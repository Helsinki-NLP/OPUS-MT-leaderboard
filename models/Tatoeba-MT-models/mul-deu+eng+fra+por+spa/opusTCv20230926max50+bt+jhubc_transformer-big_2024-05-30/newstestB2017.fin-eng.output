A 28-year-old cook found dead at a shopping mall in San Francisco
A 28-year-old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead on the staircase of a local shopping mall this week.
The victim's brother says he didn't know anyone who wanted to hurt his brother. "He had finally got his thing settled."
The body found in the Westfield shopping mall on Wednesday morning was identified as a 28-year-old Frank Galicia, according to a San Francisco forensic agency.
According to the San Francisco Police Department, the death is being investigated as a murder.
The victim’s brother, Louis Galicia, told ABC’s KGO radio station in San Francisco that Frank, who previously worked as a chef in Boston, had found his dream job as the chef of the San Francisco Sons & Daughters restaurant six months ago.
A spokesman for Sons & Daughters said that death was a shock to all of them.
"We are a small and close team, like a family. We miss the big one," the representative said.
"Our thoughts are with Frank's family and his friends."
Louis Galicia tells Frank that he first lived in hostels, but he had finally got his case settled.
“He found an apartment, and he had a girlfriend,” Louis Galicia told KGO.
Louis Galicia says he didn't know anyone who wanted to hurt his little brother.
“He was kind and generous.
His way of being with the family was to feed all of us,” says Louis Galicia.
“He never wanted to have a fight with anyone.
He was a brother who walked with the power.
Despite all the wrongs in the world, he was the perfect diamond that glowed every day,” he said.
Anybody who knows anything about the case is asked to call the San Francisco Police Department at 415-575-4444.
Strike Junior Doctors Call for New Work Fighting Actions
Representatives of British junior doctors (mostly the equivalent of specialist doctors in Finland) have appealed to their trade unions and requested permission for new labour struggles in the dispute over a new employment agreement.
The Junior Medical Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) is seeking support from its entire government for further labour struggles from the beginning of September.
According to JDC, the ministers have not solved the problems of the agreement.
Junior doctors and medical students rejected the agreement with BMA in a July vote.
58% of the voters voted against the agreement.
On Thursday evening, the chairman of the Junior Medical Committee, Ellen McCourt, tweeted a letter he sent to JDC members, saying the government was "self-concerned" about the issues that McCourt said led to the deal being contested.
The letter read: "In light of this, the JDC government has rejected a whole new draft agreement in its vote and calls for new formal negotiations on all our concerns.
In response to the government’s silence, the JDC government has today filed an official request to the BMA government, asking for permission for progressive, slightly progressive labour struggles from the beginning of September.”
For this reason, junior doctors have already been in the nursing home six times this year, which included the first complete workouts ever seen in the history of the UK’s public health system.
BMA’s director of junior doctors, Johann Malawana, resigned after the vote because he did not approve the negotiated contract terms recommended by BMA.
Malawana told BMA members at meetings prior to the vote that the agreement was good and should be approved, with 54,000 junior doctors and medical students participating in the vote.
After the vote, health minister Jeremy Hunt said the agreement would enter into force and apply to English doctors.
Russia and Turkey: an alliance of outsiders?
It was the one who decided the crisis.
Russian and Turkish leaders met on Tuesday to negotiate a deal and to formally conclude an eight-month-long war of words and economic sanctions.
However, when Vladimir Putin took over his Turkish counterpart in the Golden Hall of his palace in St. Petersburg, I had a clear impression that Ankara was more willing to make a deal.
The parties have given up,
But Putin’s smile seemed slim and he didn’t even feel the heat on his own stick.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly spoke of his "good friend" Mr. Putin – according to a report five times.
I didn't stay on the bills myself.
In addition, he promised that relations with Russia would return even better than before the crisis.
The next day, a newspaper in our country wrote that Erdogan behaved as if nothing bad had ever happened.
I realized his enthusiasm on the contrary.
But Putin’s continued coldness has shown that the Russian leader has not forgotten anything.
In fact, the first thing Putin mentioned in his opening speech was the cause of the crisis: Turkey shot down a Russian fighter aircraft at the border with Syria.
Moscow’s reaction to the incident was outrageous.
Putin attacked, in his own words, Ankara and blamed it for his backslipping.
The insult was even greater because it came from an alleged friend.
Re-establishing true trust will be difficult, perhaps even impossible.
The public opinion of the Russian people has also changed since November.
For months, state-controlled media has been campaigning in a thorough and aggressive manner against Ankara.
Suddenly, however, it seemed that the Turks were the cause of everything.
The most serious were the allegations by senior officials that Erdogan’s own family had benefited from the illegal oil trade in ISIS-controlled areas in Syria.
Erdogan has denied the allegations.
However, the official message received from St. Petersburg was that it was time to move forward.
After all, this meeting was only organized to get Putin to ask for an apology from President Erdogan.
This is how Russia can win some kind of victory.
The benefits of declaring an amnesty for Ankara are clear.
First and foremost, Erdogan needs all his potential friends after he was almost expelled from power in a failed coup d'état last month.
The repeated terrorist attacks in Turkey have clearly curated him as well.
There is also an economic impact on the agreement.
Russia’s sanctions have hit Turkey heavily, especially the charter flight ban, as it is common for millions of Russian tourists to travel to the Turkish coast every year.
The amount has fallen by almost 90 percent.
As far as Russia is concerned, tour operators and charter companies will certainly be shocked by the relief when air traffic can finally be continued.
They put their faith in the end of the war in the Mediterranean.
And even this week, state television has predicted a fall in the price of fruits and vegetables, as imports of Turkish agricultural products are again allowed.
"You visited there, the tomatoes back here," the newspaper Vedemost's article said.
But the visit also had greater political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the West because it believes the West is reacting to the coup attempt.
Without forgetting the old cravings of Turkey's progressive EU membership negotiations and Putin's involvement in matters, Putin, who is eager to take advantage of the cool moments and break Turkey's ties to the west.
The Russian leader undoubtedly won bonus points from Ankara when it expressed its support to the elected authorities after the coup attempt.
This was obvious to Moscow, which has its own deep concern about the transfer of power.
Thus, Russia and Turkey were able to deliver at their summit in a beautiful seaside palace a picture that one analyst described as an "external alliance": two countries, which are experiencing being rejected and treated by the West, are joining forces.
Despite the public conciliation act, the two still have large differences.
The most significant is Syria, where Moscow has created a picture of itself as a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support the opposite sides.
It says a lot that after almost three hours of initial negotiations, both presidents told in a press conference that they had not discussed the issue at all.
The President of Turkey deliberately refused to answer the question of the disagreements between the countries, while Putin in turn stressed them.
There is no clear consensus between the countries on where they could seek to reach a consensus in Syria.
Given the possibility of a complete disaster caused by Turkey, a NATO member, when she shot down a Russian fighter jet, it is undoubtedly better that, after months of open hostility, these two heads of state are again even in the middle of the talks.
Royal Bank of Scotland's banks disappear from customers outside Scotland
According to the CEO of RBS, the bank’s activities outside Scotland will be reduced by providing only business services, i.e. back office services.
The Royal Bank of Scotland has lost its customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was originally linked to the bank’s global goals.
The bank had to retreat from its targets when it almost collapsed eight years ago and had to be saved.
At that time, brand strategists used RBS to protect other consumer finance brands.
It sponsored millions of pounds of international sports, such as Six Nations rugby and Wimbledon champion Andy Murray.
But now the front sector has been deemed right to release more national brands.
Royal Bank of Scotland will remain available to Scottish customers, but it does not use the abbreviation RBS.
In England and Wales, all RBS names are converted to NatWest, except for the head office and stock exchange.
The Ulster Bank brand is already in use in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
In addition, there are other smaller private banking brands that will gain greater weight, such as Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed during a presentation aimed at customers and staff in Invernessshire.
He told the BBC Scotland: “RBS is turning into an investment brand and that’s why our staff is serving as we are now becoming much more banks of different brands.
As the bank itself became a global brand, RBS also became a global brand.
Now our aspirations are no longer global, but local.
Each of these brands represents something very different within their own community, and our staff is working with customers under these brands."
RBS has already announced that it will stop sponsoring Six Nations rugby, and it has raised the profile of different brands in sports sponsorship.
“Now is the right time to move to a bank with different brands, because basically it’s a question of how we can make the bank better for our customers,” says the bank’s CEO.
“Three years ago, it would have been very honourable if we had said that we would be an excellent bank for our customers and introduced brands.
But the work we do and the focus on the needs of our customers instead of our own needs have changed a lot.
We can bring those brands back, so I think the time is right.”
Frankie Dettor rides Predilection to win Newmarket and reaches his 3,000th win
Dettor sprays champagne after winning twice in a row at Newmarket, which was his 3,000th win.
Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th victory in the British Championships at Newmarket on Friday.
This is what he achieved by riding his horse Predilection twice on the same night on the trail of his own town. Predilection is a horse trained by John Gosden.
The Italian Dettori, 45, is the sixth jockey to achieve this in racing on a straight track.
He was previously joined by Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
Three-time championship jockey Dettori, who previously won at Ghayari, says: "This is special.
My feelings are on the surface because my family is here too.
I am very happy that this happened at Newmarket, because I just ended up here 30 years ago.
The event is not a big, no Royal Ascot, but a completely normal Friday night and a 20,000-person audience.
I am relieved and I feel great humility.”
Dettori accepts hurricanes with Predilection after winning
Two jockeys have reached their milestone in blockbuster competitions, including champion jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who has won his record-breaking career more than 4,300 times.
Lester Piggott, nine-time Derby winner, 4,493 wins
“Frankie is one of the best jockeys of his time, and it’s no surprise that he was the one who reached this milestone, which few have reached.
She’s stylish and strong, but her tactical ferocity is what sets her apart from the rest.
He is a fantastic representative of the race, his enthusiasm and passion has been bringing backers to the species for years.”
“I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom that he would have already won 6,000 races if he hadn’t competed only on weekends and in big races!
Seriously, Frankie’s riding in the UK has been a win-win for almost 30 years, which has been great to watch.
He’s a lively person, which is good for British racing, but above all he’s an incredible jockey.”
Frankie Dettore, in a symbolic way, jumped flying down the back of his horse.
"Frankie Dettori has been a model for the British race for two decades, from flying paint to flying downwards.
The trip has been up and down.
He has won numerous major competitions, including his famous victory at Ascot in 1996 "Magnificent Seven", but in addition, he has survived a flight accident and has been banned from competition due to drug abuse.
When the ban of competition ended three years ago, he had difficulty getting started, but he showed an admirable strength of character, showed his doubters and returned to his best.
And he hasn’t been quitting his career for a while — Dettori has recently said he wants to keep competing until at least the age of 50.”
Putin Appointed Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has abruptly fired his chief executive Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been part of Putin’s trusteeship for several years.
Ivanov, 63, was now appointed Special Representative for the Environment and Transport.
According to the Kremlin, President Putin "decided to release Ivanovic from his position as head of the Russian presidential administration", but the reasons for his resignation were not disclosed.
Ivanovi was appointed Deputy Chief Executive Officer since 2012, acting as Anton Vaino.
The 44-year-old is a former diplomat.
Born in Tallinn in 1972, Vaino graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and has previously worked at the Embassy of Tokyo.
He later led the president’s protocol department and the government’s office, according to the Kremlin’s Russian-language website.
Vaino thanked Putin for his appointment in the following words: “I am grateful for your trust.
In my view, the most important task of the administration is to support your role as Head of State, which means drafting and monitoring the implementation of your guidelines."
Putin told Russian television on Friday that Ivanov himself had asked for a divorce and recommended Vanoa as his successor.
Are your smiles real?
This move has caused confusion in Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been a close friend of Vladimir Putin, and like Putin, he also has a KGB past.
As chief of staff, he was one of the most influential men in the country.
In a meeting on Russian state television with President Putin, both said Ivanovic would step down at his own request.
Despite the smiles shown to the cameras, the explanations are convincing only a few, especially during parliamentary elections.
Is the dismissal a result of some kind of power struggle?
No one knows that yet.
Russia has been very suspicious of the official claim that a man named as a possible president suddenly wants to lead Russia’s environmental policy.
The Kremlin’s website presents Ivanov’s words to Putin, saying: “It is true that at the beginning of 2012 I asked you to give up my responsibility for this very complex and somewhat difficult task for four years.
I have now served as the president’s chief executive for four years and eight months.”
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
Prior to that, he served as Deputy Prime Minister and Defence Minister.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, a former member of the KGB.
When Putin served as the head of the FSB in the late 1990s, Ivanov was appointed as his deputy head.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov one of the five people he trusted most.
At one time, it was thought that Ivanovi could become President of Russia after the second term of Putin, as the constitution would have prevented Putin from electing for the third term.
However, the task went to another closest to Putin, Dmitri Medvedev.
Putin became prime minister, after which he returned to the presidency only three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds – FBI investigators star Thomas Gibson gets fired after hitting producer
Gibson was involved in a violent clash on the scene in Los Angeles last month.
The production companies ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios reported in a joint statement that they were fired.
Special Agent Aaron Hotchner in the series, Gibson had filed an apology on Thursday before his dismissal was announced.
“We had creative disagreements.
I’m sorry that this happened,” he said in a statement.
Information on how Gibson's character is being written out of the next series of FBI agents will be released later, according to ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
Previously in the comedy series Dharma & Greg, 54-year-old Gibson has been in the series since its first production season, 2005.
“I love Criminal Minds and I’ve put my heart and soul into it for the last 12 years,” Gibson said in a statement.
"I hoped to see the series through, but it's no longer possible.
I want to thank all the writers, producers, actors, our great production team and most importantly, the best fans the series could ever have hoped for."
The 12th season of the series will begin on September 28th in the United States.
Mysterious beaching of calves in the Banff Garden
Kevin Bain, who lives in Banff, has asked for help identifying the fish that appeared in his garden.
Bain suspects that these 75 fish are wind turbines that have fallen to the ground in the form of a roundworm.
Bain, who lives 500 meters from the sea coast, published an imagery on the Periscope and hoped to receive a response to the appearance of these five-centimeter fish.
Queensferry crossings are now connected to Fifeen
The <0xC2><0xA3>1.35 billion project is now expected to be completed by May 2017.
Engineers have connected the Queensferry crossing point to the north coast and the landing point, which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife.
It is the first of the four sections between the "citizens" who are now almost finished around the three pillars of the bridge.
The Fifest bridge is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It contains 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 wine-growing swamps.
The <0xC2><0xA3>1.35 billion project is now expected to be completed by May 2017.
Treasury Secretary Keith Brown visited the country today and was one of the first to walk from the country to the bridge.
Brown said: “This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry crossing.
We are all witnessing a truly significant progress in the construction of the bridge, with more than 30,000 concrete and steel being used for the construction of this bridge.
Despite its massive size and weight, the construction of the bridge between the ground and the bridge is a subtle operation that requires extremely precise installation tolerances.
The entire bridge is now close to 79 percent, and the rest of the cover is getting its concrete cannons in Rosyth today, which means the can is ready to lift to its place."
Michael Martin, Project Manager for Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, says: “Completing the first bridge component is always a significant milestone in all bridge projects.
In this fantastic project, this share represents the top of the road and water construction industry.
When the last part of the dam had been installed and connected to the North Tower pillar to the dam, then we had to close the remaining northern (i.e. ground) dam.
This was done by pulling bridges from the north to the south 700 millimeters.
This was a massive and at the same time high-precision operation.
Massive, since the land is 222 meters long and weighs about 6,000 tonnes and was to be pulled up at an angle of inclination of about 3%.
And requiring high precision, because the tolerances that the team had to follow were very small – just a few millimeters.
Luckily everything went well.”
The Moelfre Bay Rescue Service Tells About the Miracle of Three Men
The three men on the Anglesey side of their fishing boats were saved like a miracle shop.
The Moelfre RNLI Marine Rescue Station issued an alarm on Friday at 13:20 local time after its crew discovered the accident in the Bay of Moelfre Bay.
Three men tried desperately to swim safely while their boat continued to make their way without a guide.
“We saw the boat running around right next to them and we imagined the worst,” said Vince Jones, who was driving the Moelfre rescue boat.
"By the time we got into the water, fortunately the strong winds had carried the boat away from them."
A local fishing boat rescued two of the men, while a third, aged 60, was found exhausted by a packet and without a lifeboat.
All of them were taken to the coastal rescue ship and transported to the rescue station.
Vince Jones said: “It’s a wonder that these three men who have fallen into the water are still alive and perfectly fit.
There was an emergency extinguisher on the boat's engine, but it was for some reason separated from the man driving the boat when it crashed.
They were really lucky on their journey.”
Pokémon Go Jag brings health and happiness
It’s fascinating to see how the world changes.
Over the past decade, many have complained about why teenagers and children no longer go out to play, but rather stay inside to watch their boxes.
Pokémon Go makes people get up from the couch and move on.
Initially, it only took time to watch TV, then video games and the latest smartphones.
It is therefore great to note that technology and outdoor exercise do not exclude each other.
This, of course, refers to the Pokémon Go franchise. Pokémon Go is a game app that features characters from video games created in the 1990s (which were later also made with cartoons, card games and other accessories).
Like many popular cultural phenomena, this also ended a little before the new game was released in early July in the United States, Australia and New Zealand.
Lancement in other countries was delayed due to huge interest, which overloaded the servers.
In just a few days, the number of users of Pokémon Go surpassed Tinder and was almost as large as Twitter.
So how does the game work?
In short, players go out to search for pokémon with their smartphones, which are tracked using GPS. When a pokémon is found, it can be "photographed" (with the phone screenshot) or "caught".
Wildness has brought the video game with it the younger generation who played and raised the backs of the couch.
In the United States, the game has significantly increased the number of steps that the "average person" takes per day.
The Washington Post recently reported on the Apple Watch’s Cardiogram app, which found within two days of the game’s launch that the number of people moving 30 minutes a day suddenly rose from 45 percent to 53 percent. Cardiogram tracks 35,000 users.
The company does not know which users are playing Pokémon Go, it only sees the raw data of the amounts of exercise.
Many public health campaigns, where people are encouraged to get up from the couch and move for at least 30 minutes a day, have been avoided for deaf ears because the campaigns have been boring and their advertisers have looked unhappy.
However, the importance of the movement should not be underestimated.
Regularly moving people are less likely to get cancer or depression.
Exercise helps in weight management, lowers blood pressure, prevents diabetes and brings a large number of other benefits.
The great thing about Pokémon Go is that it gets people out to do something they enjoy.
In this way, it achieves three health-sustaining basics – exercise, cool air, and the sun and joy.
During the journey, it is possible to make new friends.
As usual, this phenomenon also involves the mourners of joy.
And yes, when you play, you can walk towards the door.
What's the matter?
A breakthrough has been made.
Because while smartphone apps like Fitbit may have been able to track your activity in the past, they didn’t give you any reason to go, as Pokémon Go does.
The excitement of novelty disappears, and use decreases over time.
However, thanks to the success of Pokémon, there will be more games where apps and virtual reality are combined with real-world activity, which will increase the exercise of people who leave the hunt and improve their fitness and health.

Simone Biles caught gold in women's boxing multiplayer
Forget the pressure.
Forget the jump.
Simone Biles is immune to all of these.
Dynamic jumps.
With no worries.
The leaves are permanent.
Great in everything.
And now, finally, the Olympic winner.
A 19-year-old American boxer won a multi-competition championship on Thursday and increased the difference between himself and the world in the Olympic lighthouse.
His total score of 62.198 was clearly better than that of the silver-based "Final Five" teammates Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafin.
Simone Biles will be present at the final of the women’s boxing final at the Rio 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Biles became the fourth consecutive and the fifth American woman of all time to win the multi-competition championship, strengthening her reputation as the best of her generation or even the best of all time.
Biles burst into tears when his final total point came to light and his long journey to this moment ended.
Achievement takes the species to completely new dimensions and raises it to the same category as other sports superstars such as Michael Phelps:
Biles has been the most powerful in his kind for the last three years. He has won 15 World Championship medals, of which 10 gold, and earned them with so ambitious and precise programs that the 1984 Olympic winner Mary Lou Retton said she was the winner of the Olympics.
In Brazil, there was one more final competition, which was held primarily between Biles and him and the burden borne by his own and excessive expectations, not so much between Biles and the rest of the world.
Returning home to Texas Spring with less than a handful of gold medals would be a disappointment.
Simone Biles (left) and Aly Raisman win gold and silver at the final of the women’s singles contest at the Rio 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on Thursday. 11.8.2016
Biles won the first gold medal on Tuesday as a point on top of the i team with his coordinates and now retired Martha Karoliy's classmates.
Although Biles claimed that he had never thought of anything in advance while at the top for a long time, it is not entirely true.
Part of his permanto program – which includes a series of volts known as his power card – has been adapted to Latin music, which could well be heard on the streets outside the Rio Olympic Arena.
It's not a coincidence.
When his grandparents were young enough to adopt him and coach Aimee Boorman’s mother had become a power figure, Boorman found a girl while he was on a babysitter visit to the gym where Boorman trained.
He hasn’t lost a single race since the summer of 2013, and the win will likely continue as long as Biles wants it to continue.
Despite the fact that Mustafina managed a small lead in two rounds, it was like a weave.
The rest were a tree and a permantle, where Biles is the defending world champion.
He returned to the leadership position after he scored 15,433 points and crowned the final result with 15,933 points.
Raisman gently hugged him while awaiting their final points – which was merely formality – and tears began to appear around Biles’ red, white, and blue flickering border color, as he once dreamed of writing his playbook.
Raisman's performance was a small revenge for the four-year-old race, when he first divided third place but then lost bronze to the Mustafinal in a renewal round.
This time, the 22-year-old team leader, which the Americans call the team's "mummy" was clearly Schwarzenegger ahead.
He sent flying balloons to the public after his perpetual program and thus rose from the losing position to the winner, which sometimes seemed uncertain.
As far as Biles is concerned, this 19-year-old’s past week and the widespread tweet now has a whole new meaning:
Police say three musicians were killed in the car by a serial killer
Two women and a 12-year-old girl were killed in Phoenix's most devastating mass murder for ten years, the victims sat in a car chatting and listening to music when they were shot, police reported Thursday.
According to authorities, the car parked in the street on June 12 was shot by Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter Maleah.
The shooter was standing on the passenger side of the car, from where he shot eight shots with a handgun and then fled in another car, the statement said.
Police suspect that the triple-homicide was not caused by the robbery, as the attacker did not take the handbags or the <0x24>2,900 found in the other adult victim's possession.
The Phoenix police spokesman, Sergeant Jonathan Howard, said the police are now investigating whether the deaths are related to four attacks in the past.
A total of seven people have been killed and two wounded in nine attacks, which have occurred mainly in Latin American-occupied areas within four months.
"It's common for the events to happen in residential areas in front of homes," Howard told KPHO earlier this month, a television and radio subsidiary of CBS.
The suspect is believed to have several vehicles, including a brown Nissan in the late 1990s, a black BMW in the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Researchers do not want to reveal what led them to conclude that the attacks are related to each other and that their cause is the same.
Ellis, 33, was taken to the hospital for his injuries, where he later died.
Liner, 31, and Ellis daughter Maleah died immediately at the scene.
The eyewitness told police that the three of them were often sitting in the car listening to music.
In addition, the police issued a statement informing the police of the shooting in an empty packed van just half an hour before the three-shot, which is believed to be the same in both cases.
Scientists found the shells and picked up the scissors from the car seat to pick up the scissors of the scissors and the scissors from the engine room.
Mother of 6-year-old boy with microcephaly: "Things are getting better"
Like most 6-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto likes singing, toys and of course his mother.
But unlike most other peers, Edmund has microcephaly, or congenital minority, due to her mother Elizabeth Picciuto’s genetic disorder that she was unaware of when she was pregnant.
“When I brought Edmund home for the first time, my first thought was that I couldn’t handle this.
I can't handle this.
I didn't commit to this.
Which is not at all true – of course you are committed to it,” he says.
Elizabeth and her husband, Vincent, were told that Edmund might never recognize them or survive at all.
Some doctors went so far as to suggest placing the child in institutional care.
“My first reaction was that I didn’t think there was any such practice anymore,” Picciuto says.
Edmund walks with a roller.
Edmund got up and started counting until he was 3 years old, and he still doesn’t talk.
But he is slowly moving at his own pace.
He walks assisted and rides a bicycle.
She enjoys playing with her two brothers and loves singing.
Elizabeth introduces Edmund's invention of a pointless, meaning "sing me".
"We'll teach him the language of reference," Picciuto told CBS News.
However, it does not only mean a common reference language, but it also includes the references invented by Edmund himself.
The background of microcephaly can be a number of different diseases: hereditary, such as the case of Edmund, or pregnancies with viral infections, such as ash or zika virus.
Symptoms and predictions vary greatly.
It is still too early to assess how it affects the lives of people with Zika virus.
Picciuto reminds us of an uncertain future.
"I keep saying, how are we going,
how we are doing."
And he still doesn't know.
“I haven’t asked for a prediction for a while, because I don’t think anyone can give it.”
But Picciuto has to give hopeful advice to mothers whose children have birth defects caused by the zika virus.
“Things are getting better.
Things are usually arranged in order.
You love your child, and your child loves you.”
Heavy rains and floods have resulted in massive rescue operations in Louisiana and Mississippi
Louisiana's governor said on Friday that the state will receive more rain on Saturday due to heavy rains and widespread flooding.
According to the National Weather Service, several rivers in South-East Louisiana and South Mississippi will flood over their slopes and spread across the area as a result of heavy rains.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards says the state authorities are in constant contact with local authorities and help is already on the way to flooding areas.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the Office of the Governor for National Security and Emergency Preparedness, said the agency will receive requests for flood vehicles, boats and sandbags.
According to Steel, only Tangipahoa County has asked for tens of thousands of sandbags.
The flood warning will remain in effect until Saturday in most parts of South Louisiana.
According to the Meteorological Service, there may be an additional 76 to 127 mm of water in the area.
A flood warning was issued in South Alabama on Friday as rains continued in the Mobile area.
Over the weekend, the Comite River near Baton Rouge and the Amite River near Denham Springs, both of which in Louisiana, are predicted to rise to record highs.
According to weather forecaster Alek Krautmann, many houses on the banks of the rivers could be flooded in suburbs of Baton Rouge.
In addition, he says, floods in the Ascension District are a threat, as the flooded rivers slowly evaporate into Lake Maurepas.
The Tickfaw River, which flows south of the Mississippi state border in Liverpool, Louisiana, had already risen higher than ever on Friday at 9 a.m.
Rescue work continued in the Amite and Wilkinson districts of Southwest Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and sons were among the survivors of Glossary on Friday.
Hansford, 62, says the Beaver Creek River, which is normally more than 120 meters away from her house, rose rapidly overnight.
The other side of the house had warned him.
"We got up, and the water came with a continuous feed," Hansford says.
"It reached my waistband."
Her wife had told Hansford that she had never seen the river rise so high in the 48 years she has lived in the area.
Hansford says that he and his family members have all the injuries, and he himself is the only swimmer of them.
Rescue workers had rescued all three large military-style trucks and taken them to the fire station in Glossary, where they held protection on Friday.
Weather forecaster Krautmann says the floods are spreading rapidly as heavy rains continue, and authorities are already considering evacuation orders.
According to reports from a nearby observatory in Livingston, it had rained almost 350 mm between midnight and Friday morning.
Krautmann said the soil was heavily watered after the rains that began on Wednesday.
Authorities say that due to heavy rains and flooding on the streets, residents of Tangipahoa district had to be rescued from their homes and school hours had to be cancelled in five school districts.
A member of the Tangipahoa City Council had told CBS television and radio subsidiary WWL that there were 200 homes under the flood.
Residents had been evacuated to two churches, but now the flood has overtaken them both.
Robby Miller, the head of the district, said the authorities had rescued 72 people and seven pets that had survived the flood.
The evacuees have opened shelters in the cities of Amiten and Hammond.
"They can go back to their homes when the water starts to withdraw," he says.
In the city of Hammond in Tangipahoa district, nearly twenty streets were closed due to flooding, and residents were offered sandbags to try to prevent water from entering their homes and business premises.
"The last time we had a big flood in March," said Lacy Landrum, a member of the city council.
"This flood appears to be the same."
In Mississippi, the rains continued smoothly off the Gulf of Mexico, says Harrison County Rescue Director Rupert Lacy.
Lacy said Thursday that there were reports of a severe flood in the house, but nothing had been reported so far on Friday.
Keith Townson, head of Shopper Value Foods, says he has lived in the Amite area for 40 years.
“I’ve seen water in places I’ve never seen before, and it’s raining all the time.”
6-year-old Mahaj Brown, who has received several shots in his body, survives a Philadelphia shooting attack
Police say a six-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, another six-year-old who was shot in the city this week.
The child's grandparents told CBS Philadelphia that the son was Mahaj Brown.
According to the grandparents, the son had several gunshot wounds in the thighs, leg, arm and abdomen, but he was conscious when he was taken to the hospital.
"He got a lot of hits, his little body was full of nuts," his grandmother, Delores Melendez, told television.
"I can't believe this is true."
The boy is in a critical condition in the hospital, and he has undergone several surgeries.
The family tells the television company that the boy is believed to survive.
He was starting the first class with a local sub-level.
Brown was one of four people shot in the Germantown district.
Two 29-year-old men and a 32-year-old man were also shot.
The other 29-year-old was reported to be critical and the other two were stable, according to CBS Philadelphia.
According to the television company, the child was found in the front seat of the car next to a 29-year-old in critical condition.
Two other victims were not in the car, and police are now investigating whether one of the injured men could be a shooter.
Police investigators told CBS Philadelphia that it was a crossroads between several armed men.
The venue was full of scrambled-type shells, which originated from various scrambled shells.
“It’s clear that this was an ongoing battle.
There were shelves on both sides of the pedestrian corridor on the street.
There have been several armed fighters on the scene, and they have been actively involved in the shooting,” Philadelphia Police Chief Commissioner Anthony Ginaldi told the television station.
The ruins also affected many homes and vehicles in the area.
No arrests have been made, and police are reportedly watching surveillance videos.
Another victim of the shooting in the city this week was a 6-year-old girl who was hit by a harassment while playing in front of her home in the West Oak Lane district on Tuesday.
She's recovering, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
This is the name I call the women's Olympic team, and there are more than one reasons.
First of all, I have been at every Summer Olympics since 1984, and the United States has never been as powerful as it is now.
Secondly, the three gymnasts of this team, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, have inspired many colorful girls.
The composition of the team, complemented by Jewish Aly Raisman and Catholic Madison Kocian, makes everything proud.
The team is finally representing America.
It has also strengthened the visibility of black and Latino women at the top of the species.
For the past four years, the best female rapper has been an African-American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were ranked 1 and 2.
This is great.
In the previous Olympics, Gabby Douglas became a surprise winner of the races, and all of America hugged.
Now the world has been able to witness the incredible performances of three-time world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez and the surprising and masterful training programs.
On Thursday, Simon became the fourth consecutive American to win gold in the women’s individual competition.
Teammate Aly Raisman won the silver.
The views are such at the top of the species, but the same does not appear to be the case in the country-wide battlefields.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie followed the same footsteps as Aly and Madison to form the Olympic team.
They are the last five (“Final Five”), as the next Olympic team will have only four gymnasts, and this is Marta Karoly’s last year as coach.
However, the reality is that training is an expensive sport and gymnasts practice mainly in private training centres maintained by their parents. The parents are paid for the cost of training, accommodations, trips, performances, family allowances, competition fees.
The premises of most deployment facilities are located in wealthy residential areas that are able to support the operation.
The training of master trainers takes place in these associations, and this means an expensive and long-term commitment to the families of the trainers.
Simone Biles' coach Aimee Boorman and Laurie Hernandez's coach Maggie Haney have both trained the breed's fans ever since they started the race.
We need to arrange a cheaper and more accessible training for the countless young girls whose enthusiasm Simone, Gabby and Laurie have sparked.
I founded my own scouting foundation 20 years ago.
Our Harlem-based organisation has offered a free or affordable opportunity to recruit more than 15,000 urban youth (mainly black and Latin American) and some of them have competed in national and international championships.
In September, we are expanding our operations to my hometown of Detroit to provide high-quality training for young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympics.
Strength training develops strength, agility and body coordination and teaches hard work, discipline and determination.
This combination brings lifelong sustainable benefits and supports good health and success in school and work life.
This team has aroused enthusiasm for thousands of young girls who now want to start a training session, and it’s really great.
Participation in some sports is very important, especially for girls.
This is an exciting time.
Thanks to Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for the real "girl power" you showed when you won the Olympic gold, and for motivating so many different young girls from their backgrounds to start their way into prosperous, strong and successful young women.
Junior doctors reject Jeremy Hunt's proposal and prepare for new strikes
The ministers hoped to decide on the dispute on changes in salary and working conditions by adopting a reformed agreement with the British Medical Association (BMA), but of the 37,000 junior doctors who voted, i.e. a specialised doctor58 per cent.
Health Minister Hunt said in July that plans to get the deal forcibly pre-empted and said the UK’s public health system (NHS) is “nobody’s land” and that all additional delays are harmful to staff and patients.
The first junior doctors are moving to a new agreement that includes changes to night and weekend work practices in order to improve health care at unsocial times.
Mrs Ellen McCourt, chairman of the BMA Junior Doctors Committee, delivered an opinion yesterday in which she said: "Junior doctors are still very concerned about the proposed agreement. The particular fear is that it will accelerate the current labour crisis, and that it will not cause all labour crises.
There are only eight weeks until the first doctors are transferred to the new agreement, so now we have to move on, because time is running out.
The BMA has sought to resolve the dispute by speaking, but the government has treated the discussions unintentionally and occasionally without even reacting in any way.
In spite of the fact that Jeremy Hunt made a promise last month that his door would always be open.
Jeremy Hunt must act now, cancel the implementation of the contract, and respond to the concerns of junior doctors.
If this is not the case, junior doctors will be ready for new occupational measures.”
The previous strike at the end of April delayed nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 reception times when nurses and consulting doctors were asked to support strike doctors in the strike guard.
The ministers hoped that the dispute on the amendments would be resolved by concluding a renewed agreement with the representatives of the British trade union of doctors.
The trade union BMA wants a better weekend salary for the 54,000 junior doctors affected by the deal.
NHS Chief Executive Daniel Mortimer appealed to junior doctors not to start new strikes.
Mortimer says: “Working with the teams is very little or nothing, but they are putting pressure on already-extreme teams and services and causing care, distress and disruption to patients, caregivers and their families.
We have been negotiating with the Junior Doctors Committee for the past two months, and together with the Ministry of Health and other bodies, we have welcomed their concern about the role of supervisor and the disclosure of defects.
Employees were looking forward to a continuous positive commitment to other important topics, such as development, flexibility of education, return to further training, education costs, the mutual recognition of the curriculum, health and well-being, well-being, well-being and well-being, well-being, well-being and well-being, well-being and well-being.
A medicine that costs <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.40 a day can reduce the risk of a heart attack
Thousands of patients with a heart attack are getting around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.40 a day when the authorities recommended it to be given to more people and for longer use.
Ticagrelor reduces the risk of new heart attacks in patients with heart disease.
The medicine is already given 12 months after a heart attack, which reduces the risk of a stroke or a new heart attack.
The NICE (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence) which is part of the UK Public Health System (NHS) and assesses the introduction of new treatments has instructed patients to give ticagrelor for four years in order to increase the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now the NICE (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence) which is part of the UK’s Public Health System (NHS) and assesses the introduction of new treatment methods has instructed patients to take ticagrelor for an additional four years to take heart and blood vessels at risk.
In England, about 140,000 people have a heart attack each year, with a quarter of them having a heart attack or a stroke.
The cause of heart attacks and strokes is the accumulation of fat in the walls of the blood vessels, which produces plaques.
If the plaque breaks, it can produce a blood clot, which prevents blood from entering the heart and causes a heart attack.
And if the blood clot releases, it can travel with the bloodstream and prevent blood flow to the brain, resulting in a stroke.
The risk of a new episode is higher in people who have had a heart attack.
British-made AstraZeneca ticagrelor, which is sold as Brilique, reduces this risk by reducing the likelihood of tuberculosis.
In today’s NICE guideline, it is recommended that ticagrelor be given for the next 90 mg for 12 months, after which the dose is reduced to 60 milligrams and aspirin given twice a day for another three years.
Professor Carole Longson of the Center for the Assessment of Treatments (NICE) says: “While there are effective treatments available to effectively prevent disease progression and symptoms, even a quarter of those who have a heart attack get a new seizure or stroke.
Fear of renewal can have a very negative impact on a person’s quality of life.
We have been shown that ticagrelor in combination with aspirin effectively reduces the risk of new heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
The recommendation for the temporary use of ticagrelor provides more treatment options for thousands of people who benefit from it."
Since data on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor are limited, especially with regard to the risk of bleeding, if used for more than three years, the draft guidelines do not recommend the use of the treatment method for a longer period.
Voting in Muslim regions has blossomed because of political correctness in the electoral climate
Tower Hamlets' former mayor Lutfur Rahman was dismissed last year due to corruption, as a result of which the government made a statement
The climate of political correctness has led to the closure of the eyes of widespread electoral corruption in Muslim communities, a government report published today reveals.
Former government minister Sir Eric Pickles has criticized police, election observers and city officials for blocking their eyes from the polls "for their sensitivity to ethnicity and religion".
According to Pickles, a former regional government minister and current anti-corruption force, the intimidation of voters for religious reasons was so bad that the police had to have permission to form guard chains outside the polling stations in order to allow feared voters to vote.
He proposes that voters should present an identity card in order to prove their identity when they come to vote.
At the moment, the voter will only have to tell his name and address.
In addition, the report proposes that the fingers be cast into a non-going black after the vote, so that no one can vote twice.
Reporters should be protected more, Sir Eric says.
He called for improved access by journalists to the documents of the State Council and to the decisions of informal committees and working groups.
“The aim is not only to prevent electoral fraud, but also to combat corruption and economic interests and a culture that favors them in local governments more broadly,” he says.
The British Prime Minister asked for a report in East London after the Hamlet Tower vote scandal.
Last year, a special election court ruled that the then mayor, Lutfur Rahman, should be dismissed due to corruption and numerous illegal practices.
The court considered Rahma to be "irreligiously distorted" the religious beliefs of his Muslim community and to have criticised his spirit by accusing them of racism and anti-Islamism.
Rahman was said to be “using the basis of his campaign that every Muslim believer had a religious duty to vote for him.”
Up to 300 of the votes were questionable or were falsely cast so that the person voted by becoming another person.
Sir Eric said evidence of fraud was obtained from all over the country.
He expressed his particular concern about the post-war campaign, in which members of the Muslim community were told that they had pressured people to vote for the candidate they chose.
Sir Eric (pictured) made several proposals to clean up the voting system, including requiring an identity card at the polling station.
The report states: "Evidence has been obtained that some members of vulnerable ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, have been pressured to vote in accordance with the will of the parents, particularly in the communities of Pakistan and Bangladesh."
“I was concerned that ... the state institutions had closed their eyes to such activities because of the ‘politically correct’ sensitivity to ethnicity and religion.”
Sir Eric made 50 proposals to clean up the system, including banning the handling of post-voting tickets from political activists, in order to prevent "collecting votes".
The report under review by Theresa May also calls for stricter checks in the context of registration in order to prevent the use of the voting rights register for immigration and preferential fraud.
Consideration of alternatives requiring voters to present an identity card before voting.
Watering your fingers into an unleashed black after voting so that no one can vote twice.
Systemic checks to ensure the nationality and voting rights of voters.
Setting a limit of three years for requests for automatic postal voting.
Prohibition of handling by political activists of mail-filled votes and postcards.
The right of the police to form security chains around the polling stations.
Amendment of the Act to make it easier to raise intimidation charges under the 1983 Representation of the People Act on the Expansion of Voting Rights.
Prohibition of photography in voting places.
Only English allowed in polling stations (except Wales).
Enhancing training in order to ensure a rule governing staff that only one person at a time is allowed to go to the voting spectrum.
Sir Eric strongly criticizes the London police and finds it "astonishing" that no criminal charges have been filed after the Tower Hamlet case.
“The Election Court has dismissed Lutfur Rahman and his representatives from their duties because of corruption and numerous illegal practices,” he said.
"She was found guilty without undue suspicion, and the criminal prosecution threshold was exceeded on many grounds."
He also criticized the ineffective "race checks" of the departments responsible for the election lists.
“The court’s decision last year in the Tower Hamlet case was a wake-up call,” Sir Eric said.
"Our country is proud of its legacy as the mother of all parliaments, but this good reputation is threatened by a worrying and disguised election whale and its denial."
The Olympic cyclist’s chances with Duchess Catherine and other twin flights savage at the Rio Olympics
This week’s Rio 2016 Olympics fans were stunned by French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, whose likelihood with the Duchess of Cambridge is astonishing.
But according to social media discussions, this 24-year-old Olympic representative is not at all the only championship-fighting athlete to have a chance of being matched with a known person.
In honor of Rio’s competitions and all of the delusional faces in our screens, FEMAIL compiled a list of all the Olympic representatives whose chances of being equal to Hollywood audiences are obvious.
Hunter and wolf: Brady Ellison, the American men's squad, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a kid.
In addition to Duchess Catherine’s twin life, seen on bicycle rides, many people have noted on social media how one of the snipers could be the favorite actor Leonardo DiCaprio’s twin brother.
Brady Ellison, a U.S. men's sniper team, sparked a storm on Twitter after images posted about him reminiscent of the star of Wolf of Wall Street.
Ellison was aware of the rise of social media and admitted that he had heard from a child that he was reminiscent of DiCaprio.
“I don’t see the likelihood so high, except maybe shaved and shaved,” Brady Huffington told Post.
"He's a good-looking guy, so I take this as a courtesy."
At the 2012 London competitions, British long jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris were highlighted, which is undoubtedly even more prominent in these competitions.
Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina is said to be the twin flight of Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
The South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to Matthew Morrison, a Glee TV series.
This user says Nathan Adrian is an "athletic version" of the Inception film actor.
Similarly, the likelihood between tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett has long been noted, underscored by both strong eyebrows and lips.
Swimming silver artist, Russian Yulia Efimova resembles actress Annalyn McCord, and not only because of her beautifully browned skin and blonde hair, while U.S. team Nathan Adrian is according to her fans "athletic version of Joseph Gorgon Levitti".
These two iron ladies, football star Hope Solo (as.) and Dexter series actress Jennifer Carpenter (as.), resemble each other's faces and eyes.
Not only: this Twitter user was delighted when others saw the likelihood as well.
This user is wondering if there is a good reason for the pair’s likelihood.
A tweeter recently said he was happy that "others on the Internet agree on the likelihood of Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter."
The American football star and Dexter-series actor really resemble each other astonishingly in their faces and eyes.
Many have also noticed the likelihood in the smiles of Kerri Walsh-Jennings and actress Laura Linney and gold-winning gymnast Gabby Douglas and Anna!, starring Gabrielle Union in wide-ranging smiles.
CBC Olympic commentator apologizes for saying Chinese swimmer "died like a pig"
Byron MacDonald's analysis of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan's 4<0xC3><0x97>200-meter freestyle, instead of women, shocked CBC's live Olympics viewers on Wednesday.
Canadian radio station CBC has been forced to apologize after one of its commentators told a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer that he had "lost the smell" and "dead like a pig" during the race.
Storyteller Byron MacDonald thought his microphone was off when he began to unravel his own opinions at the end of the women's 4 x 200-meter free speech finale.
MacDonald, who was taken to CBC’s coloring team, was heard saying, “This little 14-year-old Chinese egg, baby.
He was too excited, left in a hurry, and died like a pig.
Thank you for that."
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, floated the second half of the message at 1:57.79, and stayed 1.61 seconds from Canadian Taylor Ruck, which allowed the Canadians to sneak into China.
Viewers across Canada reacted quickly when they were shocked by the commentator’s tone and language usage.
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted: "Did CBC reporter just say that a 14-year-old Chinese killer died like a pig????
The idiot didn't realize he was still on the show."
Ai Yanhana, a Chinese swimmer in the final of the women's 4 x 200-meter freestyle message, was described in the following words: "This little 14-year-old Chinese egg, baby.
Twitter was quickly filled with outrageous comments criticizing Byron MacDonald, and many demanded his dismissal.
The tweeters did not hold their words when they heard how disrespectful Byron Macdonald was.
Sarah Paradis tweeted: “Wau <0x23>ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada, and you make us all sound like a racist gang.
CBC host Scott Russell quickly apologized for MacDonald’s comments: “We apologize for the comments made on the swim performance.
It was a regrettable choice of words, and we are sorry that this happened."
The CBC finally had to apologize more than 90 times to people who had tweeted in response to the comment.
Colleague Scott Russel had to apologize on behalf of MacDonald.
CBC then copied and pasted her apology to comments from more than 90 other tweeters complaining about MacDonald’s speeches.
The television company also quickly filed a public apology.
“We are sincerely sorry for these statements and for the fact that they were transmitted.
In yesterday's broadcast, we quickly apologized to our viewers, and we also apologized to our social media followers.
For clarity, Byron's comments were related to the performance of the swimmer, not to him personally.
Nevertheless, they were inappropriate and the choice of words was regrettable, and Byron is very sorry for his words."
On Thursday night, MacDonald apologized in a broadcast and tried to defend his speech by saying that he did not mean it personally.
"I'd like to apologize for my comment that I made last night after the women's message," MacDonald said in a CBC Olympic broadcast.
"I refer to the performance of the swimmer, not the person.
In any case, it’s clear that I didn’t mean anything derogatory in my words, and I’m very sorry.”
A woman who agreed to trade in unobstructed underwear in Primark shocked customers
Customers didn't know where to look when the woman disguised herself in the middle of the Primark to fit the underpants.
He further aggravated the situation by assessing what he looked like in underpants, taking them off his leg and putting them back on the shelf.
He continued to spin and eventually tried four pairs of underpants at a store in Folkestone, Bouverie Place.
A Primark chain shop in Folkestone Bouverie Place where a woman tried underpants in front of everyone and put them back on the shelf
Jenny Davidson, the mother of two children at the same time at the store, says that after trying underwear, an unknown woman dressed and walked out of the store without buying anything.
He said: “People didn’t believe their eyes.
The woman stood in the middle of the shop, took her underpants from the shelf, removed her own tricots and underpants, and wore them on.
He did not try to do it unnoticed, but did it completely without shame.
Everyone was staring at him when he took his underpants off his leg and apparently didn’t like them because he put them back on the shelf.
He did it three more times before finally deciding that he didn’t like any of them, dressed and walked out.
He didn’t seem to care about the looks—and didn’t think of a person who would eventually buy the underpants he had brought.”
Davidson, 33, who lives in Kent Town, continues: “How embarrassing it is to think that someone brings home underpants that someone else has worn and has not washed.”
The incident happened on Tuesday afternoon.
“I understood that the sales staff was trying to remove those pieces of clothing from the sale once the woman had left – which is right.
It would be awful to take the new underpants home and notice that someone else has brought them in without having to wash them afterwards,” added Davidson.
Primark's spokesman said: "Primark is aware of the situation in the Folkestone movement on Tuesday, August 9.
All of these products have been removed from sale.”
How to defend yourself against armed attack with the help of Krav Maga
The world is full of dangers, but this video from Dailymail.com can help make it a little safer.
We interviewed Grand Master Rhon Mizrach of the Krav Maga League in New York City and asked for advice on how to survive a proximate robbery or malicious attacker.
The video shows you how to defend yourself against the attacker, depending on whether the attacker is approaching you from the front or back.
If the attacker approaches the rear, the first thing to do is to turn around to see the attacker and get out of the shooter line, Mizrachi says.
Then grab the object so that it stays between your hip and shoulder, and strike the attacker's face on your free hip.
Then smash the attacker on his knees, and as he goes from pain to double, smash him in the face with a gun and move back by holding the weapon towards him.
The technique is the same if an armed attacker approaches from the front. You have to move away from the shooter line, catch the object and turn it so that the attacker can't shoot.
At the same time, place your weight on the object and strike the attacker with a punch in the chest. Turn the weapon away from the attacker's grip, turn back and hold the weapon against the attacker.
Does it sound difficult?
Watch the video of how Mizrachi does it.
However, remember that the safest way to get rid of the robber is by giving away your cash – unless you are the Krav Maga Grandmaster.
Ian Wright, the world traveler who made the travel guide, flies the dirtiest places in Europe
The British world traveler put his resistance and the strongest reflexes to the test by smashing Europe’s dirtiest and most resilient places.
Suffolk director and travel guide writer Ian Wright, 51, wanted to prove the strength of his resistance by swiping euro banknotes, handcrafts at Piccadilly Circus, a train toilet wash button and a Russian general telephone.
Before he flew, Wright measured objects with a luminometer to see for himself and to show the viewers what his tongue was pushing into.
The experiment was documented by Ian Wright in the footsteps of Internal Power, and the results were surprising.
The idea of arrowing the rinse button in a train toilet can be illustrative, but in fact more bacteria are in the kitchen sink.
On his journey to different parts of Europe, Wright interviews doctors and other medical professionals about the strengthening of good gut bacteria and their own health.
Fortunately, nothing he flew caused but the mouth of the evil one.
Ian Wright was first known for his travel program, where he tested the durability of his intestines by traveling around the world and eating strange and wonderful things.
Unquestionably, the arrows of the railway station’s handles and the wash-out button challenged Wright’s resilience.
Wright says in the document: "Since I was a kid, I've been pretty careless about my health and I've put in my mouth all sorts of things, such as moths, worms, and coyotes."
In the film, he really showed his reputation as a tax collector.
The border was only found in a turbulent common toilet in Russia.
The luminometer measured more than 4,000 units of the sample.
For comparison, let’s say that the number of hands that have been washed is usually less than 60.
The border was found in a Russian general toilet where Wright refused to arrow when the luminometer measured 4,000 units – the same number in counterwashed hands is less than 60.
In the documentary Ian Wright, Wright, produced with Valio, he takes on the trail of Internal Strength, where the number of bacteria is made visible in different places, such as the bathroom.
Wright says in the documentary, "This is almost the worst smell I've ever smelled in any bathroom.
There's nothing more dirty than that!
The place is so imaginary that I really don’t arrow anything here.”
Wright produced the documentary film Ian Wright in collaboration with Valio.
Wright was given Valium Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria and vitamins C and D, to help strengthen the gut bacterial strain and resistance.
Niko Vuorenmaa, head of the category for snacks, juices and news products at Valio, says: “We wanted to offer consumers something completely new.
Something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time tells about the benefits of probiotics.
We took a lot of time to come up with something crazy, and we finally came to the idea of asking for Ia."
Healthcare has become a global trend.
“Instead of just talking about products, we wanted to bring them into a wider context and tell you about the good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the importance of intestinal health and how it relates to resistance.
The health of the digestive system has become a global trend, and the document allows us to give consumers more information about it in an interesting way.
The movie also tells us about our sense of humor.”
Tom Hakala, director of the film, added: “It is said that I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had stabbed certain items we asked for, such as the Russian toilet, which is also shown in the film.
Of course, arrowing some items was easier for Ian, while some were quite bad.
I'm glad we got some of the dirty holidays on the tape."
In a 2015 Valio survey, 84 per cent of respondents linked lactic acid bacteria specifically to the well-being of the stomach and intestines, and 58 per cent reported using at least occasionally products to which lactic acid bacteria were added.
The family destroyed a town-owned rental house in Saltash, Cornwall before their wedding
The family left behind <0xC2><0xA3>50,000 in damages to the town's rental house after they got married because of the terrorization of the neighbourhood.
Tanya Skeldon and her husband Shaun Trebilcock have been married to her apartment in Saltash, Cornwall, after several complaints against the couple.
When the couple was forcibly removed from the apartment, representatives of the rental housing company found that the apartment was in a state of shock.
The walls had firing holes, the floor panels were torn off, the garbage was spread on the floor, and the walls were crushed with graffiti.
The couple has now moved, and they are believed to live in a private apartment.
Donna McEvoy, head of Cornwall Housing, said she was afraid that the apartment could no longer be saved.
He says: “This has been a full nightmare for the people living here, no one should have to endure such a nightmare.
There is a lot to be weighed on, as the property is likely to become known not as a pleasant part of Cornwall.
The family is famous, as is its name.”
The couple had three boys who lived in the apartment from time to time, according to police, the family’s fearful power included street fights on baseball holidays, intimidation of neighbors, drug use and transmission, as well as loud screams, debates and curses.
The 47-year-old signatory Skeldon received an order in June on unsocial behavior.
In several rooms of the house under the bottle door, old waste was found.
The house had previously been sold with drugs, and the floor coverings had been torn off.
According to the neighbors, the family fought on the street and the police had to call regularly.
The Cornwall Housing Agency married the couple forcibly this week after giving them an additional 11 weeks to volunteer to leave.
Relief neighbors were grateful for the wedding—they said their lives were the earthly hell.
One of the neighbors said, "They didn't care about anyone.
We've been living next door to them for 20 years, and all that time has been hard.
The police have been here incredibly many times.”
“We couldn’t sleep this morning.
We woke up because it was so quiet, and we are not used to it!
It’s going to be great now that they’ve finally got married.”
Adam Fitzpatrick, Chief Executive Officer for Coercive Practices at the Cornwall Housing Agency, said the family was unable to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, during which time the police were called to the place regularly.
The rubbish and old toys were thrown on the wild wall of the rental house.
Fitzpatrick added: “It is a pity that the tenant did not take any responsibility for his or her family’s behavior, as the wedding is always the last measure that the Cornwall housing agency is considering.
This case was very difficult, as the behavior was extreme and their actions must have been shocking to the neighbor.
I am grateful to my working group, the Devon and Cornwall police and the members of the community who participated in the work and offered courageously to provide us with information.
I hope that this progress will improve the well-being of neighbours and give the message that unsocial behaviour is not acceptable."
Fitzpatrick says that the three sons of the family were all living in the apartment at different times, but were already in their twenties.
A dirty mat found in one bedroom of the house after the wedding
Housing workers now have to clean out the debris surrounding the house.
In 2014, police raided the apartment and found more than 70 grams of cannabis in addition to bags and other supplies, as well as <0xC2><0xA3>1,700 in cash.
Skeldon was fined after he was found guilty of holding a B-Class drug to sell it.
He claimed that the money was for the funeral of his son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
When Skeldon and her husband are homeless, they are told they have moved to a private apartment in Plymouth.
The walls of many rooms were plastered with graffiti.
Police say they are demanding a wedding for tenants who violate the rules of the lease.
Angela Crow Devon and Cornwall police say the wedding serves as a clear warning to tenants who constantly threaten the rules.
“This is a clear message for those who think they can behave as they want without charges, as well as for those who suffer from such behavior,” Crow says.
The Devon and Cornwall police will never accept criminal and unsocial behaviour and continue to cooperate with their partners to protect our communities.
Low-flying, beach hippopotamus army shower machine frightened tourists in Portugal
Sun worshippers have experienced the shock of their lives in Aveiros, Portugal.
The P-3C Orion of the Portuguese Air Force crashed at a staggering low.
According to the Air Force, it was a training flight that did not threaten security.
The picture shows a moment when tourists were forced into the evacuation period when a low-flying shower machine crashed over a full beach.
Dramatic images show how an army plane arrives almost at a distance from tourists taking the sun on the sandy beach in northern Aveiros, Portugal.
The holidaymakers rose to their feet, concerned, understandably, about the whirlwind of the engines of the shower machine, which began to sound before they could see what was coming through the clouds.
The incident happened yesterday afternoon on the Costa Nova near Aveiro.
One of the photographs and videos of the dramatic performances posted on social media was Daniel Fernandes, who says: "It crossed the beach twice really low, and there was a moment when it looked like it would fall to the ground."
Nuno Arroja adds: "I was surfing and I was sure the plane would fall on me."
Tourists on the shore of Aveiro were shocked when the plane suddenly appeared and flew at a crawling low.
The Portuguese Air Force announced today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion was on a training flight to identify coastal fishing vessels, which is why the aircraft had to fly so low.
According to the pilot, they had to fly slightly lower than normal because the smoke caused by nearby forest fires damaged visibility, but according to the air force, this did not threaten anyone’s safety.
Forest fires have destroyed parts of mainland Portugal and killed four people on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force said today that due to poor visibility caused by fog and smoke, the pilot had to fly so low.
The aircraft was on a training flight, during which the pilot was asked to identify fishing vessels.
The results of the first half of the year are better than expected.
The social and health sector (Exote) in South Karelia made a better result of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.4 million than planned in January-June.
The result of the exodus was a surplus of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>4.3 million in the first half of the year.
The result was particularly good in family and social services, where the development of preventive services has been able to dismantle institutional management.
The guarantee of care was carried out in all activities.
This year, Exote aims to shorten the measures.
The exodus covers by surplusing the previous deficiency.
The remaining amount may be used to shorten the strings and purchase measures for patients.
The full year’s result is projected to be <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>4.6 million better than planned.
The Board of Exotes will discuss the semi-annual review at its meeting next Wednesday.
70 Special Border Doctors Sworn in Military War in Immola
A total of 70 officers of the Border and Marine Guard School vowed military service on Friday.
The military demonstration of the Armed Forces and Marine Guards School was held in Immola on Friday.
The 10th Special Border Medical Course was held at the team's sports ground.
There were 70 soldiers sworn in.
Specialised Border Doctors are trained for demanding border security, intelligence and combat tasks.
They serve 347 days.
This year, 310 young people have applied for Special Border Doctor.
250 of them were selected.
Specialised border doctors have been trained in Immola since 2007.
Five veterans of the war-time border forces participated in the meeting during the election.
The average age of the participants is now 90 years.
The oldest veterans who participated in the event were born in 1918.
ESS.fi - Crime Investigation helps to investigate crimes and reveals serious crime - ESS.fi
Since the beginning of 2014, each of the 11 police stations in Finland has been operated by the RTA, a criminal investigation and analysis unit.
The operation of the unit is externally invisible.
The Hämeen police station has a total of four police officers in Lahde and Hämeenlinna.
That's what the Lieutenant-in-Chief in the Bay draws.
As Chief of Staff, the Commissioner is in Lahti.
In addition, the strength of the unit includes a civilian dedicated to information technology in Hämeenlinna.
They all work in civilization.
The unit has demonstrated its usefulness and necessity, says Deputy Police Chief Tero Seppänen.
The RTA unit produces different investigations for other police officers.
It has, among other things, obtained information about asylum seekers.
Renewal of new ways of working
The establishment of analytics units is the most recent reform of police working methods.
The aim was to prevent crime, which meant that the police were less and less likely to go to the place where the pills were called until they were alerted.
The information collected and analysed by the unit targets the day-to-day police activity where it is most needed.
As part of the reform of the police administration, a criminal intelligence centre was established, with its three national units and each police station having its own criminal intelligence unit.
The PTR centre, which operates in the context of the Vantaa Central Crime Police, operates nationally.
In PTR units, people from the Police, Customs and Border Guards are working according to their name.
The RTA units, in turn, work in areas divided by police agencies and have the task of providing information to both local police forces and national units.
The survey extends outside of your area
Where an individual policeman is aware of what has happened during his 12-hour work hours, the task of the RTA unit is to know what is going on in the entire police station area.
The investigation also extends beyond the borders of your own institution, as crime also does.
Workers in the RTA unit have a better level of R&D skills than the basic police.
The Unit seeks to draw police attention to new phenomena, productive criminal or reminiscent of crimes, through registers, alert mission databases and detections.
This is called serialization, and it is one of the most important tools for criminal investigation.
Every person has their own way of acting.
The footprint is also visible at work, whether it is honest or criminal.
Based on the method of work, a certain image of the author is formed.
Serialization can be done either on the basis of a person or a person, depending on which police officer has more information.
Criminals learn from their mistakes
RTA employees do not carry the collars in the city vertically, but their work is not entirely public.
The methods used by criminals and their own are not disclosed, as this could lead to professional criminals developing their activities, thereby aiming at preventing police criminal investigations.
The methods will be publicly reported by the police if it anticipates a threat to them.
This was the case, for example, from the beginning of the summer, with the labelling of empty apartments used in residential breaks.
In it, the perpetrators set up an outdoor water jacket, a knob, or a tape piece of the apartment with which they tried to see if the residents were really traveling.
The present investigation material shall be public to at least the parties concerned.
The analysis unit has found that the most professional criminals take lessons from their mistakes.
The most prolific are signing a District Court Protocol, which can, for example, indicate that fingerprints have been found on the site.
Next time, the thief will wear gloves in his hand.
For the case, Deputy Chief of Police Tero Seppäs was interviewed about Häme’s Police, Commissioner Tuomo Lepola of East Finland Police, Criminal Commissioner Sami Joutjärve of Joensuu Police Station and Criminal Investigator Arto Tuomela of Central Criminal Police.
The police collects and analyzes information that allows them to plan practical activities.
In the background, the reduction in the amount of labour and funding.
The first steps towards a new approach were taken 30 years ago.
The last change was the three-phase PORA reform, which ended at the end of 2013.
With national cooperation, information is collected from outside the institution and outside the borders of Finland.
A London schoolgirl who joined her father was killed in Syria
According to reports, one in three Britons who joined Father in the past year, Kadiza Sultana, has been killed in Syria.
Attorney Tasnime Akunjee tells the girl's family that Sultan died in Raqqa in Syria a few weeks ago.
He was believed to have been killed in a Russian statement on Raqqa, which is ISIS’s base in Syria, ITV News reported on Thursday.
The 17-year-old Sultan, according to his family, was planning to flee the war and return to Britain.
"We can only hope that this will serve as a warning example and a testament so that people understand that this is a real risk when going to the war zone - and that it will cause people to give up the decision to leave," Akunjee said.
In February 2015, Sultana boarded a plane with two other East Ottoman schoolgirls to Turkey and continued to travel by bus to the Syrian border.
The family had heard that Sultana had married an ISIS fighter in Syria and remained a widow only a few months after the wedding.
Reid says Clinton will support Garland's appointment to the Supreme Court if he is elected
Senate Democrat Harry Reid says he is convinced that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will appoint Merrick Garland as the Supreme Court judge if he is elected president.
Republicans in the Senate have not agreed to confirm Garland's appointment since Barack Obama appointed him in March.
Senate Majority President Mitch McConnell said the next president will elect a person to serve as the post of late Supreme Court judge Anton Scalia.
Reid said in a phone call on Thursday that he predicted that Clinton would elect Garland "with great certainty".
Reid’s spokesman later pointed out that this was just speculation and that Reid had not spoken directly to Clinton, whether he was going to name Garland.
Reid praised Garland and said that the Clinton team wouldn’t want to “influence the boat” by choosing someone else.
Garland is the Chief Justice of the U.S. Court of Appeal in the District Court of Columbia.
Reid says Republicans who are preventing Garland's appointment are Donald Trump's "chiefs" and "foreigners".
Trump says he is not fit for office.
According to Treats magazine, naked calendars belong as well to women as men.
Treats magazine collaborates with photographer David Bellemer and brings the 1970s-style calendar to the market for 2017 inspired by Pirelli.
Instead of publishing models, they want to find top models of the next generation in their 2017 NU Muses calendar.
Treats CEO Steve Shaw said earlier this year that his nudity-shocking magazine differs from the old school's Playboy magazine, as he says, "Playboy is for men.
I'll do this to women."
He seems to think the same way about the calendar.
“We have to bring back timeless and classical nudity where women, wherever men are, can enjoy and be inspired by these women’s body-honoring images without any hassle,” Shaw said in a press release.
“Women will definitely want to participate in this project because it will be a beautiful work of art.”
As a model, you can send your photos online or take part in open selection events in Los Angeles and New York.
Vinyl charm: who buys records?
Lonely, middle-aged men like vinyl.
Before you can post in the comments section with the title of your angry objection to EiväKalkiSingleMiddle-ageMen, this claim is based on real research data.
According to the YouGov research company, there is not a millennial-generation buoy behind the new arrival of much-talked vinyl sheets, when millennials want to feel a physical object in their hands, but instead, there is a middle-aged nostalgia in the background.
The age of the person who recently purchased vinyl album is most likely between 45-54.
The 18-24 age group is in fact the least likely buyers.
It is also not only a desire for lovers to search for records, but also an emotion-based meaning: older buyers of vinyl records are slightly more likely to hide their feelings (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy exclusiveness (69% vs. 66%).
But are YouGov’s results true?
If this blog were a televised newscast, the camera would follow me while walking along the lively Soho Street, wearing a grey jacket on me. I would bend my hand vividly, fold my hand into a cup and say something traditional, like, "Let's figure it out."
So let's figure it out.
Although Soho has slowly lost its charm and rosyness as the hotels, Eats, Prets and Paperchase chains have taken over the premises owned by private entrepreneurs, there are still a few specialty record stores left.
I would probably ask the photographer to stop the camera for a moment when I apply very close to the men visiting these stores and try to assess their age and nature.
The Glasgow-born Stuart, 55, followed by the Sister Ray movement (at the moment two young women, three middle-aged men) to the Reckless Records movement (at the time eight middle-aged men are offered, one is likely to be in the middle-aged group, and one is in the middle-aged group at twenty-two).
I'll ask if he's a collector.
“I think I am,” he says.
"I have about 3,000-4,000 discs."
These discs fill the walls of his living room, as shown in the picture. (Stuart sent me the picture by email, I did not follow him home.)
The reason why he has acquired so many albums and singles, is partly because of his available income. He is now able to buy records that he could not afford when they first appeared, and to buy again the things he was young and my moneyless.
“There were a lot of things in the late 60s and early 70s that appeared when I was 11 or 12 years old and probably too young to get them,” he says.
He agrees that buyers of vinyl discs are more likely to be introverts who enjoy themselves with them, and adds: "I don't smoke, and I don't drink too much.
It's my evil."
Wez, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many of their customers fit into their YouGov profile.
However, he has detected a new kind of human flow that has been affected by media leaps. These people have heard of vinyl records coming back and now feel compelled to buy their old records back.
"Based on my experiences, people had generally abandoned their collections in 1998 or 1999.
Customers who sold their vinyl to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their vinyl back,” he says.
This can explain the boom of certain age vinyl greens.
What about the alleged emotional significance of the audio recordings?
In just a few seconds, in a movement like Phonica, you will realize that they provide a comfortable community for similar types.
According to Wez, some of the older customers are particularly upset about the contactless payment system.
The digital world may haunt some of the vinyl fans, for whom returning to familiar record labels means permanence and resemble the happy days of youth.
“I think it sometimes fills a gap or material property is acquired as some kind of comfort,” Wez says.
“I saw it myself as a collector, and I believe so many others.
It’s an easy way to get ideas elsewhere.”
"We're like social workers!" says Wez's colleague behind the board.
An ICM survey conducted in April found that nearly 50 percent of those who bought vinyl albums in the previous month had not yet listened to their disc.
The opinion poll also revealed that 41 percent of the consumers have a record player that they never use, and 7 percent of the buyers of vinyl records do not have their own record player at all.
At this stage of the newsletter, I would probably look like a serious mask while browsing the piled bossa nova collections.
The new release of vinyl records is also associated with a "pokal phenomenon" that the salesman of Sounds of the Universe (three middle-aged men at the time) Jonny, 42, has observed.
“A client came out recently and said he doesn’t have a record player, but he wants to buy a Radiohead record so he can put it on his shelf,” Jonny says.
“There’s not a lot of customers, but they do.
For them, materiality is more important than music.
Some of our customers say they don't have a record player yet.
They are younger, not older, mostly teens, who are just starting to get into a hobby."
The customer base is much more diverse in Fop, which will be next. The movement has owned the entire layer of vinyl sheets.
Customers include 70 couples, tourists taking pictures, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
The difference of the customers is delightful, even though the atmosphere is not as relaxed as in previous movements: instead of loud jazz, the newest sex synthesizer in the Wild Beast.
None of the clients seem particularly lonely, but it is difficult to detect a painful psychological trauma by standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been walking around Foppia for a few minutes and watching various discounted records.
He's watching rather than shopping.
He says his income is small, so collecting records is not possible for him.
"They cost a lot.
It’s easy to listen to music from a computer or something, but the fineness of the wine is ..." she lets a lovely whisper and continues:
"I can't explain, they're so unique."
My last stop is a store that is said to have inspired a new generation of vinyl fans: Urban Outfitters.
I notice a bunch of teenage girls who would imagine jumping jerseys, but who instead gather for a moment around Polaroid cameras. I see a father and daughter considering buying a Crosley record player.
On the left is a staircase with a wall filled with the records of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, key records to any midrange collection.
No one looks at the wall, perhaps because they are just interior elements and part so high that they are not even overlooked.
They are pure "art vinyl" interiors.
But considering that all the means to get attention to these records may mean more money to the industry and send a few customers to search for Soho, there is little reason to complain.
It’s no surprise that the group of people most likely to have more time and money than most people, at the same time, is also the group that spends the most money on luxury, such as vinyl records.
While my research has shown that YouGov’s findings are true, at least in Soho record stores, they do not exclude a large number of female trackers and vinyl fans that actually exist in both record stores and online forums.
These people are likely to be tightly stuck in school or work.
They certainly will not spend at least their Thursday nights minimizing Berwick Street record stores, browsing records, and avoiding a 30-year-old television presenter who is frighteningly watching and staring at malicious middle-aged men.
Holker, or ice shark, is the longest living spinal cord – video report
Scientists say the longest living vertebrae on earth is an ice shark.
According to Haitian researcher Julius Nielsen, the age of the oldest glacier was 272–512 years, a five-meter-long female.
French court rejects application for dismantling of shops in a jungle camp
The French court has rejected an application by the authorities in Calais demanding the dismantling of dozens of temporary shops and restaurants by thousands of refugees in a jungle camp.
During the trial held this week, the Calais authorities submitted allegations that the state should be allowed to dismantle 72 temporary shops for refugee camps. The shops sell different kinds of goods to the camp’s residents. with 50 cents of tobacco tobacco to energy drinks and cans to buy.
According to the Calais prefectural authorities, these shops and restaurants must be cut down because they do not pay taxes and therefore represent the grey economy and because they are associated with fire and hygiene risks.
Humanitarian aid groups told the Court that shops and restaurants are essential for the camp, as free meals offered by the state-backed organization and other agencies are not enough for the growing population of the camp.
According to them, temporary shops and restaurants often offer protection and free food for those in need.
The Lillen court ruled that there was no legal ground for expulsion of 72 temporary traders, but considered Calais's concerns "totally understandable".
According to Judge Jean-François Molla, the camp’s grocery stores, cafes and restaurants are much more important than just providing food for people who “live in extremely unstable conditions”.
He says that they offer peaceful places where refugees and volunteers can meet each other.
One of the places below the landing site was the Jungle Book Kids Cafe, which is not for profit and offers 200 meals a day, English and French lessons and asylum advice to hundreds of campmates without caregivers, whose status is the most vulnerable.
More than 170,000 people have signed an address where the children’s café is required to be kept.
According to a letter to the Guardian, its closure "would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are only 8 years old."
Two charities, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, estimated Friday that following a sharp increase in summer arrivals, the population of the jungle camp has risen to a record 9,000.
The price of bread in Finland drops significantly faster than the EU average
In Finland, food is sharply depleted for the sake of consumers and at the expense of producers.
In Finland, the price of bread has fallen by almost 5% in three years, compared with the average price of bread in EU countries falling by 0.9%.
At the same time, food has become 1% more expensive in Germany and Sweden.
Over the past three years, food prices in Finland have fallen to the second highest in the EU countries with a similar pay level to those in Finland.
Only in the UK, the price of food has fallen faster than in Finland.
The information is published by Ilkka Lehtisen, Head of Development at Statistics Centre, published in the blog Tieto & Trends.
The leaf compared real prices, i.e. prices that are proportional to the general development of consumer prices.
The latest data is from June of this year.
In the early 2010s, food prices rose sharply.
In 2013, prices fell close to the 1994 price level.
The situation was alarming.
"We were close to losing the price advantage that came with EU membership," Lehtinen says.
Then followed the turn, after which the food has become cheaper year by year.
The Russian food import bans, which have slowed food exports from Finland to Russia, are now burdening the price.
Therefore, the supply of milk and meat products in the Finnish market has increased and agricultural producer prices have fallen.
“Putin’s policy has helped the Finnish consumer in the short term,” Lehtinen says.
Increased price competition in industry and trade has also affected the price drop.
The major trading chains of the S-Group and Kesko have both lowered their prices.
For consumers, price competition has been shown as prominent advertising campaigns.
Nevertheless, Finland is still not a low-cost diet planner, even though the price of food has fallen abundantly.
In 2015, food was the fourth most expensive in the EU, with a similar salary level as in Finland.
According to the newspaper, the price of food sold in Finland is significantly affected by VAT.
He found that if the VAT rates were the same, the cheapest food from the same third countries would be sold in Finland at the same level of wages.
The newspaper compared Finland to Denmark, Sweden, Austria, France, Italy, Britain, Germany and the Netherlands.
If the VAT rate were seven in the country, only the Germans and the Dutch would sell food cheaper than the Finns.
“If we want to reach the level of the old EU countries in terms of food prices, the VAT must be halved by the EU’s average level and continue price competition,” Lehtinen writes.
Lehtinen notes that his calculations at the rate of VAT are indicative.
The school is no longer its former
You may notice that there has been a change in school during the summer.
A new curriculum has been developed for schools, which will be introduced at the beginning of the semester in all secondary schools.
It is a guide that says that all Finnish schools will operate.
Schools decide on the details themselves, but the plan tells you the official goals.
New guidelines have been prepared for several years, and they differ from the old guidelines in many ways.
Among other things, the teaching of fine-grained writing is abandoned, and instead, coding is practiced in schools.
Swedish education begins in the sixth grade at the latest, and social education begins in the fourth.
The biggest change is the role of the students.
It used to be thought that the teacher teaches the students, but now everyone has to be active and learn from each other.
In this way, the school visit is made more interesting.
World's longest-lived vertebrate found - ice shark can live up to 400 years
Ice-haired Greenlandish shrimp (Somniosus microcephalus) reaches sexual maturity only at the age of 150.
It can live for another 250 years, according to a new study.
The figures make the species the longest-lived vertebrae in the world today.
In the zoo, it is bypassed by only an Icelandic pigeon whose oldest known individual is scheduled to be 507 years old.
Greenland swamps swim along the North Atlantic.
They also have another record: they are the largest fish in the Arctic.
Females stretch dogs longer, they can grow up to more than five meters.
Because the growth rate is slow, according to the tracks only about a centimeter a year, adult individuals have probably lived for a long time.
But for how long?
Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen found out about his colleagues.
He identified some of the 28 females left behind in the fisherman’s catches for adult frogs.
The age of the lenses was revealed by radiocarbon limitation of the lenses.
The average age of the studied sharks was at least 272 years.
The two largest fish in the sample, the 493- and 502-centimeter amazon populations, were revealed to be around 335 and 392 years old.
Because previous studies have found that ice skates only reach sexual maturity by more than a square meter, the researchers calculated that they are about 150 years old at the time.
The study was published by Science.
Stockmann fired for nearly 300 - sellers are not deducted
Almost 300 employees will be fired from Stockmann.
The joint ventures in the company, which was in difficulty, ended in early August.
"As a result of the negotiations, about 300 jobs will be cut, the majority of which will be laid off," Stockmann said in a statement.
According to it, the number of vendors of warehouses is not deducted so that customer service does not suffer.
In addition, about 80 employees in support functions are offered a new job as a seller.
Stockmann's YT negotiations involved about 3,000 employees.
At the beginning, the reduction requirement was estimated to be around 380 employees.
The reduction of population aims at annual cost savings of around EUR 20 million, which are expected to be achieved over the next year.
Stockmann has already launched an efficiency programme to achieve savings of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>50 million this year.
In the background, Stockmann’s difficulties in getting a profit from the grocery store.
Although the Group’s adjusted turnover improved to EUR 11.1 million in the second quarter, commodity sales are still losing.
According to Stockmann CEO Lauri Veijalaise, sales in warehouses have not exceeded the objectives set by the company.
"Unfortunately, staff reductions are necessary to ensure that Stockmann Retail will have a positive turnover in 2018," Veijalainen said in a statement.
The second quarter’s performance improvement was based on Lindex’s good success, in particular.
The chain achieved its best sales and profits in the second quarter of all time.
Lindex’s operating profit grew from EUR 9.5 million to EUR 28.1 million.
At the same time last year, the total revenue of the Stockmann Group was 4.1 million losses.
Stockmann estimates that the Group’s turnover this year will decline from last year.
The adjusted turnover is expected to be a bit positive this year.
Friday is the rainiest in the north - temperatures below 20 degrees across the country
The low-pressure centre on the northern part of Finland will keep the weather rainy on Friday, according to HS meteorologist Ilona Láng.
There are rainy seasons in the central part of the country, but the southern part is steep.
The temperature is no longer very summery, as mercury remains below 20 degrees throughout the country.
In the northern rainy regions, stay at 10-15 degrees.
Kenyan sports team is ravaging doping scandal – a strange explanation for the coach’s execution
Kenyan general sports coach John Anzrah was sent home from the Rio Olympics after it turned out that Anzrah appeared as a country team athlete in a doping test.
The AP news agency said the athlete Anzrah attempted to perform was the 800-metre star Ferguson Rotich.
Kenyan national team leader Stephen Arap Soi said Anzrah's identity was revealed after he gave a sample of Rotichina in the surprise test.
Doping officials went to the authorities in Anzrahi.
According to Soin, Anzrah was sent home because he "made a crime against the Kenyan national team".
He appeared as an athlete, gave a urine sample and even signed the documents.
We cannot accept such behavior," said Kip Keino, chairman of the Kenyan Olympic Committee, in a statement to Reuters.
The Olympic general sport starts on Friday, and Rotich is scheduled to run immediately.
It is not yet known whether the runner is aware of the consequences of the incident.
Rotich finished fourth in the World Cup last year and is ahead of Rio’s winners’ favourites.
According to Reuters, a source within the Kenyan general sports team claimed that Anzrah went with the athlete's accreditation card only to get free meals in the village.
When anti-doping officials met him, they assumed he was an athlete and he was put to the test.
The coach did not explain the situation to the officials because he was afraid that it would be revealed,” the source said.
Where's everybody?
Rio's public sports stadium is empty.
Where are they all right?
At least they don’t play sports at the Olympic Stadium in Rio.
On Friday, Rio started the competition for public sports medals, but the world’s top players were able to showcase their skills to a confusing, empty audience.
Rio’s organizers said Friday that only 58% of the tickets for the first day’s morning shows and 65% of the evening’s tickets were sold.
The second one was four years ago in London, where the stadium was populated by a horrifying crowd.
Tickets for the finals have already been sold out in Rio.
The distribution of the Rio Olympics has already attracted attention before the general sport.
For example, thousands of empty benches have been seen in the spectators of rugby, melon and horseback riding.
When Brazilian medalist Talita Antunes and Larissa Franca played beach volleyball at the legendary Copacabana, it was only 70 percent full.
After the Brazilian coup, the Netherlands played against Russia, and the 12,000 viewers were just about 30% full.
The bad losses are at least explained by the fact that Brazil, struggling with economic difficulties, is far from European and Asian racers, and many of the Olympics are strange to Brazilians who are accustomed to football.
However, even the first match of the Brazilian football team did not get a watered soccer stadium complete.
At the end of the weekend, Mario Andrada, a spokesman for the event, said 82 percent of the tickets had been sold at the time, which is significantly less than four years ago.
"There are still 1.1 million left to sell," Andrada told Reuters.
Of the 8.5 million London Olympic tickets, 8.2 million were sold, although tickets cost almost half more than in Rio.
In Rio, the prices of tickets ranged from about nine euros to more than a thousand euros.
More than half of the tickets cost less than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>16.
At the Olympic Games in London, volunteers and military personnel were allowed to sit in empty places, but this is not yet allowed in Rio, as organizers need money and are trying to get tickets for sale until the last minute.
In Rio, however, organizers have given 240,000 tickets to schoolchildren in the country for lesser-known species, such as golf and rugby.
In the morning, there were plenty of empty spaces at the Rio Stadium.
Even beach volleyball in the Copacabana sand has not attracted the public.
Jukka Midfielder competed in London in 2012.
People in the newspapers were enough.
A new way to protect nature - acquire the right to land
The Helsinki Foundation participates in the conservation of nature in the latest ways.
Established last year, the foundation acquires ecologically important natural areas.
After that, private companies and entities can redeem the ownership rights of the land with money.
The Foundation has acquired its first land from Lapis.
The land area is virtually divided into blocks that will be available to all interested parties for a fee of ownership.
The holder is given a right of veto to a block of 187 squares, which in practice means that not every holder will need approval if the purpose of the land is to be changed.
Ownership rights can also be acquired for multiple blocks.
The acquisition of an administrative right is something concrete that can be left as a legacy or as a gift.
You don’t have to go wearing banners or shovel yourself somewhere to protect nature,” Juha Leviäkangas, who acquired the management right for his company, explains.
The administrator acquirer receives accurate location information from his block, which allows for, for example, a visit to the block.
On the Foundation’s website, the names of the acquisitions of ownership rights appear on the same map where the block data of the land can be found.
The leaf fabric sees the risk of its natural protection procurement only in the fact that the foundation’s activities change from its original idea.
The Helsinki Foundation has been established as a foundation of public interest, which aims to promote the protection of the environment and nature.
The risk is that the foundation would somehow act unethically or commercially, but it should not be possible.
The basic idea of the Holdija project of the Helsinki Foundation is the protection of natural areas so that they can be intact and peaceful.
The Foundation acquires land either through purchase or as a donation.
It finances its operations mainly through the sale of ownership rights, but the foundation has received its initial capital from its founders.
The aim of the Foundation is to acquire more protected countries.
It also targets outside the borders of Finland and is planning to purchase goods from Australia.
The Helsinki Foundation will present its activities in the pop up forest at the Helsinki Trader on August 13-19.
Cycling thieves torture the worst of major cities in Turku - see your local situation
Bicycle thefts are one of the worst in Finland’s major cities in Turkey.
This year, more wheels have been stolen than in nine other major cities in the country.
On the basis of the bicycle thefts reported to the police, Sanomat of Helsinki found out how many of the ten largest cities had stolen bicycles in January-August of this year and parts of them calculated per 1,000 inhabitants.
In addition to the market, Helsinki, Oulu and Lahti rose to the top.
According to police, there were four to five bicycle thefts per 1,000 inhabitants.
In Espoo and Kouvola, only about two bicycle thefts per 1,000 inhabitants were reported.
That's a big difference.
“In other cities, double the number of robberies occurs in proportion to the population,” said Tommi Reen, police inspector of the Police Department.
The market police are wondering why the city is at the forefront of comparison.
It is extremely difficult to say why more wheels have been stolen in the market than elsewhere.
I don't have an answer to that.
“The frequency of warnings can be influenced by how much of the city is moving on wheels and how much of the wheels are at all,” said Lieutenant General Teemu <0xC3><0x84>ikäs.
The police government, Tommi Reen, expects Turku, Helsinki and Oulu to rise to the top in comparison.
The number of bicycle thefts varies largely depending on which cities are studying and cycling.
The market is close to the center, short distances and a lot of wheels available for thieves.
"For example, Espoo is a very different type of city, where city centres are far from each other and bicycles are not necessarily the primary means of transport," Reen says.
The total number of bicycle thefts reported in Finland in January-August is slightly lower than in the corresponding period last year.
There is still no reason for great joy.
Despite the decline in recent years, the police are aware of just over 20,000 bicycle thefts every year.
It means 50-60 fillers per day and only in Helsinki about 4,000 wheels per year.
“It’s a lot,” Reen says.
In fact, thieves take more wheels, as only a few of the victims report the theft to the police.
Reen urges people to make a criminal report of bicycle theft, although fewer than one in ten cases reported to the police will survive.
A typical detected bicycle theft is one in which the police are informed of the theft immediately and the thief is trapped in his blood.
“There are also cases in other investigations where, for example, stolen wheels can be found in a drugged apartment,” Reen says.
In Helsinki, bicycle thefts are arrested weekly for their own crime or in connection with a police investigation, according to senior police officer Timo Leppämäki.
According to him, bicycles are stolen, for example, from shopping malls’ wheelchairs, inner courtyards, warehouses and bicycle paths, i.e. virtually anywhere they are usually stored.
The most individual bike models are stolen in the same way as in previous years.
The U-lock gives the bike better protection than many other types of locks.
Some thieves, for example, take the bike for short-term use, but a large part of the stolen bikes end up on sale, for example, via the internet.
They remain in the domestic market.
“At least the police have not come to the knowledge that the stolen wheels would go very little abroad,” Reen says.
The buyers of stolen bicycles are, according to police, ordinary Finns.
Some will probably buy a stolen bike unknowingly.
Some may have doubts about it.
The buyer of a used bike must be careful as he or she may be guilty of concealment or violation.
"The alarm clocks should be ringing if the good condition bike is sold at a clear lower price," Reen says.
Special Librarian Severi Hirvi always wears his colourful Nopsana for the duration of his working day under the protection of the Kallio Library in Helsinki.
He has had five wheels, but none has been stolen, says the Monster. "There has never been taken, there has been a good monk."
"Well, maybe this doesn't attract thieves so much, there's not necessarily any hipster value here," Hirvi, a Helsinkier, said.
Siiri Valve closed his bike with a small U-Location in a kiosk in Helsinki, Kallio.
Now the bike leaned against the wall of the kiosk, but usually Valve locks his bike into something fixed, such as a wheelbarrow.
"There's a lot to think about, because this bike is the most expensive thing I own," says a Helsinki student about his white bike, whose body alone cost about five hundred euros.
"All the time I hear from my friends that the wheels have been taken away."
"First of all, bad wheels, that kind of stuff."
A bicycle was stolen from the company’s interior a year ago.
The bike had been unlocked, so Valve could wait for it to be pulled.
You're under 15 years of age to blame for your crimes?
Helsinki to test U.S. peer-reviewed crews
In Helsinki, the so-called peer-to-peer crew is trying to prevent young people from getting into the crime scene.
Initially, the trial applies to children under the age of 15, who are now without criminal liability.
The crew is missing the first young man to commit a crime.
The idea is that the peer-to-peer crew will discuss the incident with the perpetrator and impose a penalty.
A week later, the perpetrator of the crime can join the peer group to compensate for his actions.
Other consequences may be, for example, a letter written to the family explaining what has been done and what has been learned from it.
Youth CEO Tommi Laitio says the model is not strict.
We also have other conciliation models that are used in parallel.
“Everyone is guided in a more responsible direction so that everything is not ruined by the first mistake,” Laitio says.
A model of the United States, where it is widely used, has been incorporated into the comparative crew.
The idea is that after the first crime, the young man does not face an adult panel, but reflects on what has happened with nearly the same age.
The model has been tried once.
Iikka Lovio, a Palmu service designer who followed the experiment, says that it was a maltreatment that was successfully resolved.
In particular, the first offences of less than 15 years of age may not have been treated at all.
“It’s been a message that you continue on the path you choose,” Lovio says.
The team is part of the Immigrant Youth Helsinki project, which is based on the Helsinki City and Me Foundation.
Lovio stresses that new approaches are being offered to all those in need, not just young immigrants.
More than 70 Republicans Want Party to Stop Financing Trump Campaign
More than 70 influential Republicans are said to have signed a letter calling on the party to stop funding Donald Trump’s presidential campaign.
The letter was reported by the American magazine Politico, which had received it to view the draft.
According to the newspaper, an open letter is addressed to the chairman of the Republican National Committee, Reince Priebus.
The signatories want the party’s money to be channeled to Congress instead of Trump’s campaign.
“We believe that the disagreements caused by Donald Trump, as well as his disrespect, incompetence and record-breaking incompetence, are threatening to bring voter turnout to Democrats in these elections,” the letter said.
Only directing all possible funds to Congressmen can prevent Republicans from drowning in the Trump-correct anchor in their necks.
According to the letter, the decision should not be difficult as Trump’s chances of winning the presidential election are diminishing day by day.
Politico writes that the letter is due to be sent within the next week.
Among the signatories are among others politicians Gordon Humphrey, Chris Shays, Tom Coleman and Vin Weber.
One of the organizers of the letter is apparently Republican Andrew Weinstein, who opposes Trump.
According to Politico, Weinstein has said that the letter comes from "people who want the party to protect the majority in Congress" and that it is not about endorsing anyone.
The letter lists several of Donald Trump’s actions, believed to have offended millions of voters.
In addition, he is said to have shown dangerous authoritarian tendencies.
Earlier this week, 50 officials working on national security said in an open letter that they would not support Donald Trump as president.
Clinton pledges relief to U.S. child families
In the United States, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton told about her economic policy details on Thursday night.
I am trying to make sure that the U.S. economy is going well for everyone.
"Donald Trump is trying to make the economy go well for him and his friends," Clinton said in a speech.
At the heart of Clinton’s plan is a massive, <0x24>275 billion five-year program to improve U.S. infrastructure – roads, bridges, and airports.
This would be financed in part by tax increases for the rich, in part by private money.
The construction program is a hand-over to American donors who suffer from the move of factories to low-income countries.
Clinton called the program the largest investment in high-paying jobs after World War II.
We are a builder nation, we must rebuild!
Clinton said.
On Thursday, Clinton also pledged to ease the status of working families.
On Thursday, Sanders said that the rich should pay a fair share of their taxes.
And if the company leaves the United States as a taxpayer, it has to pay the exit tax, Clinton said.
Currently, he opposes the Pacific Free Trade Agreement, which he previously supported.
“As president, I oppose any trade agreements that operate against workers or wages,” Clinton said.
According to speculation published by The Washington Post prior to Clinton’s speech, Clinton was planning to criticize the Republican economic program announced by Donald Trump on Monday for “encouraging only such millionaires.”
Trump’s proposal for a ruthless reduction in corporate taxes, Clinton has previously called “Trump’s Porcelain Deal.”
On Thursday, Clinton said she was the daughter of a small businessman.
He reminded listeners of the small businessmen whose bills Trump has left unpaid, and the clothes that Trump himself makes in China and Mexico.
“If he wants to make America great again, he should start making products himself in America,” Clinton said.
These are Rio’s spectator figures: The races have not glued Finnish boxes, but the mobile app is of interest
Sporting events are usually seen in TV viewers’ statistics as sharp mountain peaks.
The Rio Olympics have yet to reach a bleak audience.
At the same time, the competitions have attracted 12 per cent of the population at their best: on Tuesday night, the swimming was followed by 615 000 spectators on the Yle Olympic Channel at the same time.
For comparison: a month ago, the European general sports championships had almost 800,000 spectators on TV2, and the European football championships were fairly another million.
So far, the most interested of the Olympics has been cycling on Sunday afternoons and the fifth day of the race, which both reached nearly half a million spectators on the Olympic channel at the same time.
Yerevan sports chief Panu Pokkinen is pleased with the spectator figures, and reminds that the spectators will be divided into several different instruments for the first time at the Rio Olympics.
In addition, the Finns will be watching the Olympics in Rio Arena.
We are pleased with how much television viewers choose the Olympics in general.
On both sides of the TV, viewers share TV2 and Yle Fem channels.
The Rio Olympics are the first sports to which Yle has owned the entire channel.
When the broadcast comes 24 hours a day, and the viewers are all the time from 20,000 to 500,000, then it’s a good base.
The number of spectators is less than at the 2012 London Games or the 2008 Beijing Games, but the difference explains the time difference – a large part of Rio’s performances will come in Finland at night.
The second reason for his lean interest - if it is now considered a lean one - is certainly the traditional Finnish reason: if Finland had taken a surprise medal from the initials, the interest would have pumped up with it.
In addition, public sports are just beginning, as are other Finnish species of interest: sailing and horse riding.
The initial number of spectators, according to Pokkis, was near-expected.
When the sport starts, spectator numbers explode.
Yle launched the Yle Rio 2016 mobile app for competitions, which in the first days of the competitions became the most downloaded free app in Finland on the Apple App Store.
By Monday, the app had been downloaded 150,000 times.
I bet we're already running 200,000 downloads now.
"We will only receive the spectator numbers of the network later," says Pokkinen
Rio Arena has not worked for all users as expected.
Pokkinen says that the feedback has come and the faults have been corrected.
The Rio Arena has been subject to a delay and other minor technical problems in its early stages.
There are updated versions of the apps that should be corrected for errors.
The Rio Olympics will be seen in the Yle canals and arena more broadly than any other sporting event ever before.
The Yle Fem channel can be monitored by some species, and on the radio Yle Speech transmits competitions daily.
The Olympics are not only perhaps the hardest to work Yle ever, but also the last to be watched only on Yle’s channels.
Beginning in 2018, Olympic sports will be shown on both Yle and commercial channels.
How deep is Finland’s deepest lake?
According to official statistics, the deepest lake in Finland is Päijänje, with a depth of 95.3 meters.
It might be even deeper.
Technician diving instructor Matti Kannela found a pressure gauge of about 20 square meters at Kristiselä, at the bottom of which the diving computer showed a depth of 104 meters.
In the summer of 2014, the Finnish Environment Agency tried in vain to reinforce the finding by eliminating consumption.
The method may not necessarily be found at a small depth of one hundred meters, says development engineer Jari Hakala.
So far, the official depth is still 95.3 meters.
Other deep lakes are Lake Inarij (92 meters) and Suvasvesi (90 meters).
Saimaa, Toisvesi and Lake Päääjärvi are more than 80 meters wide.
They have not been studied as closely as the Journal.
In particular, the base of Lake Inarija has not been accurately mapped.
"There might well be unknown depths," Kannela thinks.
If the deepest lake is defined by the medium depth, it is Great Lake Jukaj, 23 meters.
In this way, your Day will not reach the ten deepest groups and Suvaswater will be even farther from the top.
Repair on August 12 at 14:29: Fixed the last piece, where the deepest lakes of their central depth were wrong.
Taxation: Pensioners’ Taxation Is Still Harder
The taxation of pensioners is still more stringent than the taxpayers.
Ihalinen says that the deficiency emerged under parliamentary elections and pensioners were promised to pay equal to the employees.
This is not included in the Government’s proposal.
In our view, that should be absolutely the case.
The promises made should be kept after the elections, he told Western Media.
At the beginning of this year, workers were given a reduction in their earnings, which eased taxation.
The matter was heated up in the parliament by opposition representatives, who stifled the then-Financial Minister Alexander Stubbia (cook.) on the election promises.
Purchase power is secured, it does not grow
In the line presented by Finance Minister Petteri Orpon (co.), according to Ihalines, tax cuts are mainly about securing the purchasing power and not increasing it, because next year there will be no increase in wages.
He says that tax cuts have a positive impact on purchasing power and employment, if other things do not increase people’s uncertainty.
Ihalainen welcomes the messages of Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Central) and Orpo on the desire to respect the competitiveness agreement.
He said that sticking to the agreement is important for credibility.
It is the most important economic and employment policy activity of the government period.
It has been done by the labour market organisations, so it should not be questioned by questioning.
It comes in need, because the economy is so much in the stock of domestic demand and people's own faith in the future.
Long-term unemployment in the wake of
Ihalainen appeals to the government that it should catch up with long-term unemployment in the budget line, at least to stop its growth.
In June, there were about 17,000 more long-term unemployed than a year earlier.
He says that if growth doesn’t stop, the government’s goal will be to increase the employment rate to 72 percent.
He warns that if the challenge of prolonged unemployment is overlooked, there will be a very large social decline.
Embassy in Thailand: No Finnish casualties reported in attacks
At least four people were killed in the bombings in Thailand last night and last night in Finland.
The Embassy calls on Finns in the country to be vigilant and to avoid the busiest tourist areas, as well as to follow the instructions of the authorities.
Finnish tourists intending to Thailand should not cancel their trip due to the explosions, but the embassy’s instructions for caution should be followed, Westphale said.
There are very few Finns in Thailand
According to Westphalen, there are currently very few Finns in Thailand, although their exact number is difficult to estimate.
The travel season for Finns in Thailand is scheduled for the season.
The majority of Thai tourists come from southern Europe and China this time of year.
The Embassy of Finland has received comments from Finns in Thailand via Facebook after the bombings.
The Embassy has tried to target the Finns in Hua Hin in particular in order to get information on the situation in the city.
However, many of our contacts in Hua Hin are currently out of town.
Overall, everything seems to be fine, Westphale says.
No information on the author
Westphalen said there was no information on the perpetrator of the attacks.
The ambassador believes the events could be linked to the political turmoil of a divided society in Thailand and the last week’s referendum on the constitution drawn up by the military junta.
The law was passed in a referendum.
The referendum was not an open, democratic process.
Among other things, people were detained who said they were opposed to the law.
In the southernmost provinces of Thailand, an ethnic-national conflict linked to the Muslim population, Westphale says.
Muslims want to increase their right to self-determination.
However, the attacks have not been extended to tourist destinations in the past.
Today is a big, local holiday in Bangkok, Westphalen says.
She said the city celebrates the Queen’s Birthday and Mother’s Day.
There is very little traffic in the city.
The attacks affect the course of the day in such a way that the authorities are very precise about security.
Thailand Police: Attacks do not involve international terrorism
According to police, the attacks are "local sabotage" and differ from conventional terrorist attacks.
Islamic terrorism has also been excluded, according to the Thai police news agency AP.
At least four people have died in Thailand in a 24-hour period after 11 bombs exploded across the country, including tourist-favorite Phuket and Hua Hin.
At a popular tourist destination for Finns, the holiday island of Phuket exploded four bombs at night, reports the Thai newspaper Bangkok Post.
According to current data, they did not require deaths.
Two of the bombs exploded in Patong Beach, according to the newspaper.
In addition, two bombs exploded in Phang Nga, injuring one person, according to the newspaper.
A popular tourist destination in Hua Hin, in turn, according to local authorities, has exploded a total of four bombs yesterday and today.
At least one of them died in both bombs.
In South Thailand, at least one bomb exploded in the village of Surat Than and in the city of Trang.
At least one person died in both attacks.
Surat Thani is also known to many tourists as it transports to Ko Samuin, Ko Pha Nganin and Ko Tao holiday islands.
The perpetrator of the attack is unknown
According to Prayut Chan-O-Chan, the leader of the Thai-run military junta, the perpetrator of the attacks is not yet known.
Bombs are an attempt to create chaos and confusion.
We should not let people panic any more, he told reporters.
According to Deputy Prime Minister Gen Prawit Wongsuwan, at least Hua Hin and Trang are linked.
He told Thai BSB that the intention of the perpetrators was to destroy the country’s tourism because all the attacks have taken place in tourist destinations.
The Embassy of Finland urges the Finnish people in the country to be vigilant and to avoid the busiest tourist areas and to follow the instructions of the authorities.
Finns intending to Thailand should not cancel their trip due to the explosions, but the embassy’s instructions on caution should be followed, Westphale said.
Injured Europeans
Very little is known about the attacks during the night in Finland and their victims so far.
A little bit more information about the attack in Hua Hin last night has been provided.
It killed a local woman and wounded more than 20 others, including at least nine foreign tourists.
Among the injured are at least Germans, Italians, Dutch and Austrians.
In Hua Hin's second attack, at least three people were injured.
Two bombs exploded in the vicinity of the clock tower.
Thai PBS says police have isolated the area in Hua Hin where they believe they have found another bomb.
The Surat Thann bomb was hidden in a flower bank, according to the governor of the county.
One day, a local employee died.
There are at least one injured.
A CNN spokesman said two bombs, which exploded every half an hour, were also used in the attack on Surat Than.
According to the Bangkok Post, bombs exploded in front of two different police stations.

Thailand’s Finnish entrepreneur: “Everyone has no impact on tourism”
Established in Thailand’s Phuket real estate agency and children’s toy club, Esa Huovila is not worried about the impact of the Thai bombings on tourism.
If there are no more strikes, then I don’t think there will be any more wonder, as a Finnish entrepreneur in Asia estimates that you have been working in Huovila for about twenty years.
An experienced entrepreneur has seen many tragedies experienced in Thailand close by.
There's always something here.
First there was a tsunami, then a bird flu, and last year there was a bombing in Bangkok.
If they haven’t deported tourists in the past, that’s hardly the case.
The office of the company Huovila is located a few hundred meters away from the explosion site.
Huovila heard about the attack from his own employee.
The employee called around 9 a.m. local time and said it wasn’t worth coming to the office.
Huovila says that both the beach and main street of Bangla Road were completely closed early in the morning due to the attacks.
Many of my local employees came to work in the morning as usual.
They believed that the roadblocks had been set for the Queen’s birthday, Huovila says and refers to a holiday in Thailand on Friday.
At Patong, the atmosphere was calm and the main street movements were allowed to open at about 10 a.m. local time.
A lot of people on the beach hadn’t even heard of the attacks.
At half time three a day in Thailand, traffic in Patong had normalized and a large part of the shops had opened their doors.
Based on the location of the attack, the explosion has been quite small, says Huovila, who visited the site of the attack.
The car was later seen in Kruunupyyy at Jouxholmin Road.
When the police arrived, the car was on fire.
The battalion found two men fit for emotion while hiding in a nearby hemisphere.
The other man was immediately arrested.
The other escaped, but the man was later found in the forest with the help of a police dog.
Men are suspected of theft, theft and gross damage of a motor vehicle.
The police thanked those who gave the clues.
Director of Research on Changes in Leadership in Russia: Clear Dismissal
In Russia, the highest-ranking change of leadership was made on Friday in the years when President Vladimir Putin expelled Sergei Ivanov, the head of his administration.
Ivanov's successor is 44-year-old Anton Vaino.
He is a former diplomat and served as Ivanovi's second man.
Kangaspuro says that the reason for Ivanov’s separation may be Putin’s desire to prevent the strong people around him from accumulating too much power.
He adds that recycling leadership tasks is one way of using power.
This is a way of preventing people from exercising power independently of the President.
It is also possible that Ivanov has been involved in or misled by other executives, according to the fabric trail.
Asemanpudotus Ivanoville
Ivanov, who belongs to Putin’s inner circle, is moving on to special tasks for the environment and transport.
With a tape presented by the state media, Putin said the change to a joint decision.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had asked to move to other positions and proposed Vaino in his place, Russia Today said.
Ivanovi’s point of view is that this is a clear misstatement.
Environmental and transport issues are not very high in the order of importance in Russia.
He notes that Ivanov has been one of the most important people on the summit of Russian power.
In addition, Ivanov has played an important role in the President’s Security Council.
Ivanov worked with Putin in the KGB during the Soviet Union.
He was considered a possible successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitri Medvedev was elected president.
Canvas strip notes that the old card, for example, governors, has been exchanged in Russia recently.
Senior researcher Katri Pynnöniemi of the Foreign Policy Institute says that more interesting than the heir to Ivanovi's place is that Putin is changing his neighborhood to younger.
ISIS fighters used civilians as human shields when retreating in Syria
They used civilians as human shields as they fled to the city of Jarabulus to prevent us from targeting them, said Sherfan Darwish, a representative of the Manbij military council.
According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, civilians were placed in hundreds of cars where they were taken to Jarabulus.
Last week, Arab and Kurdish fighters seized about 90 percent of the city of Manbij, which is important to ISIS.
It is estimated that dozens of jihadists remained in the city at the time.
Corrected from the previous news at 7:30 p.m.: Previously we mistakenly told that civilians were fleeing the city, actually ISIS fighters kidnapped civilians while fleeing the city.
Professor: The Ministry of the Interior's documentary publication is illegal
The Ministry of the Interior’s line of publicity of documents is illegal, says Professor Tomi Voutilainen of the University of Eastern Finland.
Voutilainen tells STT that the documentary publicity cannot be based on the authorities' own lineages, but it is based on the law.
In the past, the Ministry of the Interior refused to hand over the Minister’s list of attendees to Ilta-Sanom.
The Minister justified the decision with the guidance of the State Council’s chancellor and the fact that the information was included in the minister’s calendar and not in the accounting records.
The Head of Communications of the Ministry told the STT that there was a need for reform in the Ministry.
Usain Bolt's last Olympic show starts in Rio
As in the past few years, Bolt has been running against time.
He had to leave behind the Olympic Bears of Jamaica for the first time.
This hasn’t been the perfect preparation, but I’m in much better shape.
I've practiced well and that's the key," Bolt said at a press conference in Rio.
That press conference included low-dressed Saturday dancers and fan-made reporters.
Porina around Bolt underscores the fact that the Jamaican star has risen in an era when public sport has struggled with doping scandals and slippery interest.
Bolt's previous loss at the 2004 Olympics was in Athens, where he scored at the start of the 200 metres at a time of 21.05.
At the time, 17-year-old Bolt was a young promise that was slowed down by injuries and found your workout.
Four years later in Beijing, his reign began at 100 metres, with which he broke the world record and the confidence of his competitors in spite of the final celebration of 9.69.
This is more difficult.
A year later at the World Cup in Berlin, Bolt achieved his career at the legal point on the clock.
The world records born in Berlin at 9.58 m and 19.19 m are still in force.
In Rio, Bolt has announced that it is aiming for a 200-meter world record and a 19-second low, but no one believes it was born except Bolt himself.
The biggest challenger of the 100 Bolt is the Athens 2004 Olympic 100 winner Justin Gatlin.
Last year, in the Beijing World Cup final, Bolt defeated the American by just one hundredth of a second.
During his reign in Beijing, Bolt hasn’t lost in the finals of the championships once, if only he’s made his way.
In Daegu 2011, the 100th World Cup final was left out of Bolt due to a scam.
Bolt will be 30 in a week.
He's an old man in the young men's race, and the Rio races are his last Olympics.
Bolt has set the next year’s World Cup in London as the last line of his career.
These are the Olympics that separate me from the rest.
I'm older and it's harder.
But every time I’m under, I remind myself: this year I have to do it, Bolt said three months ago in an interview with Sports Illustrated.
Reveals of Rio: Two athletes suspected of doping
According to the Chinese state news agency Xinhua, 18-year-old Chinese lawyer Chen Xinyi has given a positive doping sample at the Rio Olympics.
Chinese investigator Chen Xinyi's doping sample found traces of illegal substances.
Bulgarian drinker Silvia Danekova is also suspected of doping.
In addition, a Kenyan general sports coach was passported home because he gave a doping sample for the athlete.
Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample with signs of epo-hormone.
She was ranked fourth in the women’s 100-metre butterfly race in Rio.
According to the Brazilian newspaper Estadao, a Chinese lawyer has brought his doping case to the International Sport Court of Appeal CAS.
Xinhua says a sample given by Xinyin on Sunday had found signs of a diuretic called hydrochlorothiazide.
There are other doping suspects in Rio.
The BBC reported that Bulgarian women’s boxer Silvia Danekova has given a doping sample with signs of epo-hormone.
Kenya has moved from Rio to the home of a sports coach due to a doping strike.
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) said on Thursday that the Kenyan coach had been tested as an athlete and had given a doping sample for it.
According to media reports, this is Kenyan high-speed coach John Anzrah.
According to the Daily Mail, he used Ferguson Rotich's 800-metre race pass in the situation.
Nothing stops Phelps - historical gold came to the screen style
The most successful athlete in Olympic history, American Michael Phelps, swims in a 200-metre mix in his 22nd Olympic victory in Rio.
Michael Phelps has already won 22 Olympic gold medals.
At the same time, Phelps was the first swimmer to achieve the same kind of Olympic gold in four consecutive races.
Phelps' win time was 1.54.66.
Japan's Kosuke Hagino was second in the mix before China's Wang Shun.
I'm just trying to have a little fun, BBC Olympic commentator Helen Skelton laughs at Ittalhehde's quick interview.
The story of Helen Skelton on Monday is the most read this week on the website of Ittalehde.
Next up is Rebecca Adlington.
Skelton doesn't feel much stressed if there's a little bit of a glimpse of his revealing and special habits in the Somme or the British press.
TV is a visual medium, he stresses.
Skelton has worn high-heeled shoes and a short-sleeved dress that certainly has at least enough disclosure – at least for many conservative British fans.
However, rear steps are not allowed.
It's important to look good, and small judgments are just a funny thing.
Skelton certainly wants to play and perhaps abuse, but he stresses that he doesn’t want to be in the lead role.
It’s not about me, he says.
We're watching sports here, and the focus needs to be on athletes.
It shouldn't matter as much as I'm dressed.
Can you imagine that the slope has gone up to Finland?
I can't, but all that focuses on how hard these swimmers do their jobs and how big the sacrifices they make is okay for me, Skelton whispered.
You know what?
It is rather empty when it comes to (the seller) dressing.
I'm a little curious if this has hit someone.
Police in Rio de Janeiro arrested two people on suspicion of terrorism
Rio's police said on Thursday it had arrested two people on suspicion of terrorism.
The police made arrests in connection with the safety surveillance of the contests.
At the same time, the police made five other arrests and interrogated two people before they were released.
All the suspects were Brazilian.
According to the G1 news site, the detainees for terrorism are part of the same group that the police had already detained in July.
The detainees are believed to have connections with ISIS.
The detainees were known to have lit up violence on social media.
Inviting messages of violence were circulated, among other things, on the popular WhatsApp service.
85,000 police officers are responsible for the safety of Rio.
Police detonated a suspected package in Rio
Spain and Nigeria had to start their first round of the Rio basketball tournament in an empty court on Thursday.
Police found a suspicious package in the basketball court and closed the place to the public.
The police allowed the public to enter after the package had exploded in a controlled manner.
This was the third time during the Rio Olympics that police had carried out a controlled explosive mission.
Police closed the arena because of a suspicious package found there.
The crowd came in after the police had controlledly exploded the package.
The audience did not predict the show by the start of the match, as the police closed the arena due to a suspicious package found in the castle.
The police exploded the packet and reached the public hall only after that.
The bag aroused the race to the Spanish team, which had started in a dream.
With two losses, Spain won Nigeria 96-87.
In the previous two competitions, Spain won silver.
The police carried out a controlled explosive mission for the third time during the Rio summer wars.
Last Saturday, police were forced to detonate a suspected discovery near the scene of road cycling.
Spain and Nigeria began their first round of the Rio basketball tournament in front of the empty spectators.
Argentine lady chuckles Petejja-Sireni - Finnish thought protest
Wind Petäjä-Sireni had a colorful race day in Rio.
The wind of Petäjä-Siren was hard on Thursday.
An Argentine lady kicked off the wind of Petejja-Sireni on Thursday in Rio at the opening day of the women's surfing day.
The wind was clearly violated.
The opponent admitted the breach.
He was left behind because of the collision, and others fled, Finnish head coach Joakim Wilenius told reporters.
The athlete was thinking about protesting for a long time.
It was not worth doing, because it would have been futile according to the Olympic rules.
I should have fallen into the water in order to get a refund, Mr. Siren said.
The Finnish was on board until the last time, because he did not want to get into the dirty waters of Rio.
The Finnish left with the collar when he left for 27th place.
In total, the London 2012 Olympic silver medalist is eighth.
The collision in relation to the particles did not affect much.
Friday is an important day when there are race departures from 10-12.
Modified 0.39: Unlike the first information, Petäjä-Siren did not protest.
7 Special Things That Extend Life According to Science
Science has explored everything possible between the earth and the sky.
These things have been proven to bring additional years into a person’s life.
Some things are ways that directly or indirectly affect a person’s health in such a way that his or her life is prolonged.
Sometimes things that a person can’t influence themselves can bring him extra years.
Such are, among other things, the tendency to medium-term obesity or social status.
Regular shopping can prolong your lifespan.
You don't always have to crush it - just picking up a milkshake is enough.
The secret of longevity has been explored through a number of different studies.
The Medical Daily presents seven of the strangest research results.
According to science, all of these things could lead to more years of life.
Drinking beer and coffee
Coffee has been found to protect against some cancers, type 2 diabetes, and Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease.
A Harvard University study found that moderate coffee consumption is associated with a “decreased risk of death,” especially with regard to neurological or cardiac diseases.
Alcohol research suggests that one to three daily doses of alcohol can prolong lifespans.
For example, one found that wine drinkers lived older than people who did not drink at all.
Regular use of toothpaste can extend a person’s life by up to six years, according to one study.
The argument is based on the fact that this prevents pneumonia.
They can contribute to the outbreak of other diseases elsewhere in the human body.
A study in Norway found out how laughter has affected a person’s life.
The project, which lasted seven years, was attended by more than 54,000 people.
Those who laughed more were 35% more likely to survive the test after the trial.
Sex, where protection from sexual intercourse has been taken into account, is, according to many studies, good for health.
In addition to everything, it can also prolong life.
Unfortunately, just having sex as such is not enough.
In order for a person to have additional years in his life, he must also have an orgasm.
There will be more years of mobility, there will be no denying it.
Achieving a long life, however, does not require absolute stamina.
In fact, a study by the University of Oxford found that women with a large back side had lower cholesterol levels.
They also had more omega-3 fatty acids in their body.
The same study combined these factors with lower mortality.
Whether it was an Olympic medalist who became an athlete or an Oscar-winning actor, he is more likely to live longer than a regular poodle.
A lot of research has tried to find the cause of this phenomenon.
One explanation might be that an ambitious person is likely to live in a way that brings his life to years.
Some researchers suspect that long life is the result of a person’s social status – which, in turn, enables, for example, the pursuit of recognition such as the Nobel Prize.
A study of shopping behaviors for over 65-year-olds found that a person who shops daily is less likely to be a parent who shops.
This is because spinning in specific trades reduces loneliness.
It has once again been found to trigger biological mechanisms that can prematurely kill.
So count the credit card off your hand - online shopping games will therefore not have the same effect.
A steering wheelbase spilled into a truck
Varsinais-Suomen Koske on Friday night, a serious truck and passenger car crashed.
The accident took place in Koskela, between the contacts and Sorvastonia on Friday at 9 p.m.
The truck had been driving in the direction of Forssa, when the passenger car had been driven on the same track, hitting the truck at the right angle.
After the collision, the truck remained upright on its ribbon, but burned.
The driver managed to extinguish the fire himself.
The passenger car was sitting in the hallway and then across the hallway to the roof.
A woman who was born in 1972, who was driving a passenger car, was put under compression in her car.
The rescue agency removed the injured driver from the car, and he was transported to the main hospital of the University of Turu.
The result of the woman's breath test was 2.02 promille.
He's suspected of drunken driving.
The postman sent the landfills to the wrong city.
K-CityMarket’s sewerage range was flawed because the mail had accidentally delivered some of the cargo to the Wall.
Teija Haltia, who lives in Pernion, was on Thursday shopping for dishes from Salon K-Citymarket when a fun cold hit her eyes.
Unfortunately, there are product shortcomings in the debris because Posti delivered our cargo to the Wall!
We'll get more when the Post gets the delivered cargo!
If you don’t have a lawn mower, read it in the field.
The success of the dealer is due to the fact that Posti expanded its services last spring to include lawn mowers.
The lawn mower is available at Post until the end of August.
Haltia thought the show was mostly interesting and he decided to share it on social media.
The popularity of the update hit me in a whirlwind.
Media representatives have been calling all the time, and the attention raised to this is incredible, Haltia wonders.
On Friday night, Haltia’s update had more than 700 shares on Facebook.
Haltia got her own favorite shoveled in a waste bag, even though a few plates were empty.
Mr Jaakko Kaidesoji, responsible for the business of Transportation Services at the Post Office, apologized for the damage done to Itta-Sanom.
The background is that three of the five stages were mistaken yesterday in the wrong place (Seinääjoki) and we no longer went to make a partial delivery (Saloon) by three, but we only took five stages today, Kaidesoja told Itta-Sanom.
He was the first to report on the evening.
Teija Haltia was not upset by the rice, because she found all of her favorites from the selection.

Lotta Backlund has lost dozens of pounds as a result of a life change.
Lotta shared a photo of her change on Instagram on Friday.
In the spring, Lotta was on the bumpers and your star was a normal weight.
Lutta Backlund in 2014.
Comedian, TV producer Lotta Backlund began her weight loss cycle in 2009.
She is a complete lifestyle change and she lost a little quietly thirty pounds.
On Friday, Backlund posted his amazing performance on Instagram.
The picture shows how much Lotta has changed over the years in her appearance.
The Backlund before and after pair has collected several thank-you comments from interchangers.
You're great.
We are on the same path, motivation hard! one shines.
Piia Koriseva, Lotta Backlund and Mikael Saarinen were involved in the project Let's Do It Now.
I get a lot of power and excitement from your pictures while the sky itself is on the same path, the other tells me.
In the spring, Lotta dropped her last pounds. Let's do it now.
At that time, he told Ittelhehde that he wanted to finally get to a normal weight, which was then a 10-pound journey.
Over the course of three months of exercise, the pounds finally fell by five.
Family Wishes of Woman Murdered in Loviisa: Victim's Memory for Police Dogs
The 42-year-old woman’s family, who was murdered in Loviisa a week ago, hopes that the victims will be remembered instead of flowers and addresses with a donation to police dogs.
The Sipoo Veterinary Office has released a Facebook update, in which it conveys the victim’s family’s wishes for donations to police dogs.
The publication says that the victim had worked at the Sipoo Veterinary Station as a substitute and had also carried out her nursing training there.
The veterinarian reminds me of a woman with words that touch her.
Pleasant, smart, humorous and working fearless.
A good friend.
We still can't fully understand that he's gone.
The Facebook update includes an account number where donations can be transferred.
The update mentions that the donation funds in their entirety go to police officers, primarily for the procurement of security guards.
Last Friday, a 42-year-old Loviisa woman was murdered in her own home in Loviisa Koskenkyle.
The woman's neighbors have said that the victim was a very animal lover.
He owned a number of animals, including horses, dogs, cats, chickens and flowers.
The 27-year-old suspect did not know the woman and they had no connection with each other.
The killer was accompanied by a police dog named Börje, who was wounded in a life-threatening detention situation.
However, the startle survived and is recovering.
The District Court sentenced Post for violation of the Equality Act
The Post did not have the right to retain the salary of an employee who refused to familiarise the tenant, the district court assessed in its judgment.
The County Court obliged Post to pay the employee the majority of the detained salary and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2,000 in compensation for discrimination.
According to the verdict, Post could have detained only a part of the family prosecutor's salary, which was responsible for the part of the whole day's work.
According to the district court, the employee was placed in a disadvantaged position on the basis of his trade union activities, contrary to the Equality Act.
The employee had adhered to the Union for Postal and Logistics on the organisational decision of the PAU on the ban on familiarisation.
In November last year, during a postage stamp, the PAU decided that the Post employees were not aware of the strike against rented workers.
It was first reported by the People's News.
Turkey's return to respect for human rights
Turkey must return to the path of democratic development and respect for human rights, writes Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Central) and Foreign Minister Timo Soini (P.S.) in his response to the Journalist Union.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (central) and Foreign Minister Timo Soini (ps) agree on the human rights situation in Turkey.
In a letter earlier, the Federation of Journalists asked Cipilä and Sonia to express their concern for Turkey’s freedom of speech and press.
Sipilä and Soini repeatedly point out to Turkey the importance of freedom of the press and of expression.
Putin Separates Chief of Administration - Replace the Estonian-backed Vaino
Russian President Vladimir Putin has resigned President Sergei Ivanov, the Kremlin said.
Anton Vaino, the grandson of the Soviet-Estonian Communist leader Karl Vaino, will be replaced.
Vaino is a 44-year-old former diplomat who has served as deputy head of the presidential administration since 2012.
He will also be a member of the Russian Security Council, according to the Interfax news agency.
Vladimir Putin fired his administration’s chief.
According to the Kremlin, Ivanov, a member of Putin’s close circle, is moving on to special tasks for the environment and transport.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had asked to move to other positions and proposed Vanoa to replace him, Russia Today said.
Ivanov worked with Putin during the Soviet Union in the KGB espionage.
Many considered Ivanovi to be Putin's successor in 2008, but Dmitri Medvedev was elected president.
Ivanov was appointed to office in 2011 before Putin was re-elected president in 2012.
BBC: ManU's massive acquisition for game ban - not seen at the opening of the Champions League
The world record player of football transfers will not be seen on the field when the England Cup is kicked off at the end of the weekend.
Paul Pogbang's career was followed by England.
Manchester United's leftover acquisition, Paul Pogba, will be on ManU's side due to a game ban opening his league season against Bournemouth on Sunday, the BBC said on Friday.
ManU paid <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>105 million from Pogba to the Italian company Juventus.
However, the English football association FA keeps him out of the game, as Pogba has been banned from Juventus.
He received two warnings in last season’s Italian Cup, and it becomes a one-match game ban.
The ban was transferred to England, the FA told the BBC.
Pogba's next match will be in the league's second round on August 19, where ManU will face Southampton.
In Flow, greatness is good.
The precise criteria and ambitious visions of entertainment have consolidated the Flow Festival’s status as an internationally recognized event, marked by the world’s top artists.
The Flow Festival starts Friday in Helsinki.
Festival visitors have typically expressed themselves in self-described dresses.
One of the main characters this year is punk legend Iggy Pop.
The Flow Festival’s event area is decorated with artwork and art installations, among others.
It has never been enough for us to have only a masterpiece and a tent, says artistic director of the event Tuomas Kallio.
The Flow Festival in Helsinki’s Suvilah this weekend has grown from a small card life festival to an event of tens of thousands of visitors.
In the background of success, there is a simple question: what kind of event would the perpetrators themselves want to go to?
It’s a bit different in the event productions to think like this.
Often the goal is to achieve the level of necessity and to act in accordance with the regulations of the authorities, says artistic director of the event Tuomas Kallio.
He knew a week before the event that Flow would be sold out again this year.
The goal has been to increase the number of visitors to 70,000 by 5,000 last year.
This year, the festival will be attended by a number of interesting domestic and foreign artists.
The increase in the number of visitors is a good thing, because it has to be financed in some way.
On the other hand, we don’t want to grow too much, because at some point the mass would be like a herd of cattle, guided by huge roads.
That's not what we want.
The ideology of the successful event has been refined over the course of 13 years, with 130 performers, art installations, as well as numerous restaurants and drink bars in the part of the area.
In addition to the main table and the smaller showcases, this year a tent of 15,000 people will operate as a venue.
Kallio admits that the event could be carried out more simply.
Maybe I'm a little big, but at the same time, we've been able to keep Flow alive.
If you lose it, it's not our business anymore.
The greatest joy and reward for Kallio’s work is that today even big visions are practically possible.
In the early years of the event, in the mid-2000s, the activity was highly dependent on the support of the city of Helsinki of around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>20,000.
Last year, Flow had a turnover of around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>6 million.
It can lead to "circumstances" such as the construction of a 73-meter-wide tent.
Visitors to Flow have typically expressed themselves in self-described dresses.
Alongside the music event, we can talk about a community of trendy young adults.
However, the event has not been consciously profiled as particularly fashionable.
First and foremost, we want to stand out in content.
Yet fashion phenomena also fit Flow’s value world: curiosity and a desire to interact with the environment, says Kallio.
This year, one of the main characters is a punk legend, 69-year-old Iggy Pop.
The man has a huge crowd of fans in his own genre, but he doesn’t have indie rock, pop music, rap and soul combining festivals, he has the most typical performances.
According to Kallio, Iggy was booked because this is probably the last time she will be seen in Finland.
We are all interested in history and the future.
Not just what is being played on the commercial radio.
Iggy's last album is damn good, and he's been doing damn good plays in the last few years.
Thailand's tourist parade bombs were hidden in bouquets - tourists fled in terror
Two bombs exploded in Hua Hin on Thursday night.
At times, at least one local woman died and over 20 were injured.
The bombs were apparently hidden in a flower basket and exploded with cell phones.
The bombs were placed on the street, most of whose customers are foreigners.
They were exploded at the same time as tourists started leaving bars and returning to their hotels, police spokesman Samoer Yoosumran told CNN.
Edwin Wiek, a wildlife conservationist living in Asia, tweeted a high-speed picture of the attacks in 1989.
If the tweet doesn’t look good, you can watch it here.
At least 11 of the injured in Hua Hin were foreign tourists.
The crowd ran up against me and said the bomb exploded at the bars.
It happened in one of the biggest barricades, Swedish tourist Emelie Olsson told Aftonbladett.
The next morning local time exploded two bombs in Surat Than.
At least one died.
The number of wounded is not yet known.
Shortly thereafter, two bombs exploded on the island of Phuket, also favored by the Finns.
I don't think anyone's dead.
At the same time, another double bombing was carried out in Hua Hin.
At least one died and three were injured.
A bomb exploded in the city of Trang.
Police said they had found at least one bomb in Hua Hin that had not yet been able to explode.
According to the Thai authorities, there are likely rebel forces behind the bombings that are not satisfied with the actions of the Thai military leadership.
According to local authorities, there may also be criminal organizations involved.
According to Aftonbladet, police have recently been harassed by human trafficking organizations.
KSML: This part of the new armour will go to battle in a war situation first
In the acute war situation, troops are ordered to combat missions only after several months of sworn military ceasefire, says Central Finland.
According to Jukka Sonnisen, the head of training of the Defence Forces interviewed by the newspaper, for example, of the military personnel serving for 5.5 months in a war situation, only those who are at the end of their training are eligible for combat.
According to the head of training, the service is first assigned to the reserves belonging to the preparedness teams.
There is no command from a battalion or reserve to a mission that has not received the required training, Sonninen says.
Earlier in the summer it was revealed that the Defence Forces will begin training men in units of immediate readiness from next year.
Units can be used in military operations as required already during the training of the military.
Pamela Tola received gigantic compensation from homestay
Actress Pamela Tola and her ex-husband, CEO Pauli Waroma, have won a tough dispute over the apartment they bought from Espoo in 2009.
The retail price of the two-layer separate list was EUR 330 000.
After the trade, however, a serious moisture problem was revealed in the house, which caused a health-threatening microbial plant.
The couple was forced to sell the apartment in 2014.
The sales price had fallen to EUR 132,000, so the financial loss to Tola and Waroma amounted to EUR 198,000.
The couple took the matter to court and demanded a price reduction from the seller.
The seller denied the claim, but Tola and Waroma won the case in both court and court courts.
The court ruled the case on Wednesday.
It maintained a district court ruling ordering the seller to pay Tola and Waroma EUR 150,000 for the price reduction.
In addition, the seller will have to reimburse the costs of litigation and settlement of the couple for a total of EUR 47,344.
The court reasoned the price reduction a bit, because some of the repair needs of the apartment had already been known to buyers at the time of making the home purchase.
However, according to the Court of Justice, the apparent construction errors were substantially more serious than what was presented.
Tola looking for a good home
Tola told the court that the couple had specifically searched for well-established homes because they did not want to take up repairs.
He had the idea that the building was renovated and in good condition, and that the factors mentioned in the conditional inspection report were not affected.
The conditional inspection report referred to risk and inadequacy of ventilation and the inadequacy of rain and melting water management along the rocky surface.
However, on the basis of the discussions, it did not appear that this was a matter of any urgency.
Tola and Waroma agreed that the rainwater coming from the rock should perhaps be guided a bit in a few years’ time.
Trades were made in October 2009.
Within a few years, it turned out that the moisture problems in the apartment were likely to be much more serious.
Inspections carried out in 2012 and 2013 found a microbial plantation in the building, which, according to witnesses, resulted from both the rock’s rainwater and the capillary rise in the soil.
The air contaminated by microbes on the west side of the house, according to the inspector, could also reach the interiors through the debris.
A possible risk to health, exceeding the limits, was found in the sweeping samples of the home care room, the cellar staircase, the windows of the living room and the laundry room.
Terraces were built without permission
The court also disputed whether the apartment was expanded against the building permit.
The court considered that Tola and Waroma were not aware of the city of Espoo’s decision that the apartment had been changed against the permit before trading.
Among other things, the terraces were built, although there were no proper permits yet.
However, home problems were a key issue in the courtroom.
According to the court, on the basis of the information received from the seller before the transaction, the buyers could assume that the building was suitable for housing as such and that there was no need for major repairs in the near future.
Tola and Waroma did not consider the Court of Justice to have any particular reason to carry out a larger inspection than usual.
Purchasers have not neglected their securities obligation, the court states in its judgment.
Hundreds of thousands of women wanted to have children for the Nazis - in the register also the Finnish
Reporter Christopher Andersson writes in a recent Dagens Nyheter article that the National Archives of Maryland, U.S.A., has recorded documents on microfilms for a total of 218,500 women, all wanting to marry SS men.
Most of the women are German, but there are also Americans, French, Dutch and Russian.
At least 65 Danes, 86 Norwegians, 14 Finns and 31 Swedish women were also wanted as Nazi memorials.
Documents and registration cards are from a breeding agency operating in Nazi Germany.
The Rotuvirasto operated under the authority of SS Director Heinrich Himmler.
No SS man was allowed to have children in Nazi Germany until he was examined by an SS doctor.
The same applies even more to women who had to be able to give birth to more than 10 children.
According to Andersson, gynecological studies were performed on women to clarify the matter.
The Rotuvirasto examined women’s backgrounds by studying church books, among others.
The purpose was to ensure that there were no Jews in the family.
Women also had to be prepared to give up their Swedish citizenship and give the breeding agency handwritten resumes as well as good recommendations from loved ones.
The breeding agency wanted assurances that women were "children's", "savings" and "good national socialists" who knew very well German.
Women who did not meet the requirements were not accepted as SS men's brides.
The story does not tell us what happened to the 14 Finnish women found in the archives.
SS leaders created a state-sponsored program, known as Lebensborn, in 1936.
The programme, among other things, stipulated that every SS man should have four children, either in marriage or outside it.
The Lebensborn households take care of children born outside of marriage and their mothers.
However, the program was not very actively promoted, according to the pages of the American Holocaust Museum.
Instead, the Nazi population policy focused on family and marriage.
The state encouraged marriage by providing loans and support for children.
The honorary crown of the German mother was awarded to women who had given birth to at least four children.
In Nazi Germany, marriages between "Aryans" and "non-Aryans" were prohibited by law, according to the museum's pages.
Sixth of the Pirate Sir, Nirkko rose and fell
Tapio Nirkko was ranked third in the first departure on the day of the Finnjolli sailing at the Olympics in Rio, but left the whole crowd on the second departure of the day.
Nirkko rose to eighth overall after five departures, but the failure of the second departure dropped him to 14th place.
Wind Petäjä-Siren fought 17th and 3rd in RS:X-Class departures.
In total, Petäjä-Siren is sixth.
In the 470s, Joonas and Niklas Lindgren placed 23rd in the opening run of the day.
In total, Lindgren is 19th.
Jari Sillanpää Satulinna was recorded a couple of hours at night: "I was so bored"
Jari Sillanpää has been one of the favourite Finnish artists for over 20 years.
Sillanpää, who became Finland’s best-selling solo artist and the star of dancers and festivals from the cruise ship’s bar to the tango of 1995, is able to continue to grow and is currently in a rough upturn.
The book, written by Mari Koppisen, about the life of the favorite singer Jari Sillanpää - Paljaana, was published on Thursday.
In the book Sillanpää tells of his life and career in both good and bad.
Bridgehead's career rose to a real ascent when he won the tango crown at the Tango Market of Seinäjoen in 1995.
Sillanpää sang tangos in the cat, but he had already designed a little different music for himself at the time.
In the spring of 1995, Jukka Kuoppamäki had composed a tango piece on behalf of Sillanpää, which Kassu Halonen adapted to a slightly different form.
Satulinna became one of the most popular pieces in Finnish music history.
The book tells us that the song did not go exactly as planned: Sillanpää sang on the tape in a terrible crapule and only a few hours after the night’s sleep.
We had a party tonight.
I was so pissed!
The head of the bridge remembers in the book.
A huge hit from the collection of a hit song would not immediately be thought to have been sung in crappy.
Although I wasn’t physically at my best, the track was still good.
I’ve learned that I don’t always have to demand perfection and excellence.
Another incident related to the man’s most popular tracks, which is told in the book, occurred almost twenty years later.
In 2013, Sillanpää divorced from her partner at the time, and the event ended with the lyrics of You earn gold, which were released as a single in 2014.
The book tells us that the words of the song ordered by Saara Törmäss were not the kind of song that Sillankopf would have liked.
Bridgehead had imagined himself making a record telling the true story of his own life, but the words of the differential song were not true, but it was written based on the news of the 7 Days magazine.
Jari's divorce from his ex-girlfriend was reported in the newspaper's news about Jari's excessive celebration and alcohol consumption, but Jari said it was full of puppets and did not hold true.
According to the book, Jari played in his anger with the record company and refused to sing the song, but eventually ended up singing it - and good so.
In June, the British surprised themselves by voting their kingdom out of the EU.
Eventually, 52% of voters voted for the difference and 48% would have remained in the Union, even though polls in voting week predicted the opposite result.
British economists and economic institutions were almost unanimous in their position to remain in the EU.
No prestigious research institute or university voted for the distinction, even though a couple of individual researchers were allowed to disagree with the vast flow of their professions.
The theme house of former U.S. President Bill Clinton’s recent election campaign, “It’s the economy, stupid” flew into the rubble during the British Brexit vote.
The economists were shocked when their voice was not heard.
They were shocked when the economy did not seem to be the most important thing in politics.
Category: Economical language
The Centre for Macroeconomics, in its latest monthly survey, has tightened its professional responses to the Brexit disaster.
The most typical answer is that economists were not heard because this time voters made a decision on non-economic grounds.
One explanation for economists’ loss of economic status is that people don’t understand the economy.
Many still have the idea that the number of jobs is independent of the number of people employed, i.e. almost constant.
If an immigrant gets a job, it's from the UK.
Many also have the idea that declining the value of the currency would be a good thing because it promotes the export industry.
According to economists, voters did not believe in economic arguments because the consensus of economists did not come up enough.
They were particularly haunted by the equality of the BBC, which gave just as much room to economists who represent only a few percent of the economics of the EU as to the overwhelming majority.
The EU-hostile press was not interested in telling what IFS, IFM, BoE, CEPR and LSE and other economic capacities combinations would think of the consequences of the difference.
Those remote combinations of letters spoke face-to-face about economic growth, trade relations, public debt and currency.
And if the messages of economists were both heard and understood, then they were not conveyed, because economists represent an elite with whom the voters do not think they have any common interests.
Academics in big cities like economists would have stayed in the EU, but in small cities and in rural areas the message did not work.
Immigration is an economy
The overwhelming victory argument of the Brexit vote was about immigration.
An immigrant takes your job, an immigrant pushes your hospital, an immigrant takes advantage of you.
These arguments slipped.
In every cafe there are foreign employees.
How much more jobs would there be in the UK if they left?
In the waiting room of each health centre, there are immigrants.
How much easier would it be for the British to get medical appointments if they didn’t?
In every school, there are children of immigrants.
How much easier would the right British children get a place of school if they were rid of them?
In every city there are foreigners.
How much more space would there be indigenous peoples if they disappeared?
In my opinion, these are economic issues.
They relate to jobs, housing and public services.
However, economists did not succeed in responding to them, and if they succeeded, their answers did not get visibility.
Economists have failed to explain that, thanks to immigrants, the UK has more jobs, fewer health centres and more money for education and social security.
Immigrants - and especially EU immigrants - are the net payers of the UK's public finances and their consumption creates jobs.
Aberdeen Real Estate Fund Prepares for Brexit Cash
One of the funds was Aberdeen Asset Management, which is responsible for real estate investments by Finnish Pertti Vanhanen.
He said that Aberdeen was prepared in time for Brexit by drawing up plans A and B.
Plan B, or EU-wide dividend camp, began to be prepared more precisely a few weeks before the vote in the event that the result would be a leave.
The concern was that investors would start withdrawing their funds from the market.
Real estate funds usually do not have a large amount of liquidity, but now they may be needed.
We went to raise cash.
When Brexit took place on the 23rd, we had 25 percent of the fund’s investments in cash or liquidity, Vanhanen says of Aberdeen’s only open-ended property fund on a day-to-day basis.
According to the old, the normal level would be 15-20%.
The fund was worth <0xC2><0xA3>3.5 billion at the time.
The total value of the company’s funds is about <0xC2><0xA3>20 billion.
It was the highest number in nine open real estate funds, Vanhanen says of all UK real estate funds open real estate funds.
He estimates that the lowest amount of cash in these funds remained at ten percent or even below.
The Real Estate Funds are therefore prepared for Brexit with very different strategies.
The Funds Closed the Trade
When the EU-winning camp won, Europe became confused.
However, the few weeks that followed the vote in the real estate market were quite calm, Vanhanen says.
There were two things that changed the situation.
The first was the speech by Mark Carney, the CEO of the Bank of England, in which he assessed that Brexit could pose a high risk to commercial real estate operators.
In addition, the first of the real estate funds, Standard Life, froze its trading.
These together plundered the situation and raised the matter to the headlines of the Financial Times and the BBC.
The situation was immediately compared in 2007 and 2008, says Vanhanen.
This made the investors nervous.
Institutional investors remained quieter, but private investors were nervous.
The snowball started to roll, and the foundation had to close its doors one after the other.
The situation in Aberdeen was good because of the cash accumulated, but it also had to finally freeze its trading for six days.
According to the old, they did not actually close trade, but changed prices down.
In practice, he said, investors were given time to consider whether it would be worthwhile to pull out the money in panic.
Aberdeen's message was that if you don't have to take your money out now, it's not worth it, because it would cause losses.
It calmed the situation, and most cancelled the announcement.
Since then it has been quite flat, and now the market has been a couple of weeks very calm, the old says.
He notes that, for example, the Aberdeen Continental European Funds have not had any similar meltdowns.
There were a lot of questions, however.
Unreasonable attention to real estate funds
According to the old, the closures of the trades of real estate funds have received a disproportionate amount of attention.
The open funds covered by the closures control about four per cent of Britain’s property.
The Aberdeen shutdown lasted six days, and the company sold out less than ten of its 80 properties in London.
Some of the other funds are still closed.
Aviva Investors warned its investors this week that it might hold its funds in the middle of 2017.
At the moment, there is uncertainty in the air, and economic growth forecasts have been downwards, but the situation does not appear to be "more pronounced" for Aberdeen.
The main issues now concern the future development of the British public economy.
Despite the uncertainty, the situation has given some real estate investors even new opportunities, notes Vanhanen.
The Punjab and the dollar rate is at its lowest for 30 years, plus the market has a 15% discount on sales compared to the time before the Brexit vote.
The dollar buyer can now buy the same property up to 30% cheaper.
There are a lot of buyers, the old man says.
Brexit Brings Mines to London Real Estate Market
At two o’clock in the morning, the situation didn’t seem very different.
But at four o’clock, when Pertti Vanhanen, the real estate investment manager of the British real estate fund Aberdeen Asset Management, woke up again to look at the results of the Brexit vote, the situation was different.
That's what you got.
I realized that this is now going to plan B, says Vanhanen in his second home in Helsinki.
He went to work right away.
London City was already fully alive in spite of the morning.
The TV channels normally set to be silent in the office gave the news back, and usually the loud crowd was completely silent to listen when Prime Minister David Cameron stepped in front of the camera in the morning to report his departure.
When the market opened, the display ends flashed just red.
It was a morning that you would never have believed to live, says the old man.
It is not because, in spite of the mist, Aberdeen, one of Britain’s largest real estate funds, completed two real estate trades on the day after the Brexit vote.
The feeling was confusing.
However, the company was well prepared for the alternative, and therefore the situation was somewhat calm, says Vanhanen.
Brexit Vote Starts Correctional Movement
The vote was followed by a storm.
The point collapsed, the British leadership switched.
The markets began to anticipate sharp declines in the real estate market in Britain and in particular in London.
London’s offices were projected to fall by as much as 20% in the coming years.
Soon a number of British real estate funds began to freeze their trades one after the other.
Aberdeen did that for six days.
Now the ants have fallen, but in the air still there is uncertainty.
However, it does not appear to be the last summer holidays this week in the face of the Old Man who spent in Helsinki.
It is still too early to say much about what will happen to Brexit.
So much is still open: how the difference is happening and how Scotland reacts to the situation, for example.
The developments in the London real estate market have already been identified.
The CBRE data on price developments of the real estate service company covers about a third of the market.
According to them, the prices of all properties in London fell by 3.3% from June to July.
In London’s City office buildings, the minus increased by 6.1 per cent, according to Vanhanen.
The numbers aren't so terrible, but they're monthly changes.
Monthly indexes began to be published in 1987, and in just five months there have been worse figures, Vanhanen says.
All equally significant drops occurred in the years of crisis 2007 and 2008.
Interestingly enough, Brexit was quickly compared to the collapse of Lehman and the global economic crisis that began from the US real estate market.
The old man thinks that the comparison is not exactly right, because it is now a British domestic crisis.
There's another feeling.
The real estate market has now seen no such panic sales at the time, but a willingness to sell to improve liquidity, says Vanhanen.
Funding is also normal.
Corrections could have been ahead in any case.
In fact, the price adjustment movement is not a miracle for him - it could have been that way without Brexit.
According to Aberdeen, the prices of properties in London and other major cities in the world have been too high for years.
We have been saying for two years that City and especially the offices are overpriced, says Vanhanen.
The loss started at a very high level.
London's prices have been upwards for four reasons, the Old List.
The British economy has grown sharply, the population of London as well.
Another major trend is that real estate is the last class of ownership that is globalizing, says Olden.
New players have emerged from the Middle East and Asia, and more and more institutions and private investors are looking for real estate investment destinations abroad.
London is known for its easy destination.
In addition, prices have been fuelled by a low interest rate, which is why, for example, pension companies have had to search for income from new items.
Loan on this has been readily available - although debt relief has now been used significantly less than during the boom before the 2008 crisis.
Decentralize, decentralize
In London, the price rise was equal to last summer, says Vanhanen.
Aberdeen started to lighten his assets in London, and was a net seller last year.
There was some kind of reversal to be expected, and now it has come.
What's next?
It depends on how the British economy evolves, the old says.
He doesn't dare to estimate the future, but he says that there's hardly any climbing peak.
Sensation indicates that there is a downward or steady passage ahead.
The old man has already seen several moves up and down, as he has been in the real estate industry since 1988.
And he's still an optimist who believes that the cup will be solved by work.
If you are well prepared for the risks, you are in a better position.
He believes in global decentralization.
If you have invested in a single market, there are too many victims.
If it is decentralized, the risks are also decentralized, says the Old Man.
S-Group starts registering purchase information more accurately than before
The S-Group knows what you’re eating, as my business group has announced today that it’s starting to collect more detailed information about its customers’ purchases.
Once the final amount of the receipt has been collected so far, the group will start searching for the products purchased at the beginning of May.
The S-Group will follow Kesko here, because the information on the goods purchased with the plus card has been collected in the Kesko customer register for a couple of years.
According to Ismo Riitala, CEO of K-Plus Oy, the feedback received from the program has been mainly positive.
Product-specific information is collected with the consent of the customer and used for marketing purposes.
The most effective channel is email.
Very few customers have refused to use product information, Riitala tells Taloussanom.
According to him, Kesko will not react to the S-Group registration change.
Kesko already categorizes its customers according to the simple food purchases into ten groups.
The rating is updated monthly.
Customers are also classified according to the number of purchases and the amount of money spent on them.
The data is used for targeted marketing to the customer.
Product-specific purchase information is collected only from the K-Group's own chains.
Partners such as Neste Oil do not disclose their information.
Lidl Finland has no customer support program and does not have any plans for this item.
The Finnish Neighborhood has its own First-Bonus customer program, which can be joined in the Selection Houses, Siwos and Euromarkets.
We do not currently collect information about product or product category levels, we will remain at the final amount of the receipt.
So we know where the purchases were made in the store and the day and the final amount of the customer receipt.
We have not gone to the same level as the K-group or the S-group,” says commercial director Anu Ora.
According to him, the customer support programme is to be further reformed, but Neighborhood Trade will tell you about it later.
Ora, however, does not allow the registration of product information.
Initially the experiment
So far, SOK’s customer and customer register has been relatively extensive.
In addition to personal and address information, the basic information included the profession, education, form of residence, and the years of birth of children and previous personal information.
Individuals belonging to the same economy and their role are also registered.
The date and time of purchase, the place, the final amount of purchases and the payment method are stored on the S-Etucard purchase.
In addition, information from S-bonus partners has been obtained from their cashier systems.
From the beginning of May, product-level purchase data will begin to be deposited in Sokos and Emotion chains.
Instead, in S-markets, Prisms, Home Terriers and ABC chains, data is recorded at product category level for the time being.
For a long time, customers have been hoping that marketing could be targeted more closely, says Marjaana Saarikoski, Head of Customer Ownership and Partnership at SOK.
The S-Group says it will inform its customers about the change.
These may prohibit the use of product-specific information for marketing purposes.
However, the data is stored in the cash register anyway, whether you want it or not.
You can check your stored information on the S-Group website.
For example, the cash registers do not have access to the data, Saarikoski stresses.
Video: Heila-pentu is Zoll's newest dog confirmation - puppy becomes first explosive dog
The black labrador puppy sharply squeezes five boxes of similar land in a row at Helsinki-Vantaa airport.
It doesn’t take long when it sits firmly next to the middle box.
Customs inspector Lassi Suntio rewards his Heila dog for playing it with his favorite film.
The box next to which Heila was sitting revealed a bottle of scented shells for the red gaze.
Rust gas is the first smell that has now been practiced with Heila, says Suntio, owner of the Heila dog.
Security status and e-shop accesses
Heila is the first dog specializing in the search for weapons and explosives at Tull and will be placed to work at Helsinki-Vantaa Airport next year.
Work tasks may take Heila and Suntion to other border crossing points and ports as needed.
However, the airport will be Heila's main workplace, as the international security situation has changed due to the serious terrorist attacks in Europe.
The attacks in Paris and Brussels led to measures in Customs and after the attacks, controls have been strengthened, said Customs Supervisor Mikko Grönberg.
The second reason for training weapons and explosives cows in customs duties is the postal consignments through Helsinki-Vantaa.
With the growing internet trade, up to 40 million mails are being sent through the airport each year, including supplies and explosives ordered from abroad.
In recent years, Customs has made a discovery of online shopping at Helsinki-Vantaa airport, including around 300 weapons, parts of weapons, ammunition and explosives and their starting materials.
Heila will work on different sides of Helsinki-Vantaata.
It will investigate checked baggage and postage.
In ports, it will be of great benefit in the future, as it can pass through large container areas and mark areas that require more detailed research, says Grönberg.
Based on the performance of the sound, Tulli will assess whether more weapons and explosive cows will be trained in the future.
Grönberg is hopeful of the idea.
Kirkkonummella School
Heila penn training is coordinated by the Tull dog school in Kirkkonummel.
Heila also trains with police and Defence Force experts.
The police have strong experience in training dogs and the Defence Forces have expertise in explosives.
Customs, together with other authorities, decide what smells Heila is taught to recognize.
The sound will always be trained as needed, says Grönberg.
Heila’s colleagues at Helsinki-Vantala are Tullin’s six drug dogs and money and drug dogs Massi.
Labrador breeder Heila has been selected from ten puppies.
The selection criteria for a dog to choose from at the airport include crawling and hunting, as well as calmness, because the dog is dealing with weapons, explosives and human flows.
Heila, who lives at Suntion’s home, is a close friend of the customs inspector, but also a family member.
There's nowhere to go without Light at home, Suntio laughs.
The subtle commands go to Heila at once.
The Night-Samomi cameraman loses a bit of camera cover for a quick dog, but Heila returns the cover from a soft toy immediately from the "exit" command.
Hard Competition for Tools
The primary school will be completed next year.
There are still some basic tests ahead, next October, to assess whether training is sufficient for demanding tasks.
Heila can be seen at work in Helsinki-Vantala next half of the year, if everything goes according to plans.
Unfortunately, passengers can’t come to squeeze a dog on the work slips, reminds Suntio.
The cost of one working dog is approximately EUR 60000-70000 per year for customs.
Their working life is about seven to eight years, up to ten, after which they are retired to the care of their owners.
Working days can be long, from eight to ten hours, but active portions last only from ten minutes to a few hours.
The owner of the working dogs is a tough competition in Tullis.
Approximately 20-30 employees of Customs were applied for as the owner of the cell.
Lucky hit Sunti, who has not had a working dog before, but has years of experience in dogs as well as supervisory tasks in Tulissa.
The mini-state gets its first Olympic medal – the people get a day off
Less than a million people in Fiji’s Olympic gold rugby is so high in the country that the government has designated August 22 as a national holiday.
According to the country's broadcaster, the Fiji government confirmed the issue after the championship was resolved.
The day of rest will be held on the team's return the next day.
There are also celebrations for the hero team in their home country.
The Fiji rugby team celebrates the championship.
The Guardian reports that a final was followed in the capital Suva, where the stadium was screened.
Normally only native Fijians are interested in rugby, but this game combined our multicultural community.
Even Chinese restaurants were watching the game, I heard they were encouraging," Fiji Times reporter Michaele Seru told The Guardian.
Drama in Rio - Finnish wreckage after performance
Weightlifter Milko Tokola succeeded in his last attempt after a hard battle of 175 kilos.
Tokola has a special and life-threatening feature as a lifter.
During or immediately after the lifting of the ribs, he has been rotted many times.
No one has ever been able to say why.
Tokola gained 175 pounds from work in Rio and 145 pounds from training.
His total result was 320 pounds.
Tokola attempted to gain 175 pounds in the end, as well as the other.
With the third company, the weights rose in a hurry.
The body whispered under the weights until the judge approved the lift.
The joy of the Finnish driver is that he has suffered from knee problems.
RoPS acquires Prosan - Veikkausliga - Itta-Sanomat
Rovaniemi Palloseura, who plays in the men's football league, has signed a lasting deal with Estonian striker Albert Prosa.
We are looking for a top player in our team, who has the power and the threshold to come to Finland and Rovaniemi is small.
We’ve been through more than 50 players from all over the world with more than ten player agents.
Prosa, RoPS coach Juha Malinen, said in a statement that he was a good choice.
Prosa, 25, comes to RoPS from Flora in Tallinn, where he scored a total of 51 goals in 109 matches.
He has also played in the Estonian national team.
Prosan is expected to be with RoPS on Saturday at Seinäjo, where the Rovani people will face the SJK of the dominant Finnish champion.
RoPS needed a new attacker when last season's painter Aleksandr Kokko moved to Australia.
The Threat of Modern Family: Teen Star Shorts Reveal Almost Everything
Alex Dunphy, the kind acquaintance of the Modern Family comedy series, Ariel Winter is once again exploding by presenting his proud body.
Winter was filmed in Hollywood this week in mini-shorts that do not leave much imagination behind.
The shorts revealed not only the actor's legs but also the back of this.
18-year-old Winter has recently attracted attention by changing her style and behavior to a much more bold one.
The star has posed in her social media posts with very few clothes and has taken numerous tattoos.
A young woman has also been seen wearing very thin suits.
Winter, on the threshold of adulthood, has also recently released several photos of herself celebrating.
If you don't see the picture, you can see it here.
Earlier this summer, Fox News asked experts why Winter has changed his public image so radically.
In this case, PowerwomenTV founder and CEO Amy Palmer suspected that Winter was running a "typical Hollywood transformation" from a children's star to an adult.
He has been on television most of his life and grew up in the Kardashian era.
He has learned that the more he looks like a surface, the more publicity and attention he gets in Hollywood, Palmer tells Fox News and adds that the exact same phenomenon has been seen countless times before.
Winter started in the Modern Family series when he was only 11 years old.
The actor has haunted some of his long-time fans with his image change.
It’s not hard to guess where she is in ten years’ time, as the downside is already rough, says one woman on Winter’s Instagram.
Some of the women’s fans, on the other hand, defend the actress and urge her not to be critical.
You look gorgeous!
It doesn't matter what others say.
You are an inspiration to many women, a bright young woman.
Japanese prefer North America to Finland - tourists are attracted by stripes: Autumn is possible to see a haunted mirror aurora
The aim of the campaign is to attract Japanese people to start revenge trips in early autumn, Visit Finland said in a statement.
The main destinations of Japanese recreational tourism are Inari and Levi.
Revolts are the power maps of our winter tourism, and they are strongly combined with the winter of the heart and snowy landscapes.
Lapland’s winter resort trips are very in demand, but we are now trying to increase the sales of autumn resort trips.
It is rare to know that the harvest season starts in early autumn and continues in the long spring.
In the autumn, it is possible to see the so-called mirror aurora, where the surface of the lake reflects the resounding, making the display twice as random, says Anne Lind, Marketing Manager of Visit Finland.
The main target group of the Finnish revolution campaign are the wealthy 25-35-year-olds, Japanese women living in the city, who dream of travel and new experiences.
They are already interested in Finland, its nature and design.
Tourists are attracted to Finland, among other things, by online advertising.
According to a survey conducted by Aalto University and researchers from the universities of Turku and Tokyo, Finland has an exceptionally strong and positive image among Japanese compared to other Nordic countries.
However, the Japanese would need more distinctive sights from Finland, and Lind said the area has a huge potential.
Overnight stays for Japanese tourists have increased significantly more in Finland than in other Nordic countries.
Last year they stayed in Finland more than twice as much as in Sweden, Denmark or Norway.
The Japanese are interested in tourism in Finland as a target group, as they spent more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>80 million in Finland.
The average Japanese spent <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>183 a day in Finland, Lind says.
Britain had to be satisfied with silver in rugby 7 when Fiji's championship team won gold
Britain's impressive success in the seven-player rugby tournament was severely disrupted when Fidzi won it in the final 43–7 at the Rio Deodoro Stadium on Thursday.
Fidzi taught the masters in ball processing, transfers, side drills, support games, runners-ups and racing, and thus won gold – if the country had the first Olympic medal in its entire history.
The loss meant silver, which was a little bit more comfort for Britain, as it was the country's third silver on the same day. They can be proud of their success as Olympics in the first time rugby 7 tournament, where the team won New Zealand, Argentina and E.
A strong win in the 7–5 semi-finals from the South African Boxers earlier that day could have a negative impact on the team in the finals.
Despite this, the Fidz team in this form would have won the British, even if the 15-man team were in full force.
Britain may be comforted by the fact that at least one Briton will get a gold medal tomorrow: Fidz's head coach Ben Ryan, the former coach of the English rugby team 7 from Wimbledon.
The experience has been pretty good for the UK.
Eight years ago, they lost all the games at the Adelaide Sevens in training for Ryan.
In Rio, they lost only one game.
Loss is painful, but progress is stunning.
Fidzi started great and presented his tactics to the UK for fun.
It seemed as if Captain Tom Mitchell and his teams had collided with moving buses, and the world champions rose 5–0 in the lead as Osea Kolinisau slammed the corner.
When the clock was four minutes away, Jerry Tuwai made the second shot on the right-hand side of the shot.
The situation was 12–0, and Britain had barely touched the ball.
Mitchell's splendid tale prevented Leone Nakarawa from making a third goal, but it did not slow Fidz's pace for a long time.
After the game was played for seven minutes, Jasa Veremalua made the goal right corner, after which the UK lost 17–0.
Nakarawa scored a second goal from the start, with the first half remaining more than a minute.
After that, Vatemo Ravouvouou crashed into the UK team through even more powerless obstacles and crashed across the line.
After the draw, the opening period ended in the situation 29–0.
It seemed that the Fidjians were born to play the rugby of seven players, while the British are still in the genre as a pupil.
Which is very much true.
The United Kingdom made large-scale changes in the semi-finals and managed to hold the Fijians for a total of four minutes, which in comparison to the first half was a good performance until Joshua Tuisova made the goal thanks to Fiji’s excellent team play.
Dan Norton managed to get rid of the situation 36–7 by making the ball to the left corner of the UK, but the game had long since been lost to the South Atlantic Islanders, whose fans in the audience sang, cheered their flags and danced.
It was hard not to admire Fidz’s purely cheerful attitude.
Mata Viliame made the final order for the Fidzians cake by doing the painting at the last moment.
The pill sounded, the Fidsians hugged each other and the British fell on the ground, completely crushed.
Earlier in the day, Fidzi had won Japan’s semi-finals in the 20-5s, and Britain had folded past South Africa in a tight semi-final, where the tie was solved by Britain’s draw.
Kyle Brown led the South African Boxers in the first half, but Dan Norton crossed the line with his stunning footwork and crashed under the caps in the second half.
Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony Watson, the England 15-player rugby team player, sealed the victory and finally the silver medal.
Coach's battle against cancer prompted Helen Glover and Heather Stanning to shed gold
This could not be more emotional in these competitions.
From the first bet to the last, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning supported 220 winning bets in their history and found additional purpose for their golden moment in the Estacio da Lagoa.
Even though they were two in the air, the boat was the third coach Robin Williams' voice, which prompted them to enter their second consecutive Olympic gold in the women's doubles, making them the first women in the history of British sport to exceed similar achievements.
Their superiority was undeniable, the victory was already their 39th consecutive and once again a record.
What we see, two great athletes joining on the water as you age, does not fully match the nature of success.
Behind each arm is a large set of helping hands, each of which has taken two towards achievements. However, the most important of the assistants is a coach who was diagnosed with cancer 30 months ago and who didn’t know then if he would see today.
Williams said the situation was severe at the time.
“I had bladder cancer, and the tumor was able to be removed.
Without surgery, it would have spread everywhere.
And the situation would have been pretty bad.
It changes a little bit the way you think.”
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The third was fortunate that Williams was able to start his treatment outside the seasonality of the species in early 2014, when the suspension caused as little harm as possible, if now it can be said in such circumstances.
“I needed money, so I had to recover quickly.
It worked as an incentive.
I was in the hospital and walked around the department 6, 9 and 15 meters at a time when they said a few steps is enough.
That's where it starts.
The journey itself is already a journey, but this made it a little bigger.”
Immediately after the victory, the duo’s thoughts were in Williams, who had spent a nervous morning talking a little more than normal trying to win his own restlessness.
Captain Stanning of the British Royal Artificial Intelligence Corps, who was behind a tour of Afghanistan, said: “I’ve been devastated at a level this week, which is perhaps a bit extreme, but that means so much.”
“It just tells us how much this means to me and how much we’ve worked with Helen and Robin.
The last three years in Helen and Robin's cash register have been fantastic.
Without Robin, we wouldn't be anything, so thank you very much, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn’t have hoped for a better person to train with or a better coach.”
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost any competition in the last five years.
The pair have found a superpowerful rhythm that their competitors have failed to draw.
Even at the last 500 meters, when the twins of New Zealand and Denmark began approaching, Stanning and Glover still had extra resources.
“We were very busy at the moment.
Helen hockey "Stay on hold, stay on hold".
It is very important not to get out of the way.”
“We started off well, and at the same time we didn’t try to do anything wonderful.
We didn’t aim for heaven today, we just wanted to make a good fight and win the race that we did.”
A couple think a year before deciding on their future.
Glover is celebrating next month's wedding with Steve Backshall
Now he just wants to enjoy the moment.
“I didn’t want to say that this was my last race.
It would have brought too much pressure.”
“After London, it took about six months before I realized I was an Olympic winner.
Everything was so new, and I was very stressed.
This time the realization took about four minutes.
It feels so much better,” he says.
Iceland to Replace Panama Leaked Government
Iceland will hold early parliamentary elections in October, which are already being called for by protesters angered by Panama data leaks in the spring.
The so-called Panama papers revealed that a number of Icelandic politicians circumvented taxes through tax havens.
Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson resigned because of the scandal, but it was not enough for the protesters.
His successor, Sigurdur Ingi Johannsson, promised to hold new parliamentary elections in the autumn.
The election day is now set for October 29.
According to analysts, it is difficult to predict how much the people’s final anger affects the outcome of the autumn election.
In the June presidential election, criticism of the powerful was clearly shown, and out-of-political candidate Gudni Johannesson was elected president.
Trump says he was sarcastic about claiming Obama as the founder of ISIS
U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has resigned from his last speech.
He said he was sarcastic in claiming that President Barack Obama would be the founder of ISIS and Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton to form the organization.
The Democratic Party was angry at the speeches and demanded an apology from Trump.
The commander-in-chief of the army should never let anyone who can fall down like that, Clinton tweeted.
In southern France, the mayor of Cannes has banned the use of a popular Muslim-like burkini swimsuit on the beaches, reports the British newspaper Guardian.
The decision signed by Mayor David Lisnard states that beaches and swimming are prohibited from anyone who does not have a good habit and a swimsuit that respects secularism.
The decision also states that swimming suits, which largely express religious connections, can increase the risk of disorders in France, which has been the target of terrorist attacks.
In mid-July, 85 people died and hundreds were injured in Nice, when a 31-year-old man drove the French National Day celebrations to the crowd.
At the end of July, two extremist organizations, connected to the Fathers, attacked the church in northern France and killed an 80-year-old priest.
The quality of the swimming water in the area of Oulu will pass through the lake - Pykösjärväsammaa in Pykösjärv
Water samples taken from the official swimming beaches in the Oulu area meet the quality requirements for swimming water.
Only on the shore of Lake Pykösjärvi has been observed blue-leaf fatigue.
During Tuesday and Wednesday, the environmental action in Oulu region took water samples from nine EU beaches and 30 other public swimming beaches in the Oulu area.
With the exception of the seaweed beach, the concentrations of enterococci bacteria in E. coli and intestinal ponds of all swimming pools were below the operational limits laid down in the regulations of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
The E.coli and enterococci concentrations of seaweed bathing water were confirmed on Wednesday, when bacterial levels had been lowered below the operational limits.
The blue leafyness observed on the shores of Lake Pyk<0xC3><0xAB>s does not yet make the water unfloatable, but under favorable conditions, the situation can quickly turn into blue leafy leaf, forming a blue-green debris on the surface of the water.
The environmental action follows the situation with a tightened check.
In the event of a bluefin tunnel becoming a bluefin tunnel tunnel, the notification board shall also inform you separately.
See the results of the swimming water samples here.
MTK’s Hakkarainen forest donation reduction: more than 80% of forest owners outside
Forest gift reduction is one tax change in the Ministry of Finance’s draft budget for next year.
The Income Tax Act proposes a tax reduction to be granted on the basis of the gift transfer tax for forestry.
In the proposal of the Ministry of Finance, forest gift reduction has four objectives: to promote the generation of forest farms, to rejuvenate the age structure of forest owners, to increase forest size and to increase the supply of wood.
The Ministry aims to promote entrepreneurial forestry.
The forest owner would make a reduction in the net capital income of forestry.
In general, the idea of making such a tool to promote the generation of forest farms is good, commented Juha Hakkarainen, director of the Central Union of Agricultural and Forestry Producers (CFO).
However, Hakkkaren finds criticism of the tax evasion proposal.
Forest gift reduction is presented for the forest owner's net capital income.
It is a capital income from which all other deductions are deducted.
According to MTK and Hakkaraisen, the effect of the tax reduction would be greater if the reduction could be made directly from the results of the sale of the tree.
The VM’s proposal is based on a reduction in the net capital income of forestry, which prevents the loss of forestry capital income from being deducted from other taxation.
Such a person would get a tax benefit, even if they don't have a tree for sale.
The calculation model is inextricably complicated.
The average forest owner can't figure it out, Hakkarainen says.
In addition, he said, the model concerns only a small proportion of forest owners.
The limit for the tax reduction linked to the forest’s profit value is EUR 40 000 in the proposal.
He thinks it's too high.
As such, he said, it would exclude 82% of Finnish forest owners from the reduction.
The model would have an impact on about 10 percent of the forest owners, he says.
The VM considers that the boundary guarantees the goal of growing up in space.
According to Hakkarasen, forest donation has been reduced in forest policy for decades.
It is based on the ageing of forest owners.
According to the MTK, the average age of forest owners is currently over 60 years, and about half of forest owners are retired.
Powerful racing shocked the drivers at Himanga - two cars crashed into the entrance and crashed into each other
On Friday morning, a special delay occurred on the Himang River.
According to the rescue agency, two consecutive times a car crashed into a section, followed by a collision with the previous driver.
According to firefighter Harri Pyyytä, it is suspected to have been caused by a strong crackdown.
In the back of the car were two people who were both transported to the hospital for treatment.
There is no more accurate information about their injuries.
The driver of the car was not injured.
The accident occurred on the highway 8 from Himangal Pradesh, a few kilometers to Kalajo.
Finnish research can help improve the effectiveness of cancer treatments
Recent research from researchers at the University of Turin can help to develop cancer treatments more effectively.
The findings of the academy professor Johanna Ivaska’s research team show that the hardness of the cancerous tumor increases the malignancy of the cancer.
Many human tissues, such as breast tissue, are very soft, and tissue cells grow as usual in such an environment.
According to Ivaska, the growth of cancer was prevented in laboratory conditions by restoring the tissue surrounding the cancer to match the normal, soft tissue.
In the future, the effectiveness of cancer treatments may be improved by focusing on the interaction between cells and the surrounding tissue in the treatment, in addition to cancer cells.
The results of the study were published on August 4 in the prestigious journal Nature Communications in the field of cell biology.
Mukherjee's family death continues in court, prosecutor demands murder sentence for another perpetrator
The death penalty for Muhok’s family continues in court for both convicts.
Two young men were sentenced to prison in June for Muhok’s family death.
The other was sentenced to 8 years and 4 months for murder as a young person and brutal robbery.
The second sentence is 12 years in prison for murder as a young person and brutal robbery.
The executioner was also sentenced for endangering traffic safety as a young person and the right to transport a vehicle as a young person.
The court’s judgment was appealed by the prosecutor, the lawyers and the man who received a more severe sentence.
The prosecutor demands that a man sentenced as a young person to 12 years in prison for murder.
They were at the moment in full understanding.
According to the court, 17-year-old boys killed a man in July last year who worked as the school’s child protection unit manager.
A 17-year-old convicted of murder allegedly attacked the driver sitting in the back of the living room on the couch.
The conductor had escaped from the excavation and had taken the young man to his room, when another young man hit him with a vacuum cleaner.
Among other things, the conductor was beaten, beaten and kicked in the head.
According to the mental state study, both convicts were in full understanding at the time of the act.
According to the law, young people had planned to escape from family homes at least from the previous day.
Ice shark is the longest-lived vertebrae in the world, growing only at the age of 156
The world’s longest-lived vertebrate is a confirmed ice shark, according to a study published in Science magazine.
In the northern Atlantic, such as the floating glacier around Greenland, the Holker can live up to 400 years old.
The female is only growing at the age of 156.
Ice sharks live more because it grows only one centimeter a year.
Only one species of Simpu is known to live frostbites for longer.
Researchers found out the age with radiocarbons.
Due to nuclear tests in the 1950s, some oysters had radioactive residues.
Based on these, researchers were able to estimate the age of the sharks.
The oldest age was estimated to be 392 years - yet a throw in one direction or another can be up to 120 years.
Donald Trump's Economics - People's News
Donald Trump’s America doesn’t need to change the world.
Even a third of the country’s tax revenue would be excluded if the change to corporate tax led by Donald Trump was implemented.
Tax revenues would also decrease, in particular with the richest tax reliefs.
Trump described his tax program as revolutionary by presenting it in Detroit on Monday.
Corporate tax would drop from 35 percent to 15 percent.
Without collecting, it would be a really great sum of <0x24>1 billion a year.
The highest income tax rate is now 39.6, after Trump’s 33.
The inheritance tax would be completely waived.
Trump accused the state of over-regulation of business and bankruptcy of small businesses.
The environmental norms adopted by the breeders must be revised and the regulation in the energy sector must be abolished.
Barack Obama's health care reform needs to be taken into consideration.
The administration must appoint "experts instead of bureaucrats".
Trump’s “destructive” trade policy is one of the biggest causes of US problems.
Free trade agreements would be terminated.
Imports from China would be subject to a penalty of 45 % and from Mexico a penalty of 35 %.
We offer a new future.
“Americanity, not globalism, is our religion,” Trump said.
Donald Trump’s America Doesn’t Need to Change the World
American cars come to drive on the streets, American planes to connect cities, American ships to watch at sea, American steel to lift new skyscrapers all over the country.
In contrast, Trump faithfully read through a speech written by his aides, even though well-organized protests interrupted it 14 times.
Economists - including those close to Republicans - are seeing the U.S. take the Trump program to a deep economic downturn.
Hillary Clinton announced her program early on Friday in Finland.
An Attack on the Past - People's News
The sea whispers fatefully, but the real storm strikes in the middle of Madrid’s street wall – whether accountability with the past can begin.
In short, it is the core of Pedro Almodóvar’s new story.
Almodóvar’s previous directorial work Matkarakastajat (2013) was a small-faced and rhetoric satirical comedy, preceded by The Skin in which I live (2011) at the peaks of the career of the Spanish violinist.
Levelly Julieta (2016) is located somewhere between these two works.
It is the interconnected bond of love, human relationship and family, at the center of which is the mother-daughter relationship.
The story is simple and can be seen as a long backstory.
Life seems to be modeled on the middle-aged nominee (Emma Suarez), but then everyone threatens to fade away.
In the aftermath of a casual encounter, a new boyfriend (Dario Grandinetti) must be surprised to find out until the end of the film.
In the form of a backpack and a long letter, Julieta repeats the stages of her life to her adult daughter.
He starts from the time before his daughter was born, the moment he met this future father (Daniel Grao).
At the same time, Julieta's second female lead is Adraina Ugarte, who plays as a young teacher in the television series Between Ommelte (2013-2014).
Julieta's aging has been treated in a way that can be considered a boiler, but I would say that time is slow and word for word.
For Almodóvar films, there is often a fair distance in Julieta with such a characteristic brilliance, always with humor.
It is an equally well-played, distracted, a place with good music and a rather sad film with elements of elegance as such.
Instead, the typical visual luminosity of the Spanish driver is present and in such a way that it begins to put a little silence into the eye as a pure form rather than as a dramatic effect.
People in the film experience illnesses, deaths or just sudden losses, but the surface remains the same as Korean.
This is especially true for the infestation: in the case of a nominee, the dwellings change from scene to scene, and the same applies to the appearance of the earrings.
Almodóvar is precise in these matters, but the main thing is that the descriptions of the scene are not particularly clear.
When mechanically repeated, the impression is external and a little indifferent.
Almodóvar has written a novel based on three novels by the Nobel laureate Alice Munro.
Novels have been published in Karkulainen: Stories.
Almodóvar has invested in dialogue, resulting in a somewhat balanced literary filming.
The subjects would have been emotionally incomparable to the drama, as the theme of the leffa deals with the big things - especially the blatant guilt.
Written and directed by Pedro Almodóvar.
Based on the three novels of Alice Munro.
Starring: Emma Suarez, Adriana Ugarte, Rossy de Palma, Daniel Grao, Dario Grandinetti.
The first movie is 12.8.
The government is trying to vote - People's News
No new cuts will be made, the ministers insist, so that the basic Finns do not collapse completely.
In the spring, however, the cuts are done by the barber shop.
There will be no new surgery.
The <0x24>4 billion savings already made are sufficient.
This is what Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (central) and Minister of Finance Petteri Orpo (cook.) under the budget line convince.
It is true that there are no new cuts in the VM proposal, as the cuts in social security were decided already in the spring frame phase.
Children's allowances, national pensions, basic unemployment insurance and almost all other benefits linked to national pensions indexes will be reduced by 0.85%.
The duration of the unemployed person’s unemployment insurance is reduced from 500 days to 400 days.
The training cuts continue.
The Municipal Elections
Why do the ministers insist that there are no new cuts on these?
Because next year is the election year.
The municipal elections are held in April and they are the most important thermometer of the election season, not gallus.
In the past, it has been seen that the results of the municipal elections leading to different directions of the government parties have long been detrimental to the atmosphere of the government.
However, the Gallus report that the main Finnish government party expects a scoring loss, although the result of its previous elections was modestly 12.3 per cent compared to parliamentary elections.
Four years ago, Finns received 752 new delegates, many of whom will realize the price of influence in the right-wing government next spring.
The life-threatening role of a three-party government is in the hands of the Finns.
Now it has not lasted, but more than half of the voters got enough of government policy in the first year.
The first signs of the party's parliamentary group's rallies have also come to the surface.
The rhetoric does not allow new cuts, firstly, to obscure the fact that they will be made vigorously next year, and secondly, they will be attempted to soften the anticipated blow to the main Finns.
Big cuts in 2018?
In a year's time, everything will probably be different - if the Civilian government is still in a position.
The government has set the goal of indebtedness in this election period, but the budget proposal by Petteri Orpo will take <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>5.9 billion in debt next year, which is more than this year.
After the elections, the government has two options.
The first is to raise hands in the middle of the election and admit that the government is unable to follow its own agenda: debt does not tilt or even slow down.
The second is to stick to the program.
This means even more severe cuts in the 2017 budget line for the former.
The budget would be balanced at least during 2018, and then in the spring parliamentary elections, what is coming will be welcomed.
These actions do not lead to debt
It is quite clear that the current actions do not lead to indebtedness, even if Juha Sipilä is trying to lighten the positive atmosphere.
The curves presented by Secretary of State Martti Hetemäe in the report on the budget are irreconcilable:
Global economic growth forecasts have repeatedly proved to be optimistic, meaning that the international economy will not receive any appeal.
The Finnish economy has not just risen since the collapse in 2008, except temporarily during the recovery policy exercised in the early 2010s.
Unemployment has increased by 35 per cent over the decade, extending from an average of 34 to 54 weeks.
Unemployment now costs <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3 billion more per year than it did in 2008.
The public debt, which exceeded the 60 per cent threshold in 2014, will rise to 70 per cent in the middle of the next decade.
What is Responsible?
In the spring of 2015, the Left League’s debt relief was rejected because it was considered irresponsible.
Next year, the maintenance of unemployment will cost around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>6 billion, which is practically covered by taking on a completely new debt.
This is the central, meeting and basic Finns' perception of what is responsible.
Question: We want to leave a lot of work to the city
Three out of four believe that organizing child care, youth work and exercise is the responsibility of the municipality, according to KAKS - Municipal Development Foundation research.
The clear majority of the people will also assign responsibility to the individual municipality for libraries, culture, civil isotopes, building supervision, college education and waste management.
The responsibility of the county, in turn, is most clearly aimed at county care, specialist nursing, vocational education, vocational colleges and the institutional management of development disabilities.
None of the tasks in charge of the municipalities are intended to be delegated to the state.
A minor steering wheelchair runs backwards after police escape
A 16-year-old motorcyclist from Joensuu fled the police force in Joensuu, Ilomantsintie, on Friday at half time.
The police tried to stop the motorcycle without lights for a while, but the young man left to drive the police away at a fair speed.
The trail continued to the Sonkayan coast, from which to the Sorronahonti and the smaller forest road, where the motorcycle drove out of the road.
Even after that, the young man ran away, but a faster policeman ran to catch the fugitive.
The inhalation test for the driver showed 0.75 promille.
He also did not have a driver’s license that would have allowed him to drive a motorcycle.
The case is being investigated, inter alia, as a serious threat to road safety.
The truck that was in the rocks crashed into the river
On Thursday night, at 9:15 p.m., the truck in Kivilast crashed into the Polvijärvi lake.
The truck had been driven to the left in a comfy map out of the road and fell to the edge of the village.
The rescue agency pulled the injured driver out of the crashed truck through a door above it, along with the rescue helicopter staff and first responders.
Lifting the vehicle was the responsibility of the owner.
The hydraulic oil that the rescuers put into the turbine from the abandoned truck.

Materials of disaster in the air - see photo gallery of the destruction of Parafest
The collapse of the Parafest festival tents caused massive destruction.
The president of the Joensuu Parafestival, Arto Pippuri, estimates that the festival will be economically accessible, and the event can also be organised next year.
Kalle Salonen, the last performer of the Parafest, performed at the end of Friday afternoon with a torilalava.
On Saturday, the program will continue with performances in the premises of the city theatre from 1 p.m.
The Art Center in Ahjo has a Parafest exhibition from 13 to 15.
The program is organized in a planned manner.
The outflow occurs in a cloudy cloud when rainwater and its weight initiate a decreasing airflow.
Changes in the form of water in the flood cloud bind the heat, and thus the dropping air cools and its speed towards the ground accelerates.
According to the Meteorological Institute, several collisions occur in Finland during the summer.
It is difficult to predict the trajectory of the outflows.
The outflow hit the backyard of the art museum in Joensuu, the venue of Parafest, on Friday afternoon before 5 p.m.
Three tents collapsed, with a total of about 200 people in the tents.
In the accident, four people injured themselves slightly.
Among them was one child who was transported slightly injured to follow-up treatment.
Air Pollution Aging Londoners
According to the study, the skin of Londoners aging faster than usual.
The reason for the aging of the skin is air pollution.
According to the British study, the Evening Standard.
The British skincare company Caci analyzed London’s air with the smallest particles and their effects on the skin.
The results show that the skin of many retirees in London is two and a half years older than that of a rural comrade.
Small particles aging the skin are very fine dust pollution, which originates from transport fuels.
The same particles also cause respiratory diseases, which according to the Evening Standard, nearly 9,500 Londoners die each year.
Studies have shown that the particles are small enough to penetrate the outermost layer of the skin.
The Cac study found that premature aging is a risk, especially for Londoners who walk on their work trips in the vicinity of crowded streets.
Londoners can try to protect themselves from air pollution, for example, with different masks, but for a more practical solution, regular cleansing of the skin is recommended.
Tractor brakes cheated - a man standing in front of him
The man had moved stones in his yard with a tractor.

Josban, Kataja and River Boys to the U.S. national team
Anne Jumppanen has played in almost all Saliband World Championships since 2003.
Now Tampere is already in its sixth race, only 2013 was a better one for Canada in North American exports.
I was working at the Market and playing with the Sicilian women when I noticed the announcement.
The U.S. was setting up a Saliband national team.
I was interested, and here we are, Jumppane, 48, says.
Jumppanen was born in 1967 near New York City, Elizabeth.
The family moved to Helsinki when the girl was one year old.
In 1987, Jumppanen joined the University of Joensuu to study computer processing.
When I came to Joensuu, there was no such thing as a SM-level game like Salibandy.
Sahl was played at the university.
I played basketball in Kataja and later in Jokipoj ice hockey in the SM series, Jumppanen remembers.
Jumppanen played with the University in the 1991–92 Saliband SM series, the next three passes took place in Josba.
In addition to playing, he trained the A-girls for the championship.
The women's SM series peaked in silver in 1995.
In total, Jumppanen played in the women's SM series through 10, a total of 169 matches 51<0x2B>34<0x3D>85.
The last SM season is 2001-2002.
Perttu Puska and Tatu Vääänen were named to the national team

The main coach of the Salibandyma team is Petri Kettunen, who is from the Continental region.
Beach volleyball player Essi Hasu circle closes in Kouvola - SM gold missing from prize box
Essi Hasu is quitting as a beach volleyball player at least temporarily after the current season.
The Finnish beach volleyball championships will be held at Kouvola Sports Park this weekend.
Over the course of three days, the medals will be played in both adult and young series.
In cooperation with the Kouvola Volleyball Players and the Finnish Volleyball Federation, the six best pairs of each series are eligible for the SM final tournament.
The local colour of the tournament is represented by the NMKY raised by Essi Hasu, who has been part of the Finnish beach volley for many years.
Currently in Helsinki, Hasu is eagerly awaiting games in front of a well-known audience.
Hopefully as many as possible will be able to watch this weekend.
I'm sure it's going to be a great stadium for the football stadium.
I have not played in adult series very often in Kouvola, so it is great to play in the finals at home corners, Hasu feels.
The village of Kouvola ignited Hasu’s passion for sport and gave good wishes for a great hobby.
There are a lot of memories of childhood.
I started volleyball at the age of 9 in the NMKY E-girls in Elimäen.
The main thing in mind is too big game shirts, knee pads on the cheeks, as well as amazing ass shouts and choreographies after a point, Hasu recalls.
In a small village, a sports group was a close community where everyone knew each other.
The team’s spirit created an environment where it was fun to play.
All the families were strongly involved in the operation - the teammate's father trained us and our mother was the chairman for a long time.
Essi Hasulle beach volleyball was already a natural variety choice against the indoor volleyball.
Swimming pool has been played by Bibi since the 1990s.
The activity has always been active.
I also attended the Junior SM Tour competitions myself, considering that one day I would be playing there myself.
Now this dream comes true when Hasu plays together with Anniina Parkkis in the SM Finals over the weekend.
After Riikka Lehtosen and Taru Lahden, the goal of the doubles that were penalized for the second time in the tournament is clear.
As a realistic goal, we have a medal.
SM gold is still missing from the prize box, Hasu throws value.
A weekend in Kouvola may be the last for Hasulle in front of a familiar audience.
At the beginning of September, new challenges for civil work are expected.
Yes, the international career is over after the Tournament.
Otherwise, the bodyguards are placed on the nail at least temporarily, Hasu plans.

Solomon Koli boldly went on to become an agricultural entrepreneur
As an entrepreneur, agriculture means risk gains, sweat and strength.
A young farmer, Salomon Koli, 25, became an agricultural entrepreneur because he believes in a positive future also in rural areas.
Koli started working as a continuation of their home state just two years ago, together with his little brother Valtteri Kol.
Their father, Markus Koli, helps and advises the brothers with their own experience.
Starting up as a rural entrepreneur meant borrowing and enlargement of the estate so that bread could come into the hands of agriculture.
This has been my thing since I was a kid.
I’ve always wanted to be on the farm, and now that I started as an entrepreneur myself, I’ve put everything into the game.
If something starts, then I think it should be done seriously and properly.
In 2013, we started to build a yard, and at first the bank was not excited about it.
However, I myself joined the project with great courage and I have been fully involved in it, says Salomon Koli, adding that he would not have taken action if he had no faith in the production of pure Finnish food and that everything would still be fine.
The goal of Salomon Kol, a carpenter growing company, is to invest in an even larger hub.
The work has yielded results, as Salomon Koli has been selected among the top ten young food producers of the Rural Future magazine.
He is currently competing for a possible win.
He will be able to vote on the magazine’s website until August 21.
Bulgaria announces inflation for the first time in eight months
According to national statistics, Bulgaria's monthly inflation was 1% in July.
This is the highest value in many years (after June 2012) and the first time it has risen above zero since October last year, when the country reported positive inflation of 0.2%.
The average annual inflation rate measured by the CPI over the last 12 months (August 2015 to July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 to July 2015) was -0.8%.
The consumer price index in July 2016 was 101.0% compared to June 2016, i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0%.
Since the beginning of the year, the inflation rate (approximately 2016 per cent compared to December 2015) has been -0.2%, and annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -0.2%.
Compared to the previous month in July 2016, prices for the following consumer groups increased: foodstuffs and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%), transport (1.8%), recreation and culture (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), other goods and services (0.3%).
Prices decreased in clothing and footwear (2.2%), furniture, home appliances and periodicals (0.5%) and health (0.1%).
Prices for the following product groups remained at the same level as last month: alcohol and tobacco, apartments, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communication and training.
Snapchat Anime Effect Criticized as Asian Cartoon
Snapchat says it was an anime that inspired the filter, but some viewers think it’s racist.
With Snapchat’s lens tool, about 150 million daily users can change reality and play identity in ways that approach absurdity.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog or a character in Roy Lichtenstein's painting.
The lenses are unparalleled, flawless tools that create more than 30 million enhanced selfies a day.
All deceptions are quickly becoming known to the general public.
Snapchat’s lenses have received criticism, accusing it of favoring blackface or bleached skin tones as a beauty cover.
So when it offered some of its users this week a filter that turned their eyes into blurred, faked teeth and made pocket pulls, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asian people ("yellowface").
The critics also wondered whether these repeated conflicts refer to a larger problem that the company has with the difference.
News and anger spread widely on Wednesday and it was written by the online publications The Verge and Motherboard the day after Snapchat said it had removed the filter.
The company gave the following explanation: the lens was intended to honor anime characters, not as a caricature of Asian people.
But for observers who have experienced racism, the lens was a reminder of offensive stereotypes.
Some were very dissatisfied with the anime comparison.
Korean-American art student Grace Sparapani, whose tweets were widely shared, said in an email that the lens was “at least offensive and embarrassing.”
He adds: “It is difficult to dispute the comparison of the very tasteless Asian caricature with the filter effects.
It shows that the filter is not just a "yellowface", but a filter that is carried to a humiliating extreme."
Snapchat is not the only company that needs to avoid these cultural merits.
In American culture, there is an endless struggle for diversity and social inclusion, ranging from corporate governments to Hollywood and the equipment we carry with us.
Snapchat’s large audience consists of young people who are more diverse from their ethnic backgrounds than their parents did. This can mean that they are likely to expect subtlety even more.
“When one of Snapchat’s lenses creates an image that offends the user, things like this don’t go unnoticed as before,” 25-year-old Katie Zhu said in an interview on Thursday.
Zhu, who works as product manager and designer for Medium, decided on Thursday to remove his Snapchat account and encouraged others to do the same.
In his writing and telephone interview with the media, he said he believed that ethnicity-related conflicts reflected the lack of diversity appreciation in Snapchat’s recruitment practices.
Zhu criticized the company for the majority of its white and men-only leadership and decided to write it with a hashtag: <0x23>DeleteSnapchat.
"It is either that there are no colorful people in their unilateral staff, where they can make such decisions, or they also have colorful employees, but their position is not such that they would dare to express their opinions directly and easily."
Other observers agree with him, but Snapchat has largely left unanswered the claim.
The company does not publish figures on the ethnic background of its staff, drawing on its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the ethnic background of its staff, but according to a reporter, the company has recently hired a recruiter whose goal is to focus on underrepresented groups of people and promote inclusion within the company.
On his part, Zhu says he keeps his Snapchat account closed and adds, “I wonder if they really need more users like us to be able to say that this is not OK.”
Congressional Expert Group Says Military Officers Falsified Intelligence About Isis
A congressional expert group on Thursday released a report that said U.S. military officials, the Central Command, had changed intelligence reports to give a more optimistic picture of the war against the Isis in Iraq and Syria than what was happening on the ground.
The presidents of the Republican Subcommittee on Intelligence and Defence Funds of the House of Representatives of the United States (House Armed Services Committee) set up a working group, which reports on the "general dissatisfaction" of intelligence analysts with the armed forces.
Central Command, or Centcom, is the headquarters of the U.S. Armed Forces in Tampa, Florida, which is responsible for military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
“The results of the CENTCOM’s top investigative leaders generally gave a more positive picture of the U.S. counter-terrorism action than the facts on the ground showed, and were, without exception, more positive than what the community’s intelligence department’s analysis of other media outlets reported.
“Centcom’s events are unacceptable – our soldiers are suffering when false analysis is presented to high-level political decision makers,” said California Republican Ken Calvert.
"Centcom's management portal errors reach the highest level of the organization."
The 10-page report describes in detail the continuing problems in 2014 and 2015 that Central Command’s descriptions and analyses of American actions to train Iraqi troops include.
While the report does not contain any decisive evidence that reports ordered by Obama’s administration have been falsified, it gives analysts the impression that Centcom leaders have pushed them to express a more optimistic view of the threat posed by ISIS.
“In the first half of 2015, many of Central Command’s press releases, statements and testimony to Congress were significantly more positive than the events were actually,” the report said.
“For example, a Centcom official made a public statement that a major military coup could take place in April or May 2015 to recapture Mosul.”
Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, is still under ISIS control.
"After months of research, this is very clear," Kansas Republican Mike Pompeo said in a statement.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, senior intelligence leaders in the US military manipulated the results to minimize ISIS threats in Iraq.
The Republicans set up the working group after learning of the suspicions raised by analysts that information on Isis would have been manipulated.
The report, published on Thursday, will be followed by more detailed results as the studies continue.
In addition, the Defence Ministry’s Superintendent has launched an investigation into Centcom’s intelligence.
On Thursday, the members of the Democratic Committee in charge of the House of Representatives' Inquiry published their own findings, which were partly in line with the Republican Working Group's conclusions.
“Between 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an overly limited process to evaluate intelligence about ISIS and Iraqi security forces,” said Adam B. Schiff, the committee’s senior Democratic intelligence officer.
According to Schiff, this process "delayed the publication of the survey results, "refused the morale of analysts" and "takes insufficiently different views".
According to Schiff and Democrats, however, there was no evidence that the White House had attempted to pressure Centcom analysts to adapt its conclusions "to a predetermined or politically official line".
The Daily Beast reported on Tuesday the preliminary results of a congressional study.
Last August, the New York Times reported on a Pentagon Superintendent’s investigation, which began as a result of complaints from Centcom analysts.
Pentagon spokesman Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans said in a statement that the Department of Defense will not comment on the Congress report as long as the Superintendent's investigation is underway.
However, he says, "experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of complex information, and the intelligence community and the Ministry of Defence welcome a sound dialogue on these key national security issues."
The investigation also has other consequences, in addition to its efforts to find out whether the US-led bombings in Iraq and Syria have been successful (an increasing number of defence authorities have made a claim).
However, the claims made last year may have questioned how much President Obama can rely on the Central Command and that it gives honest estimates of the military operation in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other critical areas.
Criticism of intelligence on Isis corresponds to disagreements raised more than a decade ago when Centcom intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker published a study that said that President George W. Bush’s government, despite the objections of many analysts in 2003, only supported Iraq’s opposition.
Hooker also played a key role in the uprising against Isis' intelligence.
According to the authorities last year, Hooker's working group concluded that despite contradictory public statements, the attacks on ISIS-controlled refineries had not significantly weakened the economy of the terrorist group because it had built temporary markets and was able to sell them.
However, the results of the study were not transmitted outside the Central Command, The Times reported in September.
Centcom’s then commander, General Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized last year after many legislators assessed that the testimonials to the Senate were too positive for the war.
General Austin retired in April, and was replaced by General Joseph L. Votel as Commander of the Central Command.
U.S. wins fourth double in women's national hockey and consolidates its position in mediation with Britain
After making three goals in a win-winning 6–1 game against Japan, Katie Bam made the first two goals for the U.S. women's national hockey team on Thursday, where the U.S. won India.
Five goals in two games could be considered a great achievement, but 27-year-old Bam was not sure if he had succeeded in the same way before.
“I have no idea,” he says.
"I don't belong to people who like to figure out what they're doing."
However, he knows this: The Americans have won four games in their Olympic tournament and have lost zero games and are splitting their team first place with Britain, which continued to win their wins on Thursday in Japan’s 2–0.
The United States and the United States will play in the final of the first round on Saturday.
Both teams survived the final production, which decides which of the six teams will be the first and which one will be the second.
The first place avoids a longer-term encounter with a hard-line Dutch team that won the second block.
Regardless of the way the game is played on Saturday, the Americans have already highlighted their surprising success in these competitions, four years after it remained the last of the 12 teams at the London Olympics.
Bam was also on the team in London.
He grew up in Blue Bells, Pennsylvania, and for the first time entered the national hockey league at the age of 3 (his older twin sisters played in Drexel). He entered the national team at the age of 16 and thus became the youngest national team player of all time.
The 2008 Olympics left him behind when he did not survive on the final list of players.
After that came the 2012 races, where he and his team were hardly seen any successes.
The following year, British coach Craig Parnham was appointed, after which things began to change.
“The change was cultural, mental and physical,” says Bam.
“Our ambition to work in London wasn’t what it is today.
We’ve done a full reversal.”
On Thursday night, Bam opened the painting mode in the first half by hitting the ball close to the inside with a slash.
India had come into the game without any tournament wins, but it turned out to be a surprisingly tough opponent and kept the 1-0 position until the third round, when Bam entered the field.
Bam carried the ball for a long time along the left side of the field, kicked in the middle, hit the ball and led the Americans 2–0 in the lead.
Melissa Gonzalez scored the last goal in the middle of the fourth half.
The game was the first of the tournament in which U.S. goalkeeper Jackie Briggs managed to keep the goal empty. In the first three games, the Americans had each scored one goal.
Briggs is now living his success.
Just like Bam.
“Our investment is good now,” says Parnham, but how good it depends on Saturday’s score.
In the middle of the Olympics, the trampoline brings zens
Regardless of time and place, the Olympics are inevitable.
Rio de Janeiro events, competitions and matches are the next passionate message constantly and everywhere.
It’s like an Olympic fire itself would be an inflammatory message box that moves from a river shooter to a swimmer, from a swimmer to a gymnast and from a gymnast to a triathlon.
You can’t open a TV, read a newspaper, or listen to your neighbor’s conversation in the coffee shop without avoiding hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky, or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's a man named Logan Dooley.
First-time Olympic Dooley with a charming smile and might well have a name on everyone’s lips that would appear and be among the best watching and listening times, would be sponsors’ favorites and would appear in good-natured TV ads if he were just a swimmer, a booster, or even a swordsman.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest in California, competes for the Olympic ball on a trampoline.
The Olympics do not equally illuminate all competitions.
Far from the center, partially in the shadow, there are less well-known sports, such as air gunshots, jojo shots, soccer ball and taekwondo.
We will always have to have a tie, and stay the championship with us for a long time.
But if I'm allowed to write a modest story about my own specialty, I'd like to pay attention to the charm of the trampoline.
Although the trampoline has been an Olympic type since the 2000 Sydney Games, its visibility has been so low for the last 16 years that many people I interviewed didn’t even know it was an Olympic type.
Ignorance can be regional.
The U.S. athletes have participated in the Olympic Trampoline, but the country has never entered the medals or advanced to the finals until 2012.
Men's trampoline medals seem to go to Chinese and Russians, and on the women's side medalists are attracted to Canadians.
Chinese Dong Dong and Canadian Rosie MacLenna are defending the gold medals they won in London this year.
The trampoline, however, has the charm of the subcontractor, partly because it sounds more appropriate to the circus school than to the Olympics.
(In this context, I admit that I am not an expert, just an ordinary fan.)
The species has its comical potential, which has been used in drawings for endless continuous pumping of characters, but it also has the same value as in gymnastics and swimming climbing, i.e. species that connect essentially in trampolines.
The word trampoline comes from the Spanish word el trampoline, which means "strength board".
The ambitious champions jump on a huge trampoline, which tilts them to a height of almost 10 meters. Before landing on their feet, jumpers must make a series of acrobatic moves, such as spins, arts and volts.
According to the official Olympic programme, jumps are criticized based on performance, difficulty and "flight time".
In Rio, 32 athletes from 17 different countries compete in the championship of trampoline training, including 16 men and 16 women.
The most common direction for the Olympics is straight forward.
When aiming for gold, the medal hopes have to go further, faster, up and above, sometimes over the line of painting, sometimes back and forth around the field.
In addition to the painting line or the starting wall, they also have another goal that they pursue in television news reports, namely the world or Olympic record.
This decisive pursuit is luxurious, admirable, even fanatic—and enough to get the viewer to tears.
But I also find this a little boring just by watching the competitions.
This trampoline offers a cooling room.
The trampoline is upwards.
The goal is not to move forward.
The gymnast jumps up as unweighted as an astronaut, falls down and sneaks back up.
The species, of course, also includes a competitive aspect, and it is also not easy, but it does not involve a passionate stride into the field or a long jump, only a dreamy and melting combination of time and weight.
It's as close to Zen as only the Olympics can get.
Women’s draws and finals are held on Friday afternoon and start at 13:00 local time and men’s matches are held on Saturday at the same time.
NBC broadcasts the finals as part of its afternoon broadcast, which starts at 2:00 p.m. local time each day.
In the middle of Olympiamania comes a quiet and beautiful moment that could be ignored in the middle of the general crowd.
And if awareness can only be increased by offering attractive men’s athletes to watch and presenting them – as U.S. men’s men’s figures recently suggested, according to the Wall Street Journal – then Logan Dooley is just waiting for his impressive new fan base.
An entire generation of protesters in Ethiopia, a long-term ally of the United States
Violent Protests in Ethiopia
Government forces have dispersed violent demonstrations calling for political change across Ethiopia.
According to eyewitnesses, several protesters have been shot dead in clashes with police.
Is Ethiopia Destroying?
For the past decade, it has been one of Africa’s most stable and reliable allies in the West, whose economy has grown rapidly.
However, in recent months, the country has been plagued by anti-government protests, which are spreading to wider areas.
Just last week, thousands of people ran into the streets demanding a profound political change.
According to human rights organizations, the government’s reaction was ruthless.
According to eyewitnesses, police shot and killed several unarmed protesters.
The video of the demonstrations supposedly at the end of last year or at the beginning of this year shows how security forces hit young people who have been forced to stand with their hands against the wall.
The UN’s leading human rights official is now demanding thorough research.
“Keeping the country together has always been difficult, and moving forward is even more difficult,” says Rashid Abdi, head of the International Crisis Group for the African Sarvi Project.
After Nigeria, Ethiopia is Africa’s second-largest country in the history of the West.
The U.S. military and intelligence service are closely supporting the Ethiopians in the fight against terror throughout the region, especially in Somalia, and few countries in Africa, if any, will receive so much help from the West.
Ethiopia’s economy has grown at a rapid pace.
Its infrastructure has improved radically, the capital city of Addis Ababa is even a new hub.
The streets of the city are usually peaceful, safe and clean.
However, Ethiopia is still far from being a model for democracy, with human rights organisations reporting on government oppression, opposition in the country is very limited and dissidents are being quickly suppressed.
Many people have been expelled from the country, imprisoned, killed or exiled to a far desert.
But the situation may be changing.
“If the people are suppressed and there is no other option than to show their mind, it will burst out,” said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer at the University of Central Ethiopia.
"The whole youth shows their minds.
“The whole generation is protesting.”
There are many issues of dissatisfaction, ranging from the use of land to the disciplining power of the government coalition.
After last year’s widely criticised elections, the ruling party and its allies took the last place in the opposition, as a result of which they now rule the entire Parliament.
At the same time, tensions are increasing at the Eritrean border, where the heightened situation demanded hundreds of deaths in the June battle.
Analysts fear that in recent years more or less defeated separatist groups, such as the Oromo Liberation Unit or the Ogaden People’s Liberation Unit, may seek to exploit confusion and rearm themselves.
There are many reasons why the fractured mood that has been crawling under the surface for years is unraveling right now.
The first one is obviously innocent: smartphones.
It was only in the last few years that Ethiopians were able to communicate on social media when cheaper smartphones became public and Internet access improved.
Even when the government repeatedly blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, especially during protests, many, however, access the Internet through media servers that encrypt their location.
Many young Ethiopians told me that this was how they called people to protest.
Another reason is the increase in solidarity between Ethiopia’s two largest population groups, the Oromos and the Amharic.
Oromas and amharas are not natural allies.
The Amharas of Ethiopia, mostly Christian, have long controlled the country’s politics and business, and have squandered the pilgrims, most of whom are Muslims and live in sub-regions.
But this too is changing.
“The cooperation is deepening and we are getting under the same umbrella,” says oromo director Mulatu Gemechu.
The biggest protests have been in the areas of Oromo and Amhara.
Many amharas and swarms find that Ethiopia is unjustly ruled by a tiger tribe, representing only about 6% of the population and yet governing the army, intelligence, trade and politics.
The third cause of the unrest is the death of Meles Zenaw.
Former rebel leader Meles was Ethiopia's prime minister for 17 years until he died of an unnamed disease in 2012.
He was considered a tactical nerd who could see behind the corner.
According to analysts, he was particularly skilled in detecting the first signs of dissatisfaction and in using envoys to reconcile the gaps between the counterparties.
“The current government lacks this essential instinct,” says conflict researcher Abdi.
Ethiopia’s new Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn stepped into Meles’s boots due to near-anonymity.
Unlike Meles, who was from the Tigre region of northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam comes from the south.
According to analysts, he does not have the trust of the security forces run by the tiger family.
Many fear that this will mean more bleeding.
For the first time in Ethiopia, similar slogans were experienced in 2005, when thousands of people protested the elections, which the government said were first smuggled and then stolen, according to analysts.
In the post-election riots, many protesters were killed, but fewer people died than in the previous months, and the riots stopped relatively quickly.
Development experts have praised Ethiopia’s leaders for their far-reaching infrastructure planning, such as the new bridge, and for their significant progress in the fight against poverty.
But the internal reluctance to the Ethiopian government has clearly not prevented it from becoming stronger.
And the desire is to take a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, protesters attacked tiger-owned enterprises in the city of Gondar, and anger against tigers is spreading on social media.
According to analysts, the protests put the US and other Western allies in the backing situation.
The U.S. government has used Ethiopia as a base for unmanned, neighboring Somalia-watching aircraft, but the base has recently been closed, according to the United States.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it also does not want its already unstable ally to collapse.
"This requires strict balance," says Abdi.
Donald Trump says he was sarcastic in claiming Obama as the founder of ISIS
On Friday, Donald J. Trump tried to retract his words in his last campaign dispute, claiming he was not serious about claiming President Obama and Hillary Clinton to be the “founders” of ISIS on several occasions this week.
The clarification raised new questions to the Republican side about the ability of the presidential candidate to communicate clearly to the citizens of his country.
His supporters are also in a difficult situation, who must try to defend their candidate in these stormy moments and explain comments that he may not have meant.
Trump said in an election rally on Wednesday evening and repeated in various interviews on Thursday that he really meant what he said when he claimed the president and Hillary Clinton created ISIS.
Earlier on Friday morning, Trump tweeted, saying he was sarcastic.
Trump tweeted his speech from the day before, saying he was completely serious about his allegations in multiple interviews.
When radio host and conservative Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump soften his claim by stating that Obama was trying to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate refused to back down his claim.
The last wave of criticism rose as Trump attempted to focus his campaign back on the economy as the backlash fell.
Trump and Clinton held economic policy talks in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Trump tried to return to the subject.
He warned on Twitter that Clinton’s proposals would raise taxes, and said Clinton’s speech was boring.
Trump has defended the sarcasm in the past.
At the end of July, she received widespread criticism when she appeared to encourage Russians to hack Hillary Clinton’s email. Later she explained her comments by saying, “Of course I was sarcastic.”
In this way, Trump stretches the boundaries of political speech and pulls back his words if necessary.
"I think it's his way of testing certain messages that arouse resentment in his supporters. He looks at how the supporters respond to messages, and "clarify" either way or otherwise depending on the reactions," says the communication expert Ruth Sherman, who has also noted the
"But I also believe that he understands his claims and knows that they are rounded enough to pass through the different branches."
Instead of softening his statements to the general public, Trump has in recent days changed his style even more intrusively as his number of supporters have continued to decline.
A new poll conducted by NBC, Wall Street Journal and Marist on Friday revealed that Trump’s support is considerably less than Clinton’s in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado, while Florida’s situation is roughly equal.
While Trump usually tries to avoid apologizing for his provocative words, he often accuses critics of misinterpreting his words or failing to understand his sense of humor.
But after becoming increasingly closely monitored in the last few months of his presidential campaign, Trump’s jokes have put his loyal supporters in a tempting position where they have to publicly defend Trump’s comments no matter how provocative they may be.
One of Trump’s most prominent supporters, New York’s former mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, vigorously defended the presidential candidate in a CNN interview on Thursday.
“I consider his statements justified, a political speech,” Giuliani said when asked if Trump was truthful in his claim that Obama and Hillary Clinton founded ISIS.
“It’s true in the sense that before Obama, ISIS was almost unknown, a small organization that Obama mistakenly called a ‘lower-series team’ and that’s why it happened because he pulled troops out of Iraq.”
Most Republicans in power are trying to claim that the Obama administration, where Hillary Clinton served as foreign minister, allowed ISIS to continue its operations when it did not deal with the situation in the Middle East.
Prior to Friday’s election in Pennsylvania, Trump continued his attack on the media on Twitter, accusing them of asserting his speeches and discriminating against him.
He mocked "innocent and pitiful" television commentators who were trying to figure it out, but he said they couldn't do it.
Some Democrats mocked Trump’s explanation, saying it would only make it even clearer that he was not fit to be president.
Cafe quits due to unreasonable lease rise opens in Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a bit of a barbecue cafe in Williamsburg, where only cash was used and there was no Wi-Fi, but which offered good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, the cafe was priced out of its street guard at Bedford Avenue when the rent went unreasonable.
Soap Cherie, which replaced Verb Cafe in the summer of 2014, sells soaps in the form of cupcakes.
The locals consider this to be depressing under the middle-classification of the loss of coffee that has been avoided.
Artist Molly Crabapple tweeted: "New York is changing, I know, but I still can't believe that the CBGB club is gone, Chelsea Hotel is destroyed, and Verb is now a soap shop."
But while New York is no longer the same, there is also a new one.
Last November, Verb Cafe opened a new café in Greenpoint, just a mile north of its original location.
The new Verb coffee shop has Wi-Fi and there you can pay by credit card, but some employees are the same and the atmosphere is still unmatched.
Coffee is still good, too.
The owner and head of the new Verb coffee shop is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-time employee of the old coffee shop.
He started at Verb in 2001 and worked there until the end.
When a customer offered to fund the opening of a new café, he said he was very interested in doing so.
Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot of things going.
Verb order bagels from the same supplier as before and use the same espresso machine model.
In addition, it reintroduced even the old Verb lamps.
Rodriguez says he wanted to try something new, too.
Added new products to the list.
Peconi eggs, cheese and sandwiches are available for filling with caprices and browned onion rings.
The list also includes dark seafood.
Coffee no longer gets beer, but instead juices made from fresh fruits.
After holding a coffee shop for nine months, Rodriguez says he noticed that the old standard customers began to visit Verb as a steady stream.
“Many of our old customers were also priced out of Williamsburg,” he says.
One of them is Rebecca Oliveira, who recently went to a cafe on Sunday.
Oliveira, 34, previously lived in Williamsburg and regularly visited Verb.
After moving to Greenpoint, he took a walk to Verby, then in Williamsburg.
When Verb was shut down, he said he had stopped drinking coffee for a while.
"I realized I liked Verb's coffee and culture," he says.
Now he drinks coffee again, although on that Sunday he took a chai tea drink instead of his usual ice-cream coffee, which is also a listing dessert.
Another long-term customer, Tom Rosenthal, has been faithfully attending Verb since 2003.
He always went to the café before work and ordered the same without exception.
“I sat in the cafe every day over seven guards, like a machine, and there they already made my voobagel with all the fillings,” she says.
Image: Rodriguez also wanted to try something new and brought new products from his dining room.
Nowadays, Rosenthal continues to order its standard product, but from time to time he changes his bagels of bacon, egg and cheese fillings.
Rodriguez says there's no shame in the soap shop taking the old place.
Soap Chere owners even offered to make special soap, which is used to make Verbi’s own cold-cooked coffee.
"We can still get on the offer," Rodriguez says.
Even the Polish people who have traditionally lived in Greenpoint have welcomed the coffee with pleasure.
One of the new customers turned the dining room into Polish, and Rodriguez tells us that he is now looking for a place for his new neighbors to feel welcome.
The new location has brought with it other advantages.
The local juice company wants to pull and sell the coffee cold-dried coffee.
The cafe can also be extended to the adjacent building.
However, it is enough for many customers to get their old favorites from the new Verbi.
Joseph Whitt was a regular client in Williamsburg, and he tells us that his heart was broken when the cafe was closed.
When the new place was opened and I ordered a coffee there, it felt as if I had arrived home, says Whitt.
"I lost the smell of coffee."
Great-season food in new work: A Square Meal
In March 1933, shortly after his rise to the presidency, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat for lunch in his office in the White House.
President Roosevelt, known as culinary, was a fan of the luxurious dishes of Fifth Avenue restaurants, such as his hemp pastry and the Maryland tortoise kitchen.
On that day his food was more modest: the devil's eggs in the tomato sauce, the potato sauce and the dessert from the ice cream.
“It was a sign of culinary solidarity for people who suffer,” says Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband, Andrew Coe, added: “It was also a message to Americans how they should eat.”
The couple in Brooklyn Heights is working as a food historian.
Coe’s latest book, Chop Suey, tells the story of Chinese cuisine in America, while Ziegelman’s latest book, 97 Orchard, tells the story of a loft in the Lower East Side district through food.
Their new collaborative work is A Square Meal, published by Harper and published on Tuesday, which depicts the history of American food as a great breeding season of the 1930s.
The couple showed their own culinary solidarity by agreeing to meet a journalist at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a small and ordinary lunch bar near the Flatiron skyscraper and opened in the same year as the big stock market collapse occurred, in 1929.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a cream cheese and olive-filled sandwich and 57-year-old Coe for turkey, apple nuts and mixed vegetables.
When the reporter ordered a meat-maker, the couple said it was appropriate for a discussion about eating a very large lamb season.
"The paints were very popular," says Jane Ziegelman.
"People ate peanut butter, liver butter and pumpkin butter.
They were made of materials that were cheap and sufficient.
Imagine your cancer with so many peanuts that they are enough for a whole meal.”
Andrew Coe's squeezing.
"It had to be pressed on the stomach like lead," he says.
Before the great holidays, the American dining table, especially in the countryside, worked on the buffet principle of "eat as much as you want."
The women made food for the farm workers, and fresh peanuts were served for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
It was the Americans who had sent food to hungry Europeans during the First World War. A Square Meal is a chronic of the ways in which the people survived when they were suddenly forced to abandon superstition.
“This was a time when food became a central and distressing topic for Americans,” Coe said, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
Equally distressing was the new low-cost diet: according to Ziegelman, valued dishes such as pancakes and pancakes became the main food, and pancakes were said to be "a powerful means to take advantage of the dishes", because the cooks could cover with pancakes.
Fresh fruits were replaced with cheaper dried fruits.
Meat, which had been a key part of American food for years, became a cost-effectively used luxury.
Strange mixtures were tried, the main thing was filling the calorie and nutritional values and not so much taste or even healthy cooking.
When researching the book, which also contains recipes, Jane Ziegelman prepared oven bowls filled with peanuts used as short-time dishes.
"It didn't get popularity at the dinner table," says Coe,
Ziegelman added: “It was unreal.
Peanut butter and onion don't fit at all.
This was typical of many household recipes.”
Household experts, such as Louise Stanley, who served as head of the Federal Household Office from 1923 to 1943, guided citizens’ eating habits in an unprecedented and unique way.
They published recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines and encouraged women to be budgeters and to respond to the challenge of making tasty dishes from peppers like carrot-cream cheesecakes.
A Square Meal is a celebration of historic tastings.
Particularly tasty are the reports of the government's reactions to its hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's "and I eat cake".
While he publicly praised his childhood for simple food on an Iowa farm, he himself ate, like a millionaire and sophisticated master who had become him.
"He liked the manner-European cuisine, like fish and peanut butter," Coe says.
"He ate almost in a gold-plated dining room, covered with smoke.
He was completely alienated from reality.”
President Roosevelt could have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor had not encouraged him to set an example in his stomach.
As the book tells us, when Mrs. Roosevelt hired a housewife who was not at all interested in the taste, the food served in the White House was not only Washington’s boringest, but also the worst-manufactured.”
Many of the food during the Lama era was abandoned as soon as the land got back on its feet.
According to Jane Ziegelman, the continuation of the tradition continues to be seen in how we pay attention to calories and nutrients and how science has been applied to cooking.
When writing the book, the couple says that they started to better understand the eating habits of Ziegelman’s mother, for example why she couldn’t throw food away.
“He was really afraid that the food would have to be thrown away,” Coe said.
"People even started to get sick of his food," recalls Ziegelman.
"For example, once in a row."
When the main dishes had been emptied at Eisenberg's lunch bar, Ziegelman and Coe had their home-made snack, the same one President Roosevelt had for lunch.
"It's called a foam foam," Ziegelman says, adding that giving a seemingly name to modest recipes was a common trick.
There was no cream foam, only cream, little flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
We drank our spoon reluctantly in a thick brown coat.
Surprisingly, it didn't taste bad.
Coe felt the second and third time.
"German nuts would make this better," Coe says to his wife, sounding like a positive budgetary.
Gilead Complete Compensation for Hepatitis C Attorney-General’s Claim with Merck
A U.S. District Court judge ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to full compensation for the lawyer’s fees that resulted from a legal dispute over the patent of a hepatitis C drug with the pharmaceutical manufacturer Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was released for <0x24>200 million in damages for infringement of two patents owned by Merck in connection with the success of Gilead’s Sovaldi and Harvoni medicines. A U.S. judge found that Merck had committed violations.
In a lawsuit filed Thursday, U.S. District Court judge Beth Labson Freeman said that Gilead had been entitled to freedom from the lawyer’s fees for defending the case.
Merck is trying to reach Gilead, which controls the market with a new generation of hepatitis C medicines that can treat 90% of hepatitis C patients.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck challenged each other in law and demanded the private ownership of sofosbuvir under laboratory work. Sofosbuvir is the active substance in Gilead medicines.
U.S.-backed troops have conquered the city of Manbij from Isis
U.S.-backed forces have taken possession of the Turkish city of Manjib, near the border, in northern Syria, when the last ISIS militants left the city, a spokesman for the forces said.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) has now raided the city to find the last ISIS fighters hiding in the city.
Sharfan Darwish, a representative of the Manbij military council of the SDF, told Reuters that 2,000 hostages kidnapped by ISIS fighters have been released.
“The city is now entirely in our possession, but we are still conducting search operations,” Darwish said.
The Clintons earned <0x24>10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2 percent of the federal tax.
Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton on Friday released her 2015 tax return, revealing that her and her husband's income at the time was <0x24>10.75 million and the real federal tax rate they paid was 34.2 percent.
In 2015, the Clintons donated <0x24>1 million to charities, most of them to the Clinton Foundation. Former President Bill Clinton made his way to nearly <0x24>5.3 million in speech rewards, and the former Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, announced every <0x24>3 million he had made.
Clinton's Vice Presidential Candidate, Virginia Senator Tim Kaine and his wife Anne Holton announced the 10-year tax returns.
The actual federal tax rate they paid in 2015 was 20.3.
“Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to be a model for economic transparency,” Clinton campaign assistant Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.
The perfect opposite is Donald Trump, who hides behind the excuses and cancels his promises to release his tax returns.
As a result, U.S. presidential candidates have always made their tax information public, even if they are not required by law.
New York businessman Trump and his lawyers have appealed to the tax authorities to check and say that’s why Trump hasn’t released his earnings information.
"The transfer is yours," Clinton's campaign assistant Ian Sams tweeted, referring to tax information.
On Thursday, Trump’s special counsel Michael Cohen told CNN that he will not let Trump disclose his tax details until the checks are complete.
Trump’s critics, including 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other Republican MPs, have said that his refusal to disclose information raises questions about Trump’s own capital, his contributions to charity, his relationships, his relationships with many others.
Clinton has been caught up in this issue and posted a video on the internet on Friday in which he highlights prominent Republicans who are urging Trump to release his tax information.
On Thursday, Clinton raised the issue in a speech on the economy in Michigan.
“Trump refuses to do what every presidential candidate has done for decades, not to make his tax returns public,” Clinton told the crowd.
According to Politico, Trump did not pay any taxes at all or only paid a little bit in the 1990s, and a New York Times business columnist on Friday cited a number of tax analysts and auditors that the situation could still be the same.
The federal tax rate has become a central issue in the presidential election.
Billionaire investor Warren Buffett has called for a rule that would ensure that those earning more than <0x24>1 million a year pay at least 30% of the tax.
President Barack Obama is also in favour of the proposal.
Last week, at a Clinton election rally in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose headquarters in Berkshire Hathaway are located in the same place, challenged a Trump meeting where they would both reveal their tax information.
Buffett says he has also been subject to fiscal audits and that Trump is not afraid of the tax authorities, but of voters.
Clinton’s campaign has published tax returns since 2007.
The Clintons, who now live in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average federal tax of 32 per cent between 2007 and 2014, and the actual combined tax rate they paid was about 40.5 per cent.
According to Clinton’s 2015 tax return, unlike most Americans, only <0x24>100 of their income was wage earnings.
Their main investment was a low-income index investment fund, and the Clintons reported <0x24>109,000 in dividend and interest returns.

Chili-powdered condoms to protect elephants in Tanzania
In Tanzania, conservationists have invented an unusual way to keep elephants away from human habitation – elephants being bullied by throwing chili powder-filled condoms against them.
The idea has proven to be effective, and a few years ago, the Honeyguide Foundation, together with the U.S. Nature Conservancy, has launched a campaign aimed at teaching volunteers in northern Tanzania how to live in shelters and shelters.
Some time ago, elephants were used to harass elephants.
Friday is the World Elephant Day dedicated to the protection of animals.
“As we developed the method, we have seen a change in attitudes in these villages, because now villagers can trust that they can keep the elephants out of their fields without harming them,” said Damian Bell, CEO of the Honeyguide Foundation.
First, the intrusive elephant is alarmed by pointing at the flashlight and playing the torch.
If this does not work, the so-called chili cloud is discarded.
Mixed chili powder is placed in the condom together with the beetle, after which the condom’s head is twisted so that only the ignition wire is left out.
When the ignition wire is ignited, the condom explodes and spreads a fine chili powder cloud into the air.
Usually one spicy cloud is enough to drive an elephant away.
The last means is a throw, which fires a flame known as a Roman candle into the air and produces a loud and bright explosion.
Jewish filmmaker criticises Berlin hotel for removing Israel’s number from Arab ‘encouragement’ – RT News
A French, Jewish filmmaker from his roots gave birth to a media outlet after revealing that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin does not mention Israel in its landing list.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Shoah document on the Holocaust, disapproved of Berlin's Kempinski Bristol by writing an open letter to the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ).
During his recent visit, Lanzmann tried to find a hotel in Israel from a list of available directions.
However, it is not mentioned among the countries to which you can call directly from the room.
“How is it possible that in 2016 in Berlin, the new capital of Germany, Israel has been completely destroyed – as if it didn’t exist?”
Lanzmann writes.
Instead, Kempinski Bristol offers the opportunity to call Israel through a separate call center.
The filmmaker asked for an explanation of the hotel’s reception.
Lanzmann writes that the receptionist's response shocked her.
The receptionist said that the removal of Israel from the list was "a carefully considered decision by the Kempinski hotel management."
The reason behind the action shocked the filmmaker even more.
According to Lanzmann, the official said: "Most of our guests are Arabs, and they are demanding the removal of Israel's number."
In an interview with Suddeutsche Zeitung, Israeli Ambassador Yakov Hadas-Handelsman said the case was "greatly embarrassed".
"The incident shocks and shocks us all.
It's a great shame.
And even more embarrassing is when we take into account that we are in Germany and this is the hotel chain.
No more explanations are needed.
We expect the hotel to make the right conclusions,” said the Ambassador.
The incident caused quite a response on the internet, where it was called a scandal.
Some accused Kempinski of simply surrendering to the claims of Arab customers.
"Cheer up" was said in a publication that highlighted the location of the hotel near the synagogue on Kurfurstendamm Street.
Der Spiegel writes to Lanzmann about the hotel's allegations of quick dispute, calling it a mistake and apologizing.
"A direct order to exclude Israel from the list of addresses has never been given," a Suddeutsche Zeitung Kempinski spokesman said in a statement.
It adds that the code has since been added to the list.
Police used tear gas and rubber scrap in protest against Brazilian students
Students gathered with the police in Sao Paulo on Thursday as they gathered to show their willingness to oppose reforms of the government’s public education system.
The police used tear gas and rubber bands against the protesters.
The mobing began when law enforcement authorities tried to disperse a group of students, as a result of which the police used rubber credentials and tear gas.
Hundreds of students took part in the protest, who wanted to show their outrage at the government’s plans.
Sao Paulo Governor Geraldo Alckmin has made a proposal for a savings measure to close nearly 100 public schools and place 300,000 students in new schools.
Some of the protesters made graffiti on the walls, which temporarily opposed Michel Temer, who served as president.
The student protests took place just a few days after the streets were filled with detachment of President Dilma Rousseff’s supporters when the Senate voted on the official prosecution.
Trade between Russia and Iran has grown by 71% – RT Business
The annual trade between Moscow and Tehran has increased by 70.9 per cent since the withdrawal of sanctions, Russian Ambassador to Iran Levan Dzhagaryan said.
According to him, Russian companies’ interest in business in Iran has increased since the lifting of international sanctions against Iran.
“Russian companies continue to maintain existing relations with Iran, while new companies are ready to enter the market.
The further growth of trade is, of course, one of the priority objectives of cooperation between the countries,” Dzhagaryan says.
He notes that in the first five months of 2016, trade between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 per cent compared to the same period in 2015 and rose to <0x24>856 million.
“In particular, Russian exports to Iran rose rapidly by 91.5 percent, to <0x24>697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16% to <0x24>158 million.
Trade was accelerated by the sale of machines, ground vehicles and weapons,” the ambassador said.
Dzhagaryan also expects the record number of Iranian tourists to travel to Russia this year.
“Last year, the Russian foreign delegation in Iran granted about 35,000 visas to Iranian citizens, most of which were travel visas.
In addition, Iran was among the first 20 countries to visit Russia for the first time in its number of tourists.
And it’s not too daring to say that the record number of Iranian tourists traveling to Russia is breaking this year,” he said.
The number of Russian tourists in Iran is relatively small, which the ambassador hopes will change.
“I can personally recommend traveling to the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, which have preserved the monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition,” he says.
Scottish Callum Skinner wins the British cycling gold
Scotland's Callum Skinner competed in the men's team print at the Rio Velodrome last night, when the UK's three defended the 2012 championship in London.
The 23-year-old Skinner, from Glasgow, played the anchor role that he inherited from his compatriot, Sir Chris Hoyl, and made the legend proud to thank him for the goal and defeating the New Zealand team as a favorite.
Britain took a surprise victory four years ago, when Hoy won the fifth of his six Olympics.
And they repeated the trick after being only placed for the sixth time at the World Cycling Championships held in London on March, despite Hoy’s subsequent abandonment of his competitive career.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of Jamie Staffin, who specialised in the role of the first drawer.
The prices came at just the right time.
Hoy’s decision to end the race also left a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton were trying to fill.
The Scottish Skinner was a man in whom the British coaches believed and where they saw the potential that he has now redeemed.
Hindes and Hoy, who won the championship four years ago, Kenny and Skinner made an Olympic record over time, but in the first round New Zealand was faster.
And the British trio won gold in the doubles.
Hindes was just behind after his lap, but Kenny made an effort to lead the team, which Skinner retained.
Much of the change was to change the strategy in such a way that Hindes drove the pace in order to slow down at a larger gear, thanks to which Kenny and Skinner in particular were able to keep pace.
Today followed her position as a BBC commentator and reached the eye of Skinner, Kenny, and Hindes as they entered the awards ceremony.
The 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow says: “I’m impressed by the comparison.
I'm just trying to do my best and succeed.
We made the Olympic record in the finals and won the world champions.
It was unbelievable.
There is no better way to win it.”
After winning in London in 2012, Hindes admitted, along with Kenny and Hoy, that he had fallen on the track due to a deliberately bad departure.
Later, he cancelled his word, and Britain’s competitors had no recourse.
This time, no such problems were associated with the victory of the sovereigns.
Hindes says: “The feeling was like in London, all the flags of the UK were lying in sight.
Our team has been unified over the last three months.
We’ve lost so many world championships that winning the Olympics feels great.”
In other words, one competition, one gold medal for the country, which won seven of the ten track championships in both Beijing and London.
If this is a gauge of progress over the past five months, the successful five days on the debtodrome are ahead.
As Kenny has demonstrated his abilities, it is not impossible to imagine that he will repeat Hoy's achievements and win three Olympic golds in one Olympics.
This would sign up for six gold medals and one silver medal for Kenny, who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoyta and was born on March 23 (the magical date of British sport, which is also the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister).
At the same time, the medals would be the same as Hoyla.
Kenny is competing in the next sprint, which starts today and resolves in three days.
Bolton’s 28-year-old Kenny says: “At the moment, I can only enjoy this.
Team competition is always the best.
You can enjoy the win with your friends.
“Winning alone is a little lonely.”
Hindes says, "If he wins another two gold medals, he has to get the knight's value."
This was the only medal race of the day, but Britain got more good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull were the fastest four men in the team race.
Their time was 3:51,943.
The world record, made in London in 2012 and won gold, is 3:51,659.
The first round and the final (22.42pm) will be competing today on the second day of the competition, and the focus of attention will certainly be Wiggins.
Yesterday, he had a dispute with the competitors before the deadline, when the journalists invited him to measure his length.
Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald from Milngavian reached a world record time of 4:13,260.
The UK team can now count on its great cycling team to take responsibility for the mid-stage Olympics and bring a number of medals to the country.
After the really exceptional evidence of the full leadership position in Beijing and London, the expectations before Rio have been underestimated.
There have been dramas, the least of which is the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April amid allegations of sexism and harassment, and the end of major athletes such as Hoyn and Victoria Pendelton.
However, the competitions held on the first night at the Velodrome show that Britain’s already legendary reputation to rise to the top at the perfect moment will once again take place.
The future of the Portland melting plant on the verge of termination of the electricity deal
The future of the aluminum melting plant in Portland, Victoria, and thus the jobs of thousands of workers are in demand when the power plant supplying the melting plant said that one of the owners of the plant is discontinuing the supply contract and that all the supply contracts are expected to be terminated.
This is the result of the decision taken earlier this year by the Victorian Government not to continue to support the operation of the plant.
Fixed, 20-year-old aid will be discontinued in November.
The Alcoan Portland plant is at risk of losing up to 2,000 jobs.
Due to cancellations, up to 2,000 direct or indirect jobs may be at risk.
The snowball effect can continue to increase, as the melting plant consumes about 10 percent of Victoria’s total electricity production.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry melthouse, as a result of which the Anglesea power plant had to be closed last year.
Alcoan Portland's melting pot loses money and is in danger of having to close its doors.
The measures are similar to speculations that have been used for years on the future of the plant, first caused by the strong Australian dollar and recently by the price of the plant’s production.
AGL, which supplies electricity from its Loy Yang A plant in Latrobe Valley to a large aluminum melting plant, says it expects three other melting plants owners to terminate their contract.
The majority of the plant is owned by Alcoa and Alumina, a joint venture between the Chinese CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp.
AGL says it expects the Portland plant to remain in operation, which means that physical electricity demand for the melting plant will continue.
AGL says the agreements are so-called protection agreements, which were due to enter into force in November 2016.
The termination period of the contracts is 12 months, so they expire in 2017.
“As a result, AGL expects contracts to generate revenue in the financial year 2017,” says the power plant.
The potential returns on AGL from fiscal year 2018 onwards are currently limited by strong future market outlooks for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL says it has already lowered the value of the agreements by <0x24>187 million in its accounting “in advance of termination of the agreements.”
According to Alcoa, the decision to terminate contracts "does not affect Alcoa's ... ability to keep the melting plant in operation or to secure the electricity supply to the melting plant".
The U.S. company said it had signed a 20-year deal with Loy Yang in 2010, which was due to enter into force from November this year, although it still has to figure out why it has now expired.
Due to the weak economic situation of the sector, analysts have been cautious about their estimates of both the melting plant in Portland, Victoria, and the Tomago plant near Newcastle.
AGL chief operating officer Stephen Mikkelsen told analysts in a speech earlier this week that Portland uses about 600 megawatts of electricity per year and Tomago about 900 megawatts per year.
“If these factories leave the market, it means a significant decline in demand in the (electric) market.
As a producer, it would not be good news for us,” Mikkelsen says.
Kardashian TV star Kendall in September as Vogue's portrait girl
The Kardashian-Jenner Clan model and his mother and manager Krisis' fourth daughter Kendall Jenner, 20, poses in the famous September issue of the United States Vogue.
Kendall, who is Estee Lauder’s advertising face and has appeared at fashion weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on his Instagram account on Thursday.
“Looking at the can in the room that was full of my loved ones made me cry,” Kendall wrote.
The announcement was followed by a strange (or maybe just following the style of the Kardashian series?), a scripted video featuring all the members of the Kardashian-Jenner family (bar disturbances Rob and Caitlyn's and all of the favorites of the bands.
The story is a cliche, and it is used in almost all the birthday periods of Asten programs (Seacrest says the words, "Did you think we forgot you?" just as sincerely as a children's morning TV drawing character), but Kris had to bring his other daughters somehow to this Christmas.
The September issue of the Vogue is undoubtedly a new era for the Kardashians.
Kendall's granddaughter Kim may have filed a Vogue lawsuit earlier (she appeared in Vogue's suit with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the September issue of the magazine is quite personal.
The September issue is Vogue’s best-selling edition of the year.
Its thickness is more like a print book than a fashion magazine, which attracts a large number of advertisers (the annual Fashion website estimated that last year’s 832-page publication had 615 pages of ads).
The publication of the September issue is so eagerly awaited that in the past two years the magazine’s images have already leaked to the public before the official announcement.
Previously, September’s portrait models include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have been more model-working celebrities in the suit than models that are celebrities.
Oscar-winning and Dior-advertising face Jennifer Lawrence was featured on the cover in 2013, and a year later, the honor was given to Lady Gaga.
The magazine describes Jenner as the success model of his generation, and even though he would rather be among the celebrities working for the model, he is still pretty good with him.
These celebrities are not relatives of well-known people, real-tv stars, or modern kids who know how to make a good Snapchat video (although Jenner is all of these).
They can rightly be called talented women who are more successful in the entertainment industry than others.
Last year, Beyoncé was one of the strongest years of her career when she released her Lemonade album.
Not everyone is happy with Jenner’s success.
Due to its true TV background, Jenner’s role in the fashion world will always be a staple.
In June, Victoria's Secret's original model Stephanie Seymour criticized Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid by calling them "narutos".
These feelings have resurfaced as news of Jenner’s appearance in the Vogue costume came to light.
However, the continuous exacerbation of dissatisfaction seems irrelevant.
Kendall Jenner is Vogue's September issue cover model.
She's a supermodel, in the purest sense of the word.
He walks in the fashion shows of Marc Jacobs.
She's the advertising face of Estee Lauder's makeup.
He and all his sisters are selling pictures of themselves through paid apps.
She sells pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter, which she photographed to LOVE magazine.
And in her spare time she appears on real TV, perhaps just as a way to meet her sister and this kid.
Legal aid centers turn away 160,000 people a year
Every year, more than 160,000 people in the most vulnerable countries are displaced from the centres of justice, and the sector is preparing for the impact that additional cuts will have on the centres already operating at borders.
In the state of Queensland, five of those seeking free legal aid and legal services are already displaced by three people, most of whom are elderly, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence, unjustified marriages and human resources, and similar injustices.
Public legal aid services, already overloaded with workload, are preparing for additional cuts in appropriations.
As of June next year, legal aid centres are at risk of losing an additional 30% of federal funding.
The head of the Queensland Public Aid Centre, James Farrell, said that according to the latest calculation report by the National Aid Centres Organization, thousands of people are being displaced from the centres every year.
If the federal government does not turn its back on its decision, Farrell says the situation will only get worse.
“Queensland’s public law centres are continuously underfunded, which means that thousands of people are being turned away when applying for the services they need,” Farrell says.
“People who leave strong relationships, people who are under unmanageable and disastrous debt, families who are separated, unreasonably fired workers – all of them have problems with legal matters, and this report shows that they are unable to get help.
The federal government plans to cut funding by 30 percent from June 2017, which means that thousands of Queensland’s most vulnerable people will have to cope with complex legal problems without help.
We call on the Chancellor of Justice and Senator George Brandis of Queensland to give up these financial cuts immediately so that people can get the legal assistance they need.
Last year, the state government fulfilled its promise to bring legal aid funding to the national medium-sized level.
Now it is time to take into account the needs of public law centres and their clients, and the Palaszczuk government must invest in this important work."
Donald Trump’s Campaign to Threaten Employees with a Gun
New York: Donald Trump's campaign was appealed after no action was allegedly taken after it was told the campaign's leader had threatened an employee with a gun while driving a Jeep in February.
The incident is described in a lawsuit filed by former state campaign software instructor Vincent Bordini in a state court in Charlotte on Wednesday.
Bordini said he had waited months for the situation to be dealt with within the campaign before he realized, in his own words, that this was not going to happen.
In his complaint, Bordini said campaign leader Earl Phillip "appointed the pistol, put his right thumb on the pawl, and pressed the pipe on Vincent's knee."
According to the lawsuit, after a complaint was filed against the local and regional leaders, Bordini was informed that at least four other people had experienced the same experience with Phillip.
"Even if the gun was not fired, it would cause damage," Bordini said in his complaint.
The lawsuit comes just two days after the Republican presidential candidate sparked public anger when he told the North Carolina crowd that “the supporters of the second additional article” – which hold gun owners and gun fighters – can take action if the candidate and his opponent Hill decide to take action.
According to Trump’s campaign staff, the media removed his word from the context and Trump said it did not encourage violence.
In his complaint, Bordini demanded compensation from the campaign for indifference and compensation from Phillip for overcrowding, abuse and their mental suffering.
Trump spokesman Hope Hicks did not immediately respond to a message asking for comment.
Phillips hasn't been reached in spite of the efforts.
Charlotte’s local news agency, WCCB, said the Phillip campaign had recently been abandoned.
The call request submitted to Phillip’s consulting firm, the Innovative Consulting Service, was not answered immediately.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has run a controversial campaign.
Court Case: Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court of Justice, Superior Court Division County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Britain needs to use the Olympic spirit to expand Heathrow
Heathrow also revives the economy and creates prosperity – not only in local communities and in London, but throughout the country.
For me, this was the most interesting thing in Heathrow, and as at the 2012 Olympics in London, we worked hard to make sure that all of our nation and all of our regions benefit from it.
The Olympics were of great benefit to Stratford and the East End.
We do this again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
For local communities alone, we are creating 10,000 new learning contracts and 40,000 new jobs, eliminating youth unemployment in the vicinity of the airport.
As at the 2012 London Olympics, there are always people who think Heathrow’s enlargement is too big a challenge.
As far as the Olympics are concerned, I have heard that Britain will never be ready for them and that we will face a painful situation in the eyes of the rest of the world.
The suspects were wrong in 2012, and they will also be wrong about Heathrow.
Overcoming obstacles will always be faced, but Heathrow will answer every question asked.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project that benefits many rather than a few.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create up to 180 000 new jobs and boost the economy by <0xC2><0xA3>211 billion, bringing expertise and employment to both the airport environment and the UK as a whole.
We have a great team at Heathrow, which has implemented in time and keeping the budget of an infrastructure investment programme of <0xC2><0xA3>11 billion, which included the T5 terminal – voted the best four-year flight terminal in the world for two consecutive years – and the T2 terminal for two consecutive years.
Now they are ready to produce a third thank-you route, supported by a private investment of <0xC2><0xA3>16 billion.
The 2012 Olympics in London have been a great success for our country, and I am convinced that it will also be Heathrow's enlargement.
It is time to use the same Olympic spirit to enlarge Heathrow so that we can guarantee the future of our trade and create the skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is the chairman of the Heathrow Board and former secretary of the Treasury Department.
Adblock Plus and Facebook Advertising Service in Cat and Mouse Games
Attempts by companies earning money from online advertising to mislead advertising software have turned into cat-mouse games, says one company that produces obstacle programs.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced on its own page that it was blocking adware programs, Adblock Plus published a blog post in which it said users could update their obstruction software filters and thus again block community ads.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that it would modify its desktop site’s ad tag codes to make it harder for ads to identify which parts of the page are ads.
But now Adblock says he has discovered new codes.
Adblock spokesman Ben Williams wrote in his blog post that "such a bullying between the open-source ad community and deceptive advertisers has been underway since the ad campaign was invented" and that it is possible that Facebook will soon re-create its own repair shop.
The fact that the world’s largest social media company has participated in the fight is a strong indication of how much concern advertisers have become in the industry.
An estimated 200 million people worldwide are using advertising testing programs, according to a study by Pagefair and Adobe last year, which has nearly quadrupled since 2013.
Facebook is used daily by 1.03 million active users on mobile devices, and mobile ads already account for 84% of Facebook ads.
However, the company intends to invest in deceiving ads in its desktop application, as, according to the informant, mobile advertising blockers do not work in Facebook mobile apps and Instagram.
Revenues from desktop ads are still high enough, which is why Facebook considered the effort to be profitable.
On Tuesday, Facebook said it would update its Advertising Settings tool to allow users more control over how ads are targeted.
On Thursday, Facebook criticized Adblock’s new filters, saying they also blocked the viewing of some ordinary Facebook posts.
“This is not a good experience for users, and we’re going to solve the problem,” a Facebook spokesperson said in an email.
“Advertising preference programs are tricky and ineffective, and that’s why we’ve invested in developing user settings such as advertising tools so that people can control the targeting of ads themselves.”
Woman commits suicide by lying under cars on Swiss highway
The victim slept on the highway in the middle of the night.
The police are asking eyewitnesses for help on the highway in the first hours of Thursday's accident, in which the woman was deliberately left under several cars.
The accident occurred on the A1 motorway in Vaud, near Morges, shortly after midnight.
The woman committed a desperate act by setting herself on a dark road, and several cars hit her, Vaud police said in a statement.
The victim was a 49-year-old Swiss woman, who apparently wanted to commit suicide, including a truck.
The woman died at the scene.
According to the police, many drivers involved in the accident have already been interviewed, but some are still unidentified. Police are asking them or other eyewitnesses of the accident to report.
Lawyer Gilles Hofstetter says in the Le Tribune de Geneve newspaper that a criminal investigation has been initiated, which is a logical step in a situation like this.
However, it remains to be seen whether the charges against the drivers involved in the accident are raised.
"Was it impossible to avoid a collision?
It remains for the prosecutor to find out,” says Hofstetter.
In the last five years, there have been two similar cases where drivers are not held responsible.
In both cases, the person walked on a dark highway and the court ruled that drivers could not wait to hit their pedestrians on the highway in the middle of the night.
Last year, the police were released on charges brought against him of murder after he collided with a man lying on the A1 motorway near Paynerna on one August night in 2014.
The court heard that the 22-year-old victim had consumed a lot of alcohol and dropped off on the road.
The court found that the policeman, who was responding to an emergency call, had a justified way of driving and that the man lying on the road was "a completely exceptional and unpredictable situation".
Any person who knows about the accident on Thursday near Morges is asked to call the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA’s climate model: Venus has been viable
According to NASA’s new climate model, Venus may have been viable.
NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) has developed a model that uses the same tools and algorithms to explore Venus' past as climate scientists use.
The model was intended to determine whether the conditions on Venus could have been similar to those on Earth, although Venus is hot and anhydrous on its surface and its gas atmosphere is almost entirely carbon dioxide.
According to previous research, Venus’ slow rotation rate is explained by its thick gaseous atmosphere.
However, the latest simulation suggests that Venus has had a thin, Earth-like atmosphere, and it has nevertheless rotated slowly.
The model was also used to determine the early surface formation of Venus.
There were probably more dry areas on the planet than on Earth, but there may have been enough water and geographic variation to maintain life and prevent rapid evaporation.
The early Venus also benefited from the sun, which was 30% darker.
"In the GISS modelling, Venus rotates slowly and has a day-half sunshine of almost two months at a time," said GISS researcher Anthony Del Genio in a press release.
This heats the surface and produces rain, which creates a thick cloud layer. The cloud layer acts like a rain shield and protects the surface largely from the sun's heat.
As a result, the average temperatures of the climate are even a few degrees lower than the current temperatures of the Earth.
The model was used to create the story of Venus, which corresponds to previous assumptions by planetary scientists about its evolutionary cost.
Although Venus may have been viable, it has been exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet light for several billions of years.
Its oceans evaporated, and the ultraviolet light burned the evaporated water.
In the hydrogen karate space, only a thick carbon dioxide-containing atmosphere and a deadly greenhouse effect – that is, Venus as it is today.
The researchers reported the results of the new Venus climate modelling in Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigns as Avalanche coach
Patrick Roy resigned on Thursday as Colorado Avalanche coach and deputy chief of ice hockey, drawing on the lack of influence in the team's decision-making.
Colorado Deputy Chief Executive Officer/Chef Joe Sakic confirmed the news and announced that the company will immediately begin to apply for a new coach.
“For the past three years, I have been the lead coach of the Colorado Avalanche team and the deputy manager of ice hockey with a strong, passionate and decisive attitude,” said 50-year-old Roy in a statement.
“During the summer, I have been thinking long and hard about how I could improve the team, give it the depth it needs, and raise it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this, the coach and the Deputy Director of Ice Hockey must be completely on the same lines as the organization.
He must also have the authority to make decisions that affect the team’s performance.
These conditions are not met at the moment.”
Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Royta for his contribution to the team.
"Patrick told me about his decision today," Sakic says.
“We are grateful for everything he has done for our organization, and we wish him all the best for the future.”
Roy was awarded the Jack Adams Award as the best coach of the league of the year for his first season as the head coach of Avalanche from 2013 to 2014.
Under his leadership, the team reached 112 points and won the central division, but Colorado lost to Minnesota in the drop-off games and has not been able to continue in the last two years.
Avalanche scored 39–39–4 points in the 2015–16 season and stayed five points ahead of Minnesota Wilds playing from a second Wild Card spot in the Western Conference.
Hall of Fame goalkeeper Roy won four Stanley Cups in his career – two in the Montreal Canadiens and two in the Avalanche.
North Sea Oilers to Start Negotiations and Suspend Law
The chief negotiators say the North Sea oil-grown fisheries will be suspended as all parties to the dispute take part in a new round of negotiations.
Wood Group, which provides oil field services, has been on strikes with drilling boards under the control of Royal Dutch Shell, located in the North Sea.
According to a joint statement by the parties, "Wood Group and the trade unions Unite and RMT confirm their agreement to restart the process in order to resolve the dispute".
From the beginning of next week, we will be holding a number of long-lasting meetings throughout the day for the coming weeks, where we will deal with problems from fresh perspectives.
The trade unions justified their recent activity, which they said was the first in more than 25 years, in protest of a maximum of 30% wage cuts.
Due to the negative market pressures, Wood Group will cut the tariffs of its North Sea contractors this year by around 9%.
The reduction in the company's tariffs is in line with the fall in the prices of contractors working in the country by 10% in 20114.
According to the company, the additional cuts will give it the space needed to cope with the downturn in the market.
Shell, in turn, has cut off thousands of employees from its employees and announced plans to leave oil and gas drilling operations in up to 10 countries, aiming to improve its operations after its megafusion with British energy company BG Group.
Lower crude prices and the economic situation resulting from Britain's decision to leave the European Union in June are putting pressure on energy companies.
Scottish MEP Dave Anderson met with the leaders of the labour force earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest jobs experienced in the North Sea for a whole generation.
According to him, the North Sea is vital to the region’s economy.
“In the North Sea and across the country, we need an economy that benefits many, not just a few,” says Anderson.
New projects in the North Sea are expected to be spent less than <0x24>1.4 billion in 2016, compared to about <0x24>7 billion in the last five years.
Kepler measures the rotational speed of stars in the Pleiadian constellation
The newest task of the Kepler Space Telescope has been to measure the rotational speed of stars, which has helped astronomers compile the most comprehensive list of the rotational speeds of stars in the Pleiadian cluster to date.
Astronomers will be able to figure out why the stars of the same cluster rotate at different speeds and how the orbital times are related to the formation of planets.
“We hope that by comparing the results to other clusters, we will learn more about the relationship between weight and age of the star and even the history of its solar system,” said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech’s Infrastructure Processing and Analysis Center at the University of Pasadena.
The Pleiadian constellation is located 445 light-years from Earth.
Many of the star clusters were born about 125 million years ago, which means that they are just reaching their adulthood.
They are running faster than ever at the moment.
When the speed of rotation is at its peak, large amounts of adult stars are released from the stellar wind.
These winds have a braking effect on the stars as they move through the magnetic fields of the stars.
As the star agees, its rotational speed starts to slow.
Kepler measures the rotational speed of each star by tracking the time between the occurrence of identifiable star spots (equivalent to solar spots).
The latest rotational speed data listed indicates that the larger stars rotate more slowly than the smaller ones.
Rebull compares stars to dancers – the bigger ones spin faster than the smaller ones.
"We see from the Pleiadian 'dance' that the slow spins are typically larger, while the fastest spins are typically very light stars," says Rebull.
Because the Pleiadian star cluster is so close, it acts as an ideal space lab to compare the properties of the stars in relation to the rotational speeds.
"The Pleiadian Stars Team provides support for both younger and older star rotation theoretical models," says Rebull.
We want to learn more about how, when and why the stars slow down their rotational speed and stop "dancing".
With his colleagues, Rebull presents his latest analysis of the speeds of the Pleiades in three new articles, which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
