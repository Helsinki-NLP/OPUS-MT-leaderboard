The great return of the Czech smolar is approaching.
Pavel French was named to the NHL.
Czech hockey goalkeeper Pavel Francouz, who has been going through a difficult period in recent months, is returning to the NHL.
The thirty-one-year-old Pilsen will be on the switch and could soon get into the gate as well.
The former goalkeeper of Lithuania, Plzna and Chelyabinsk was injured in preparation for the NHL in October this year.
He switched to Vegas in the middle of the game and hasn’t played in the NHL since then.
The incident occurred when the experienced goalkeeper moved from one bar to the other.
"Pavel, the Frenchman, will be out about three to four weeks with an injury in the lower part of the body," the Denver team said in a statement.
His return to the NHL was eventually extended for more than two months.
On Sunday morning, he was summoned from a farm where he captured four duels and showed his old form.
The AHL accounted for 94.5% of the operations.
The defender of Pilsen hockey wants to finally step in and confirm that he belongs to the best league in the world.
He had problems with his hips in the last semester and in the shortened pandemic semester he did not catch a single match.
In the NHL "Francík" caught 36 matches, his success of operations is at 92.3%.
Charles on Christmas Wishes Camille Rush, William and Kate pose in Jordan
British Prince William and his wife Kate have chosen a family photo taken while traveling to Jordan as their Christmas wish.
Prince Charles also published his wish, which used a photograph on which Camille's coat of arms helped to place a scarf.
On its website, the British news station BBC reported on it.
Wishes are sent to friends, co-workers and foundations with which they work.
The photo was taken somewhere in the desert.
The Duchess of Cambridge is dressed in long summer dresses in khaki color and the dress is also worn by Princess Charlotte.
Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, wears a shorts and a t-shirt with a collar, just like Prince George and Louis.
Who took the photo, William and Kate didn't say, it's not even clear when exactly it came about.
Last year, the royal family posed for photography as a Christmas wish on a straw pack in front of a pile of wood at their rural headquarters in Norfolk County.
The photo, which serves as a Christmas wish, was also published by Prince Charles's successor to the throne with his wife Camilla.
Photographer Sam Hussein was captured in June in Ascot.
Charles, who has a cylinder on her head and a scarf on her face, helps Camille put her scarf in a color-aligned dress.
According to efotbal.cz, Slavia promised Berbro a million for the title, Trvidik denied it.
Prague – Criminalists in the current corruption case have allegedly worked on the fact that the accused former vice president of the Czech Football Association Roman Berbr had promised from Prague Slavia a million crowns for the 2018/19 league title.
He informed about this server efotbal.cz with the fact that he got to part of the police records.
The chairman of the board of the club, Jaroslav Tvrdík, said that the red-and-white people did not tolerate any corruption.
The server published a transcript of police interviews, in which Slavia mainly depicts its former sports director Jan Nezmar, who finished in the championship club last summer.
A former influential official of the red-and-white was reportedly in frequent contact with both Berbre and the former sports director of Vy<0xC5><0xA1>ehrad, Roman Rogoz, who is also in the case among the accused.
The criminals allegedly worked on the information that Slavia Berbrovi had promised a financial reward for winning the title.
In 2019, the team of SK Slavia Prague won the title in the first league.
The police authorities had knowledge that for the win in the league, Roman (Berbr) should have a promising million-dollar payment from the officials of SK Slavia Praha, the server quoted from the file.
A day later, according to the criminals, Berbr met not only Nezmar, but also the chairman of the chairmanship of Slavia Tvrdik.
According to the server, it is no longer clear from the file whether the police are still investigating this information.
The allegations of corruption have been rejected.
Between 2015 and 2017, we actively tried to change the proportions of Czech football and offered an opposing alternative to its development.
We have never committed illegal acts, we have not committed to influencing the referees in violation of the fair play rules, and we have not given anyone any financial fulfillment in this regard," he said.
In the interviews, Nezmar indiscriminately insults some former players of Slavia’s dark skin and also insults his former boss Tvdík.
The cause of the alleged influence of the matches through the referees launched a police intervention in several places in mid-October last year, including the Prague headquarters of the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R.
The highest position in the affair is Berbr, who no longer plays in any of the football features.
In mid-January, like the former sports director Vy<0xC5><0xA1>ehrad Rogoz, he was released from prison.
Helicopters, tanks and bvp are larping cold wars.
Works will be new, but in principle of a worse type (workers must come from the armored cabin and carry cartridges manually without cover).
Cars - Toyota hi-lux - are new and good
Trucks and various armored vehicles - at a decent level, in addition, Prague V3S has already managed to get rid of even specialized units.
Airplanes: combat- decent, but at the end of the rental, transport - very small with a short flight, but modern.
Drones - little and only small types without combat potential
Missiles - we do not have at all (but we manufacture and export abroad)
PVO: medium-cold-war, obsolete; short-range - good, modern, relatively good number.
I have a story like that.
I've got a hunter right next to town.
Nutrition fell from the river and damaged the crops, so I was sitting there.
When I arrived, I saw that there was a fisherman on the other side of the river.
I didn't want to make a burdel, so I sat quietly and the guy probably didn't notice me.
I was hoping she'd leave before something came out, but of course the fox was gone in a moment.
I let her come 40 yards before I decided to shoot.
The poor fisherman barely fucked up, mowing his head on all sides, so I summoned him that it was on the fox.
Before I got out of the seat, it was a fake.
I mean, the crazy man was a Prussian.
On the other hand, it's not a war, it's got to be a bunch of coincidences to happen, you'd probably see in the thermovisi that almost everyone has today.
So in a visible place, dear things put your legs in a sleeping bag and you should be fine.
Warriors versus Hama<0xC4><0x8D>ek.
Inside, respirators get significantly cheaper than the Ministry of Health
The state, responsible for the purchase and distribution of scars, masks and respirators for the profession closest to the coronavirus, has issued billions of crowns in recent weeks to purchase them.
The iRozhlas server compared the purchases of individual ministries and found that in a single day, the amounts per respirator varied by up to hundreds of crowns.
Why are prices so dramatically moving?
Which governments have behaved economically?
Why did others buy rice?
Lenka Kabrhel talks with the editor of the iRozhlas server Dominika Kubi<0xC5><0xA1>tov.
I appreciate the soldiers and the army (almost not affected by the memories of the CSLA that passed through older generations), but the Czech Republic cannot benefit from the mandatory war.
We don’t even have a large inventory of techniques that training could take place, we don’t actually have modern technology even for existing professionals, in addition, modern technology is becoming more and more complex, so the skills of inventors will quickly lose in time.
To do this, modern conventional conflicts, where anyone can deploy them, will take place very quickly, there will be no time to exercise someone again.
And finally, backers/territorial defenses are of great importance for countries like Ukraine, where the mass guerrilla is going to lead, and this is also a pronounced necessity to deter the enemy.
In the territory of the Czech Republic, the struggle will only be fought in such a conflict of magnitude and intensity, where the guerrilla will be irrelevant, and we do not have a suitable geography for that.
We do not have individual skills.
That's not even the worst.
The worst part is that half of them play as if they had it.
It's like looking at a guy who didn't hit an empty gate two minutes ago, riding into an attack by himself between two or even three Swiss, and saying, "You know, what do you think will happen now?"
Of course, he's being treated like an average taxpayer.
The situation with this "defensive" skill is so awful that I'm sure I'm honestly surprised to see our attacker beating one of his opponents.
The first patrols
The COVID pandemic is slowing down, but experts are not expecting a major turnaround for the coming weeks.
The strain in hospitals according to statistical models will continue for some time, and a new unknown has been added to the pandemic equation: the omicron variant, which is very likely to spread faster than the current dominant Delta.
At the same time, it is not possible to say with absolute certainty whether it can cause a more serious course, as much as vaccination or post-infected immunity obtained from the previous course of the disease helps against it.
However, this week an unexpected phenomenon has also entered the COVID equation on the side of the pros: the possibility of treatment.
A new drug, the antiviral molnupiravir, has arrived in the Czech Republic, which reduces the risk of severe disease and associated hospitalization by a third and can be treated at home.
And soon it should also be supplemented with the drug paxlovid from Pfizer, which from the results so far reports a success rate of even 85 percent.
However, the first deliveries of molnupiravir to the Czech Republic, in addition to the hope of expanding the portfolio of tools useful in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic, also highlighted the question of how the local administration is prepared for incoming medicines.
As it has been said, the first to be delivered to domestic patients is molnupiravir from Merck.
The company ended up on the ribbon first and because the drug began to develop long before the outbreak of the current pandemic in order to find a suitable treatment for the viral diseases of horses on the South American continent.
This research often overlooks the fact that people in the West (Germany, Sweden, etc.)
They are generally less open and do not openly share their opinions.
Therefore, Eastern Europeans, and especially we Czechs, are accustomed to talking "how our toothbrush has grown".
See you do research where people ask if they like Muslims.
In the Czech Republic, most people will say no.
In the West, they will tell you how much they like migration, how everyone should help them, and how we Czechs are a racist bastard.
And then they go and choose the party as the AfD.
They're afraid to cancel culture, to say this in public means a loss of work and a media lynch.
Then it looks nice in the surveys, west good, east bad.
But they really find out what people think.
Only in France, Le Pen and Zemmour, both have more than 20%, according to the survey.
We even know that the objects are three in the Czech Republic and completely identical.
Identical due to the rotation of units so that the soldiers do not have to re-learn where it is, so all objects on the hair are the same.
One of them is the Atom Brdy Museum and the other two are abandoned.
The funny thing is that the SSR did not want to have a nuclear warhead on its own territory, either because of the security or the speed of deployment of the warheads due to a more western position.
In those underground covers (there are two in each feather) only the heads were kept, not the entire rocket as they say.
If it was necessary to deploy this weapon, a special unit arrived, which picked up this head and mounted it on some portable device.
In addition to the museum feathers, the remaining ones are in a desolation state.
We had a fellow gypsy in the second grade of elementary school, we were with him for 4 years.
He was all right, he made good jokes, he often showed up too much, but it was like our mascot.
Everyone was having fun with him, he often went and wanted to explain something, he missed a little, he went regularly, he played sports with us, he didn’t steal snacks, or phones, he walked cleanly dressed.
He was also riding in schools in nature, doing various monkey shops, but he was fine, maybe never a breakthrough.
In the eighth or ninth grade, the siblings, the gypsies, entered the same year, other classes.
Shortly thereafter, the teacher was beaten up, the police were often there, threatening and threatening other students.
I personally sometimes sell something to advertise (old things, something I don’t need, etc.) and I’ve been selling often to gypsies, they always had money, they didn’t try to pull me at the price, communication quietly.
I even sold a car like this, the guy in a month called that he's already overwritten it.
I say of myself that I’m not a racist, I don’t care if someone is white, black, yellow, blue or different, as long as they behave as they belong in decent society (work, work, women don’t bother, just ordinary behavior).
But when someone comes, he stretches his hand, he sweeps out apartments and houses, he's got a mess around him, he's making trouble... so no matter what color, he's gonna bother me.
I have no problem with African migrants, if they get involved with us, start business, work, learn a language (not necessarily, at least English), respect our culture.
If they believe in Allah, I don't care as long as they respect my tradition and culture, I'll be there for them.
A young woman died in a car accident at Prachaticka
“The young woman suffered serious multiple injuries and, despite resuscitation care, unfortunately suffered her injuries on the spot,” said Zuzana Fajtlová, a spokeswoman for South Korean health workers.
The accident was probably blamed by the driver who took the girl.
The eighteen-year-old driver of the Peugeot car was probably heading from the village of <0xC5><0xBD>i<0xC5><0xA1>ovec to the village of Bavorov and, for unknown reasons, went in the opposite direction.
After the collision with <0xC5><0xA0>koda Octavia, the Peugeot vehicle ended on the roof outside the road, South Korean police spokesman <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>pánka Schwarzová described the accident.
The young driver of Peugut suffered a very serious injury in the accident.
There were many injuries and he was witched in the car.
After his pardon, he had to be given acute pre-hospital care and in stable condition he was transported by air to the Czechoslovak hospital, said the rescuer Fajtlová.
She added that the man from the second car suffered a minor chest injury and was taken to the hospital.
New rules apply to packages from countries outside the EU, customers often do not provide data about them
Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Neuheisl orders from abroad several times a month.
It is mainly used to collect collecting cards.
“Usually it can be dozens of dollars, say from ten dollars above where it’s still worth importing, especially from Japan, where mail is often free,” the collector says.
Since October, the order for small shipments has been slightly delayed, newly added VAT and postage must pass the data to the customs procedure.
He will receive an e-mail with the message that the customs are expecting the arrival of the package.
Then simply fill in the consignment details, and if the merchant has not already included VAT at the time of sale, the customs office will calculate it from the total amount for the consignment and for the freight.
In the event that the addressee does not secure the customs procedure on its own, the fee to the carrier must also be added to the total amount.
According to Lukas Neuheisl, the whole process is not complicated.
I click one or two check boxes, insert two attachments, and I'm done.
For me, it’s usually a question of five minutes, Neuheisl says.
Not all shipments can be shipped smoothly.
Due to the new customs rules, the daily number of shipments received from abroad has fallen to 15,000 at the international post office in Prague from 60,000.
In addition, according to the Czech Post, the problem is also that people do not respond to calls to submit the data necessary to complete the customs procedure.
Currently, there are 30,000 shipments to international mail that we need to process.
If people would fill in all the data they need and fill them in time, we would be here about halfway through, says <0xC4><0x8C>eské posta spokesman Matya<0xC5><0xA1> Vitík.
Inflation Solutions
See titles, how would you propose a solution to current inflation?
We are currently at 9.9% of inflation, and it is expected to continue to grow.
What do you think the price should do to slow down or compensate for this growth?
Do we see a reduction in food tax and VAT in Poland, is this the way for you?
What do you think will happen, what is inevitable with where it goes?
Prices are rising faster than wages, and I think it is inevitable that people will not be able to afford ordinary things, especially energy.
How much did you get added (who is an employee)?
I was added 2% gross this year, which is ridiculous, but fortunately I have a similar income from the business I run while employing.
Would anyone be able to explain to me why the demonstrable convictions of the rapists are being sent behind the grid for only six months?
This just doesn't take my head, as the court can only send such an animal behind bars for six months just to do it again as soon as it gets out.
6 Months is nothing compared to the fact that his/her victim will have a trauma for several years, this will negatively affect her sexual relationships and relationships as a whole.
Not to mention the fact that the rape victim may never be remembered again.
Will this and the potential future reports of rape of the victims not be overlooked?
A man from the grave "burns" his girlfriend from Kostomlat
The man from the tomb reluctantly helped the guards secure his state-wide-looking girlfriend from Kostomlat, for whom a warrant was issued to arrest him.
He himself called them to her.
He went on to do that with a hesitation.
He first approached the man who was about to come and invented a story that he was stolen.
After calling the emergency line, the guards arrived and were not surprised when the alleged “stealer” told them that he had invented everything for the guards to arrive.
In fact, he only wanted to advise the officers on how to submit a notification to the police of the Czech Republic.
When checking the identity of the man and his girlfriend, the officers found that the woman was on the search list, in a nationwide search, and a warrant was issued for her to be arrested.
That is why the case is handled by the PCR.
An honest question for the people here, do you think our country is Slavic?
I am personally of the opinion that we have not been celebrated ethnically or culturally for a long time, but I would be interested in your opinion.
Otherwise, I agree with the meme of course, it is a pity that Churchill failed to secure the liberation of Prague USA :')
Of course, I do not deny that we have a Slavic language.
Well, I don’t know, there’s quite a question whether a rational person can really believe something completely without evidence just because it could potentially benefit.
I personally would not consider such a case to be true faith.
I can't agree with Pascal here, there's an estimate in the world, if I don't get involved, about ten thousand different religions.
What kind of god or god should a man choose?
I would say that it is quite likely that in any of these thousands of religions there is at least one god who will not punish you fairly if you believe in another god.
But it is also written in the book of the law that there is no god but the Lord.
In such a case, wouldn’t it be more rational to refrain from believing in any god than risking the wrong choice of the thousands of gods and the one true god I just didn’t meet send me to hell for it or to some place like that?
Other: Voluntary training with subsequent inclusion in reserves.
The Swiss model is very similar.
X months of training (in different specializations, X months for one) and under the leadership of professionals with practical experience.
If a person does well, he can get a professional offer.
Something like this would have happened to all the members of the ACR.
This could be done in cooperation with the University of Defence.
We can say this: The cooperation between the education sector and industry is constantly waning, the companies hunt in schools, and there is some kind of confluence when the workforce migrates from educational institutions into employment.
Not only during adolescence, but this process is constantly going on, each of us is constantly learning something new, moving from one field to another, etc.
Similar mergers should also work between the civil and military sectors.
I also see this as a way to build some kind of relationship between the citizen and the army, that is, an institution that guarantees that there will never again be a Russian, a German or, for example, a Mongolian invader.
I think it's funny how you think NATO is something that's stoned, we have allies, so they'll defend us if there's a breakthrough.
You're welcome, sir.
There is only one election in the United States that will shatter their budget and the whole of NATO will go to hell.
The English will exchange us for Russian money, the Germans will exchange us for Russian gas, and the Poles have proved once that they are enough to show their backs and take what they want.
The only thing that will serve as a guarantee of independence for a long time is an armed army and a population that can control the military technique of their time.
And nowadays, he can pilot the remotely controlled resources of every teenager, so that wouldn't work.
We don't need border fortifications, that's fucked up today, but a teenage boy can handle a remote control device.
How not to drown in a box tsunami
Do you unpack the gifts under the Christmas tree and all of a sudden you are home packed with boxes and fillings?
This "waste" is used again by e-shops that lack packaging materials.
Therefore, a map of shops has been created that your used boxes will welcome.
And it's not just about Christmas.
All packaging materials are designed to withstand repeated manipulation.
Therefore, it is a pity to treat them as if they were disposable waste.
Anyone can bring carton boxes, plastic or paper fillings to the involved shop (the map of the KAMsNIM.cz project contains at least 150 of them).
This will support small businesses, reduce the amount of waste generated and also avoid overcrowded blue containers.
The stores themselves welcome packaging, which is currently on the market for shortages and also save money, as the packaging cardboard has increased by 50% in the last period.
In addition, in the eyes of ecologically thinking customers, I am strengthening my brand.
One such store is TIERRA VERDE, a manufacturer of eco drug stores and eco cosmetics.
The boxes and filling materials are transported to Pop<0xC5><0xAF>vek near Brno by individuals who accumulate at home, however, we are also called by companies with whom we have agreed on regular bonds of postponed cartons.
We will use everything when packing shipments from our e-shop.
Thanks to individuals and companies, together we create a more considerate world.
Our desire is to preserve the resources and beauty of nature for the next generations, says Petra Lopu<0xC5><0xA1>níková from Tierra.
However, the application www.KAMsNIM.cz shows not only pick-up places for packaging material.
It serves as a search engine if you need to get rid of anything (where to take sorted waste from the household, where to hand over past medicines, tyres, spent electricity, batteries, light sources, large-volume waste, etc.).
All waste can thus end up in the right place, in addition to reusable items will find their second home.
In total, the project map already contains more than 100,000 such locations.
“Stupidly there are growing collection courts, re-use centers, textile containers, food banks, charitable enclosures, SWAPs and other places that help to find exploitation for things that would otherwise become useless waste,” adds one author, <0xC4><0x8C>eroslav Kuzékóv.
Rather, I find it wrong that today the technique is so simple and stupid that children who use a computer or phone play games on it, but they do not learn basic computer skills.
Recently, there has been a problem (mainly in English articles) that college students do not understand the principle of computer components.
Because, for example, Google Photos or Apple apps on photos or actually mobile phones generally simply hide the underlying filesystem with folders and all spends on one screen in the app.
Let them use the technique from childhood, but above all let them learn something.
Let's rewrite history, seriously.
Emmanuel Macron presented the priorities of the French EU Presidency last weekend – starting in January – and it was magnificent.
Macron spoke over an hour during which he unveiled the presidency’s logo, called for the protection of Europeans – at work, on the street – and mentioned so many actions that they can’t be reached in half a year.
French politicians like it, and voters like it.
Macron’s supporters of the divergence between the right and the left agree on a few, but in Europe, yes.
And in France there will be new presidential elections in April.
The electoral calendar has also influenced the priorities.
The French leader noted, among other things, that historians should write "one history of Europe" and France is ready for such a work of historians to create conditions.
A number of commentators immediately came forward with criticism that Macron is a pro-European propaganda and is rewriting history.
In fact, it is rather trying to prevent the rewriting of history.
France’s far-right presidential candidate Éric Zemmour is on his way to France right now with the assumption that the Vichy regime, which worked with Hitler during World War II, was not so bad, and has quite a success with the French.
Let’s take Macron’s idea of a history textbook seriously and don’t look at what’s happening in France.
Wouldn't it be necessary?
Students in European countries learn history as a story we versus them and never as a story as a whole.
The Spaniards, the French, the Czechs find out who defeated in which battle.
But if they do not have an illuminated office, they will no longer know what the wider context of the event was.
The movie of the year is Quo vadis, Aida?
The Czech "Mushrooms" did not win.
The story, which returns to the 1995 Srebrenica massacre, also won the award for the director and for the best actress Jasna Duri<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x8D>ova.
At this year’s Karlovy Vary festival, he held on the first stages of the spectator’s ladder.
Best Actor in Berlin: Anthony Hopkins for the movie Father.
I’m not too young, I’m not too healthy and I’m not vaccinated.
It was like "having the flu/being cramped" A couple of days I had diarrhea and didn't really like smoking...
Compared to the common flu, it was worse.
I don't have a diarrhoea.
(Only personal experience. I don't say that everyone has)
Christmas Book Tips
The Christmas twin, which will be released on December 20, will contain a traditional literary attachment.
And with it, cultural tips come out.

The story of a return to the roots, which turns out to be just a fading illusion.
A Bohemian and a comparator conveys the story of the Red Carpet to the scenery of the present village.
Its brutality outweighs the popular version and grads in horror about emotional emptiness.
And that the way back to instincts is shorter than one is willing to admit.
In his last novel, the author tells a less sentimental story about returning from emigration than we are used to listening.
Those who are left, and those who have left, know too little about themselves to spend it on a common life.
Trains start to ride according to new schedules, somewhere the carriers will change
From Sunday onwards, trains will begin to ride on the railways according to the new schedule.
The biggest change is the exchange of carriers on certain routes, for example between <0xC3><0x9A>stí nad Labem and Cologne, where instead of Czech roads, RegioJet begins to ride.
For most lines, only the time of departure is adjusted, and if necessary, their routes are slightly adjusted.
There will also be dozens of new trains on the trains.
Carriers started selling their tickets in the autumn.
In the new schedule, Czech routes plan to make an average of 6783 passenger transport connections per day, of which an average of 478 long-distance trains per day.
Trains will travel around 118 million kilometres during the new schedule.
In addition to national connections under the new driving regulations, the trains will also travel to Germany, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Austria and Switzerland.
Together with the new schedule, the company will deploy dozens of new trains.
The main news will be InterJet trains, which will run on lines from Prague to Cheb.
Other new trains will be transported to northern Moravia or western Czechoslovakia.
The carrier will also traditionally increase the price of tickets by an average of 3.2 percent from next year.
Drafts take inflation into account in their tariffs annually.
The biggest change in the RegioJet schedule is the entry to the line R23 <0xC3><0x9A>stí nad Labem – M<0xC4><0x9B>lník – Nymburk – Kolín.
The carrier will replace the Czech Routes after success in the competition of the Ministry of Transport.
Every day, RegioJet will run a total of 16 connections on the route, eight in each direction.
Other changes relate to long-distance connections between Prague and Brno, which will also stop at Havlí<0xC4><0x8D>k<0xC5><0xAF>v Brod, <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F>ár nad Sázavou and Kolín stations from Sunday.
Leo Express retained its 16 connections, two return connections to Slovakia and also a weekend connection to Krakow.
According to spokesman Emil Sedla<0xC5><0x99>ík, despite the planned excavation work, the carrier tried to maintain as similar driving times as possible for its long-distance trains.
Without major changes, the Arriva trains and other carriers should continue to operate.
The carrier will also be exchanged on some regional routes.
The changes are awaiting passengers in Czechoslovakia, for example, where the trains of the German company Die Landesbahn will be used instead of Czech roads on the route from Mladá Boleslav via Czech Lip to Rumburg.
In the second year, passengers will also be able to use a single rail pass.
As with Czech roads, their price will rise by inflation of 3.2 per cent.
I have to disagree.
Aren’t we learning from the other side?
Everywhere we hear how much they had to fight for their rights, how they had to be oppressed, how they had to die.
I have never heard of teaching from the point of view of the slave party or from that time, no one defends this, just condemns it.
No one will even tell you in schools that blacks were often sold into slavery by blacks themselves, and that they were often the worst slaves.
No one at school will teach you that the settlers often bought land from the Indians, everywhere they just tell you how brutally we, the Europeans, murdered them and murdered each other a long time ago.
I also spent some time in the United States, directly in schools, both in northern and southern schools.
I haven’t encountered anyone deliberately shutting down the facts, but I’ve heard before that it’s happening and I think it’s a problem, I don’t deny it (e.g. in Japan, WW2 monsters are quite taboo).
My point was rather that history is not black and white and that we tend to look at it from today’s point of view, without understanding.
History doesn’t care about someone’s feelings, it’s just what they are, and I think it’s a fatal mistake to condemn without looking at anything from that time.
On the other hand, we should learn from it and never repeat it again.
By the way, when we're already at those southern states, yes, the Confederate flag and the famous slaves there are quite popular, on the other hand, they also had some good successes and it seemed absurd to me to reject them.
Moreover, the North was not much better, as it is idealized by many people today.
And many people also forget that not all in the South were slaves, and many things were opposed to them too.
I wouldn’t compare this to the Russians, they deliberately omit some facts, they lie and they manipulate, moreover, maybe our view on them doesn’t exist (on YT there was also a video from TV where someone who started talking about our legionaries and 1968).
What seemed ridiculous to me in US schools was the rise of Marxism and the idealization of communism, something that their country never experienced.
Overall, I thought it was awful at some universities, those students were radicalized enough, and the schools supported them how many times.
And when I imagine that these people are going to be a lot older, I'm a little upset that this could be the voice of the majority, because it's among the young and even in the ruling elite.
It seems to me that feminism has achieved what it had long ago and it is no longer about the same thing, it has radicalized itself.
Nowadays, feminists are referred to as those who have nothing to do with it and ignore the basic biological fact, as are other groups like LGBT, and this leads to radicalization on the opposite side, where it often leads to resistance even in fairly reasonable things.
In addition, the more radical someone is, the more they hear him.
In any case, I haven’t met anyone who would condemn me for colonialism or slavery either.
I've met the wrong geography, but it was both sides :D
Not because I don't like it here, but because I think it's completely pointless.
Should I be proud of something I couldn't do myself?
In addition, I consider the concept of nationality as a whole to be unnecessary in terms of some personal identity.
If something connects me with people, then interests, views of the world and shared experiences, not the place where we were born.
I am not a believer, but from what I know, I can tell you this: we have two Greek-Catholic parishes here, one is Ukrainian and the other is Slovak.
This Slovak priest is a terribly nice guy, he preaches about theology rather than politics, but then he always fucks a bitch about the coronavirus that everyone is ashamed.
Then, of course, here is the Czechoslovak Hussite Church.
Officially they are Protestants, but in fact they were born from Catholic modernity and are actually Catholics without a pope.
I know a lot of people who are Catholics, but they go to Hussite worship because it is theologically very similar, but members are mostly more liberal.
They have a beautiful and historically very valuable functionalist temple on Botanical Street.
Otherwise, the Church of St. Michael on Dominican Square belongs to the Dominicans and even there at 3:00 p.m. every Sunday they do Mass in Latin, as they did before Vatican II.
Flame from Bethlehem is in the Czech Republic, scouts take it from Austria
B<0xC5><0x99>eclav – A flame burned in Bethlehem, where according to Christian tradition Jesus Christ was born, is in the Czech Republic.
The scouts did not go to Vienna for the coronavirus pandemic, but they took it from their Austrian colleagues in the morning at the border crossing Reintal – B<0xC5><0x99>eclav.
It was taken over at the border last year.
The light of Bethlehem is a beautiful Christmas tradition, which we participate with the department every year, I look forward to.
It is an honour for me to have been chosen, said Amalia Bud<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87>, a scout, to the journalists present.
While last year the transfer took place at the Mikulov-Drasenhofen border crossing, right on the border bridge, now at the Reintal – B<0xC5><0x99>eclav crossing on the parking lot.
For him, scouts usually take the train to Vienna.
Nothing changes in the transport of flames through the Czech Republic.
With the light of Bethlehem, the scouts traditionally took the train first to Brno, where they handed it to the diocesan bishop Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch Zikrlem.
On Saturday, December 18th, the lights will be transported by Scottish couriers, who will travel on selected high-speed trains and passenger trains.
The light will be taken from them at the stations by local scouts or volunteers, who will then continue to spread flames throughout the Czech Republic and where the railways do not take them.
Scouts must follow the current measures against the spread of the coronavirus this year.
It’s happening the same way as last year.
We recommend that both the courier teams and the organizers of local events, of course, to wear scarves, to try to follow the breaks, to do the least of them, not to sing colleagues, just to behave so that it is as safe as possible.
The tradition of Bethlehem light travelling through Europe was born in 1986 in Austria.
The goal is to spread the idea of peace, friendship and peace at the same time.
The light of Bethlehem is for the believer a symbol of hope, a light that overcomes darkness.
In the Czech Republic, scouts and scouts have been taking care of its spread for more than 30 years.
The action stands on hundreds of volunteers, and the flame is also a symbol of dishonesty and human reciprocity.
All the news, including a list of places where people can come for the flames, can be found on the website www.betlemskesvetlo.cz.
I don't have economic education, so I don't know the basics of an economy that confirms that subsidies are a cancer of the economy, but I don't think that subsidies as a whole would be a problem.
Infrastructure development, ecology (e.g. water retention), health and education are making good use of the money, but I do not understand why the money is being put into agriculture, industry and businesses as a whole.
As mentioned - the unnecessary product is produced and the free market and the "natural life of the company" is mined.
I work in a factory where a million xy-financed/co-financed xy-projects are in the corridors, and such a company is simply artificially kept alive.
This is not the support of a company that gives jobs to x people, this is the bribery of the development when this company is both sticking to and picking up contracts/employees to companies that could grow after its disappearance and be more productive
Absolutely agree, it's terrible.
Sometimes even a person who was born in the Internet age gets caught up in some trick or trap - especially advertising.
I think that internet ads are moving with me, but I still find that they influenced me – it’s just so ridiculous that you don’t always defend yourself.
For this reason, I also support the radical votes in the European Parliament, which are currently trying to ban programmatic (<0x3D> targeted) advertising...
It's all shit, the words of the classic - I'd ban those internets.
I have a feeling that this source has roots in (but mostly in point 1):
“I won’t believe something that the majority believe and makes sense, I’m not a sheep, but I’d rather believe something that’s less likely, it doesn’t make much sense, but it’s important that I have my own original opinion that I’ll claim to be critical.”
“I won’t believe everything the media says.”
“I don’t trust politicians.”
TV has dropped the trend of Christmas movies, its premiere this year has two hundred.
Los Angeles – Kino, TV stations and streaming platforms in the United States and other English-speaking countries have dropped the trend of Christmas movies and this year will showcase more than 200 records to their audiences.
This was calculated by the IMDb film database operator.
The genre of Christmas family and romantic films has been punctuating and significantly increasing the audience’s visibility in recent years, which is why these pictures are becoming more and more.
This year, there were four times more Christmas movies than in 2011 and twice as many as five years ago.
The IMDb database has included only those images that have the word Christmas in their name, so there will actually be a lot more holiday movies.
Films that people traditionally associate with Christmas have always existed.
In the Czech Republic, this period is especially associated with fairy tales, world-wide are also popular such as the pictures of Alone at home, Love Heavenly or the classic Christmas story Life is beautiful from 1946.
But the real boom in Christmas movies did not start until 2009, when a special film series was released by American cable television station Hallmark, a BBC server said.
Her advent project, Countdown to Christmas, at the time included four films and was a huge success.
This year, the station began to set up its viewers at Christmas already on October 22 and will present a total of 42 Christmas pictures.
This year, Lifetime has 35 new Christmas-themed movies, and they’re contributing to a total of popular streaming platforms such as Netflix.
“In this magical period, the story doesn’t matter much, it’s important that there are a lot of Christmas trees in the background and that it’s snowing,” said Brandon Gray, author of a book about Christmas movies called I’ll Be Home for Christmas Movies.
"For viewers, it's a form of escape and a way for at least two hours to feel a bit of peace in the midst of all the holiday madness and madness of the world we've been living in for the last few years," Gray said.
According to him, for example, Hallmark TV still uses the same recipe for its films, which is uniform but successful.
You have two people who fall in love with each other, but then about half an hour before the end of some misunderstanding that seems to be resolved and the two of you kiss.
That’s the way it is, and as long as all the movies look similar and have a similar atmosphere, people watch each other, Gray adds.
Mazepin had a positive text for Covid-19, it will not hit the final F1 race.
Only nineteen riders will enter the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in Formula 1.
Nikita Mazepin had a positive text on COVID-19 and will not hit the last race of the season.
Stay Haas will then send only one formula to the track.
In the last race of the season, he had to strike for a better place from the 20th innings he went into qualifying.
However, Russian Nikita Mazepin from Haas will not eventually be involved in the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.
It has been tested positive for COVID-19.
Only nineteen cars will appear on the starting grid, with Mazepin's teammate Mick Schumacher on the final lap, and the first Max Verstappen, who will face Lewis Hamilton in a straight battle for the title.
According to Haas, mazepin is relatively ok and does not show any symptoms.
Nikita is physically fine because she was asymptomatic.
She is now in isolation and will be guided by the guidelines of the relevant public health authorities, with safety as a final priority for all stakeholders," her representatives for Formula1.com said.
He doesn't send a replacement rider to the Haas race, he can't.
A substitute would have to complete a qualification or a ride in another part of the weekend.
Covid-19 is not the first racer.
Kimi Räikkönen had COVID-19 at the start of the season, and last year Sergio Pérez and Lewis Hamilton tested positive.
They can lock you up for this, too.

Gold, silver and 150 diamonds: The price tag of the most expensive sweater will surprise you!
It’s a bit like portable jewelry, and the creator invested half a year of work and all his savings into it.
“I had a vision of what I wanted to create, but little experience, sweaters were never worn at home,” admits Lebanon, who spent more than 3,000 hours in six months.
He bought silk in Italy, 24-carat gold thread in France and 2,000 decorative crystals supplied by Swarowski.
The silver stars then decorated 150 diamonds.
“The basis is wool and cotton, but silk adds softness to the sweater,” the creator praises his work, which he does not recommend washing.
And he's got another hook.
“I’m totally out of business, I have to sell my sweater as soon as possible,” he said.
If he succeeds, he will set a world record.
The most expensive sweater, sold five years ago, cost “only” 720,000 crowns.

Hygiene examines another case of the child from Adam.
“At the moment, we have reported another suspicion of this variant in another child from Adamov, from the preparatory class.
Direct contact with previous cases from Z<0xC5><0xA0> Adamov is not proven," Ciupek said.
Six cases have been reported in the county this week.
“We are still waiting for the official confirmation of the variant in our six cases – it is carried out by the National Reference Laboratory for influenza and non-influenza viruses of the State Institute of Health in Prague,” said the director.
She added that these are two nurses from one workplace of the University Hospital Brno and two children of one of them, and two eleven-year-old students of Z<0xC5><0xA0> Adamov.
There is no connection between the cases of Brno and Adamov.
Three of them, according to the director, have mild symptoms, four have a symptomless course.
No one suspected of Omikron was travelling abroad.
None of the above have travelled abroad, nor have any of their families, nor have they come into contact with anyone who would live abroad.
The relationship with the champions in the waterfield is none of the above mentioned, Ciupek said.
Chief hygienist Pavla Svr<0xC4><0x8D>inóvá said earlier that the international waterfield tournament, which was held in Brno a few weeks ago, is being tested.

California is limiting arms sales.
He wants to act like Texas banning abortions.
California Governor Gavin Newsom announced on Saturday a plan to ban the sale and manufacture of certain weapons in the most populous U.S. state using a legal mechanism that used Texas in its controversial anti-abortion law to detect heartbeat.
People would then be entitled to compensation for the lawsuit against anyone who manufactures or sells assault rifles and handguns manufactured in California.
Newsoma’s announcement responded to the U.S. Supreme Court’s opinion on Friday, which left Texas’s abortion ban in effect, contrary to a nearly 50-year-old previous ruling that established the right to abortion platforms across the U.S. by about the 24th month of pregnancy.
However, the court has now decided not on the constitutionality of the entire law, but on a technical issue arising from the innovative design of the measure.
The enforcement of the ban in this case was made public, which prevented the Texas Republicans from attacking it in the usual court way.
“I am outraged by yesterday’s (Friday’s) decision by the U.S. Supreme Court, which allowed for the preservation of the Texas ban on most abortion services and largely supported Texas’s maneuver to protect its law,” the California government said in a statement.
“If states can now block a review of their laws by federal courts, then California will use this authority to protect human lives,” Newsom continued.
He said he commissioned his subordinates, in cooperation with the state parliament and the minister of justice, to work on measures that would justify the representative of the public to enforce the ban on attacking guns and so-called ghost weapons.
In this way, submachine-manufactured weapons that do not have serial numbers and that can be used to circumvent regulations are designated.
Newsom wants "private citizens" to have the right to claim compensation of at least <0x24>10,000 (over CZK 220,000) and legal expenses from anyone in California who would manufacture, distribute or sell assault rifle, components for their "spirit weapons" or production.
“If the most effective way to keep these scary weapons out of our streets is to create a threat of private prosecutions, then we should do exactly that,” the California governor said.
California has banned the production and sale of some military-style weapons for decades, but in June, a federal judge blocked the ban as unconstitutional.
If the state had now really renewed the ban using the Texas template, the words of the liberal member of the Supreme Court Sonia Sotomayora, who in a disagreement opinion on the Friday majority verdict, would have warned against the extension of the given legal mechanism to other states.
The Supreme Court, however, did not grant Texas’ ban on abortions full immunity from judicial review and allowed abortion clinics to continue lawsuits against selected U.S. agents.
Each emergency vaccination has its own public testing phase, when it gradually comes to how the vaccination scheme will look and also improve the vaccines themselves, based on the results.
For example, from Israel, there is already a large wave of study on the effects of 4 doses.
And according to these studies, most patients experience up to five-fold increase in antibodies, which already has the long-term effect you mentioned.
Just like any other vaccination will have its own vaccination schedule in time, it’s just too early for it so far.
Another fact is that a new vaccine based on the inactivated virus, which, according to the manufacturer’s specifications, promises up to 10 times more effectiveness, should be launched soon.
The amount teaches you to keep calm.
But re-evaluate what you learn.
Since Marie Theresa’s time, our civilization and technology have progressed a bit, and learning phone lists and describing textbooks into textbooks no longer makes much sense, and it’s a waste of time.

Poland threatens to suspend payments to the EU budget
According to Ziobra, the European Commission would act contrary to the law if it exercised new powers and, due to a dispute over the rule of law, stopped paying money to Poland.
The Commission has already postponed the approval of the Polish plan to pump <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>36 billion from the EU Fund to restore the economies affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.
And it is under pressure from the European Parliament to move forward and use a mechanism to remove EU subsidies from countries that violate the rule of law.
"Poland should respond to this EU blackmail veto on all matters that require unanimity," Ziobro, the head of the small party Solidarity Poland, said, without which the current government would lose a narrow majority in the Sejm.
“Poland should also consider its commitments in EU energy and climate policy, which lead to drastic increases in energy prices,” Ziobro added.
If the dispute continues, I will call on Poland to stop its contributions to the EU.
This would be justified in the fact that the EU is illegally depriving us of funds from the common budget, to which we are also contributing, the Polish Minister added.
Its party in its accession to the EU takes a more radical stance than the ruling Law and Justice party.
According to the European Commission, the changes undertaken by the Polish justice for Ziobr’s actions threaten its independence and subordinate it to politicians.
According to Ziobra, Brussels is setting “impossible conditions because its goal is not the rule of law, but a change of government in Poland.”
Warsaw is facing “a political dictatorship carried out by extortion and an attempt to subject the democratic decision of several million Poles,” Ziobro said.
He said Poland should be a member of an EU based on the partnership of sovereign states, not on the government of the strongest and Brussels bureaucracy that is not under democratic control.
He said his party would never agree to such concessions to Brussels that would result in Poland’s sovereignty being limited.
“We will never agree that Poland will have colony status,” he said.
But let's face it... we at Lidl have one kind of cheese in four different places.
I wasn’t looking for other things, I met one yogurt several times, I just needed cheese, parmesan, after ten minutes at the dairy shelves I gave up and asked.
They had it, it's true, in that narrow sector they were all selected, less common and special cheeses, but it was between the vegetables and the lactose-free zone...
If it's avoided, I'm not going to go to any market anymore, I'm not going to smell like action, a golden bar on the square, there's probably no such choice, but they usually have everything I need and it's got some sort of order, so I've got ten minutes to finish.
I'm going to Lidl to take a vacation.
And I don't really care.
For two years, I've been watching data handled here like fertilizer, most vaccination opponents are just slightly more out of reach than most vaccination supporters.
While rational discussion is taking place at the professional level, only extreme opinions are received in the public space.
Constantly from wall to wall.
Binary thinking: Vaccination saves us, vaccination is useless.
To ban everything, to allow everything.
Colour cakes instead of robust analyses.
Comparison of apples with pears.
This country has it like this, and we have it like this.
But that the methodology of data collection is different in these two states no one solves.
Wow, I was so relieved.
Sorry for the trip and I wish you all a nice day.
When I was a kid, I was punished by a cook.
It was never because of the signs, most of the time it was just that I repeatedly refused to listen and was angry (I read instead to go to bed, wash with my brother, etc.).
At the same time, I was never punished without warning, my mother always threatened that if I did it again, I would get a wound (sometimes even after the next "start" I just brought the stove and laid it so that I could see it).
It was only after I repeatedly refused to listen, that I got a few wounds on my ass (through clothes).
Personally, I think physical punishments (in reasonable execution and to the extent) are beneficial, because the child responds to them much more than words.
I think the part with the warning is important, because it gives the child a way to choose whether he will disobey and get, or whether he will be better and the punishment will not be.
At the end of the day, I usually just needed a warning to start listening.
Defence of the system
When the prominent Czech lawyer and constitutional judge Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch Cepl in 1999 responded to a journalistic question about what the Czech Constitution means for him – whether the sacred letter is sworn on and the one he was refused to learn in the first school, or, on the contrary, the agreement to be made in the event of a change in the case.
We once agreed in the Constitution on the democratic rules of our lives, which at the same time define who we are as a state and its citizens, and it is better to save on change.
And imagine: some nations even like their rules.
Just as the Czechs like toasts with pork and cabbage, Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch Cepl voted at that time on the question.
Recently, however, there is a growing opinion among lawyers that the Constitution of the Czech Republic needs change.
Years are tested by situations that its creators (to which Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch Cepl belonged) could not foresee, for example with the behavior of a directly elected president.
But in one thing, Cepl was right.
Everything we know about such documents shows that political interference in their texts must be considered.
The constitution must be understood and actively defended, only then can it be the key to coping with most of the crises that societies have faced throughout history.
The Constitution is, among other things, a sort of order of governance consisting of individual rules that lay down the mantiney of the game for politicians.
We are afraid that power will be abused against minorities or individuals, so we bind the politicians to bans.
At the same time, the constitutional texts also allow politicians to have their power.
Covid does not choose, in the UN Brno fight for the life of a several-month-old baby
Although it is known that the coronavirus is milder to children, there are also severe cases that hospitals have been dealing with especially recently.
“We know that children are at risk and less affected than adults, 2 to 5 percent are talking about compared to adults,” said the new Primary Officer of the Clinic of Pediatric Anesthesiology and Resuscitation of the Faculty of Hospital Brno and the Faculty of Medicine of Masaryk University Petr.
The course is much simpler, lighter, often without symptoms.
But there are children who are severely ill with the coronavirus, which we see especially in recent times," Dominik added.
According to the doctor, these are dozens of children who need mild supportive care.
It takes place at the Children's Infectious Disease Clinic.
Really very seriously ill children with coronavirus are only recently on the ARU.
Children with postcovid syndromes were in the department continuously throughout the year, according to the doctor.
“Now there is an increase in children with acute covid pneumonia, that is, pneumonia, which requires staying on a resuscitation bed,” he said, adding that the disease affects both adults and a few months-old baby.
In hospitals, children are also in severe condition due to the coronavirus.
“At the moment, we have a child of several months and adolescence,” the primary school teacher said.
However, she is pleased that no infant deaths have been recorded so far in the FN Brno Children’s Hospital.
According to the available data, six children aged 0 to 14 died in the Czech Republic on 6 December.
According to Dominik, the children’s hospital – not just in the coronavirus department – is an integral part of the psychologist’s cooperation.
At the same time, it also points out the fact that, as in adults and children, vaccination alleviates the course of the disease and at the same time reduces the incidence of post-covid syndrome.
“Therefore, we recommend the administration of the vaccine dose in children as well,” the doctor added.
In a quiet area, you can only walk on marked roads.
But the quiet areas aren't that big.
They can be seen on the tourist map on maps.cz.
In general, in national parks outside the quiet zone you can walk anywhere (but do not cross the fence into the district).
Skiing/cycling in the woods outside the marked path is not allowed anywhere unless you have an exception (but of course it is not so closely monitored outside the national park).
How does the conductor practice?
The music is in my head, Josef Kurfi<0xC5><0x99>t laughs.
He is decorated with a Liberian opera and originally played for the forest corner.
As a singer he can sing virtually any repertoire and as a conductor he works not only in the Liberian Theatre F. <0xC5><0xA0>aldy, but also in Pilsen, in the Theater Josef Kajetán Tyla.
It works with the castle philharmonic, with the film philharmonic or with the underwater symphony orchestra.
China is building the impression that the authoritarian regime is better faced with the crisis
Synolog Jiro<0xC5><0xA1>: China is building the impression of a managed infection and that the authoritarian regime is better facing the crisis.
China has undergone a medical and political offensive.
A few months ago, Beijing was criticized for failing to stop the disease that has turned into a global pandemic.
The country is now reporting a zero increase in the infected.
Countries including the Czech Republic are competing for Chinese defence aid, and Chinese doctors are often helping to fight the coronavirus, for example in Italy’s worst-affected country.
How do you feel about Beijing?
Is this friendly support or is the communist regime trying to improve its image in the world?
A friend meets a friend and says to him, "Don't you want an elephant?"
I have it and it's great.
The wife likes it because she saves grass, washes the car with a shovel, children play with it.
It's just great.
If you want 5,000, I'll sell you an elephant.
I'm going to cry, it's going to be great...
After a while they meet and the buyer complains: man, what did you sell it for an elephant???
The lawn of the slumbering, all over the gigantic bastards, the car slumped, the kids were afraid of him, and his wife wanted to let him divorce.
The guy who sold says, "You don't talk about an elephant, you don't sell an elephant like that."
World events are controlled by the great powers.
Despite the equality of sovereign states, it is the great powers that determine the course of international affairs.
Europe can become such a power only if it works for its integration.
It still operates at the economic and political level (in selected issues), but military integration is still lacking.
I personally think that Europe is heading towards federalization.
It won't be in 10, 15 or 20 years.
But maybe in the middle of the century there will be a different mood and it will lead to it.
I thought about it, too, and it's quite possible.
I'm not an expert in Czech, so maybe I'm a dictionary.
I'm just assuming that the ellipse usually includes 2 different units on the same level.
I will borrow an example from another commentary "Spanish oranges and mandarins", where it is clear that they are both from Spain, whereas for "Spanish fruit and mandarins" it is no longer clear that they are from Spain.
In addition, I base this on the fact that the sentence sounds like "all American forces", including their weapons, and that I know that American complexes are operated only by Americans.
In other words, I expect it to be already included in that broad term and there is no need to specify it further with the American forces.
But again, maybe just the dictionaries :D
Whether it's true or not, it's a nonsense requirement.

Vicki Holland from Britain tortures monkey scumbag Milly
Annoying footage shows the moment when the frightened monkey crawled in the toilet bowl before her ruthless owner rinsed her and laughed at her.
The Dutch monkey also fed couples, kebabs and hamburgers, regardless of her real nutritional needs.
The Gwent Magistrate’s court has now banned animal breeding for life, The Sun reported.
Monkey rehabilitation experts taking care of Milly after she was tortured have said they have never seen a cosmonaut so frightened.
Milly has spent almost two years of rehabilitation with Monkey World workers in Dorset, and now she is again playing happily with another saved monkey named Moon.
The four-time mother confessed to two charges of causing unnecessary suffering to the protected animal.
At the Gwent Magistrate's court, she was sentenced to 12 weeks in prison with a conditional deferment of one year.
The Netherlands was also sentenced to 120 hours of unpaid work, received a life-long ban on animal husbandry and had to pay a total of 12,000 crowns of legal costs.
Small Monkeys team leader Steph Sawyer, who rehabbed the affected animal, said: “Milly is fine, but the rehab will continue.”
Milly took her time to get used to people again.
She was screaming and hiding from everyone she met, and any loud sound or sudden movement caused her to scream.
The monkey refused to eat for a long time.
Even now that she has settled down and is satisfied with the male, her eyesight on new people can still panic.
Psychic scars from bullying will accompany her forever, Sawyer adds.
Milla's tyranny came out after police in Gwent discovered horrifying footage of her wife's phone after she ran into her apartment on drug charges.
On footage, you can hear Milly vulgarly navigating.
In the next video, you hear a Dutch monkey offering cocaine and saying, “Do you want cocaine?”
Get my fingers wet.
In May, she and her partner Russell Cox admitted to holding cocaine with the intention of selling it.
In her house, she found cocaine for <0xC2><0xA3>1,600 (about 50,000) hidden in Kinder's eggs.
Cox was subsequently imprisoned for 30 months and Holland was sentenced to 20 months on probation.
And what amazing concepts do you learn from that real age three times in a row when you bravely skip the entire 20th century?
Like in the first grade, you're taking the same things as in the sixth grade?
And all this kills the idea of bifling, when nobody, honoring exceptions, doesn't matter if you know or understand it.
Write a test on 1 and then no one cares.
Walk and on the street randomly people ask if they can determine the character of the roots of the square equation and coefficients.
They've all been through it, and the absolute majority won't even turn around and tell you they're totally in the guts.
So what the fuck's he learning?
I’m a big fan of the general overview and the fact is that people don’t want and don’t need.
And at that moment it's useless and you'll never get it to them anyway.
Partly, it's being taught for the many people who need the thing.
But, like, the note that you don't really need all this to stand by the machine, I mean, really, really... because you just don't need it.
In addition, we slowly get to a time when not knowing is a sign of punk.
(This is probably what our communist past and our stigma against educators and elites are all about.) However, the price of being a barbarian with these machines is simply high.
If, for example, journalists could count, Covid probably never reached this dimension here.
Wedding at first glance: The War of Kadri and Andrey continues!
That’s the main reason why she can’t leave Switzerland right away,” Andrea replied on Instagram in Stories to all the questions asked by curious fans, which so disappointed her in Kadrim that she decided to end all contact and even block it on social media.
It's been between Kadri and Andrea since the beginning of the experiment.
The main problem was the fact that Kadri lived and worked in Switzerland and his idea was that Andrea would move behind her, that is, at least until she permanently returned to the Czech Republic.
But she resolutely refused.
And as you can see, their relationship not only did not end with love, but rather grew into mutual disrespect to hatred.
It was a planned attack from you! he turned to Kadri in response to Andreino's accusations of lies, gambling and debt.
The alleged sincerity of Kadri's ex-wife was no longer liked by his younger sister Linda.
My brother decided to stop in public.
Normally I don’t express myself to such things at all, and we’ve never even said such things to each other in our family.
I definitely don't want to cause any regret.
But when I see someone trying to hurt in public and smear the name of someone I love so much, it just doesn't give me that!
I'm sorry to have to do it this way, but I would like to publicly thank my brother Kadri for making himself a character and helping our family when we needed it most, despite how young he was.
I am more sorry to have to read such false information, which is probably quite out of context.
I wish all of you to know Kadri as well as I, our loved ones and family, stand in confession in response to Andrea’s words.
I'm really grateful to him for everything!
Of course, people will believe what is written, but most importantly, we, his family, above all, love him and know the reality and know how it really was, added indefinitely.
The drunk thief jumped up the facade to the fifth floor.
You won't believe why.
Cchao started his burglary expedition on a parking lot in the residential district, where he tried to get into several cars.
According to the information available, he eventually cut off from one vehicle in less than 330 crowns.
Then there was nothing better for him than to climb up to the 5th floor and enter the apartment with an open window.
There he stole two bananas.
On a footage from a security camera, he is then captured walking down the street away from the scene of the crime and eating a banana.
When the owner of the apartment woke up in the morning, he found out the bananas were not where they were, and called the police.
The Cchaa was subsequently arrested.
The man admitted to drinking some alcohol on an incriminating day.
And since he needed the money, in drunkenness he decided to steal.
The whole thing is under investigation so far.
The drunker jumped up the facade to the 5th floor, where he stole two bananas.
The Pandemic Act is time-limited and effective due to pandemic alertness.
If it is repealed, the law will not be effective.

Is that not enough for you as a reason?
The right to collect will be limited, but not cancelled.
More than 60 percent of voters voted for the four municipalities in the Saturday elections
On Saturday, new representatives voted in the municipalities of Kom<0xC5><0x88>a in Hungary, Lu<0xC5><0xBE>ice in Mostecka, Nová Ves in Liberec and Evné in Pelh<0xC5><0x99>ímovska.
The number of representatives in these municipalities decreased under the statutory number or the elected representatives here disintegrated.
On Saturday, there were 99 candidates for a total of 28 seats.
The average age of newly elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest of them is 69 years old, the youngest 33 years old.
Processing the results of the Saturday elections symbolically concludes a relatively demanding but successful year for us.
There were a total of four new or repeated elections to the municipal representatives and, above all, very followed elections to the House of Representatives, said <0xC4><0x8C>S<0xC3><0x9A> Vice-President Eva Krumpová.
She recalled that due to the COVID-19 epidemic, the choices were more demanding for both equipment and personnel security.
In the Komna in Hungary, the Independent Candidate Association won the elections on Saturday, which won 27.76 percent of the vote and two mandates in a seven-member representative office.
Stan received 24.84 percent of the vote, which also means a two-mandate win.
Two seats in the House of Representatives were also won by the Citizens for the House, giving them their vote of 18.52 percent of the vote.
Jan K<0xC5><0x99>i<0xC5><0xBE>ková, who is a member of the Privileges, was also admitted to the mayoral office again for them.
One mandate in the delegation was reached by the Communists – independent candidates.
75.48% of eligible voters came to the polls.
In the village of Evná na Pelh<0xC5><0x99>imovska, the association Pro Evná won.
It won 50.50 percent of the vote, which means four out of seven mandates.
Two more representatives from the Association of Independent Candidates 1 and one from the Association of Independent Candidates 2 were admitted to the Municipal Representative.
Election turnout was 93.62%.
The repeated elections in Lu<0xC5><0xBE>ice in Mostecka were again won by the Association of Lu<0xC5><0xBE>ice and Svin<0xC4><0x8D>ice led by Mayor Jind<0xC5><0x99>ich John.
It gained 56.73 percent of the vote and, as in 2018, has four mandates in the seven-member representative office.
The second finished by the candidate Municipality for the People, who voted for 43.27 percent of the vote, so there will be three representatives in the representative office.
In the polls, 76.7 percent of voters came.
The elections in Nová Vsi in Liberec were won by independent candidates of Hope for Nová Ves before the Yes Movement.
59.88 per cent of voters voted for the Independent Candidate Association, earning four seats in a seven-member General Representative.
YES received 40.12 percent of the vote, and in 2018, against the right elections, it strengthened, gained a mandate by more and has three.
Elections accounted for 42.9% of the voters.
The results of the election will be discussed by the State Election Commission on Monday.
They will then be published in the Collection of Laws.
What do you think would be a bigger problem?
A dead civilian or a foreign policy?
I think you know all this stuff that people write to you.
You're just playing a fool to have someone to argue with.
If not, it's sad.
I’m not saying that Christians are degenerate, or anything like that.
I even like a lot of church buildings from an aesthetic point of view (which, after all, was the goal to make them look good).
And I don't care who believes in what.
On the other hand, I am concerned about how much power the church had in the Middle Ages, how much money it raised, the suppression of science, etc.
Not to mention all the wars it caused, such as the 30-year-old
Tl;dr: Believe in a spaghetti monster, but the state and the church have nothing to do together
The man fell his head down from 12 meters.
The concrete collision survived.
An unbelievable fall survived on Sunday night in Ostrava, where rescuers from the regional health services intervened.
Workers at the regional operations center took over an hour after Saturday midnight an emergency call with initial information about the man's fall from an altitude.
Two ZZS crews – medical and medical – immediately arrived at the site.
Upon arriving at the site, the health care workers found that the 27-year-old man had to fall from a window from a height of about twelve meters and hit his head on the concrete!
In Vitkovi<0xC4><0x87>, there's a catch of coal.
But not as it should, and the firefighters went into action.
At the time of the arrival of the rescue teams, the man was unconscious, with multiple injuries and a direct life-threatening.
The intervening doctor intubated his respiratory tract, provided artificial lung ventilation and, after further measures in the pre-hospital emergency care, his ambulance was transported to the additional care of the Ostrava traumatic center, a spokesman for ZZS MS kraj, Huká<0xC5><0xA1> Luká<0xC5><0xA1> reported.
I am more concerned than I am about the inadequate response of the public and the authorities.
The spread of the coronavirus in the Czech Republic is a challenge for politicians and officials, but in the first line of the fight against the disease, there are mainly doctors and health personnel.
How serious is the situation from their point of view?
We're asking military doctor David the Cutler.

Legendary Nunes falls after seven years, Oliveira defends belt
MMA experienced a wonderful gala evening full of interesting results.
There was a lot going on in UFC 269.
Outsider Julianna Penny was able to defeat legendary Amanda Nunes, who hasn't found a winner in seven years.
Charles Oliveira did not hesitate in light weight, showed Dustin Poirier a great sharpening and defended the belt.
The victory was also recorded by Kai Kara-France, who quickly defeated Cody Garbrandt with the technical KO in the first round.
Sean O'Malley also defeated his opponent.
Surprise that no one expected.
This resulted in a women's batman weight match between the famous Amanda Nunes and Julian Penny.
The American woman entered into each other’s battles as a conceptual “shooter” because Nunes hadn’t lost for seven years and brushed her teeth for another triumph.
In addition, the beginning of the duel was carried in the spirit of paper assumptions.
Nunes started her way to victory very actively and even spawned the push kicks she sent to the ground.
However, the money was not allowed to make any further mistakes, and she failed to try to attack herself with a lever on her hand.
The second round was exciting and very exciting for MMA fans.
Both rivals had a lot of excellent kicks and hard hooks.
The money also got Nunes to the ground where she began to cut it.
She had to give up and unleash the attack.
The American woman prepared a huge shock for everyone when she became a new champion.
The climax of the gala dinner was the battle between Charles Oliveira and Dustin Poirier for a lightweight title.
Poirier did better at first, but the card gradually began to turn.
In the second he tried to be more active Oliveira, who tried to withstand the opponent with a lever on his hand.
He didn't do that much, but then he put a lot of pressure on his back, got his opponent on the back, and put him in a series of wounds.
Thanks to that, he won the second round.
In the third round, Oliveira showed a rear naked shock, to which Poirier had resisted for a while, but subsequently had to unlock the slash.
The Brazilian defended the title, but Poirier lost after two years.
In the next game, he attributed the sovereign triumph to Sean O'Malley, who had already placed Raulian Paiva in the first round with a hard right-back.
He subsequently received a series of precisely targeted hits and recorded a fifteenth triumph.
Kara-France was able to talk to Cody Garbrandt.
In the spring, Nunes celebrated another triumph with her little daughter, now losing after seven years.
That heel or that heel?
At first glance, it is not a complex thing.
Most essential names in Czech express only one grammatical genus, and so it is not a problem for them to determine whether it is a male, female or middle genus.
But then there is also a relatively large group of significant names, for which the genus is not fixed.
Such substantive names vary between the two genera.
When inclined, they then acquire double ends and in some cases remain in non-inclined form.
For example, the words “sweet” or “sweet” are a genus of both male and female, in the first they tend to be “machine” model, in the second to be “written”.
For another group of essential names, different forms are already in the first drop of a single number, e.g.: "row/row", "killed/killed" or "brambore/brambore" (in the sense of food).
Both forms are written, have the same meaning, and are therefore freely interchangeable.
Some expressions may differ regionally, for example "okurka" in the Czech Republic and "okurek" in Moravia, but in this case the Moravian variant is unwritten, similarly there are other Czech-Moravian pairs of words: "<0xD0><0xBF><0xD1><0x80><0xD0><0xB8>kop" and "<0xD0><0xBF><0xD1><0x80><0xD0><0xB8>kop", "kobliha" and "pod" and koblih.
Some of the words, which have penetrated into Czech from other languages, were originally non-slovak, but gradually take over the Czech endings.
A typical example is the expression "image", which is a genus of both male and female, or the word "buffet", which remained non-scrupulous in the middle genus, but in the male has the endings according to the pattern of "garden".
Turkey has paved the way for migrants to Europe.
What is the situation directly on the Greek border?
At the Greco-Turkish border there is tension due to the growing number of migrants trying to get further into Europe.
Thousands of people have been trapped on the southern border of the Schengen area after Ankara stopped defending them.
European politicians promise Greece support, humanitarian aid is also being prepared by the Czech government.
What motivates refugees to go on an uncertain path?
What does the situation look like on the spot?
"We haven't seen the blue sky in three months and we're so excited," a Sydney reporter said.
The devastating fires in Australia for the fourth month have killed nearly three dozen people and hundreds of millions of animals and devastated millions of hectares of land.
How do the authorities and the people themselves deal with the disaster?
Could the government of Prime Minister Morrison do more to prevent drastic impacts, critics say?
And what will the country have to prepare for in the future in the context of climate change?
Lenka Kabrhel talks to Sydney journalist Ika Detrich.
False accusations have always been and are quite rare.
That’s why it’s always written about everyone everywhere.
It’s unpleasant for people to deal with how much sexual violence in our society looks and how widespread it is, so they try to deal with it.
I don't know anyone who's been falsely accused.
But I know a lot of people who have been raped and I have experienced how people often treat their surroundings or even the police.
Victims should always be trusted.
The trend is that the victims are finally opening up about their traumas.
But it still keeps too many people for themselves.
Yes, there will be those who falsely accuse someone.
It’s disgusting and sneezing in the face of all the victims of sexual violence, but by spreading the idea that “most of the charges are insane” and that it’s a “trend” you’re only helping sexual abusers.
Czech Republic floods detached houses, families have no money to complete
Construction material prices have increased by more than 30 percent in the last few weeks and months.
A lot of people have gotten into a blissful situation.
It does not have the means to complete the detached households and banks refuse to raise the mortgage loans.
In addition to the price of the material, the price of construction works also increases.
Therefore, people do not have enough money to complete already arranged family homes.
In many cases, banks refuse to raise mortgage loans, which creates extremely unpleasant situations.
In the best case, people move into separated and unoccupied homes.
In the worst case scenario, detached houses are uninhabitable and families are forced to sell them because they can’t afford to pay mortgages and still pay rent to do so,” says BHS economist <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>pán K<0xC5><0x99>e<0xC4><0x8D>ek.
We will build two to three family homes in a year, and 50 percent of us have done so.
For us as a construction company, it is difficult to comply with certain things contractually, even if the material has gone wrong.
So we do without profits," said the owner of the construction company Zden<0xC4><0x9B>k Slive<0xC5><0x88>.
A lot of people will only have financial problems.
If they count on building the house to be worth five million, now it's going to be seven.
I think some of them will wait,” Slivon added.
The most irritated of the material was copper, iron and also installation and heating equipment.
But construction companies are also struggling with a shortage of workforce.
In the Czech Republic, graduates from construction sectors are missing and the influx of foreign workers is slowing down the pandemic.
At the moment, only the situation regarding the issuance of a building permit is more favourable.
“The construction authorities issued 7,675 building permits in October, which is almost 10 percent more than a year ago,” Kre<0xC4><0x8D>ek said.
We'll be fine and we'll be even better.
But real vision is missing, says commentator <0xC4><0x8C>RO – mujRozhlas
The entry into the new year, in addition to classical celebrations, has traditionally been accompanied by speeches by politicians.
In addition to Prime Minister Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1> and the Christmas message of President Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Zeman, the President of the Senate and the House of Representatives spoke to the people this year.
What's the most important thing we've learned?
As I like the super diploma right there, I have my own theme that I chose, I stick to my bachelor's degree, I always work on it all year round, and then in a week to two I write a written part.
The statesmen are completely at peace with us, unless a man is a total macaque and there is something left in his head, then the commission will not stifle him in vain on the theory.
I may have been studying for a week at the state school, and when I was in the end, the commission always tried to induce me to some logical deduction that I immediately found and I had it right.
Otherwise, I know people who pay someone to do the semester project to them (we did it many times, really useful, learn a lot) and then just learn the project and have it out.
I think it’s great when at the end of the subject there’s a test that reflects the knowledge gained within the project, not just the defense.
All right, but don't pay emails and phones and don't send any packages to the embassy.
You'll be the same as them.
Those people at the embassy don't have anything to do with it.
And if they were against Russia, they would risk a lot, so maybe they have to play with them, because otherwise something could happen to them.
But you can build a statue of Putin next to the statue of the bear Pu.
I'd love to put it in a way to shave Xi Jinping's ass or something.
I agree, though, that the Insta throws artists clack under their feet.
Once you don’t give stories every day and at least every other day a new picture, your reaches will be reduced to a complete minimum.
In addition, furt changes which function is more important, whether you like, comment or save.
It's been awful for me lately, so maybe I'll have to get down to a tick where a lot of artists in my industry are successful and can't afford it.
In the end, I might also like to have something user-friendly that doesn’t drain all the creativity and energy from the artists.
Statement of the Working Party on Donbass
The union – yes, the break-up – no, the opposition to the break-up of the USSR expresses their opinion in the picture.
Thirty years since the illegal collapse of the USSR.
On December 8, 1991, the largest geopolitical disaster in human history took place.
Boris Jelcin, Leonid Kravchuk and Stanislav <0xC5><0xA0>u<0xC5><0xA1>kevi<0xC4><0x8D>, without any legal powers and violation of the results of the referendum of March 17, 1991, with an open-ended sweeping attitude to the right.
With a single cut, the feathers “dismantled” a vast country with almost three hundred million inhabitants.
With the collapse of the USSR, tens of millions of ethnic Russian citizens were abroad.
Since the early 1990s, the population of Russia has declined by 10 to 11 million.
Despite the loss of the non-Russian population of the former Soviet republics, we have already lost more people than in the two world wars together!
Earlier, the same people who destroyed what was built in the previous seventy years during one session in the White Forest had betrayed the socialist camp (created at the cost of millions of lives in World War II and the Great Patriotic War).
They deliberately carried out deindustrializations, disrupted agriculture, cut off from the world’s largest power fourteen republics that had previously been economically linked into a single mechanism.
If we want to look even deeper, then we see the decline of the population, the disintegration of the economy, the sciences, the army, the rise of crime, the interethnic conflicts, the war in Chechnya, all the conflicts in the post-Soviet space, the series of orange revolutions, the expansion of the war, the collapse of NATO and the war in the east.
There is such a concept in politology as the "vacuum of power".
Everything that was quickly robbed and abandoned was quickly filled and conquered by the NATO countries that accepted our geopolitical surrender.
And the whole world is still shocked by the events of the late 1980s and early 1990s of the last century.
The price of a product sold in a supermarket with a large turnover does not necessarily correspond directly with its quality and quality.
It is Monday and we have some meat in the supermarket that costs 189 CZK / kg.
I'll buy it and put it in the fridge and make it a Thursday dinner.
In an alternative reality, where I will not buy this meat on Monday, the chain will discount it on Tuesday to 99 CZK / kg - would you describe me the mechanism by which the change in its price will become a burden for my digestive system?
Or I will wait until Thursday and this meat will be discounted to 69 CZK / kg 1 day before the date of consumption - what would make this meat different from what I bought on Monday for 120 CZK and left it 3 days in my refrigerator?
I'll answer myself - nothing.
These jokes about the fact that when something is cheap, it must be guaranteed to be bad, corrupt or poor quality are terriblely delayed to tell you the truth ;-)
Recently I went to Brno to Hlavas and in the basement the ladies were distributing some brochure, things like this I always take to help the brigadiers, they can't throw it away...
Well, the brochure was full of village reason and conservative views on how the world works, but nowhere about God, I was confused, but I figured it would be some sort of agitation.
After reading, I found out who published it, and eventually Scientology came out of it.
Well, as it was a good mattress, full of totally unnecessary lessons, like I'm supposed to wash and not be a pussy.
Too bad the paper, because of this, the forests wouldn't have to crawl.
I had a similar experience with my ex-girlfriend.
Psychic manipulation and emotional extortion will force you to conform to that person because you love him without being aware of how much the situation is.
She threatened to hurt me several times because I went with a friend she didn't like to go out with.
Or even when I wanted to leave her apartment earlier, she was crying, and she begged me not to go anywhere.
Then she started physically blocking the door.
About a year it was a great relationship, but then the next half-year ran and started chewing it on the palate.
Then I ended the relationship with the fact that I told her I was breaking up, and I beat her up, but we can still talk about it next week so I can calm her down and she won't catch any bullshit again.
Such a person expels feelings, emotions and overall joy from you.
Better to keep a distance
When insurers are furiously spoiled here by buying a cloud of tests and getting it to the positive ones who wouldn't even know about the terrible disease.
The only thing we're achieving is complications for companies, carriers and others, because their employees in the random number generator fell five days of home imprisonment.
In the West, they have already stopped with the chascar and acknowledged that it has no price to deal with the disease weaker than the famous flu.
Unfortunately, the War is new and has to steal something and drive the ego by inventing the buzzing.
I'm watching the old good shit come back to us.
After several years of repression and repression of this unjust business, MLM recruiting is back on track.
I was one of the recruits, I tried it (I was 20 years old, a student at the university), initial promises about product training and business skills quickly turned into "it doesn't have to interest you, especially get people".
Honestly, I was interested in the products that I offer because I wanted to help people, but the training was more about how to scare people and make fun of them.
When the first money earned came, a person quickly realized that if he wanted to make a profit, he had to cultivate a few certain products a month.
Investment life insurance and mortgages were the only lucrative ones, or a person felt like a foreign vendor of pots.
But what I can say, the experience it was valuable, the man learned that he should not jump immediately to every point and thoroughly check the information.
At the same time, I wouldn't put them all in one bag.
People in this business are successful and even beneficial to people, but they will certainly not boast of expensive consumer goods or a "fat" account.
I haven't seen much of that in a corporation where I'm doing things like that.
The HR is calm, the managers are looking at their management and they don’t blow our noses too much.
Regular evaluation, therefore, happens in some way, in the form in which it takes place with us it goes quite well (set some goals for the next year, let's see what came out and what doesn't) - it's more of a self-assessment than someone would judge you by some numbers, and the like.
Events are non-compulsory.
But we are also a bit unique within our company - there are departments that are more "corporate".
Sometimes a person feels like we're such a near-startup that squats in the offices of a big corporation.
But it works so we don't worry too much until the results are.
The Czech Republic is missing in Britain after death.
Her body was found in London.
Almost ten days ago, British police searched for the missing 32-year-old Czech woman, who disappeared at the end of November.
On Sunday, December 12, Foreign Minister Jakub Kulhánek announced in his resignation on social networks that a woman from Hungary was found dead.
The British police have unfortunately confirmed to our representative office in London this afternoon that they have found the body of a missing Czech citizen.
The cause of death is being investigated.
With regard to the family, we will not provide more information about the case.
Congratulations, he said on Twitter.
The young woman was last seen on November 28 in a bus while on the way from work, she was supposed to collect money from ATM before the show.
Her exit was reported by her colleagues five days later.
Afterwards, the London police searched for her, and Interpol ranks her among the missing around the world.
It also appeared in the Czech database of missing persons.
Police have detained a man in this regard a few days ago.
What role he had in the case and what he suspected of, but did not disclose it.
At the end of the year, there are four new municipalities.
On Saturday, December 11, in the municipalities of Kom<0xC5><0x88>a in Hungary, Lu<0xC5><0xBE>ice in Mostecka, Nová Ves in Liberec and Evná in Pelh<0xC5><0x99>imovska, new representatives were elected.
The number of representatives in these municipalities decreased under the statutory number or the elected representatives here disintegrated.
There were 99 valid candidates in the new elections for 28 mandates.
Election turnout was 62.41%.
The highest interest was recorded in the village of Evná, where 93.62% of eligible voters voted.
A total of 8 women and 20 men were given the mandate.
The average age of elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest is 69 years old, the youngest is 33 years old.
A total of 13 candidacy documents have been registered for the new elections in the four municipalities.
There were 28 representative positions for 36 women and 63 men.
The average age of candidates was 46.6 years.
The youngest candidate was 22 years old and the oldest was 72.
Processing the results of the Saturday elections symbolically concludes a relatively demanding but successful year for us.
There were four new or repeated elections to the municipal representatives and, above all, very closely watched elections to the House of Representatives.
At the same time, we had to work mostly in more demanding epidemic conditions, which put greater demands on equipment and personnel security, Eva Krumpová, 1st Vice-President of the Czech Statistical Office, assessed.
The last constituency was held on Sunday, December 12, at 3:49 p.m.
The results of the vote will be discussed by the State Electoral Commission on Monday and will be published in the Bill of Rights after approval.
This is the biggest problem I have with the whole pandemic.
To deal with the fact that we have a quite dangerous infectious disease here took me a while at the very beginning, but it went without any major backlash.
To deal with the stupidity of a large part of the population in all its layers, I have a problem with that so far.
I am most looking forward to the vaccination (tomorrow!) because thanks to it, I will finally be less dependent on the fact that other people are not shit.
He would be deprived of the office of President and the ability to re-acquire it.
The chances that this will really happen are, however, as the others here mention, very small.
In addition, I'm not sure if the downloaded file could be considered a betrayal at all.
The embassy is an act by which the President of the Republic threatens the sovereignty, territorial integrity, or democratic character of the State.
It must have been something more serious.
How the Pandemic Affected Intimate Life: Growing Number of People Under 35 Who Are Sex-Free Throughout the Year
More and more young adults in the United States are living their lives without sex.
These are mainly religious-based people, according to the DailyMail website.
The survey showed that from 2008 to 2021, the proportion of people under 35 who quit their sex life increased from eight to 21 percent.
Women between the ages of 18 and 35 who said they hadn’t had sex in the last year are more than ever.
Other factors contribute to the decline in the number of sexually active individuals, according to a study by the Institute for Family Studies (IFS).
One of them could be the economic impacts of the coronavirus pandemic and a higher percentage of unemployment.
The contribution could also be the presence of media, social media or video games, which make sex a less and less priority for young people.
“Since 2010, the proportion of men and women between the ages of 18 and 35 who said they hadn’t had sex in the previous year is growing rapidly,” said IFS researcher Lyman Stone.
In marriage, sexual activity is more common, and in 2021, only 5% said they had not had sex in the last year.
In free people, it was 29%. Stone added that marriage under the age of 35 is only a small percentage.
The loss of sexual activity also contributes to the fear of premarital contact and religious foundations.
Although married couples are more likely to be sexually active, the percentage of married and married under the age of 35 is still declining.
Young people share opinions about premarital sex, about 30% think it’s a bad thing, while about 70% think it’s okay.
“It’s true that there are a minority among the free individuals in this age group, but their behavior is shifting this trend,” Stone says of those thirty percent.
For most of those who have a moral problem with premarital relationships, it is a reason for religious foundation.
Since 2008, the rate of abstinence has increased from 20 to almost 60 per cent for free people under the age of 35 who attend religious meetings more than once a month.
Among “less believers,” the trend rose from 10 percent to 20 percent,” Stone said.
Other factors also contribute to the decline in sexual activity, such as less social interaction and mainly social alcohol consumption during the pandemic.
The study also found that the likelihood of sex is lower in people without work or with lower income.
Another reason may be the expansion of digital media, which apparently reduces the need for sex.
People spend more time online, thereby “repairing” this need.
This trend has largely followed the lockdown during the coronavirus pandemic.
The whole regulation of Covid vaccines is whether the company should donate a part of the population to behaviors that they don’t want, but that can save their lives.
This is a fairly difficult question, which I personally am most interested in the question of social conscience.
For example, the question is, if we don't order them and they die, it's our fault.
My argument is that we could certainly have killed an 80-year-old man who didn't really know much, we didn't explain it well to him, he heard some disinformation, and as a result he didn't get vaccinated and eventually caught it and died.
On the other hand, I do not think that we can blame for the death of a stiff-necked vaccination opponent, who, alongside the SPD and the KS<0xC4><0x8C>, shouts something about a bullying and totalitarian state.
From the statistics I mentioned, it is quite clear that most unvaccinated pensioners are likely to belong to the second group, so they will be able to do so themselves.
Czech Republic without snow.
How does a mild winter sign a drought fight?
This year’s winter in the Czech Republic has brought one of the smallest snow surpluses in recent times.
The operators of the ski resorts will not be able to do without technical snow, the weather, for example, complicates the preparation of the Jizerské fifties.
Is it a trend or an exception?
And what will little snow mean for the fight against drought in the Czech Republic?
I'd have a story, but it's not about pancakes.
Once in high school, a teacher took us through the whole city on a shipyard so that we could build a project on boats along the river.
On the way there, we once walked a fairly wide street and we probably don’t see anyone in the middle – supporters of the Hare K<0xE1><0xB9><0x9B><0xE1><0xB9><0xA3><0xE1><0xB9><0x87>a sect.
Of course, they've got us.
Fortunately, I ran away, but a friend and I made a speech.
When she left, we asked her and the teacher what she had told them.
"They asked me if I wanted to save my soul.
I told them I didn’t have a soul,” she said.
Everyone, including the teacher, laughed all the way to the yard.
We're awfully confused.
Not so much happens, but the system is already breaking down, says Orozovi<0xC4><0x8D>
German Chancellor Olaf Scholz arrived in Warsaw on Sunday after previous visits to Paris and Brussels, where he was greeted with military compliments by Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki.
“We are opening a new chapter of mutual relations,” Morawiecki said at a joint press conference after the talks.
Mr Scholz stressed that Europe must make it clear together that it will not accept violations of Ukraine’s territorial integrity.
The crisis triggered by the disturbing movements of Russian troops at the Ukrainian borders, according to the chancellor, is to be resolved by means of diplomatic negotiations, even within the “Norman group”, uniting France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine.
Morawiecki said he informed the Chancellor of the situation on the Polish border with Belarus, whose leader Alexander Lukashenko artificially triggered the migration crisis and uses people as living targets and weapons, because every night we record a hundred attempts to cross (illegal) borders.
He talked with the Chancellor about further sanctions so that the Lukashenko regime and its Kremlin patrons finally understand that we are determined to defend the eastern border of the EU.
Scholz said Warsaw enjoyed German support in a dispute with Belarus and condemned the inhumane treatment of the Lukashenko regime with runners.
A drunk Polish nun blamed the accident, tried to hide it
After a while, the car returned to the scene of the accident, but the car was already driven by another dwarf who tried to take the blame on himself.
When she was told by police that she could lose her driver's license for failing to prioritise driving and being caught from the scene of the accident, she came out with the truth, TVN24 said.
She admits that another jetty crashed into the car and asked her for help.
Then the police came for Sister Celestina.
She underwent a breath test and, after finding that she had more than two diaphragms in her blood, she immediately received her driver's license.
At the same time, she was informed that she would confess to her actions in court.
Hugo does what he can.
Juraj Shajmovi<0xC4><0x8D> did not hesitate to make his film.
Czech creators of family comedies stared at each other in American stories about pet dogs.
But they forgot the essential thing: the legality of the film trade.
After the thrilling film F. Brabce Gump - a dog that taught people how to live, now the spectator emotion in cinemas comes to another picture Here we watch.
The co-author of the script and the director in one person, Juraj <0xC5><0xA0>ajmovi<0xC4><0x8D> ml., freely follows his previous film Here I watch from 2012.
On the scene returns talking pond Hugo and some famous characters around him.
Julie and Ivan, the owners of the forest pension, who is dying, and so they begin to call him a puppy, Julie's father with her partner and most notably her daughter Veronika.
She is no longer a little girl, but a teenage girl who experiences first love.
The director and his partner Beatriz <0xC5><0xA0>ajmovi<0xC4><0x8D>ova (who is also the producer of the film) were already confronted with the storytelling practices in the previous picture, but at least children and a dog were entertained there.
This time, the creative couple wrote an even weaker script that sparked a mixture of amazement and embarrassment.
Let's summarize it.
Julie, although a scientist, may be subjected to the temptation of the child's own delusions, and if the right "constellation" comes from, she is chopping with her forest engineer Ivan, wherever the coordinates are determined – on the hood of a car or a church tower, she is going through the process (of course, in the course of the excavation).
Nothing against the cleansing treatment of nature and the strength of animal pets.
Their owners know why they have them.
The spectator, however, wondered what kind of content a pelpellet full of unbelievable situations and figures was needed for this message.
A pair of staff thieves, a dogfighter competition, a forested charlatan, policemen coming to search for “drugs” and discussing over herbs about the fertile power of bone marrow – and that a baked family in a guesthouse of course drank.
When a heroine wakes up after a severe coma and soon sits on the edge of a family table and is asked for her father’s whiskey and flakes as a cured vegetarian, she can’t laugh.
The viewer will explain to the creators that “it sometimes happens after a coma.”
Shajmovi<0xC4><0x87>’s team lacks basic dramaturgy knowledge of working with text, the ability to construct situations, a sense of character and point and directing.
The performances are unbalanced, the cut is seamless and the overall impression is inflamed.
No matter how much Lukas Vaculík, Jitka Je<0xC5><0xBE>ková or Nela Boudová try to give up their parties, they don’t have much to play.
The only feature of the film remains the poetic pictures of the forest nature of cameraman Vladimir Holomko and a pair of lakes.
It is not enough to draw a few characters, a cottage plot and dog rumors, as well as more folk vulgar expressions, whose characters are allowed.
The argument is not even a volatile membership in the Club of breeders - as in the case of the female producer.
Behind the good intentions of promoting nature and the friendship of man with the dog must also be the knowledge of the craft, if one wants to tell a credible story.
It didn't happen in this case.
For a good family picture, there is a little bit of eroticity and a minimum of something for the genre.
Not even as a canistherapy advertisement would this amateur-looking piece go through.
Yeah, respect, 'cause they have to listen to the constant bullshit exactly from idiots like you.
There's a difference between offering and forcing, here's to see how shit you understand, but it's just because you've never tried it.
The decision is always up to the customer, if he doesn’t want to, the answer will always be no.
If you ever listened to the furt, you might have changed your mind.
It's a job like any other, in that case the Brigade of Allocations.
The Middle East suffers from unusually dry months.
Winter is the only time of the year when it rains.
“The complete absence of falls during November, as we have recorded at some stations, is unusual,” the Israeli Meteorological Service said.
For example, the village of Kfar Gilad in northern Israel reports only 6% of the long-term rainfall average for November.
The two-day rain from this week was an exception.
It's good for us.
It didn't take long.
It is also the right Christmas scene, was delighted by the inhabitants of Nazareth Wasim Ashkar.
Catches in Israel come almost exclusively in the winter months, they are shocking and irregular.
Forests depend on winter rainfall.
Without them, they are dry and prone to fire.
It is not only about forests, but also about drinking water and water supply for farmers.
Israel’s largest freshwater source, Lake Galilee, has been flooded by the last three rainy winters this spring.
Since then, the level has fallen.
Water owners have warned of drought a long time ago.
"It is expected that, depending on global warming and climate change, there may be a drop in the area," said Uri Schor, a spokeswoman for the Israeli Water Administration in 2018.
Israel can use technologies such as sewage or wastewater recycling.
Economically weaker countries such as Lebanon, Syria and Jordan are worse.
In the streets of Jordan's capital, Amman, there is an increase in tankers.
Water and private wells are drying out.
“This year, I have increased my orders by 70 to 80 percent compared to the previous two years,” said Imád Suleiman, a tanker driver.
In Isfahan, Iran, clashes broke out between farmers and security forces.
The reason for the protests was drought.
The local river Coryto was completely without water.
The region has the driest month of November in recent years.
Israel Prepares Military Intervention Against Iran
Israel's defense minister said the Vienna talks had "not made any progress" and that he had informed Washington of the preparations for the attack on Iran's nuclear facilities.
Minister Benny Gantz said on Saturday that he had ordered the Israeli army to prepare for the possibility of a military strike against Iran, Jonathan Lis reported.
Gantz, who resides in the United States, is trying to persuade Americans to step up their pressure on Iran, but also to inform Washington about military preparations.
During a press conference in Florida, Gantz said the nuclear talks in Vienna had "not made any progress" and the world powers "think that the Iranians are playing with them".
This happened to me about 3 years ago, too.
I liked the lady a little bit and barbecued in an interview to find out what she really wanted for me.
Eventually, I found that my suspicion of the pyramid was justified.
Because I really don't like these assholes, so I've been squeezing the lady with doubts and questions for a while and finally thanked her and left.
Don't worry, I'm a coward, but the pyramid is a pyramid, and the financial advisers are financial advisers.
Skiers went to the mountains on weekends, waiting for them enough snow and nice weather
Mountain resorts in the Czech Republic experienced the first major enthusiasm of skiers this weekend.
After extensive snowfall at the end of the working week, there is no snow emergency and some ski resorts have started operating.
The successor did not deter the obligation to prove himself with a Covid certificate at the trains.
While skiers are not complaining about customer disinterest, some ski equipment rental companies report a weaker demand for their services than before the epidemic.
Thousands of people went to the runways and to the slopes during the weekend in the Liberec region.
The skiers wanted the weather, which today offered the sun and excellent snow conditions.
“We are pleased that the opening weekend has really come out since Friday evening skiing, when we had the first skier on the hill,” Je<0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC4><0x9B>d Jakub Hanu<0xC5><0xA1>, Director of the Sports Arena, praised the interest.
Hundreds of people also went to Jeseník for the first weekend skiing in the new season.
For example, they had open Ski Arena Karlov or a ski resort in Branné, <0xC5><0xA0>umpersk.
The weekend visit was very decent, on Saturday and today an estimated 400 people came.
Conditions are agreed upon.
Today the sun was shining, it was about minus three degrees, so perfect, not spared the praise of the representative of the ski resort in Branna Rostislav Prokázka.
Ski area operators can only sell ski passports to people who are vaccinated or are in a deadline after COVID-19.
Except for exceptions, people are ready to do so and have the necessary documents, said René Hrones of the <0xC5><0xA0>pindler<0xC5><0xAF>v Ml<0xC3><0xBD>n ski center.
"We've only recorded the incident units," he added.
Lower interest than before the pandemic is reported by some rental companies and ski equipment stores.
Fortunately, there is interest in ski lending.
It’s not the same as in previous years, but there are still enough customers, said Alexandra Boki<0xC5><0xA1>ová from Skiopava’s opava store.
More effort is expected during the period of ski courses.
Also, David <0xC5><0xA0>inták, director of the Royal Snowbear company, feels that due to covid, there is no such interest in renting ski equipment as before.
During the pandemic, we were almost loaned.
Compared to the period before the pandemic, we are about 50 percent, <0xC4><0x8C>TK <0xC5><0xA0>inták said.
He said people were sickened by the pandemic and learned to sit at home.
On the contrary, there is a high demand for rentals in Novako on Bo<0xC5><0xBE>í Dara.
Ski rentals started there a week ago and the interested parties have to book them in advance.
“We are starting to borrow runs this weekend, but people have already called ahead, so we expect a lot of interest, just like last year,” said Pavlína Novaková, the site operator.
According to her, an interest comparable to the period before the epidemic is also a ski school.
If we want the successful and the wealthy not to go abroad, they must have the opportunity to live a quality life as abroad.
This certainly does not include socialist health care, where it is often not possible to get a dentist or a specialist.
There are smart and stylish people out there who don’t have any property.
The owner of the company is not going to go abroad.
Too much, but I totally agree.
If these people will not live well in the Czech Republic and if these people will not have a vision of a reasonable future in the Czech Republic, then they will simply not live in the Czech Republic.
Emigration from Hungary began with a beautiful day won by Orbán, a year reigning, and all of a sudden the annual emigration rose by a few tens of thousands.
It is naive to think that the Czech Republic cannot find itself in a similar position from day to day.
The next question is the election.
If there's going to be a fool here, some traditional V4k insane can win here too.
Young and educated people will leave, his supporters will remain and people whose possessions cannot be plunged into the plane.
Awful photo!
Langmayer's in the blood because of the beer bet?
While in the Czech Republic it was full autumn, in Thailand the crew of the film Island led by Ji<0xC5><0x99>í Langmajer (55) enjoyed tropical weather!
The actor posted a bleeding photo of his face on social media.
Is it a real injury, or is it a make-up for filming?
London police are still looking for an unidentified Czech.
She was last seen on her way home.
“The disappearance of Petra is not at all like her behavior, and we are starting to be very concerned about her,” Lucy O’Connor, of the police department in Lambeth district where Mrnec worked, said in a video on Saturday.
“Her family in the Czech Republic is also very concerned about her and, in short, wants to know where she is,” she continued.
The missing Czech Republic said on Sunday, November 28, at about 7:45 p.m., she left work and headed home to the Camberwell district.
The last time she was seen on the bus was about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported on December 3 by one of her colleagues.
According to the British media, Mrs. was a nurse at the Evelina London Children's Hospital, which is part of the Guy's and St Thomas Hospital Association.
“We are extremely concerned about our dear colleague Petra, who is unaware,” a group of health facilities said on Twitter.
"We would like to encourage anyone who could have any information that could help her find her to contact the police," the statement said.
The public is also calling on MEP Harriet Harman to cooperate, who warned on Saturday about the Srnc case at a press conference.
"She's been unaware for a few days, she's only 32, she's from the Czech Republic, her parents are obviously resigned to death," the Labour politician said, holding a photo of a woman distributed by the London police in her hand.
“I feel like we all have a special responsibility to try and find her, because she was outside her home country, away from her family, and working here for our health care,” Harman said.
Police have previously detained a man who remains in custody in connection with the case.
According to the BBC news website, however, the police did not provide any information about his identity or what the man was suspected of.
Russia is not able to occupy Ukraine, and certainly not with 30 BTG (i.e. about 5 divisions).
I don’t underestimate Ukraine like that either.
These are not “a huge amount,” but about 8% of the Russian army.
Note that Ukraine is constantly repeating that we are waging the threat of invasion and is beginning to have our entry full of teeth.
I quoted above.
I don't know why you thought Russia wanted a war.
War is a damn expensive joke and Russia has a GDP of Italy.
The comparison with the situation in the year 38 is in so many points that I don’t even know where to start.
I can already compare this to the First Punic War and the “Annex” of Sicily :D
I can imagine that after Ukraine announced that it did not intend to abide by the Minsk agreement, Russia annexed those ridiculous republics.
That's all, and that's what the "concentration" on the borders would be like.
Yes, the pacta is servanda...
New schedules apply in Prague from Sunday, mainly affecting suburban connections
Passengers in Prague Integrated Transport (PID) are awaiting several changes from Sunday, which relate in particular to suburban connections.
New lines have emerged, some have changed the route, and others have disappeared.
Mladoboleslavsko is newly involved in the integrated system.
In the capital from Sunday, the bus stops from <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xBD> Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovic in Zagardní M<0xC4><0x9B>sto station.
In suburban train transport, S7 trains depart on the route from Beroun to <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xBD> Brod through the main train station in Prague.
In the newly operated Prague-Zahradní M<0xC4><0x9B>sto station, R17 from <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovic and Bene<0xC5><0xA1>ov will stop again.
PID is expanding to other areas.
Among other things, buses run to Svetlé nad Sázavou, Blatna u Jesenice, Stare Splav<0xC3><0xBD> and Turnov.
Buses to Mladoboleslavsk include lines to the Liberec and Královéhradec region.
With the integration, 77 lines will be cancelled, 37 new ones will be introduced and 12 operating lines will be modified.
From Prague Zli<0xC4><0x8D>ina there will be a new bus line 405 that will go to <0xC5><0xBD>atce.
There was also a new direct connection between Prague and Kralovice, which replaces the cancelled S53 train line.
They will be reinforced in the morning and on the weekend of the connection from Prague to Krakow, when the express line number 404 will come out again.
The PID has recently included lines 400 and 410 to the Liberec region.
They leave from the St<0xC5><0x99>í<0xC5><0xBE>kov metro station, not from the railway station Hole<0xC5><0xA1>ovice.
Line 400 crosses M<0xC4><0x9B>lník, Dubou and <0xC4><0x8C>eská Lípu to Nov<0xC3><0xBD> Bor and the selected connections continue to Rumburk or Cvikov.
Additional line 410 passes through M<0xC4><0x9B>lník and Dubou to Doks, Mimone and Jablonn<0xC3><0xBD> in Podje<0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC4><0x9B>di.
On the contrary, the new operation is cancelled or restricted on dozens of central Chinese local routes, including to Mochova, Dob<0xC5><0x99>í<0xC5><0xA1>e or Ro<0xC5><0xBE>mitál pod T<0xC5><0x99>em<0xC5><0xA1>ín.
All trains leaving Prague are cancelled at 02:30.
Due to the modernisation of the railways, long-term restrictions continue on the lines Prague – Beroun, Prague – Lysá nad Labem and in the vicinity of Cologne.
The changes are waiting for the passengers in other places as well.
Buses replace some cancelled railway lines or extend the section on line 420 from Dob<0xC5><0x99>í<0xC5><0xA1> with a connection from Prague, where it is possible to use PID tickets to Milevosk.
The routes of lines 540 to 543 to Nymburk have been changed and the routes of some buses on the border of central Czech and Ho<0xC5><0x99>ovic in the Plze<0xC5><0x88> region have been adjusted.
Healthy breakfast/lunch in the office from the supermarket
Hi, I'm doing a classic 9-5 with a 30min break and my only option to get food is to go next to Billy or a little further to Lidl.
Since I don’t have any exercise, I don’t have the strength to exercise after work, so I have to eat as healthy and dietically as possible.
Unfortunately, I never know what to buy and quickly I buy maximum pizza grounds and a snack of yogurt and apple.
Question: What healthy without the need for heat treatment would you recommend me to buy in the supermarket?
Not everyone is waiting for a meter of snow like you, so unfortunately it is.
And it’s not about trees that you need to see.
Under the snow, only the top of the tree can be hidden.
If it falls down, the tree may be more prone to fungal diseases.
I'm not saying that's the only reason we're banned from riding out of the runway, but it's one of them.
Confession of a Relationship with Nedveda: I wasn't happy at all about this
The Czech showbusiness pond has been living nothing but the revelation of the relationship between Dary Rollins and Pavel Nedv<0xC4><0x9B>d since Friday.
They have been pulling it together for years, a famous footballer even got divorced because of the singer.
Dara now sends an extensive message to fans explaining why love had been hiding in front of them for half a year.
“I allow myself to claim that there is currently no one in Czech Republic or Slovakia who would escape that Dara caught a bear, that is, sorry, Nedv<0xC4><0x9B>da,” jokes Dara Rollins, who is in love with the most successful Czech footballer.
He said, but he picked it up, not the other way around.
Three days are the center of attention, and although they are accustomed to the public interest, they do not enjoy it.
And it's here.
What we both didn’t like, but we knew it would happen one day, the singer continues.
I just don't know who's worse.
Whether those who are not interested in it at all, and it jumps out of them and the cans, or we, whose lives are thoroughly distilled.
As if one of you wanted to hear your opinion about whether you’re fit enough with your spouse or girlfriend, or you insisted that everyone really know the list of your ex-partners and be familiar with the list of your mistakes and mistakes.
That's what you want, it's what you want, Darryl.
The couple came together in Italy, where Rollins drove to prepare her new fashion collection.
Nedvädt has been there for a long time as vice president of Juventus football club.
They only went out with the truth now, because they were waiting for Ned's divorce to be completed.
My wife and Ivana have been separated for three years, but they are not their own but only three weeks.
Anyway, thank you to those who are happy with us and want to do so.
We are only people, we have families, children, the past and dreams.
We're not perfect, but I think we have both hearts in the right place.
That's why I love my new husband, and like him with me, I stand with him. In good and in bad, Rolins concluded.
Hi, the other commentators have already said almost everything essential, I just confirm that the tracks are great at the beginning, my colleagues met mostly during the first semester or two and scammed and then found a hiring together, which will come to me as the best option, because you know, you'll be with
Apartments are usually not advertised too long in advance, so you probably won’t find much now, but looking at the offer will certainly not hurt.
Otherwise you will certainly avoid not only Ceila, but also the surroundings (streets like Vranovská, French etc., this is a pretty bad address), and some parts of the Jews are a bit of a ghetto.
In contrast, the Veve<0xC5><0x99>í district is very student-oriented, Královo field and so it's fine, besides, it's close to most VUT faculty (I don't know exactly where you're going).
So I have never rented, but I am a native of Br<0xC5><0x88>ák, so I can possibly consult Brno as such, if you still lack some information :)
This is an example of “normal” thinking.
Due to what a number of doctors have decided to do somewhere in Poland, it is actually perfectly okay that the state does not sufficiently finance some schools.
Either they learn what they want and pay for it from their own or they go according to the state and pay for the state.
After all, we can’t let a private actor control a piece of education just because a couple of crowns will come to a full state contribution and so he will be able to learn what he wants in schools.
Such a claim loses some weight when it is written by a man who, two days earlier, expressed himself as a petition for a boycott of a totalitarian state:
So the voice against whether someone's going to get an abortion is the same for you as the voice against a statue standing on the square?
If I were you, I'd consult directly with the man who gave you the job.
Otherwise, I have already experienced in cataloging/digitalization that (and also for many years of professionals) it is either in some way right from the eye, or they write something in the way xxx *** or ... (according to the convention) and to note that it is unreadable.
The truth is that in this case it is quite legible, so I probably wouldn’t recommend it at all.
Personally, I'd deal with it somehow in a note depending on what program you're using.
If you want to be a decent and hardworking student, you can look into some character databases and look for the nearest one.
But since it looks like you're drawing from a book, I'd tip to myself that the author or printer simply created his own character that fits into what's physically on that coin.
PS: Isn’t that the Odry Empire (kingdom) rather than the Odry Ns?
P.S.: Someone has already let you down.
Take a look at this comment with F<0xC3><0x82>LH
Politicians don’t even know what will be the “theme” of our Presidency.
That’s a lot worse than having an interpreter with you.
The idea that they would approve of something because no one understood a text is smiling.
All important approved documents are examined word by word, however some basic knowledge of English is not enough, it is a matter of lawyers.
Hundreds of translators and interpreters work in different EU institutions, and English is more suitable for informal contacts, for the establishment of superior relationships.
In addition, with that English, it is quite interesting, after the GB exit from the EU.
I don't understand Ceylon's hatred.
I’ve been working there for the third year and I’m fine.
How many times do I drive out of work at 10 p.m. and never have a problem.
The fact that it is a ghetto can only be said by someone who has barely ever walked there in life.
Yes, most Roma people live in Brno, but the only thing they do is stop on the sidewalk and park where they don’t :D it’s definitely not that I’m afraid to go out there in the evening.
So if you are looking for a relatively cheap accommodation with good accessibility to the center, then I would go into it peacefully.
Plenty of apartments are now newly renovated or newly built.
Felix Slova<0xC4><0x8D>ek (78) without Dáda and the lover of Gelem like a bark in the fence!
Who is he spending Christmas with?
On Sunday, most people on the Advent wreath lighted the first candle, Felix Slova<0xC4><0x8D>ek did not.
I don't have an advent gift, so there was nothing to ignite.
I have seen the gifts of the devotee, and Lucie certainly has some, said the Lightning saxophonist, who thus confirmed the words of Patras, that he often visits her.
He visits, but does not live in their house in Vinohrad, where Dáda remained alone after his departure.
The Slovak still does not know where he will be on Christmas Eve.
We recently met Ani<0xC4><0x8D>ka, Felix and both grandchildren.
VIDEO: Felix Slova<0xC4><0x8D>ek and Lucie Gelemová: ZASE SPOLU!
Felix Slova<0xC4><0x8D>ek and Lucie Gelemová: ZASE SPOLU!
But we always talked to each other about something, so it didn't happen at Christmas.
I really don't know where I'm going.
I'm buying gifts all the time and I'm sure I'm buying something for Daddy and Lucy, probably perfume.
I'm a gentleman, added Felix, who himself came to baptize the music video to the Richman Club.
I'm alone here, but I don't feel alone.
I will always find someone I like to have fun with, says Slova<0xC4><0x8D>ek, who was happy to meet the wife of Ludjka Sobota Adriana or the singer Kamil Nyvltov.
And he made it clear.
And we're Iceland, so we can afford to have no soldiers and no weapons?
I doubt someone is going to defend us and our location is so strategic that the aggressor would have to be an absolute idiot in order not to occupy this territory.
And I don't understand why that should be a bad argument, so explain it to me?
I don't know any other component that could be deployed in hospitals in the crisis.
There are few police officers and they can’t afford it, so firefighters and nowhere else is such a high percentage of health-educated people at this level.
And the fact that our army is capable of defending Ostrava just goes to the head of previous governments, not the army, it has been asking for new toys for quite a long time.
A record-breaking drought in the Czech Republic.
It is necessary to change the agricultural subsidies, the country should not be just a food factory, the journalist says.
The Czech Republic is experiencing the worst period of drought in recent years.
According to scientists, the waters have remained in mountainous and sub-mountain areas, a smaller number of precipitations also record places where there has been no need for moisture so far.
The cause of drought in much of Central Europe is climate change.
The impacts, however, also reinforce the way we manage the soil.
What to prepare for when it comes to drying?
And how can we help nature in difficult times?
Yeah, it's gonna be, I'm barely going to stay on the ice, the fungus know what it's like to play hockey, and the tactic (which I tried in the Hockey Manager franchise) is also a total hallucination.
And whether you're a hockey team "Bear Russia" or "Lama China" so lose by two goals, even if you don't have to win a match at all costs, it's different than when compared.
But just as I listen to Czech comments, what the referees don’t notice whether men’s or women’s hockey, it’s all weird, but it’s probably the same with all sports, UEFA and “Italian players” or motorsport F1, WRC, etc.
Controversy is everywhere.
And if it were the opposite, it would be as usual, and that the Czech Republic had already lost with Russia more often than they had won, it would probably be the classic "I'm losing" vs "I've won".
Coronavirus: Number of infections in Russia exceeds 10 million
On Saturday, December 11, the Czech Republic recorded 9080 daily infections.
5766 people have been hospitalized.
In total, 34,451 people died in the Czech Republic, another 74.
The confirmed cases in the last 14 days in the Czech Republic are 100,000 in 1967, 871 in 100,000 in the last week.
The number of infections in Russia exceeded 10 million on Sunday.
In the last 24 hours, 29,929 new infections have been reported.
This is the lowest number of days since October 13.
The total number of registered infections in Russia is 10 016 896.
The daily death toll is 1132, the lowest daily death toll since the end of October.
Britain is facing an "inevitable" major wave of Omicron-induced disease, Dr. Susan Hopkins, chief medical consultant for the British Health Safety Authority, said on Sunday.
New quarantine measures will be needed.
Omicron-infected people are already hospitalized in Britain, and Hopkins expects their numbers to increase.
No one has died on omicron yet, but hospitalizations take place about fourteen days after the infection and deaths about three weeks after the infection.
British Labour chief Keir Starmer said on Sunday that Boris Johnson apparently violated the law by organizing a Christmas quiz in Downing Street last December, when it was introduced lockdown and were banned from Christmas parties.
One Johnson government minister argued that the quiz took place “virtually” through a computer.
However, he participated in the Downing Street group of employees gathered around the computers.
In Britain, pressure is increasing to remove Johnson from the prime minister's office.
During last December, when a strict lockdown was introduced in London and Christmas parties were banned, Johnson's ministers held numerous parties despite a lockdown.
The British public and the media are outraged that Johnson and his government have made fun of them:
Paul Brand, editor of commercial TV ITV for Britain: Boris Johnson won the general election two years ago.
This morning, the Conservative Party is talking about the need to remove him from the office of prime minister.
It is remarkable how quickly the events evolved.
Do you want to turn around and save your skin?
Hungary is awaiting the spring elections, which could end the 12-year government of Viktor Orbán.
These will be European-wide elections.
How much can we expect them to be fair?
They won't be fair.
They probably won’t be free, because they haven’t been the last two elections under Orbán.
His party Fidesz controls the media, changes the boundaries of the electoral districts to profit from it, and makes more or less tricks.
So far the latter sounds like anyone can in practice vote wherever they want.
This will allow the Fidesz to bring voters from determined districts to those where the result is uncertain and the opposition could succeed.
So I'm just repeating that they're not fair at all.
Do you think it will be just as unfair as in 2014 and 2018?
The situation is quite different, though.
Previously, it was not about whether Fidesz would win, but how much and whether he would have a constitutional majority.
Now there is a real chance that more votes and mandates will be won by the united opposition.
This is a big habit for Viktor Orbán and his side.
Aren’t they going to try to keep playing even harder?
Yes, we have some hints that they're ready to go beyond what they've done so far.
Recently, a recording of the president of the parliament and one of the leaders of the Fidesz, László Kövér, escaped to the independent media, explaining to the heads of intelligence that the opposition poses a threat to national security.
Are these the signs of a new approach you’re talking about?
Yeah, that's one of those novelties.
It all starts with the language.
I was beaten quite often, the last time at 14, my mom’s parents didn’t have much patience, I didn’t, her dad had a long time, but then it hurts extremely (only in relation to me).
At the same time, I was very cholera and I got angry as a little awful, to the point that I was lying on the ground in a crash and was completely blue, so I took a shower about 2x to calm down.
Sometimes I got a puppy, sometimes it was more like they didn't know.
I definitely have a tendency to deal with things with violence now, as a little girl I was quite washed, now to kick myself into something at least with a pussy and as a young person I might have been crying through my hands like that (so I didn’t get too much of a hold), so I never have to do anything extreme, but I never have to do it.
I'm not able to determine to what extent that's my explosiveness, but I'm sure that's what that education is all about.
I am afraid that I will also lose patience with all the children and deal with it the same way.
I think it's just bad to beat kids and that my parents shouldn't do it, especially not at the time when it was no longer "educational," but frustratingly, on the other hand, maybe every parent just poses something, maybe it's not possible to put their children at least, not a little bit.
It doesn’t bother me, I don’t understand why OP should be ashamed of something.
The laws must be clear and unambiguous.
So I would call customers those that make up the laws in such a quality.
Otherwise, I wonder if you're not afraid of income loss?
Can you really count on people to want and buy the product and you will have a mortgage from which to pay?
Cocker's ugly world.
Where will Slovakia move the trial for the murder of journalist Kuciak?
In Slovakia, the main plot begins in the trial with the four-man accused of the murder of Ján Kuciak and Martina Ku<0xC5><0xA1>nírová.
The death of the investigative reporter and his partners changed Slovakia.
She displaced civil society, but also revealed the practices of the accused businessman Marian Ko<0xC4><0x8D>ner and his connection to the top of Slovak politics and justice.
How serious will the process be for Slovakia?
That's what journalists pay for.
How is it possible that this petition had more media attention than the anti-competition of the dean of all medical faculties, which was issued a day, two later?

Next government ends and the law on the involvement of municipalities in the selection of warehouses nowhere
Minister Karl Havlí<0xC4><0x8D>ek’s proposal needs to be fundamentally revised
The government of Prime Minister Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1> is at an end and the law, which was supposed to ensure respect for the interests of municipalities and their citizens when selecting and authorizing a deep storage of highly radioactive waste, still does not exist.
The Legislative Council of the Government has suspended the discussion of the proposal submitted to the Government after the flight of the Ministry of Industry and Trade.
However, its content is in serious conflict not only with the affected communities associated in the Platform against deep storage, but also with the Union of Cities and Communities of the Czech Republic.
Self-government governments expect more significant reinforcement of their options when deciding on storage, which is promised to concerns since 2011, when the first work on this legislation began and which is required by the Czech Atomic Law and the European Directive.
We expect the new government to revise its draft coalition treaty in cooperation with the municipalities.
The proposal for a law from Minister Karl Havlí<0xC4><0x8D>ka, who has the Platform available, concerns the municipalities in particular: The proposed degree of involvement of municipalities and the public in the decision-making process on the location of the warehouse is insufficient and cannot ensure respect for the interests of municipalities and their citizens.
Indeed, it can only be effective if the municipality or the public can influence whether the process will continue in a given location at all.
This can be ensured by the retention of the warehouse management obligation to request the consent of the municipalities concerned prior to the initiation of a specific procedure.
The proposal for an act of intent almost completely ignores the involvement of the public and makes the citizens of the municipalities practically mere statisticians in the licensing proceedings.
The proposal lacks system compensation settings for municipalities for the entire search and location selection process for the warehouse, its authorization and operation.
Municipal representatives really do not have too much opportunity, according to today’s legal standards, to defend the interests of their citizens when looking for a place for storage.
Only in certain authorisation procedures may they make their comments or withdraw, but the office or the minister in whose interest the authorisation is to be granted shall decide.
Any action shall not have a delayed effect on the conduct of exploration or construction work.
The co-determination of self-governments requested by the Platform is a principle commonly used in many democratically developed countries, and certainly then in those where they have already advanced in the authorisation of storage facilities, such as in Sweden or Finland.
The preparation of the law is also another failure of the state administration, which hires external legal offices to prepare the legislation.
In this case, it is a contract with the law firm HAVEL & PARTNERS s.r.o., which was concluded by S<0xC3><0x9A>RAO and which follows the contracts with the lawyer Jan Zemanek.
According to the contract register, the total amount for these works is about 4 million kroner.
Antonín Sekni<0xC4><0x8D>ka, Deputy Mayor of Cejle from Hrádek and spokesman of the Platform against Deep Storage, said: After the Ministers of Industry, who have aligned the position of self-government with the state authorities in the search for a deeper storage of highly radioactive waste, have only repelled the debris to their debris.
We also offer a helping hand.
We also thank the Association of Cities and Communities for their support, which sees the problem of insufficient municipal rights in such fundamental constructions in a similar way as the directly affected municipalities in selected locations.
The anti-depth storage platform brings together 51 members (35 municipalities and cities and 16 associations) to enforce a change in the state’s approach to treating incinerated nuclear fuel and other radioactive waste, which will not be limited to deep storage.
The platform further promotes that the decision to select a site for possible storage is conditional on the prior consent of the municipalities concerned.
Actor John Goodman (69) forced to lose weight: Shodil 90 kg.
Although he had no need to change his lifestyle for many years, he was eventually frightened by doctors.
They told him that if he didn't die, he would die.
And that took it.
Goodman gradually lost 90 kilograms, which is half of his original weight of 180 kilograms, reports The Sun newspaper.
His new character was featured in Los Angeles at the premiere of the animated series The Freak Brothers.
From the thickness of Roseanne's seat, he's a completely different person!
John liked to joke that his friends and family asked him to lose weight because his large body caused furniture to burst.
“I put it all in my mouth,” the actor said in an interview with AARP in 2018.
This time I wanted to do it slowly.
Move, exercise, move.
“I’m reaching an age when I can’t afford to sit in my seat anymore,” he told ABC Goodman, whose transformation is amazing.
It also depends on what boss and where you want to use the word "boss".
If there is any text on the platform that expects readers from the gaming environment, I wouldn’t translate it at all.
If it were a formal text or a college text, I would probably be looking for a way of describing or explaining bosses.
There are several types of bosses for everything.
For example, a game like Dark Souls etc. has a few bosses that do, and so the "boss" is something like a master/governor of a given level, and then there is the final boss...
In many games there are hidden bosses (super boss, hidden boss) who do not need to be defeated at all to complete the game or level, but are often even stronger than the standard boss.
Then there are Half-Life games where the bosses are, but the player sticks with them directly (Tentacle, Gargantua), and they can be called in any way?
And then there are the mini bosses.
It is not possible to translate the boss uniformly in any way, Czech and other languages do not solve it in any way (interestingly, we need only Catalan, which translates the boss as the final opponent).
It is short for a story or game generally significant, computer-controlled, opponent stronger than all previous and supervising the completion of any level or task.
After the disappearance of Peter from London, the whole world is searching for him.
The Czech police were also involved.
After the disappearance of Peter Srnc, the British police have been searching for him since December 3.
The Czech police were also involved in the search.
She has been looking for a 32-year-old woman from Hungary since December 7.
At the same time, Interpol is helping the British police.
The Czech Republic was last seen by her colleagues on November 28.
British police have been looking for her since December 3.
Interpol issued a so-called yellow circuitry for her.
Peter is looking for the whole world.
“The Czech police are working closely with the British police,” police spokeswoman Kate<0xC5><0x99>ina Rendlová said.
“We share information on the case,” she added.
The announcement of the search for Peter has already appeared on the police website.
According to him, it is 168 centimeters tall, thin and has brown eyes and long straight hair of the same color.
It should come from Hungary, Hungary.
Petra worked as a nurse in one of London’s hospitals.
Friends and colleagues are worried about her, because such disappearance is very unusual for her
Harriet Harman was also involved in the search for Peter.
She was involved in hanging out flyers with Petra's face.
"We are very concerned about her," she said at a press conference on Saturday.
In connection with the disappearance, British police have already detained a suspect.
It is unclear who he was and what he had in common with Peter.
The Czech Republic terrorizes Agent Tesla.
While the data in October indicated a slight decline in attack campaigns, last month with the approaching end of the year, the attacks significantly increased.
A big campaign in connection with Agent Tesla was recorded on November 18.
The attacks are targeted against the Czech Republic.
At the moment, the attacker’s strategy remains the same.
The infected attachment in the email is intended to attract the attention of the user with a name that refers to payments and financial transactions.
"While last month had a dangerous attachment in the name of the bill, this time it was labeled as a Copy of 11,2021...exe bill repairs," said Martin Jirkal of Esset.
Spyware contains features that scan web browsers and other programs, such as Microsoft Outlook email clients, Mozilla Thunderbird or Yandex.
The malicious code actively searches for stored login data, which it then sends to the attackers.
The last strong campaign took place in the Czech Republic at the turn of August and September and with the upcoming holidays and the end of the year, the activity of the attackers is growing again.
In November, the Spyware Formbook remained active.
Unlike Agent Tesla, the attackers in this case do not focus specifically on the Czech Republic and security specialists in November rather captured campaigns with global reach.
Compared to the October data, Formbook in November slightly weakened, but still worth almost a fifth of all detections.
The attacks continued throughout the month, with increased activity on November 3, 10 and 15.
The formbook most often contained an attachment with the .exe extension, which was named REQUEST FOR SPECIFICATION.
However, the name of the account is still appearing.
The appendix in the Czech language can then be far more dangerous for the Czech user.
Security analysts at Fareit, which accounted for 1.6 percent of the attacks and has not had a major attack campaign in the Czech Republic in the past few months, have seen significant declines and diminished activity.
Today's demo of smart people who don't need oxygen because oxygen is for vaccinated fools.
The guide to Prague was larger than the media says.
According to the footage of the coastal passage, and according to my experience of the demonstrator, I am not afraid to estimate about 10,000 people.
The people in the passage filled the coast and the bridge and the opposite coastal communication.
That means that people really do a lot.
In addition, an unprecedented number of demonstrators is spontaneously added to the passage.
I say something new is born here, writes Radek Wekry.
That the constant dissatisfaction of several large groups or classes of the population led them to find a common language.
Only the anti-smokers themselves, anti-smokers, and so on, would not have been able to fill or pay such a large fee.
The actions of the association Chcípl dog have an upward popularity, reminds me of a million moments for the democracy of wrinkles.
Sometimes I have the impression that they are renting the same stage and technique.
It's hard to say what kind of dissatisfaction could take away from this movement, it depends not only on the contribution of the money, but also on whether the three-dose vaccine from Pfizer will not become a square and more dosage.
It's definitely not going to be a left-wing or middle-wing movement, bet it.
A three-dose vaccine will almost certainly become multi-dose because it is obvious that we will have to be over-vaccinated every six months.
I'm so glad the vaccines saved us.
The genius action of scientists, of which humanity is quite proud.
At the end of the pause, Bulgaria has a new prime minister reporting change
Bulgarian President Rumen Radev commissioned the creation of a new government by Kiril Petkov from the anti-corruption movement We continue with the change that won the November elections.
This has already managed to form a broad coalition government, which is expected to take office within a few days.
The political crisis in the country has been going on since April, when the last government lost the election under heavy anti-corruption protests.
However, the winning parties reporting the fight against remuneration and abuse of power were unable to agree, so two more early elections followed.
What do cats do when no one is watching?
The “secret” footage is a global hit.
In Britain this weekend, there were growing concerns about the fate of the 32-year-old Czech woman, after which the London police have been searching for her for a few days.
Petra Srncova was last seen two weeks ago when she went home from work in the south of the British metropolis.
In addition to the police and its previous employer or deputy representatives representing the part of London where she lived, she called the hospital.
“The disappearance of Petra is not at all like her behavior, and we are starting to be very concerned about her,” Lucy O’Connor, of the police department in Lambeth district where Mrnec worked, said in a video on Saturday.
“Her family in the Czech Republic is also very concerned about her and, in short, wants to know where she is,” she continued.
The missing Czech Republic said on Sunday, November 28, at about 7:45 p.m., she left work and headed home to the Camberwell district.
The last time she was seen on the bus was about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported on December 3 by one of her colleagues.
According to the British media, Mrs. was a nurse at the Evelina London Children's Hospital, which is part of the Guy's and St Thomas Hospital Association.
“We are extremely concerned about our dear colleague Petra, who is unaware,” a group of health facilities said on Twitter.
"We would like to encourage anyone who could have any information that could help her find her to contact the police," the statement said.
Zde<0xC5><0x88>ka Dvo<0xC5><0x99>áková Kocourková (as well as the regional pirate council) gave anonymity to the amateur painter Zde<0xC5><0x88>ka Dvo<0xC5><0x99>áková Kocourkova that he violated copyright with his paintings.
However, the court acknowledged that Krte<0xC4><0x8D>ka’s paintings in the Shumper-like attempts do not violate the law.
In <0xC3><0x9A>stí nad Labem there was a hole in the road in the form of a canal without a cover.
It was about life.
The magistrate referred to the complaints to the RSD to which the road belongs, and because it said it did not respond, the hole continued.
Finally, the authorities clarified their responsibilities and ownership and after a month, the SSR began “intensively addressing the situation”.
