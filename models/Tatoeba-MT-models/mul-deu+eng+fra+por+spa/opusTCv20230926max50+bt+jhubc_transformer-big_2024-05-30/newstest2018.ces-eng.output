The Civil Rights Movement has issued a travel warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Preference of Colored People (NAACP) has issued a warning for colored people traveling to Missouri on the basis of state discriminatory principles and racist attacks.
“NAACP’s Travel Recommendation for the State of Missouri, with effect from August 28, 2017, calls on African-American travelers, visitors and residents of Missouri to pay more attention to travel across the state as a result of a series of disputed racially motivated incidents,” he said.
NAACP stated that it has taken this step on the basis of Missouri’s current laws, which make it easier to defend racistly motivated acts in court, as well as due to the actions of criminal prosecution bodies that are disproportionately targeting minorities.
“There are violations of civil rights.
People are stopped by police just because of the color of their skin, they’re attacked or killed,” NAACP president for the Missouri Rod Chapel told Kansas City Star.
“We have the largest number of complaints to date.”
This is the first warning of its kind issued by the organization to the US state.
Among the incidents cited by the organization were racially motivated bullying directed at black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in controversy earlier this year after gasoline was brought to him while travelling across the state and the police detained him without charge of committing a crime.
The travel recommendation also highlights a recent statement by the Missouri state's top U.S. Attorney General stating that black drivers are 75% more likely to be stopped by the police.
“The purpose of the travel recommendation is to warn people and warn their families, friends and colleagues about what could happen in Missouri,” Chapel said.
“People need to be prepared – they should take money with them to pay the bail or warn their relatives that they are about to travel to the state.”
According to the FBI’s current figures, in 2015, there were a hundred cases of hate speech in Missouri, reaching number sixteen among all states.
Travel warning is also a response to the new Missouri law, which makes it easier for companies to file for discrimination in providing accommodation or employment.
The American Union for Civil Liberties (ACLU) has issued travel recommendations for Texas and Arizona after states passed an immigration law that allows state agents to detain people on the basis of a violation of this law, which is intended to improve racial profiling, according to the ACLU.
Travel recommendations are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for foreign countries, but lately lawyer groups have resorted to these measures in response to specific laws and trends within the United States.
The model was killed by a chef.
Her family is not at peace after 12 years.
The murder of Sally Anne Bowman.
A Croydon-born girl was murdered in 2005 by chef Mark Dixi right in the restaurant she worked in, which caused her punctuation.
The victim and the killer were supposed to have sex together and smoke marijuana, then killed her.
The killer then sat in a nearby cafe and watched the careful criminal work of considering the scene of the crime.
Dixie, a former chef, was sentenced in 2008 to 34 years in prison for the murder and rape of Sally.
He only admitted to the juvenile's assault and the lawyer claimed that his client had already found the girl lying dead on the street.
After three years, the police convinced him.
Dixie claimed that Sally and her ex-boyfriend Lewis Sprotson had a fight on fateful nights.
The killer said, "He was really angry and after his attack, the girl started screaming."
"It even attracted the attention of taxi drivers," he lied.
The girl, according to his statement, was supposed to defend herself, she could urinate, but in vain.
Lewis was supposed to hit her on the street.
Dixie's version was proven to be a lie and accused him.
After Dixie confessed, he talked about his appetite and taste for the girl.
When he wore it after sex, he felt comfortable and had to burn marijuana.
Before the incident, Sally was at his ex-girlfriend's, drinking alcohol and taking cocaine, Dexie himself told the police.
He said he felt adrenaline.
Sally started screaming for help, so he attacked her from the back and put his hand over her mouth,” the Mirror Linda added.
And after twelve years, the family is faced with further attacks by vandals destroying her grave.
He has been injured four times in the last six months.
There are so cruel people in freedom who dig these graves.
"So our daughter is no longer there," the Mirror mother of deceased girl Linda told reporters about the disappearance of the urn with ash.
Linda was waiting for the attackers, but they always had to attack when she left the cemetery.
The design vibrators cost tens of thousands.
“They are neither prudent nor conservative,” says Martin Rá<0xC5><0xBE>, who runs the Prague boutique Intimity.
In it you will find design and luxurious erotic accessories.
Including those from Czech designer Anna Mare<0xC5><0xA1>ová.
It started unnoticed, about 12 years ago.
Martin Rá<0xC5><0xBE> and his friends went on a bike ride through Moravia.
One of them brought not only a bike, but also a box full of strangely looking vibrators.
"Various chicks and dolphins and all that was green and yellow and just completely different," she tells me over lunch.
His friend and another partner decided to work with the German designer of Fun Factory erotic accessories, which Martin was interested in, and offered to help with marketing.
When his partner left to be able to devote himself to another profession, he replaced him.
Today, he runs the boutique Intimity in Benedict Street in Prague, where he sells erotic accessories in the way luxury bags or shoes are usually offered.
And why not?
They are also design objects.
Wait, wait, this is what you're talking about at lunch, you think?
But come on, don't be such a puritan!
It was the Berlin store Fun Factory, designed by renowned designer Karim Rashid, that served as an inspiration for the Intimity boutique.
It was opened in 2010 and it was a completely different concept of erotic trade than everyone is used to here.
No covers, all made in a beautiful, decent style, products exhibited rather than in a perfumery.
Martin and his business partner Zdenek <0xC5><0xA0>ebelka began to consider how to understand the Prague trade, where it should be and how it should be named.
The name Intimity was well-liked by both.
“It’s related to intimacy, and it’s, you might say, gentle,” she says.
It followed the purchase of an internet domain and the search for a suitable space, which went in parallel with various interior visualizations.
Eventually, she won the variant, which divided the shop into the garden of delight and the bedroom where the duke's bed was.
It was prepared by Dagmar <0xC5><0xA0>tepán from FormaFatal.
We found space in 2013.
At first we didn’t think it was perfect because it wasn’t on the main street, but thanks to it, he sat down in the name of Intimity.
It's intimate.
It’s in the street next to the main one, so no one’s looking at customers,” says Martin Rá<0xC5><0xBE>.
We wanted to be first.
We wanted to do a business that will be different, with branded nice goods, in an environment where women, who are mostly our customers, feel good.
And not to be ashamed of entering into such a business at all.
When I walked into the Intimity store half an hour ago, the street was empty.
Plus, I didn't even feel like I was going to the erotic aid shop.
Right at the door I was surprised by the clean elegance of the interior, which I know from the boutiques of fashion.
Even if there is only a female servant in the store, that women do not hesitate to ask for help, does not mean that the male leg is not welcome here.
Most of the time, gentlemen come here to buy gifts for their girlfriends.
“Men usually can’t estimate the right size and choose bigger,” Martin smiles over the frequent mistake.
These are the kind of prejudices, the kind of clichés that women need some great help, and that's not true.
So, for example, a man of good faith chooses an unnecessarily large vibrator.
In the same way, men prefer mostly black lingerie, where a woman tends to be more pink.
The absolute bestseller is currently the product perfectly called Satisfyer.
From the expression in my face, it must be clear that I don’t know which one is beating, because Martin immediately explains how it works.
It's such a touchless clitoris stimulator.
In my adolescence, Pere needs to reflect with admiration on the serious tone of the interpretation given to me.
It's like it's not fun.
And it doesn't actually hide.
It is for a good price and has perfect user references.
We didn't think he would be so well received.
This is the latest revolutionary news.
The first revolution was caused by a vibrator in the form of a seahorse.
He made sure that women began to be more interested in the design of such products.
The second one was a We-Vibe couple vibrator.
It completely collapsed the taboo that may persist in some men, and the fact that they see competition in erotic aids.
"There are different variants," he continues.
One-engine, two-engine, remote control.
This is a favorite category.
During a love relationship, a woman can have a controller in her hand and determine the intensity of vibration.
On the contrary, a certain downside is the category of loading vibrators.
Well, at least with us.
Czech women, it seems, prefer multi-purpose accessories and buy classic vibrators, although they may only use it externally.
At the same time, it is very popular in Western Europe, especially with younger customers.
What about men?
It is difficult to say whether a similar concept would work exclusively for men.
I think it should take a little bit differently.
The question is what to offer men,” Martin thinks.
"We also have help for them, but to a limited extent." The most sold is mainly a masturbator, in this case from the manufacturer Tenga.
It does not look like an anatomical imitation of the vagina, but rather "as a shower gel or as an egg or a futuristic object.
It focuses a lot on functionality and on the experiences of use.
In Japan, it is completely different.
It's an astonishment in me.
I thought the Japanese would suffer a lot for erotic aids, I object.
"That's the internet reality," I explained.
The everyday life is completely different.
Here in Europe, erotic aids are rather related to the use of them by women.
In Japan, they are completely normal for men, and vice versa, they are taboos for women." Just for the sake of interest - what the Japanese brand Tenga, which is represented in the Intimity store, sells worldwide, still accounts for about half of what is sold only in Japan.
In Our Waters
The Czechs and the Czechs are not prudent.
On the contrary, we are a very kind nation.
Definitely unlike countries such as Catholic Poland or Italy.
A typical business client is between 35 and 50 years old and "has some experience with sexual life, but with some help.
She will come up for something nicer, better, to complement her partner life, or herself." Martin Rá<0xC5><0xBE> and his business partner Zden<0xC4><0x9B>k <0xC5><0xA0>ebelka are taking care of her to get back to work with each product.
We also don’t want to go into a specialty of bonding and latex, because we don’t have room for it, but it doesn’t fit here.
Such things could reflect the ones we're trying to target.
Which are people who have always had the claws to go to the sex shop because they were afraid that something like that would look at them.
Many of the products displayed on shelves are really lovely.
It is also given by the selection of represented renowned brands.
Some of them even won design awards, including the Red Dot Design Award.
The first ever prized was the mentioned seahorse "and it triggered a change in the entire industry.
It began to abandon cheap materials and, on the contrary, to work with healthier, began to produce other designs, different colors...
It is pleasant that behind the design of some stands the Czech Republic, namely the popular designer Anna Mare<0xC5><0xA1>ová.
I have to say that I was quite surprised how many people buy the Whoop.de.doo design items from Anna Mareshova, even though they are relatively more expensive.
There are customers who go directly for Venus balls from Anna Mare<0xC5><0xA1>ová.
She did a really huge piece of work by presenting in the Czech Republic and abroad exactly what we are trying to present - that erotic aids can be done differently, nicely, with a story.
Ann's story began as a school work.
Now this is a finished product, which is moreover manufactured with us.
I wanted to have the production process under control and also wanted to know what materials and how Whoop.de.doo products are made from.
Because it is not a large product, but a small series, it is certainly more expensive than a large series.
Maybe I'm a little against the current, but I think it's important to keep the development with us in the Czech Republic.
It could calmly happen that in a few years we will no longer be able to produce anything,” explains later Anna, who agrees with Martin that our company is becoming more and more open.
He does not face a negative or negative attitude.
At most, people are dissatisfied.
"But they'll start smiling too." Anna Mare<0xC5><0xA1>ová currently has a vibrator on the menu, for which you can have a personal message, and this year she's also planning her own lubricant gel.
In the next year, vibration eggs and other novelties should be added.
Boundaries of healthy sex
I'm wondering where the limits of what's okay are.
Is there anything Martin Rage wouldn't sell anymore?
It is very difficult to define.
What happens to one person is normal, the other may seem completely abnormal, so we define ourselves as an assortment of brand manufacturers.
None of them will go to some extremes.
Before we say goodbye, I have a last question: What was the most insane demand they received?
Just this week, an e-mail came in, in which a lady asked for masturbation help for her friend with a nature of twenty-eight centimeters.
So we had to write that we unfortunately don't have anything like that.
The question is whether anyone has made a joke about us,” Martin points out with a suspicious look.
And it happens from time to time...
Morning for Karl Gott.
Two cancers of Alzheimer's.
His friend Karel <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>dryy is struggling with a serious illness.
Karl Gott’s best friend struggles with a disease that steals people’s memories.
"Yeah, unfortunately, that's true," the singer himself confirmed with sad news.
I know about my illness and so far I can handle it completely.
"I take medications that have the accompanying phenomena of the disease slow down," he added, adding that he thanked loved ones for their support.
The whole branched family was striving to make life easier for Karl.
Eva's wife tries to be home as much as possible, and the daughter of the first marriage of Zuzan and Theresa goes to her father's house in the White Mountains.
Sz<0xC4><0x9B>dry<0xC5><0x99>í fought cancer twice and passed on his experiences to Slavík to support him in his challenging treatment.
He has 60 chemotherapy sessions.
After them he was able to return to work on a tennis court and on the ski slopes.
"From the astrologer, I have been predicted to be here in the '90s," said Karel Blesku.
He's a warrior.
She still wants to sing.
"I keep repeating the words of the songs so that I don't forget them," Karel admitted.
Actress Kv<0xC4><0x9B>ta Fialová is already struggling with the same disease in the institute.
Do you have an Alzheimer's patient in your family?
Look at how to treat him.
Chile’s parliament has repealed the ban on interruptions, the law will judge the U.S.
In Chile, the absolute prohibition of artificial abortion is still in force, so it must not be carried out for health reasons.
“I am sorry that the legislators have filed a complaint with the Constitutional Court and that now ten people will decide what we have been dealing with in parliament for more than two years,” said Socialist Senator Isabel Allende.
The constitutional court in Chile has ten members and is expected to have a new president by the end of August, which AFP says is close to the opposition.
The law repealing the absolute ban on interruptions, initiated by current President Michelle Bachelet, was approved by the Senate on July 19.
The law opposition then announced that the law would attack the court because it said it violated the right of the unborn child to life.
MEPs postponed the vote on the bill last month until it was analysed by the Joint Parliamentary Committee.
The bill was approved by the Senate on Wednesday, and the Senate did so again.
According to the new legislation, there should be no criminal artificial interruption of pregnancy in three cases: if the life of a woman is at risk, if the fetus does not have hope of survival, or if the pregnancy arose from rape.
Similar exceptions existed in the Spanish newspaper El País in Chile since 1931, even before women were given the right to vote in 1949.
The absolute ban on interruptions in 1989 was introduced by right-wing dictator Augusto Pinochet, just a few months before he left the office of president.
Chile is one of the few countries in the world where there is an absolute ban on interruptions.
Others include Nicaragua, Dominican Republic, Salvador, Haiti, Malta and Honduras.
For example, in El Salvador, there are now about 20 women behind bars who are serving up to 30 years in prison for interrupting pregnancy.
In many cases, the human rights defenders said it was spontaneous abortion, which the court called murder.
Is there anything else sacred?
Trump’s White House is now the Statue of Liberty
An unmistakable sign of regime change is the criticism of statues.
Americans could tell about it as well as everyone else – see the carefully sketched demolition of Saddam Hussein’s statue on Baghdad’s Firdos Square in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key supporters of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he was looking for in a passionate debate with CNN reporter Jim Acosta on the president’s proposals to drastically restrict legal immigrants.
It should be added that Miller did not attack the statue as such.
For this, it would be merged by a multitude of boat owners and imitators of the Statue of Liberty.
However, he attacked its significance, specifically the fact that in 1903 a poster with the famous poem Emmy Lazarus was placed on the base, only 17 years after the monument was completed.
Acosta was quoted as saying, “I don’t want to go into history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that sheds light on the whole world.
The poem that has been placed on the base in addition, and to which you refer, is not part of it."
Miller's actually right, but as he said, it's not about history.
These are above all the striking words of Emma Lazarus, who resonate today - they call not only the immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "Let me see who falls, who is poor, who can barely breathe, who is poor in the midst of the people."
And it is in modern times that we can better than ever watch these “offering worms” on our screens.
Miller did not try to criticize poetry – he wanted to clarify that these people are not welcome in the United States.
This conflict on the significance of the statue is part of an extensive political and cultural war: it is essentially a conflict on the importance of America.
Emma Lazarus, as well as her friends, who after her death attempted to put a poster with a poem at the base of the statue, knew quite well that she was going to a high political game.
The sculpture was to express the union of the French and American Republican governments by representing the classic theme, that is, the female embodiment of freedom.
Emma Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem, the female character is not abstract, but has her own voice.
It also has a very different name: The Mother of the Emigrants.
Combining the poem with the representation of a woman is a brilliant feminist tendency and a devastating attack on American natism.
And in the same way that Emma Lazarus changed the meaning of the sculpture, the right-wing advocates have long tried to reverse this meaning.
Famous commentator Rush Limbaugh - John the Baptist in the case of Trump's coming to power - argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty in fact does not invite anyone to the country, but represents early neo-constructivism, bringing the American flame to the backward world: "The Statue of Liberty".
It carries the heritage of freedom from the United States and offers it to the rest of the world.
The trail should not illuminate the road to the United States.”
The Limbaugh strangely encounters an important thing.
The significance of the sculpture depends on the point of view.
Emma Lazarus describes the sculpture from the standpoint of a exhausted and damned passenger who, after a long and frightening cruise across the ocean, often arrives with hope in the heart of a new country.
It is literally a sight of the world in the eyes of people looking for refuge and a chance to live a better life.
From this point of view, the statue expresses hope and listens to their needs.
And that’s a perspective, of course, that Miller and Trump definitely don’t recognize.
Their conduct is not to illuminate the way, but to extinguish the hatred, which is their only source of power.
World Athletics Championship 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish team members
Eilidh Doyle recalls a time when the British team had only two Scottish members
UK Athletic Federation Director Neil Black said the strong squad of 16 Scots in the World Cup would be "a huge benefit to the team."
A record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for the 2017 World Championships in London, which starts on Friday.
Black believes that “something special is happening” in Scotland, and British athletics could learn from the Scots.
“We’re trying to understand and adapt – we’re going to work on it,” Black said.
“I talked to people at the Scottish Sports Institute and they think it has something to do with what they did.
Scottish athletics think it has something to do with what they did.
British athletics: It has something to do with what they did.
People on the streets think so too.
Whatever it is, it’s absolutely amazing.”
Several Scottish athletes will seek medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who will compete with Sir Mo Farah in the 5,000m race, while Eilidh Doyle was selected as the team captain.
“It will be modest.
Her introductory speech was amazing,” Black said.
“A few athletes, whether Scottish or other national athletes, came out of the room with a sense of pride and motivation.
The passion and unconcealed feelings with which Eilidh spoke were unrepeatable."
The Commonwealth silver medalist, who will race across the obstacles in the 400m at her fifth World Championships, said it was “incredible” that there were 16 Scottish athletes in the British team.
The previous record from 1983 and 2015 is seven.
The midfielder Muir has set only five British and two European records in the last year.
The MS will participate in the 1500m and 5000m races.
Another of the great Scots is Chris O'Hare, who will run the track for 1500 m. This season he won the British Team Race and the Annual Games.
Doyle recalls her first championship, in which she was the only other Scottish member of the Lee McConnell team.
The captain of the team said she was "very proud" that not only a large number of her colleagues had entered the team, but in many cases they would also be attacking the finals and medals.
“It’s unusual for me to be the captain of the team to be elected by the other team members. It was a great honor for me, but knowing that I was elected by the team is a pleasure,” she added.
“Obviously I’m very proud of all the Scots who have joined the team.
It proves where I moved.
These are the athletes who will think of the front seats on the stage.
What about my introductory speech?
Yeah, I think she got married.
I just pointed out the fact that we can be proud at this year’s championship because it is taking place on the home ground.
It’s important to take advantage of the support of home fans and to enjoy the fact that we’re back at the Olympic Stadium.
I got a second chance to race and I will enjoy the incredible atmosphere."
Blocking Critics on Facebook: Don’t Call for a Public Service Unless You Take Voter Criticism
The father of our country knew about his criticism.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it wasn’t long before the newspapers began to criticize him for anything, starting with domestic politics and ending with his political views.
Yes, this criticism did not leave her cold.
But he did not try to silence the critics.
Because in 1783 Washington said, “Freedom of speech can be taken away from us – and fools, and they will lead us like sheep to be defeated.”
That brings me to Maryland is Governor Larry Hogan, who needs to work to start acting like Washington.
Hogan’s employees blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people who freely expressed their views on his official Facebook page.
This week, she was sued by the American Union for Civil Liberties.
Employees of the governor rejected the lawsuit as unfounded, and many “who cares” opinions appeared in the comments on the internet.
“It’s just Facebook,” many users said.
Still, it matters.
Especially when it comes to people like Hogan.
In an absolutely democratic state, he is an extremely popular Republican governor.
It is the second-highest favorite of all 50 governors.
Hogan's not disgusting.
As can be seen, the state governs its own with certainty and strictly adheres to the principles.
It also turned out to be versatile in using Facebook as a major means of connecting with its voters - the exception is not even the publication of the first naked-headed photo after graduating from chemotherapy.
Blocking people who visit the governor's website - which is a public forum, labeled as official and managed by his employees paid out of taxpayers' money - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with the Washington Post, Hogan’s spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the governor by blocking comments from a position of moderation of posts.
However, using the image of internet trolls, spammers, or scattered people is too easy.
The Washington Post told a number of real people who were deleted posts.
And that's exactly what they are - real people who speak to their chosen leaders; a teacher, a businessman and a pastor, no trolls.
As everyone said, their comments were polite and considerate, not rude.
In his commentary, the pastor quoted the Bible, appealing to Hogan’s Catholic faith.
Lawyer Bowie Lakshmi Sarma Ramani, Md., asked about hate crimes, but her comment was not hateful.
“I was politely aware that I was disappointed by his insufficient response to hate crimes and other current reports,” she wrote in a comment section of the Washington Post.
“I don’t like the idea that once a certain number of people comment on the same topic, some people are labeled as promoting the so-called collective effort, rather than being recognized as a larger group of interested citizens.”
What the governor’s employees called a “focused spam interest” would likely be called a “defender.”
The modern Facebook era allows us to easily manage posts by blocking criticism or deleting negative comments.
It is much more convenient than in the past, when the same procedure would require sending workers to the streets, where they would collect and burn all prints with criticism, or arrest or silence the Protestants.
And that's exactly what's happening, just in digital form.
Hogan is not the last public agent to be criticized for harassing Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is facing a lawsuit on the part of Twitter users who have been denied access to his account.
One of the first important regulations was born last week in Virginia.
The chairman of the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors violated the first amendment in Alexandria, according to District Judge James C. Cacheris, where she blocked the access of one of the voters to her Facebook page.
Governor Matt Bevin (R) from Kentucky also expected a visit from the ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be that difficult.
In the days of Washington, the low cost of mail had practically the same impact as the internet.
Between 1776 and 1800, the number of daily newspapers quadrupled, and his leadership was questioned by many anonymous writers.
And even in those times Washington had to deal with anonymous trolls.
People who wrote under pseudonyms like “Juricola”, “Valerius”, “Belisarius” and “Portius” wrote letters to the newspaper and questioned Washington’s decision.
According to historical documents collected by people as part of the online Papers of George Washington Project, petitions gathered in his office criticizing his position on the Treaty of Amity, Commerce, and Navigation agreement with Britain.
But he did not silence them.
Freedom of expression, disagreement and intimidation lie in the very foundations of our nation.
And the real leader must accept it.
The Czechs quickly took advantage of free roaming, they consume more data abroad than at home.
Overseas, the Czechs consume more of their tariffs than at home.
Most often they move in Austria, but data consumption during the summer season is ruled by Croatia.
For the holidays, however, they have more time to browse the web, in addition, they usually do not have the ability to connect to Wi-Fi under the sunscreen.
Beach, bathing and smartphone in your hand.
This is what a typical Czech holiday in Croatia looks like after customers can take advantage of the services of the local operators at domestic prices.
This is based on the latest O2 statistics.
Thanks to the new roaming rules, most Czech travelers abroad have more data available within the pause than at home.
It is therefore no wonder that in Croatia, where the minimum number of visitors travels through the winter, data consumption has increased by even fifty-fold during this summer season.
In the second place in the ranks of the data consumed, Italy was then placed.
The Czechs spend the most minutes in Germany, where many of them are exported at work and during the summer.
According to the data of the Association of Czech travel agencies, Croatia visits 800,000 Czechs annually, making it our most popular holiday destination.
However, people here exchanged a book for sharing experiences using a mobile phone.
The record was July 7th this year.
"Thousands of millions of photos would have been transferred into the data," said Silvia Cieslar, O2 Mobile Segment Director.
Although Croatia is leading in data volume, the highest number of Czech users is moving in neighboring countries.
The first place is Austria, followed by Germany and Slovakia.
Croatia is fourth and Italy is sixth.
We go to Austria for hiking and active holidays, for which we do not have much time to browse the Internet.
“At the same time, the Czech Republic is heading for the Adriatic,” Cieslar explained.
While the data operator recorded high interannual growth after the release of roaming fees, the growth is much lower for phone calls.
The number of minutes spent in roaming has doubled compared to last year.
With a huge leap ahead of other countries, Germany dominates here.
“Roaming roaming is more used by corporate customers on business trips,” Cieslar added.
Ronan Rafferty hopes at home at the Renaissance Club
Former golfer Ronan Rafferty will hope for the next three days in a peaceful atmosphere at the Renaissance Club in East Lothian, Scotland, which hosts the 25th Scottish Senior Open.
Ronan Rafferty, who comes from Northern Ireland, last year on the nearby Archerfield Links golf course on his way to the finals, succumbed to Paul Eales. This year he will be the ambassador of the tournament in the presence of the club's founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
“I watched Renaissance Club slowly grow up in front of my eyes and this year’s tournament will show the world its beauty,” Rafferty said.
“The players will be able to love the first-class quality of the playground.
Jerry did a great job.
He is an ardent advocate of this game and is proud of his achievements.
This year’s tournament is in the right hands.”
Englishman Eales will defend the championship for the first time, despite winning the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour during his 32-year career.
"I feel good about it," said the Southport golfer.
“I didn’t have the opportunity to defend my victory at the Extremadura Open because a year after my victory the tournament was cancelled.
Returning to this part of the country is magical.
It's a lovely place for golf.
“I remember last year when winning for me and my wife Sharon really meant a lot.
It’s been a wonderful time I won’t forget.”
Gary Orr, who joined the European Senior Tour after celebrating 50 years from the region this year, returns home.
This event will be his first participation in the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
“I always like to play on my home soil,” Orr said of Helensburg.
“You want it to work and you feel a lot of pressure.
I really enjoyed playing again and I think I'm doing well.
I’m happy with the result so far.”
The three players will also join former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and senior tournament winners Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among six Scottish players on the pitch; the others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Admission to the tournament is free. Parking is <0xC2><0xA3>5 per car with one passenger and <0xC2><0xA3>10 per car with two or more passengers.
All profits will be allocated to Prostate Cancer UK.
Poverty and Death in Indonesian Gold Country
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she doesn't use ovens.
In fact, he rarely uses pancakes.
In her wooden cottage, located in the capital city of Paniai Enarotali in the Indonesian province of Papua, a woman usually simply throws sweet potatoes - in the language of local "notes" - directly into the fire.
After half an hour, remove the potatoes and taste them with unwashed hands.
Bardina sits on dirty ground - the house is not equipped with furniture - where at the same time he performs his daily tasks, such as washing laundry in dilapidated water from a nearby urethra.
A cupboard in a room without a roof provides a toilet.
As the youngest of her husband’s four wives, she was not assigned any field to cultivate.
Polygamy is common here.
Working late at night is a danger: most of the men in the village are unemployed and often drink alcohol. In addition, soldiers live in the village.
“At five o’clock in the afternoon, no one will be allowed to dive around the village,” Bardina says.
It is a rare look into everyday life on the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was declared part of Indonesia in 1969 after a controversial referendum, when only 1,026 elders were forced to vote in the form of a late public eyewitness.
The current movement protesting against the Dutch rules quickly turned its anger against the Jakarta government, which controlled the entire region with the exception of foreign journalists or civil rights supervisors.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua - independent Papua New Guinea occupied the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is such a remote and devastated city, where you can get after a 90-minute flight from the capital of the province of Jayapura to Nabira, and then a five-hour turmoil by car.
The public transport at this place is not working.
The city of 19,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences, roofs of woolen sheets in shades of gray and cut color.
Very few Indonesians, on the other hand, journalists, and virtually no foreigners were looking at this place.
Before the arrival of the Christians, the locals worshipped a god named Uga Tamee.
And that's not all.
“We weren’t used to wearing these dresses,” says Bardina, pointing to his colorful, hand-knit turban, dark shirt and glossy skirt.
“We used to only wear leaves.”
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia – 28% of the population lives below the poverty line, and the country’s child mortality and literacy is one of the worst in Asia.
At the same time, it is the Indonesian gold country.
The largest and most profitable gold mine in the world Grasberg, which owns Freeport McMoran from the American Phoenix, is located just 60 miles from Paniai - a rocky province about the size of New Jersey, which is home to about 153,000 inhabitants.
In 2015, Freeport mined <0x24>3.1 billion worth of gold and copper.
In addition, Papua supports <0x24>78 billion worth of timber mining.
These wealth, however, are for the Papuans a source of suffering and a guarantee of oppression by a powerful Indonesian army.
An investigation by the New York Times in 2005 found that Freeport paid local military agents and units about <0x24>20 million between 1998 and 2004, including <0x24>150,000 for one officer.
Papuans calling for self-government threaten this golden huss and are therefore severely suppressed.
According to human rights activists, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed since 1969 and thousands more have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian army.
The mass murders in the Papua tribal area during the 1970s were equivalent to genocide, according to the Asian Commission on Human Rights.
Last year alone, Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters in the region.
We Will Lose Everything, a 2016 report by the Archdiocese of Brisbane, describes the atrocities that occurred last year, such as extrajudicial executions, torture — according to another report — particularly popular rape and execution by electric current — and the brutal suppression of peaceful protesters.
“It is difficult to calculate the number of casualties because incidents occur every week,” said Andreas Harsono, an Indonesian researcher at Human Rights Watch.
The whole situation was hampered by the fact that Papuan resources attracted colonists to Indonesia.
Of the province’s 3.5 million inhabitants, 83% report Christianity, but the demographics are changing with the influx of Muslim immigrants from the Indonesian islands – Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javan canteens sell roasted chicken and gado-gado or a mixture of vegetables with peanut sauce.
The locals are fighting for survival.
“Immigrants started selling chickens and vegetables in traditional markets at lower prices than local Papuans,” explains Abeth You, twenty-four years old, who was born in Paniai and moved to work in the capital of the province of Jayapura.
“The original populace of Papua – mama-mama (women) – lost their jobs.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, who is nicknamed Jokovi, has pledged in his 2014 presidential campaign to address inequality and rights violations.
The former carpenter secured his way to the presidential palace in Jakarta, 27 of the 29 districts of Papua, including Pania.
But very little has changed in Papua and the locals feel betrayed.
“Our hearts were broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokpwi in the hope that he would hear our call for justice,” You said.
The fact is that just two months after the inauguration of Jakowi in October, Paniai experienced a major shock.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children sang a Christmas song at a camp fire in Enarotali, when two Indonesian soldiers came out of the gray night on motorcycles.
Two of the surprised children told them to turn on the lights.
One of the soldiers touched the tone and tone that was pronounced and later returned with four other soldiers, local priest Yavedt Tebai said.
Two of the soldiers in a drunken state pursued a group of children and beat them with their arms, reported casualties and witness events.
One of the soldiers then fired at a group of children.
One of the children, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was hit so hard that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, someone set fire to a nearby election commission building and the next day things were getting worse.
Approximately 1,000 young Papuan men and women gathered on a football pitch in front of the local police station and the military command and demanded justice.
They came with ceremonial hunting holes and performed a dance of waita - in which they run in a circle and imitate the singing of birds - of the Papuan tribe Mee Pago.
Several Protestants began to throw stones at buildings.
With rising tensions, soldiers were given a radio order: “If the crowd attempts at least three times for resistance, you are allowed to shoot,” according to TIME’s weekly document, the content of which was never published in public spaces.
Jeremiah Kayame, 56, the head of Enarotali Kego Koto, recognized the threat and urged residents to break into their homes.
But no one had ignored his words.
“When I turned around, someone shot me in the left wrist,” he told TIME on the porch of his painted wooden house.
Kayame does not yet know who the shooter was, but according to him, the bullet belonged to one of the soldiers present.
“There were a lot of people around and a lot of people were shooting,” he added.
One of the locals, Alfius Youw, said his cousin, who witnessed the shooting, was shot three times.
“I ran to the body to make sure it was really him,” she told TIME Weekly with a smiling voice that, like many Indonesians, uses only one name.
“I saw him dead...I kissed him.”
The Papuan police inspector, General Yotje Mende, told reporters that his officers only “secured” the station that was under attack.
“We have to defend ourselves when people threaten us with death,” said Pudjo Sulistiyo, a Papuan police spokesman in 2015.
“It’s a matter of life and death.”
According to Human Rights Watch, five protesters were killed and many were wounded.
The report of the murders spread to the Jakarta media the next day.
Three weeks later, he delivered a passionate speech to Joko in Jayapur and expressed his understanding for the families of the victims and promised to deal with the violence in Papua.
“I demand an immediate solution to this problem so that it can never happen again,” he said.
In October 2016, National Security Minister Wiranto announced that it would introduce an extrajudicial mechanism to resolve violent acts that have occurred in the past.
Almost immediately, however, apologies began to be made.
“Most of the violent acts have taken place a long time ago.
Some of them took place in the 90s of the last century and some at the beginning of the 21st century.
“I mean, we are determined to punish these violent acts, but it will not be an easy task,” he said.
However, in a June 5 interview with TIME weekly in Jakarta, Wiranto claimed that he did not intend to implement any measures in Papua.
Instead, he said that “all cases will be brought before the court.”
Wiranto, accused by the UN of "crimes against humanity" based on more than one thousand deaths during the 1999 independent elections in East Timor, said 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua, including an incident in Pania, have been settled so far.
The families of the victims of the shooting in Paniai welcomed his claims with distrust.
“I’ve been questioned a total of four times in the last three years, but so far I haven’t expected anything,” John said.
“I’m tired.”
As they say, a few years later, she still lives in fear.
“I’m scared,” he says.
"I'm afraid the army will arrest me or someone will shoot me."
His brother Yacobus confirmed the sight of many Paniai residents who are afraid to speak about the incident.
According to him, he was killed by members of the army after helping to bury four of the victims.
“After the corpse was buried, the army started looking for me,” he said.
And the shooting still doesn't stop.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot at villagers in neighboring Deiyai.
A riot, in which one person died and another 17 were injured, took place between a villager and a construction company manager who refused to provide assistance in transporting a man unconsciously to the hospital.
Ravianus Douw, 24, who drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died on his way to the hospital.
Infuriated villagers protested in front of the company’s building.
According to the police, the villagers threw stones at the people and the response was a warning shot.
Local residents, however, claim that the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) started shooting at the crowd and killed one person.
"There was panic, we were afraid of retaliation," Dominggu Badii, 29, who lives near the hospital and witnessed the arrival of the injured, told TIME.
“I haven’t left the house for two days.”
The Deiyai parliament called for the punishment of the policemen involved and the removal of the mobile brigade from the area.
The ladies have always been in the eye of the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development only deepens the separation of indigenous peoples from the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal tribes, who live in central highlands.
Many of them joined the Papuan Liberation Movement (OPM), an army of insurgents that protects the rights of Papuans by attacking and kidnapping Indonesian policemen.
Some of the leaders of the OPM are from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Judas Kogoya.
As a result of the attacks in recent years, the army has arrested and arbitrarily detained thousands of residents of Paniai, all under the pretext of " securing national sovereignty".
Some of them will never fall asleep again.
Paniai is known among the people of Papua as a "tragic and forgotten place".
Poverty is fueled by oil into fire.
The little rice that is sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.
Bread is equally inaccessible.
The locals grow their food: mainly sweet potatoes, fruits and leafy vegetables.
Women work in the fields; each of them cultivates four or five fields with sweet potatoes.
Most of the harvest is intended for the needs of the family, the rest are sold in the local market.
Ten pieces of sweet potatoes cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Since Nabire Airport opened more air routes and new immigrants began to flow into the country, economic inequalities between Papuans and immigrants have increased.
Already so few jobs are usually occupied by more educated and wealthier immigrants.
Papuans rarely have the necessary capital and education to get into business.
“Young people are moving out of villages due to lack of jobs and money,” said John Gobai, chairman of the Paniai Tribal Council.
Thanks to isolation, the province of Papua is hidden from the world.
There are also strict rules for foreign journalists to do so.
Earlier this year, two French journalists – Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp – were expelled from the papyrus due to “lack of cooperation with the authorities,” despite the fact that they were given so rare permission to film.
Phelim Kine, the deputy director of the Asian branch of Human Rights Watch, promised Jokowi in his campaign to abolish strict rules for journalists and achieve transparency and development, but that never happened.
"Foreign journalists working in the rebellious easternmost areas of Papua and West Papua are at great risk: visa non-recognition and blacklisting," the statement said.
The lack of reports from per foreign journalists means that international pressure on Indonesians in the Papua case is significantly limited.
In March, six Pacific nations - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands - urged the UN Human Rights Council to investigate "different and widespread acts of violence" in Papua, including shootings in Papua.
These countries have also supported OPM in the past.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arrmanath Nasir dismissed the charges when he told reporters in Jakarta that “the democratic system still exists in Indonesia and the media is free, so it is difficult to hide evidence of human rights violations.”
Locals are calling for the participation of foreign governments.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, headed by human rights envoy Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on May 4, the locals marched according to a source who also attended the meeting but wanted to remain anonymous, the password “we want our own”.
There are other elections scheduled for 2019 in Indonesia, but the Papuans say they will not vote for Jokowi.
"Jokowi is a man who has good intentions but is surrounded by people associated with the shooting in Pania," said Gobau, chairman of the Tribal Council.
He wants Jokowi to know that the inhabitants of Paniai - in addition to living in constant fear of a stealing army - are fighting in poverty, poor education and the health system.
Gobai claims that the inhabitants of Paniai, like the rest of the Papuans, consider their vote to be a “debt” that they must pay Joko.
“They don’t want money, they demand justice,” he added.
Despite the threats and intimidation of the family of the victims, the Panai shooting continues in the last symbolic act of resistance: they bury the bodies of the victims on the grounds opposite the police and military stations.
Knowing that justice will never be done enough, at least it will not let the responsible people forget their crimes.
“A member of our family was killed,” Yacobus said, with his head folded.
“What can we do?”
The French Navy has captured a huge supply of cocaine to Australia.
The French Navy has detained a Pacific yacht bounding 1.46 tons of cocaine worth about <0x24>256 million.
The shipment was headed to Australia.
A four-member crew of a ship, apparently made up of people from Lithuania and Latvia, was arrested during the attack.
The yacht, named Afalina, sailed from South America and after being detained, the police took it to a port in the city of Nouméa, the metropolis of French overseas territory of New Caledonia in the Pacific.
The Australian intelligence service said it would work with its international partners to determine exactly where and where the drugs were headed, and to uncover the "Lithuanian syndicate."
"We are grateful to the French authorities for the measures they have taken to stop large amounts of drugs heading to Australia," said Col Blanch, its executive director.
The drugs were destroyed in Nouméa this week.
Australia is an attractive target for its smugglers because of its high street drug prices.
The country is also facing the problem of an increasing number of people suffering from drug addiction.
The current situation is not the first in recent times.
Last month, three men were charged with transporting large amounts of drugs from the United States to Australia, who tried to crash across the Pacific in a small plane.
The elderly do not feel thirsty, drinking is necessary to remind them.
The problem could be in homes for seniors, the solution according to a doctor from the Geriatric Clinic General Faculty Hospital in Prague Pavly Mádlová could be infusions of a physiological solution that are pierced with a thin needle under the skin.
So far, they are only used in medical facilities.
The older a person is, the more the amount of water in his body decreases.
"And in addition, it loses thirst, so the elderly generally take less fluid and dehydrate very quickly," Mádlová said.
Two liters should definitely drink.
"But getting so much fluid into an old man is a big problem," she added.
In the elderly, she says, there is often no doctor.
In hospitals, dehydration is usually treated by infusion.
"I think it should be introduced there, too, gradually, so that they can get subcutaneous infusions," she said.
According to her, up to two half-liter bottles of physiological solution can be delivered to elderly people in a day.
A lack of fluids can cause nausea, headache and decreased performance.
Dehydration is a complete loss of self-esteem.
"One day the old man will say he can't get out of bed, he's talking confused," she added.
In case of neglect, it can lead to a stroke.
The blood thinners and clogs a vessel in the brain, and there is a risk of kidney failure.
Lie patients should not be covered with a feather, maximum cotton linen.
The problem can also be disposable pellets.
“It’s more nursingly demanding, but it would be ideal to occasionally expose the patient and let the skin clear,” the doctor said.
The Torch has set fire to its second skyscraper in Dubai.
In Dubai, one of the world’s largest residential cloud traps was found in flames on Friday, with firefighters evacuating all the 337-metre-high and 79-story buildings.
In the last two years, this is the second fire in this high-rise building, which bears the appropriate name The Torch.
All the inhabitants of the building were evacuated and there were no injuries. The cause of the fire is unknown.
“We slept and the alarm woke us. We heard the scream.
It took us ten minutes to run down from the 50th floor," one of the inhabitants of the dungeon told Reuters.
Dubai Civil Defence said the firefighters managed to get the fire under control around 4 a.m. (00:00 GMT) and continued to cool the building.
Government officials added that they are providing replacement accommodation for the affected populations.
The incident could once again spark discussions about the safety of materials used to coat high-rise buildings around the world.
The results of the investigation initiated by the management of the Torch cloud dwarf after the fire in 2015 revealed that the most damage was caused by the coating and the external panels used for decoration or insulation.
British police said the insulation and coating system of London’s Grenfell Tower could have contributed to the rapid spread of fire in the June fire that killed nearly 80 people.
The survey found that more than one in five passengers travel to the U.S. renting prohibited items on board a plane.
A survey of passengers showed that more than twenty percent of them consciously or unconsciously passed prohibited items through the inspection post of the U.S. government Transportation Security Administration on board the aircraft. At least six percent of passengers boarded the plane with a knife or a knife.
Less than one percent of passengers claim to have discovered late that they were travelling with firearms, ammunition or explosives.
The results of a survey conducted by Stratos Jet Charters Inc. - which was answered by more than 1,000 respondents - showed that younger passengers are more likely to violate the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted to consciously attempting to travel with an object prohibited by the TSA, 19.7 percent of passengers with several thousand hours of flying were compared to less than 15 percent of Generation X members.
Among the most common items that have escaped the attention of TSA are food and alcohol.
More than three percent of the respondents consciously passed a sharp subject through caution, while 2.2 percent of the women surveyed and 3.7 percent of the men surveyed also admitted to deliberately taking drugs on board the plane.
The company said it was conducting research among passengers around the world to find out how many of them accidentally passed unauthorized items through airport checks and how much they did so voluntarily.
It is no surprise that most people who have carried unauthorized items - whether consciously or unconsciously - travel by airplane very often.
As the company stressed, the TSA directives are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People often don’t know what fluids and how much they can transport to the plane.
It is therefore not surprising that the TSA has absorbed the largest amount of the currently prohibited liquid.
For a time, people thought that the TSA would deal with books in the same way as with smuggled goods.
Transfers of liquids are permitted on domestic flights, not international flights.
EPA chief Scott Pruitt on the postponement of planned emission reduction directives Obama administration
After the Environmental Protection Agency was sued by fifteen states, its head, Scott Pruitt, revoked its earlier decision to postpone the implementation of the former Obama administration’s plan to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
Pruitt has introduced changes within his plan, responding more closely than previous governments to the needs of state environmental regulators.
However, he did not mention the legal appeal against his previous position at the Federal Court of Appeal.
This concerns the last deadline set for 1 October, when states should begin to implement the 2015 Regulation on the reduction of ground-based ozone.
Pruitt announced in June that he would postpone the agreement by one year and order a more detailed study of the plan to avoid “interferences with local decisions or threatening economic growth.”
Pruitt, who held the position of Oklahoma State Attorney General before becoming President Donald Trump, has long served as a reliable opponent of stricter environmental regulations.
Since he settled in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly shifted or removed the regulations proposed by the chemical and fossil industries.
The sudden Wednesday turnover is the biggest legal failure for Pruitt’s regulatory agenda.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled that an EPA executive exceeded his authority in an effort to delay the Obama administration’s integration of a plan that required oil and gas companies to reduce methane leaks.
In a statement issued Wednesday evening, Pruitt proposed its version of ozone standards and reinforced EPA’s commitment to cooperate with states through complex processes and the implementation of new standards within the given timeframe.
“For the government, the previous EPA administration often failed to meet deadlines and waited for it to be sued by activist groups and others, agreeing to align and further set plans,” said Pruitt, who in his previous position filed more than a dozen complaints to the EPA.
“We don’t believe in regulation by means of a court dispute and we take the deadline seriously.
We never envy our status and the authority that comes from it.”
However, the EPA’s statement states that Pruitt may, at some point, use “the possibility of delay and all other legally available authorities” to ensure that regulation “will be based on sound policies and the most accessible information”.
Republicans in Congress are pushing for a broader transcript of the ozone rules.
The White House budget approved last month aims to postpone the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The measure has not yet passed the Senate.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who was head of the coalition of states that sued EPA this week, said the group did not intend to allow legal pressure.
“In the opinion of the EPA – following our judicial review – it is an important victory for the health and safety of the 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by air pollution,” Schneiderman added.
New York joined California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and Washington, D.C.
Earthly ozone occurs when conventional harmful substances emitted by cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources react in the atmosphere with solar radiation.
The resulting smog can cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive people and thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health advocates and environmentalists welcome Pruitt’s sudden change.
“It’s worrying how much pressure we need to develop to change the mindset of those responsible and protect the air we breathe,” said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.
“We must continue to struggle with the ideological pull of the Trump administration, which is trying to help polluters and special interests.”
The man's acid polish, however, is not dangerous according to the court.
You never know what might happen to you.
In one moment you are at home with your family and you laugh, in the other, your whole life will suddenly change from scratch.
And the worst thing is that you can't do anything about it at all.
A similar fate encountered Andreas Christopheros of the United Kingdom, whose face was pounded with acid by an unknown attacker, who was eventually released.
The information was introduced by Reuters.
In December 2014, someone knocked on the door at Christopheros's.
Andreas said he was going to open up.
He thought there was probably a courier behind the door who was supposed to deliver Christmas presents for his family that day.
Instead, a cruel surprise awaited him.
The man he had never seen in his life, immediately after opening without warning, poured it with acid, saying, "This is for you, my friend."
The pain was indescribable.
Clothes broke down on me like nothing and I felt just an incredible pain on the skin,” Andreas said.
His family quickly took him to the hospital, but his relatives heard a terrible news - according to doctors, he had no chance of survival.
A few weeks after the incident, doctors were constantly afraid that their patient would be exposed to an infection that threatened to penetrate his wounds.
His injury was very serious.
Ninety percent were affected by the face, which doctors tried to put together using skin from other parts of the patient’s body.
A major complication for Christopherosis was the loss of eyelids.
It's probably the most painful thing I've ever experienced.
"You can't hide from the unexpected light, you can't close your eyes," he said.
Today, Christopheros undergoes twelve surgeries that are far from the last.
Injuries suffered by victims of acid attacks may, according to plastic surgeons, require hundreds of surgical procedures and years of treatment.
Even after difficult and long-term treatment, victims have the tissues healed for the rest of their lives.
“Sometimes people don’t recover and fight for life against deformation and deformation,” said Professor Peter Dziewulski, a spokesman for the British Association of Plastic and Aesthetic Surgeons.
The attacker was wrong.
As far as the attack is concerned, Christopheros is sure that a stranger had to meet him with someone.
In fact, the perpetrator believed that he was avenged by a man who sexually abused his loved one.
The police investigated the whole case and the assailant was subsequently searched.
The man was initially sentenced to at least eight years in prison.
However, later on, the verdict to the amazement of Christopher’s family fundamentally changed.
“Three judges eventually came to the conclusion that the sentence should be lifted because the man is not considered a threat to the public,” Christopheros said.
In recent years, the number of yeast attacks has increased considerably.
The local Ministry of the Interior expressed its concern by planning to provide new guidelines to state representatives on the classification of fertilizers.
They should be classified as a dangerous weapon.
Victims of such attacks do not give up.
They demand that the UK government impose more stringent and longer sentences of imprisonment for people who attack their surroundings with acid or other pesticides.
They also require stricter controls on the sale of hazardous substances, which are often commonly available in different stores, as these are different detergents.
In Dubai, the largest city of the United Arab Emirates, the famous skyscraper The Torch, which is one of the largest residential buildings in the world, burned at night.
According to Dubai Civil Defense, residents of the 80-story building managed to evacuate in time and no one was injured.
According to a Dubai police spokesman, a fire broke out on the ninth floor and spread upwards.
However, according to some residents of the house, it was the opposite.
"It started on the 67th floor, that's how they told us," said one of the tenants.
According to another tenant, quoted by Reuters, the fire erupted in the highest floors and spread downwards with declining hotspots.
We slept.
We were alarmed, people were screaming.
"We were running down the stairs, it took us about ten minutes from the 50th floor," said the tenant George.
Another witness for CNN estimated that the fires had engulfed about 40 apartments.
On the ground, the fire destroyed at least two cars when burning parts of the building hit them.
About two hours later, according to the Civil Defense Department, the fire managed to get under control.
The cause of its origin is not yet known.
According to witnesses, there was a downpour in the surrounding buildings.
A massive fire also damaged the Dubai skyscraper The Torch in February 2015, destroying over a hundred apartments.
There are about 680 apartments in the entire building.
At that time, nothing happened to anyone, as the residents managed to evacuate in time.
Built in 2011, The Torch became the world’s tallest residential building with 352 meters.
The record was prepared by another Dubai skyscraper the following year.
The bodybuilder had incredible 14 doping substances in his body.
He didn't win anyway.
According to Corriere della Serra, in a sample of twenty-three-year-old Ippolita, there was a wide range of illicit drugs - from steroids to diuretics to medications for Parkinson's disease or anorexia.
Paradoxically, even this wild mix did not help him to the title, finishing fourth.
Now the bodybuilder is threatened by four years of distance and criminal prosecution.
The record was 11.
Last year, Italian ragist Davide Vasta was tested positive for 11 doping substances, which was a record amount in athletes caught up at the time.
A three-legged player said he started taking steroids a year before he collapsed in bodybuilding.
Lucka Vondra<0xC4><0x8D>ková in Czech Republic.
She hugged her ex-lover passionately!
Sotva Lucka Vondra<0xC4><0x8D>ková entered the territory of the Czech Republic, is in one wheel.
It also pays attention wherever it comes.
The last time she fell into the arms of her former lover Michal Dlouh<0xC3><0xBD>, with whom she lived for three years.
The actor was 12 years older at the time and already wanted a family.
Lucia was only 19 years old at the time and she definitely didn’t want to hang her career on the nail.
So they went away from each other, but their friends remained to this day.
They were also able to do so at the TV Prima press conference, where they met for a long time.
At the same time, the two matched in blue.
At first they didn't notice each other, but then they got closer and Lucie laughed at Michal's jokes when she fell behind her belly.
Then they hugged and photographers were willing to post.
However, their meeting was not a coincidence, as they play together a love couple in the new Prime Captain Exner series.
Islamists in the United Kingdom have been given life in preparation for an assassination.
A British court on Thursday sent four members of an Islamist cell called Three Musketeers to prison for life, and the prosecution said it was planning a terrorist attack against the police and the army.
Four men, two of whom attended a training camp in Pakistan and had previously been convicted of similar acts, were arrested in August last year.
At the time, the authorities thought they were going to attack immediately.
In the car of one of the men, security agents found a partially ready-made pipe bomb, knives with inscriptions that in Arabic mean "unbelievers" and a gun makeup.
This happened when a MI5 intelligence agent was in the car with a hearing aid.
"Recent assassinations have shown the horror that the accused could have caused if they were not stopped," said Sue Hemming, a prosecutor's office spokeswoman.
Three sentences aged 28, 25 and 33 may apply for release after 20 years.
The fourth convict, who is 38 years old, can do so after 15 years behind bars.
During the trial in London, men said they were innocent and that the weapons found in the car were placed there by MI5 agent.
The court also heard her, but then rejected the allegations of the defendants.
Thursday was the warmest day of the year.
Hodoninska was measured at 38.3 <0xC2><0xB0>C.
Tuesday's temperature record of 37.3 degrees Celsius was only two days.
With 38.3 degrees Celsius recorded in the Watchtower in Hodoninsk, it was surpassed Thursday, which became the warmest day so far this year.
This was confirmed by the staff of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
On Thursday, however, there were not many temperature records.
On Tuesday, 35 of the 145 meteorological stations measuring more than 30 years were exceeded or leveled.
On Thursday, only nine long-term measuring stations recorded record temperatures.
For example, the temperature on Thursday was the same as the previous record in 2013.
In Lednica in B<0xC5><0x99>eclavsk on Thursdays 37.4 degrees exceeded the original maximum by four decade degrees and in Pohorelice in Brno the current 37.1 degrees exceeded the record by three decades.
Both records, as with the Watchtower, came from 2013.
There were 10 degrees less in the west.
High temperatures occurred on Thursday mainly in the south and east of Moravia.
After the Guard, the biggest heat was in Dyjakovic in Znojemsk and Brod nad Dyjá in B<0xC5><0x99>eclavsk, where mercury rose to 37.8 degrees, but it did not exceed the record.
In contrast, for example, in western and northwestern Czechoslovakia, according to the website <0xC4><0x8C>HMU, the quarterly highest temperature was only about 22 degrees Celsius.
"The temperatures started to rise there until now later in the afternoon," the meteorologists said.
According to <0xC4><0x8C>HMU, the current rainfall in the Czech Republic will gradually deteriorate and more heavy rains could come on Sunday.
In most parts of Moravia, however, high temperatures will remain on Friday and in the southeast of Moravia on Saturday.

China has been trying to exercise its influence for decades without the use of force.
He spends <0x24>10 billion a year to support language schools and the construction of universities abroad, pushes his entertainment industry into foreign markets and tries to attract Western tourists.
This is not happening in Beijing.
The state media is talking about a plan to make tourism a driving force for economic transformation and modernization.
However, the number of arrivals last year grew by only 3.8 percent, and about 80 percent of tourists to China came from Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan.
This is due, among other things, to the fact that, despite all its global aspirations, China does not welcome foreigners with open arms, assesses the situation in the world’s most populous country by economics professor Christopher Balding of Beijing University in an article for Bloomberg.
An example that speaks for everything is the Chinese visa policy.
Only 13 countries have visa-free contact with China, and citizens of other countries have to issue a visa in advance.
Chinese authorities in the U.S. therefore compare the crowds to Chinese New Year celebrations.
The visa costs <0x24>140, but if you don’t want to wait long hours on the front, you have to pay <0x24>100 or more for additional services.
Such constraints create significant economic barriers.
The Journal of Economics and Finance study found that the need for visas reduces the country’s number of visitors by 70 percent.
In 2015, only two million Americans visited mainland China, while Hong Kong, which shares less than three percent of China’s gross domestic product and lives there less than one percent of all Americans, visited 1.8 million.
China often aggravates this problem itself when tourism is used to achieve its political goals, for example in disputes with Taiwan and South Korea.
When China restricted transport to South Korea in the spring as part of a crackdown around South Korea’s missile system, the South Koreans paid it off and avoided China.
In May, the number of visits declined by 42 percent annually, while Japan recorded an increase of 85 percent.
All of this affects macroeconomic stability.
According to a recently published report by the U.S. central bank, the Fed could leave China as much as <0x24>190 billion due to Chinese travel abroad, while China would receive about <0x24>35 billion annually as part of its currency sales to incoming tourists.
According to official figures on the development of the balance of payments, last year China had a tourism deficit of <0x24>217 billion, equivalent to 44 percent of China’s total surplus in goods trade.
Thus, a small number of tourists in the country, which anxiously prevents the flow of capital, inflicts a very painful wound.
However, the above-mentioned factors are only one manifestation of more general restraint towards foreigners.
In many places in China, virtually no one has heard of immigrants.
In 2013, there were less than a million foreigners living in China.
There are several cities in the United States as well.
Even Japan, which is not exactly the crossroads of immigration, has doubled.
A number of scientific papers show that immigrants usually revive economic growth, entrepreneurship and innovation.
You can hardly find them in China.
Solving these problems will be politically challenging, but the step offered is to simplify the visa apparatus.
Other Asian countries, in particular India and Vietnam, have recently developed a great deal of effort to simplify and reduce visa issuance procedures.
If China wants more foreign tourists and their hard currencies, it should be easier for them to get there.
In the zoo of Plze<0xC5><0x88>, deadly toxic beaches were propagated.
The Kingdom of Pilsen poison can enjoy the young at once three rare, deadly poisonous Plasmas.
In the exhibition, visitors will only see all nine newly born turkish snakes.
This species lives in northern Anatolia, even at an altitude of 2,000 meters.
"It grows in length and meters," said zoo spokesman Martin Vobruba.
The young of the other two species, the mortals and the red skulls, will so far gain strength in the garden's breeding grounds.
We can't say when people will see them.
"We wouldn't like to lose them," said nurse Miroslav Dohnal, saying it could take a year or two.
Australian deadly snakes came into the world eight, they are the offspring of a breeding pair originating in a population around Sydney.
"The person that visitors can see in the exhibition belongs to the mortals around Perth," Vobruba said, with the need for a lethal wintering of 6-8 weeks at a temperature of 13 degrees Celsius in human care.
The 100 percent success was accompanied by the dream of the African Swimming Cube of Red.
A couple in the Plze<0xC5><0x88> zoo lay four eggs in total.
“The incubation lasted 65 days,” Vobruba added.
This species in nature sprays poison on its victim, at a distance of up to four meters.
It's on the eye, it can cause permanent blindness.
The young of all three species live in the zoo with rats.
Within 40 days in the garden, the puppies of the black mammoth are still expected to be laid, the eggs are stored in the incubator.
According to unchecked overwriting of telephone conversation, Trump creates pressure on Mexico for paying for the border wall
The Washington Post published a transcript of President Trump’s phone calls with the leaders of Mexico and Australia.
In a telephone interview on January 27 with Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto, Trump urged her to stop publicly announcing that she would not pay for the construction of the proposed wall.
The President of the United States told him that he was publicly condemning the construction of the wall, allegedly saying, “You can’t talk like that in the press.”
Trump has pledged to build a wall along the southern borders and has announced that Mexico will pay for it.
He also evaded the transcript of his first conversation with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, revealing a tense exchange of views.
President Trump told Turnbull that the U.S. oversight agreement on refugees heading to Australia is “ ridiculous” and “stupid” and insisted that if he agreed to such an agreement – which took place under President Obama’s administration – it would look like the U.S. was “druged upside down” after the U.S. collapse.
Trump ended the call after explaining to Turnbull that “this is my most unpleasant call of the day.”
Tusk re-appointed the prosecutor for Smolensk.
"There is nothing to be afraid of," Tusk's brother, PiS Law and Justice President Jaroslaw Kaczy<0xC5><0x84>ski, said on his address.
"I have nothing to fear, Kaczy<0xC5><0x84>ski will not intimidate me," Tusk said, reckoning to the current leadership that he is trying to abuse justice against political opponents.
On leaving the prosecutor's office, a crowd was waiting for Tuska, according to TVN 24, who scandalized Donald Tusk! and wished a politician 100 years!.
Tusk thanked him for his support and assured him that he had a clear conscience: “I have nothing to fear and Kaczy<0xC5><0x84>ski will not intimidate me.”
The prosecutors say nothing, but he does not doubt that justice should serve the current Polish rulers as a tool against opponents, opposition or people who do not like it, and I fear that I belong to this group.
He was interviewed for the second time.
The prime minister was interviewed at the prosecutor’s office for the second time, this time he was supposed to be hearing about errors in drinking of the victims of the smolene disaster.
In addition, there was a change of bodies in the boxes.
Families were forbidden to open the boxes, and there must have been some reason to do so.
And the reason was that they were afraid of the scandal because it would burden Polish-Russian relations.
"Keeping good relations at all costs, despite such terrible events, should serve to make Donald Tusk a very important person in the EU," Kaczy<0xC5><0x84>ski said in a statement on Trwam.
He added that a possible conflict with Russia would hamper Tusk’s chances of gaining the most important chair in the Union, from which Poland has absolutely nothing.
Kaczy<0xC5><0x84>ski also said he had warned German Chancellor Angela Merkel that it could happen differently with Donald Tusk, but she did not take it into account.
Tusk underwent an eight-hour interrogation at the prosecutor’s office on April 19.
He didn't even speak as a suspect, just as a witness.
However, many of his calls for interrogation were seen as part of the obvious efforts of the Polish government and the head of PiS Kaczy<0xC5><0x84>ski to discredit Tusk as a political rival by linking him to various scandals.
In Poland, the Prosecutor’s Office is subordinated to the Minister of Justice, who serves as the Attorney General.
The call for a hearing came in the wake of Tusk’s election as head of the European Council, which Kaczy<0xC5><0x84>ski has tried hard but in vain to prevent, including during Merkel’s visit to Warsaw.
At the EU summit, only Polish Prime Minister Beata Szydlová protested in solitary confinement against the extension of Tusk’s mandate.
In this case, the Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán left Warsaw on his hair.
Burma in Senegal.
Where can the Czechs vote?
In the autumn parliamentary elections, registered voters will be able to re-vote the composition of the parliament from Burma, Senegal or Luxembourg.
In these and several other countries, the Czech Republic has opened its representative offices since the last parliamentary elections held in 2013.
This comes from a statement that regulates the delivery of voting tickets to a foreign country.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has prepared its update, which is currently under review.
Four years ago, 10,000 Czech citizens voted abroad.
"Since the last update of the declaration in 2013, there have been some changes that need to be taken into account in these lists," the ministry warns.
"In some countries, new offices have been created, some offices have been closed, or there has been a change in the level of representation," the report said.
The declaration shall contain two annexes, the first of which shall include the representative offices to which the paper ballots are delivered.
This group of authorities includes the Czech Republic’s representation in neighbouring countries, i.e. Germany, Poland, Austria and Slovakia.
More than a hundred Czech authorities will receive a ballot in the press release.
It's their list that's changing.
Four years ago, the Czechs could vote at the Czech Embassy in Libya or in Zimbabwe, for example.
Both embassies are closed today.
The Czech Republic has also cancelled its representation in Bamaku, Malaysia, and Kyoto, Japan.
There will be no elections at the Consulate General in Donetsk.
The Czech Republic closed in 2014 because of the war in eastern Ukraine.
They are now on the list of embassies in Kenya’s Nairobi, Senegal’s capital Dakar and Zambia’s Lusace.
In Asia, since the last parliamentary elections, the Czech Republic has expanded its representation as a general consulate in Iraq's Irbil and Cheng-tu, the capital of China's S'Chuan province.
Voting tickets will also be available to registered voters at the Czech Embassies in Burma and Cambodia.
Czechs abroad have had the opportunity to choose MPs in polling stations in representative offices or consulates four times so far.
Before each election, the state electoral commission shall determine by fate the country for which the candidates are voted abroad.
For the first time, it was in 2002, when a decision was made between South Moravian candidates.
In the next two elections, the Czechs voted abroad among South-Czech candidates.
In 2013, as well as this year, the Central Region was selected.
The number of Czechs voting abroad is steadily increasing.
At the premiere 15 years ago, about 3,800 people came to vote, in 2006 there were about 6,700, four years later 8222.
In the early parliamentary elections four years ago, 10,571 voters came to the embassies.
Moore's Ford Bridge Massacre: Activists Remember Racist Lynch
The 1948 Ford Mercury passed around observing residents of Monroe, Georgia, and climbed towards the Moore's Ford Bridge.
But before the car with four black passengers and a white driver was enough to reach the bridge, a group of whites with guns replaced him on the road.
The leader of the group – a middle-aged man in a striped outfit – pulled out of a cigarette for a long time and looked at the windshield of the car.
Inside, the passengers trembled with fear.
"We want that--and Roger!" shouted the man.
“Bring him to me!”
Silence breaks the ribs of a young black man, who is pulled out of the passenger’s seat.
Fortunately, this scene is only a reconstruction of the events that took place on July 22.
But when one of the men passes through the neck of "Roger's" rope, the audience breathes with excitement.
Since 2005, a group of activists regularly return to Moore's Ford Bridge to rebuild that fateful night in 1946, when two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murra Dorsey - killed members of the Kukluxklan.
No one has been convicted of murder yet.
“It’s surprising that not one person has been arrested in all those years – despite the fact that we still see them in our community; even though we know their identity,” said Tyrone Brooks, who helps to organize the event’s reconstruction.
“It’s a stain on our history and a burden on our souls.”
Brooks is a 71-year-old former Congressman of Georgia and a lifelong civil rights fighter.
In his eyes, the reconstruction of the event presents a dramatic call to action. Every year, the Monroe community reminds that justice has not been done enough.
“We demand prosecution and the closure of the case, we want peace of mind and reconciliation, but justice above all,” Brooks said.
“Until that time, the process of healing and reconciliation cannot be started.”
On July 27, 1946, a forensic doctor covers one of the bodies of the victims of lynching at Moore's Ford.
According to FBI records received by NBC News, up to 50 men from Monroe and surrounding districts were expected to participate in the lynching.
No one has yet been prosecuted.
Despite the fact that the suspects have remained free for decades, civil rights proponents claim that both reasons for lynching - politics and sex - were known to all residents of the city.
In April 1946, on the basis of a decision of the Supreme Court of the state of Georgia, black people were given the right to participate for the first time in elections scheduled for the summer.
And just during the summer election, according to the FBI, black-skinned farmer Roger Malcom had to punch Barnett Hester's white-skinned landowner during the fight - allegedly because of his wife.
According to Brooks, it was customary in the city that Hester had intercourse with Malcom's wife Dorothy and brought her into a different state.
According to a statement by the FBI, on July 25, 1946, the then important white-skin landowner Loy Harrison filed a <0x24>600 Malcom bail.
He was accompanied by Dorothy and his cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
Upon their return from prison, just before entering the Moore's Ford Bridge, a group of suspects took their way.
“As it turned out, Harrison planned and organized the murders,” the FBI said.
“It is also obvious that there has been a secret agreement between state and local lawmakers who not only participated in the lynching, but also got rid of the evidence and concealed the identity of the witnesses.”
Brooks made the whole point more concise.
“It was a massacre because of the right to vote,” he said.
“They always had a clear subtext for all the local black people: ‘This is how you will get here if you register and go to vote.’”
The annual reconstruction of the event at the Moore’s Ford Bridge is organized by Cassandra Greene for nearly a decade.
Her performance is picturesque, captivating and exhilarating, showing a deep-rooted racism that many would like to see extinct in modern America.
Watching this reconstruction isn't easy and even harder to turn off the vision, but Greene says it makes sense.
“No one wants to talk about lynching, because we have to face the unpleasant feelings that are hiding in each of us,” Greene said.
“But there can be no relationship between us unless you listen to what I had to go through.”
This year’s main tests of reconstruction began in June, and on the first day about 30 actors – a dozen whites, the rest of blacks – were included in the room where Greene introduced them to a very carefully planned performance.
Wade Marbaugh is an assistant director.
For many years he played the leader of the Kukluxklan, but according to him, the role is exhausting.
“I have a bad feeling about it because it contradicts who I am,” Marbaugh said.
“I think it’s very important to remember this part of history regularly because we never want to go back to such a time.”
Actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play the role of Roger Malcom, starring Barnett Hester, are practicing their roles.
The show begins with a fight - Malcom agrees with Hester and blames him for having sex with his wife.
“Get out of my land n--e!”
Rascona can't.
There's a fight.
At that moment, everyone (at least every black-skinned actor) will explode in laughter.
Greene laughed the most.
"What happened?" asked Rascona.
He's confused.
Was I too rude?
“No,” Greene replied cheerfully.
“I just don’t think the whites used to say ‘n-r’ in that tone.”
"Exactly," one of the actors whispered in black.
"You have to put more emphasis on R."
The energy in the room is suddenly better; hostility replaces the feeling of closeness.
Everyone wants the show to be authentic, just to make it enough for the four victims of the massacre.
The actors repeat the scene.
This time, Rascona emphasizes the correct pronunciation of the word N.
No one's laughing now.
The show ends violently and quickly.
Shots, shots... and silence.
A woman dressed in black stands above the actor's bodies and sings Billie Holiday's sad song "Strange Fruit".
With every word, there is sadness in the room.
In the background of all this, about a dozen viewers sweat and tears from their eyes.
There are virtually the same number of blacks and whites in the public.
One couple arrived from New York's Ithaca, many viewers from nearby areas.
Each of them tolerates a local wet climate for almost eight hours, and Brooks is in the crowd leading to the tombs of Malcolm and Dorsey.
Up until this point, the murders could have been viewed with a distance, but now, standing in the same place where the lynching took place, the atmosphere is frightening.
With the last words of the song, Greene's crowd is calling for body inspection.
Kids crawl to the victims’ heads, watch fake blood and immovable bodies, and whisper something into their ears.
"They're not dead," the little boy shuddered.
It's going to take a few minutes, and Greene's thanking the audience.
The actors clean the rope and wipe their tears.
Bradshaw embraces Marbaug, a man in a suit that played the leader of the Kukluxklan.
Nick Rascona embraces his two fellow actors and cries in their arms; finally, emotions come down on him.
“It’s okay,” whispered one of the women.
“We know that the role will come to you.
But you had a reason for that.”
Later that day, the audience sat down with the actors for dinner.
At one table, a young white couple talks about a performance with a black couple they have met today.
Denise Duplinski barely found words to express her feelings from today’s performance.
"It's hard to listen to those ugly words and look at the disgusting deeds... that people who look like you do because they look like you," she said.
“It makes me realize that lynching is still a topical topic,” she added, “it’s just called police strikes.”
On the other side of the room, Tyrone Brooks sits in the courtroom, enjoys dinner and talks about civil rights.
In his own words, he has already started planning for the show for the next year.
"The reconstruction of these events is inspiring because it describes the fear we had to experience - but it is also a moment to think about," he said.
“If we don’t learn from it, who knows... it could happen again.
People who do not know or study the history of their country are condemned to repeat it.”
I love the instructions for use.
One of my friends says that the instructions for use read only scabs.
I disagree, on the contrary.
It is one of the modern forms of art, often pure surrealism.
With nostalgia, I remember a long time ago when the instructions for using anything were rather a rare indication.
So, for example, my first gramophone contained only one paper, on which hieroglyphs depicting the involvement of some components, all of them had some secret marks.
When something went wrong inside me for years, I offered that leaf to the shaman who was not afraid to screw off the back panel.
He advised me with a clutch, what that labyrinth of charm paper is suitable for.
Yes, it was a common aid for chronic depletion of toilet paper.
Playfully found a disconnected wire and allowed me to listen to expensive vinyl plates again.
The new era brought new directions.
Even a relatively simple fruit juicer, where the overgrown grip was simply held, required about ten pictures.
Particularly mentioned was a drawing with a description of how to move one piece into another.
The setup was two-part and a different procedure was simply not possible.
To give it, on the contrary, required considerable effort with the need to break down certain plastic components.
My disdain for the instructions ended with my self-moving of the Seat Leon brand.
The year of manufacture 2003 still had such a manual with instructions for minor repairs, which included, among other things, the replacement of a blinker lamp.
It was easy.
A total of three steps and the work was to be done.
Unfortunately, the author of the instruction neglected to state that while the lamp to the right was really going to be replaced in just three steps.
1. remove the cover.
2. Screw the cracked bulb and screw the new one.
3. push the cover.
The lamp on the left had a problem in the form of the placement of the battery cover.
At first I thought that I would move the right upper extremities to the edges of the car with some spring, a screwdriver, with which the cover is easily discarded, and then I will already manage points 1-3 of the savings author of the service book.
I think it's a lavender.
The cover had no place, no room, not even for the slender hand of Cinderella, but the obese Slezon.
I've lost half an hour of my life, completely without any success.
The condition was further reinforced by my wife’s entry into the garage, which was called by the strike and the words that I heard from my mouth quite exceptionally.
"What are you doing here?" she asked in a whisper.
My answer lasted about 90 seconds, however, if I omit vulgar terms, there are only two publishable words left.
I'm changing the bulb.
"And why do you take so long?" she risked the phrase, which may be her last in the long-lasting volume.
I explained the problem to her slowly, and I put the main emphasis on the author's torture process of the instruction, where the blessing of the incinerated iron on the hand that wrote the instruction, after its inkling, so that he could never write anything again, was just an introduction to the story of the comic book in a wide range of instructions.
"How about dismantling the box?" said the woman, dismantling the battery.
In clear despair, this happened and then step 1-3 was as easy and fast as the right side.
I didn't think anything could surprise me.
And that's until the day a colleague called me, who was just talking about the collapse after checking out two officials of the State Drug Control Service.
I know her as a colleague of balance, who has experienced the possible and the impossible in the field and who can interpret even wild stories with an unmistakable voice.
"Imagine that I got a fine for not having a handwashing instruction," he told me in a weak voice.
Gradually, I got rid of the whole problem, which was that over the washbasin in the patient's toilet there was no picture instruction on how to wash your hands.
His argument by the commissioner that adults usually know how to wash their hands and that there is no need for pictograms to cope with the usual activity of decent people did not have a curative effect and cost her little money.
"It's not just that," she told him.
He understood that the simple rinsing of rinsed hands with running water is a primitive act on the level of chromanium that modern man, Homo sapiens sapiens, performs this ritual in ten steps.
Then it is necessary to inform that it is necessary to release water from the hose.
The whole process has a total of eleven points, but in the end it is a joysome discovery that a person has washed his hands exactly the way the HOSUDAR from S<0xC3><0x9A>KL commands it.
Finally, I must point out that I was inspired and I am preparing a detailed plan for the toilet activity.
In the matter of defecation, the procedure is uniform, there will not be a problem, in urination, due to certain differences between the sexes, it will be necessary to hang the instructions of two.
The problem remain those pictograms, because creating the perfect procedure also means a precise drawing of all the anatomical details, which could trigger a certain upheaval in a ruddy toilet visitor, despite the fact that he can finally learn that he has taken the course of his entire life.
Pearson Releases Another 3,000 Employees and Reduces Dividends in Efforts to Renew Business
British education group Pearson said on Friday it would release another 3,000 employees and cut the temporary dividend by 72 percent in response to another restructuring program to change the business model.
Another wave of dismissal, which CEO John Fallon said will take place at the end of 2018 and beginning of 2019, follows the company’s previous decision to release 4,000 employees as part of the previous restructuring.
Pearson announced an additional <0xC2><0xA3>300 million (<0x24>394 million) cost reduction plan in May under its third cost reduction programme in an effort to re-establish declining trade as a result of the rapid development of digital education.
The company, which agreed last month to sell its share in Penguin Random House to Bertelsmann, said the outlook for this year remained unchanged after announcing a one-percent increase in core sales in the first half of the year to <0xC2><0xA3>2.05 billion.
Convoy Attack in Kabul: NATO Soldiers Killed in Suicide Explosion
A suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital Kabul, killing one NATO soldier and injuring several others, officials said.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were injured, according to a statement by NATO.
According to informal reports, three civilians were killed in the attack in the Qarabagh district.
This month, Afghanistan was hit by a bomb attack - more than 30 people were killed in an explosion in a mosque in Heraklion on Tuesday.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
NATO said in a statement that Tuesday's blast occurred after the patrol, along with members of the Afghan army, was attacked by "a local person with a submachine-manufactured explosive device".
The statement also said that all the wounded soldiers are out of life-threatening condition and are in the U.S. military hospital at Baghram Air Base.
According to reporters, the growing power of the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State (IS) in the Qarabagh region is a major source of concern by NATO allied forces in nearby Bagram.
According to the UN, at least 1,662 civilians died in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, of which 20% died in the capital.
At the end of July, a car bomb killed at least 30 people in the Shia district of Kabul.
The Taliban joined the attack.
On May 31, a major blast killed more than 150 people in the city center, the country's deadliest militant attack since U.S. troops overthrow the Taliban government in 2001.
Violence is already undermining the dubious situation in Afghanistan, and US President Donald Trump is considering increasing the number of U.S. troops that should help military and police forces in the country.
According to reporters, the suicide attacks, which he has instilled in the public confidence in the government, its regulations, and especially in the reputation of President Ashraf Ghanin, have shocked him in recent weeks.
In response to the lawsuit, the EPA re-evaluated its decision to defer smoking rules
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency revoked its decision to postpone the Obama Administration Act, which ordered states to reduce emissions just a day after the agency was sued by 15 states.
On Wednesday night, the EPA announced its decision to transfer the Ozone Standards 2015, saying it is submitting the Agency’s commitment to cooperate with States.
“We believe in dialogue with our state partners and we will hear their opinions,” EPA Director Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
Pruitt announced in June an effort by the EPA to defer ozone standards – which measure actual air pollution in specific areas of the country and, based on measurements, set limits to be met by October 2018.
A group of 15 most democratic states, along with Washington, D.C., filed a lawsuit on Tuesday on the grounds that the EPA’s actions are illegal.
President Donald Trump’s administration is trying to avoid many of the environmental regulations proposed by former President Barack Obama, according to Trump’s statements in an effort to boost economic growth.
However, the new government’s effort has launched countermeasures by Democrats and conservative groups who are concerned about the impact of emissions on public health.
The EPA on its website states that breathing air with ozone content “may reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms”, such as asthma.
Singer Ladislav Bubnár got a wound and shed blood!
This, with us a relatively new singer, you may have already registered in June of this year, when this almost unknown singer with us organized on Czech terms a monstrous event, hosted by other leading figures such as Master Karel Gott, Nemo<0xC4><0x8D>e, Nemo<0xC4><0x8D> Krainda<0xC4><0x8D> and Simon Nikci<0xC4><0x87>.
The purpose was simple, showing up to the public and presenting their music video to the song Sara, whose name was baptized by the newly named characters.
But few know that the filming of the video, which took place in Russia, did not happen without problems and the singer Ladislav Bubnár himself had to be treated.
It was his first big shot with the stars of the Russian national ballet and it didn't happen without a proper slap.
Sara’s song is very emotional and is based on the unhappy love of two lovers.
For the drama of the scene, the singer's juice in the video should indicate a hit facky.
At one point, however, he hit him so hard and straight into his nose that the young singer had to be treated by doctors.
"It was a wound, I didn't expect it, my nose was bleeding immediately," Ladislav commented on the situation.
Colleagues and producers said that it was an unfortunate accident and Ladislav could not react in time.
Fortunately, the injury was not so severe that the continuation of the shooting was affected.
The above-mentioned video of the young artist now brings you, you can also record the scene with the hit.
The non-blooded version, however, was not preferred to be used.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Loma<0xC4><0x8D>enko talk at a meeting about the possibilities of a mutual duel
Vasyl Loma<0xC4><0x8D>enko and Mikey Garcia, two boxers who could stage the most exciting lightweight boxing match, met for the first time at a meeting on Tuesday.
Each of them was in a separate room at ESPN’s offices in Los Angeles, until Garcia, an undefeated World Boxing Council lightweight champion, came down to the hall to welcome Loma<0xC4><0x8D>enko, the world boxing champion in the penguin weight of the World Organization.
After Garcia's victory against former four-time World Champion Adrien Broner in Saturday's Showtime, both boxers were placed on the list of the top five lightweight boxers.
Garcia pulled his right hand and said, “How’s it going, champion?
Good luck."
Loma<0xC4><0x8D>enko defends her title against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday at 19:00 at ESPN.
Boxers pose for photographers and manager Loma<0xC4><0x8D>enka Egis Klimas adds that the potential fight of boxers would be “a perfect test”.
“I’m a former champion in pear weight,” Garcia adds.
“Because of a match with the Broner (67 kg) I had to pick up, but I’m not that big.
I'm small on my 63 kg.
I would like to go back to the lightweight category.
He's got to pick up the bat again to get a light weight... then we can fight.
Fans want it.
Why not fulfill it to them?"
Loma<0xC4><0x8D>enko agrees.
“Box would have helped this game.”
Climate has raised a demand to pay for viewing - which is part of his strategy. Loma<0xC4><0x8D>enko should make her debut in a lightweight at the end of this year and next year to compete with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts. who has also expressed an interest in <0xD0><0xB7><0xD0><0xB0><0xD1><0x80><0xD0><0xB5><0xD1><0x80><0xD0><0xB5><0xD1><0x81><0xD1><0x82><0xD0><0xBE><0xD0><0xBD><0xD1><0x82><0xD0><0xB0>. <0xD0><0xBB><0xD1><0x81><0xD1><0x81><0xD1><0x81><0xD1><0x82><0xD0><0xBC><0xD0><0xBC><0xD0><0xBC><0xD0><0xB5> 23. in Lik<0xD0><0xBB><0xD0><0xB5><0xD1><0x82><0xD1><0x82><0xD0><0xBB><0xD0><0xBB><0xD1><0x82>, in Lik<0xD1><0x82><0xD1><0x82><0xD1><0x81><0xD1><0x82><0xD1><0x82><0xD1><0x81><0xD1><0x82><0xD1><0x82><0xD1><0x82><0xD1><0x82><0xD1><0x82>, and also expressed interest in the camp in the <0xD0><0xBF><0xD1><0x82><0xD1><0x82><0xD1><0x82><0xD1><0x82><0xD1><0x82><0xD1><0x82><0xD1><0x82><0xD1><0x82><0xD1><0x82><0xD1><0x82><0xD1><0x82><0xD1><0x82><0xD1><0x82><0xD1><0x82><0xD1><0x82><0xD1><0x82><0xD1><0x82><0xD1><0x82><0xD1><0x82><0xD1><0x82><0xD1><0x82><0xD1><0x82><0xD1><0x82><0xD1><0x82><0xD1><0x82><0xD1><0x82><0xD1><0x82>.
“The game should be in a pay-for-view style, this is what fans demand,” Garcia, who later stated that it is open to the possibility of broadcasting the game through a TV station that will come with the best offer.
“We are the main attraction.
No one else will draw such attention to themselves.
We will wait for the right opportunity...”
Garcia said he recognizes Loma<0xC4><0x8D>enko as a "horrible boxer" and could participate in his Saturday match.
But Loma<0xC4><0x8D>enko did not hesitate to praise Garcia when he said the Riverside three-division champion looks "very slow... sorry Mike, but you're talking about knockout."
Garcia said his goal was to show strength and only then the box.
The two boxers said they felt the rising tension in front of each other’s duel.
“You won’t forget this game.
No other match will pay so much attention to itself.
And I'll comfortably attach it to the fire," Garcia said.
Loma<0xC4><0x8D>enko said, “I’ve been waiting for the best boxers and this is Mikey.”
It will be a great match.”
The young couple disappeared 12 years ago without a trace.
They found their car at the bottom of the Volga.
Two young Russians, Ilya <0xC5><0xBD>irnov and Kira Cherkasov, have been missing since December 2005.
There was an extensive search for them, but without success.
And the police finally closed the investigation for lack of evidence.
The families of the lost couple lived in uncertainty that they would not know what happened to the couple.
After 12 years, the whole story came to an end.
Their car was found by a laity diver at the bottom of the Volhy River in the town of Cheboksary in Chuva<0xC5><0xA1>sk.
Only because of the documents that remained in the car, the police managed to identify the couple.
The documents survived a decade underwater, without them, the police would have taken much longer to find out the identity of those found.
The couple were last seen when <0xC5><0xBD>irnov borrowed a car from his father so he could pick up his girlfriend from work.
The diver who discovered the car remains anonymous for the time being.
His findings were reported to the Czech police, who pulled the car to the beach the next day.
Investigators believe the death of a young couple was an accident caused by a frozen road leading around the river.
However, the investigation continues, and further details will be disclosed after its completion.
Latest test results to determine the age limit of asylum applications in Sweden
The most recent results of asylum-seekers in Sweden who were subjected to a new age-assessment method show that over 80 percent of people were questioned as 18 years of age, but not everyone believes in their accuracy.
The Swedish Forensic Medical Agency (R<0xC3><0x83><0xC2><0xA4>ttsmedicinalverket) began conducting new tests earlier this year.
The aim of the method is to assess applicants more accurately in the evaluation of asylum applications. The measure was adopted after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticized for failing to determine the correct age of some refugees who lied about their age.
To date, the Swedish Migration Agency has submitted 6,880 cases and the Forensic Medical Agency has now published a total of 2,481 tests, conducted from mid-March to 31 July 2017.
80 percent (2002) were judged to be over the age of 18, while in another 25 cases the Forensic Medical Agency ruled that the respondent was "possibly over the age of 18".
In another 423 cases, it was decided that the respondent was "possibly under the age of 18".
Tests shall be accessed only if the age of the respondent is disputed.
According to Johan G<0xC3><0x83><0xC2><0xB6>ransson of the Forensic Medical Agency, the results correspond to the previous month.
“Compared to last month, the statistics are on track and the numbers are very similar,” he told The Local.
The higher number of applicants whose age has been estimated to be over 18 doesn’t necessarily mean that asylum seekers lie about their age.
In May, the agency published the results of 581 tests, stating that in 442 cases it was found that “the person in question is 18 years of age or older.”
Svenska Dagbladet investigated 581 published cases and found that in 243 cases, the respondent said he would be 18 this year.
Critics also came with a medical method for determining age, which includes wisdom tooth X-rays and MRI scans of the knee joints, which are subsequently assessed by dentists and x-rays.
One of the skeptics is Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, who is involved, among other things, in assessing the biological maturity of people to determine the age at which he passed puberty.
“I had reason to think about this issue and I don’t think these types of measurements are right for age assessment.
Assessment of biological age is, in a sense, very uncertain.
If we can’t accurately determine the age, we shouldn’t pretend the opposite,” he told Metro.
Forensic Medical Agency's G<0xC3><0x83><0xC2><0xB6>ransson defended the decision: "In general, the risk of misjudging a child as an adult is small.
The highest risk is the fact that the respondent is just below the 18-year-old limit, which in this case corresponds to 10 percent of all respondents.
Trump threatened the president of Mexico on the phone.
U.S. President Donald Trump in a January phone call to Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto has threatened not to meet him if he publicly says his country will not pay for the construction of the US-Mexico wall.
Trump said in an interview that funding would somehow be arranged, although he admitted that it would have to be secured from other sources.
Trump also spoke openly to Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.
This comes from the transcripts of interviews published on Thursday by the American newspaper The Washington Post.
Trump has made the construction of a wall on the southern border for Mexican money one of the main promises in his last election campaign.
In his first interview with the Mexican president shortly after Trump’s inauguration, Nietzsche was undiplomatically charged with criticizing his plan to build the wall.
The South's neighbor has been identified as a growing political problem and has pressured the Mexican president not to publicly say that his government will never pay for the wall.
"You can't say this to the press," Trump said repeatedly in a January 27 interview, threatening to interrupt contacts with the Mexican president if he continues to make contradictory statements.
Financing is supposed to be invented, and in the end it will work out well.
“But if you say that Mexico won’t pay for the wall, then I don’t want to deal with you guys anymore because that’s unacceptable to me,” Trump said.
At the same time, the wall has labeled the least important thing we are talking about, but it is perhaps the most important politically.
Trump issued an executive order to build the wall shortly after taking power.
Mexico has rejected the construction and financing of the 3,200-kilometre-long wall, which has also threatened relations between the two countries.
At the end of March, Trump said the project would still be paid by the United States.
Trump finally met his Mexican counterpart for the first time at the G20 summit in Hamburg in July.
The Washington Post also reported on Trump’s telephone conversation with Australian Prime Minister Turnbull on January 28.
The White House spokesman said the conversation was ridiculous.
To this conclusion, he was led by an exchange of views on the agreement that Australia would provide asylum to Central American refugees in exchange for the United States accepting persons from internal facilities in the Pacific island states.
Trump initially thought the deal was stupid, but later agreed to it.
“You can certainly say that this is not the deal you made, but you will have to stick with it,” Turnbull told Trump.
In some passages, the phone conversation with Turnbull was almost juicy, for example, when Trump praised the Australian refusal to accept refugees embarking on boats as a good idea.
“You’re worse than me,” Trump jokes.
All of a sudden, the tone of the conversation got louder.
"I hate receiving these people," Trump said.
I assure you, they're bad.
That's why they're in jail right now.
“They’re not going to be great people who are going to work for local dairy farmers,” he said.
In an interview, he also said that the refugee could become a Boston assassin in five years.
In late January, about a week after his arrival in the White House, Trump conducted telephone conversations with a number of world nationals, often several in one day.
The conversation with Turnbull finally marked the least pleasant of the day.
Before he ended it, he said he had had previously had a pleasant conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
They had the killer Rany executed in front of the crowd.
Her father was watching, too.
The execution took place on the square in Yemen’s capital Sanaa.
Muhammad al-Maghrabi chose the little Rana Almatari, who lived in his neighborhood as his victim.
Al Maghrabi kidnapped the girl, took her to his father’s house, raped her, and bare hands.
He also raped her body, which he then carried near the mosque.
The violent death of the little girl has affected the entire country facing the threat of civil war.
Yahya Almatari stood in the first row of a thousand-headed crowd who came together to witness the execution.
Muhammad al-Maghrabi was convicted under Sharia law.
The victim's father, after the execution, told the media his feelings.
I feel like I'm reborn.
I'm relieved.
It's the new day of my life.
The other members of the family were also present, along with the crowd, shouting the motto "Long live the justice."
The rapist brought a police van to the square from which he was pulled.
The police put the man tied up on his stomach.
One of the officers turned his gun against him and fired it from nearby.
The crowd was celebrating each of the wounds that were burned.
Mr al Almatari told MailOnline that justice was done in accordance with the country’s legal system.
“Justice, Allah and Sharia law have won,” he added.
I stood on the Liberation Square in Sanaa waiting for the execution of my daughter's murderer.
Then my family and I went to the morgue.
We took Rani's little body and buried it in a nearby cemetery.
My wife and I, Jamileh, are grateful that justice has been done.
The police were afraid that the crowd gathered on the square would fall into a hated madness, the killer would be caught and melted.
The execution was ordered by a court that is under the administration of the Shiite Shootings.
However, Maghrabi was initially sentenced to 100 blows immediately after his arrest, but his act sparked such a revolt that the judge decided on the death penalty.
Al Maghrabi was arrested two days after the girl disappeared on June 27.
Rani's family knew him well.
When the police searched the basement of his house, they found evidence that the man was planning his act.
Mr. Almatari described him as a monster.
What could be his motive?
Even the animal would have been more merciful to Rana.
“Our family has no enemies, and the injuries that ran into Rani’s body were terrible,” he told the media.
"The wound disappeared in the afternoon, we reported it to the police that day, we told the newspapers and all our TV stations, posters with her photo were hanging everywhere," he continued.
Everyone thinks the police got a tip from the killer parents who suspected their son of a terrible crime.
The girl's mother, Jamileh, had to be hospitalized after she learned that her daughter's body had been found.
Rana was going out to play with the other kids from the neighborhood.
After 10-15 minutes, I went out to see where he was.
We searched everywhere, but Rana was gone.
We walked around our block, our friends took cars and drove around, but we searched in vain.
Yemen’s residents were displeased by the crime and began gathering in front of the police station where al Maghrabi was detained, demanding immediate punishment.
A representative of the Ministry of Justice read to the crowd the record of the investigation to reassure them.
The accused apparently did not show any remorse for his actions.
Shortly before the execution, the police read the verdict, but the convict only looked at his executioner.
The whole event was filmed for national television, but there were many recordings on the internet that the crowd picked up.
Governor of West Virginia Announces Change of Political Party
Democratic governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced on Thursday evening at a meeting of President Trump that he was moving to another party.
“Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have turned their backs on me,” Justice Governor said.
“Today, after a long prayer and meditation, I announce to you ... today, as a West Virginian, I tell you that I can no longer support you from the position of a democratic governor.”
The crowd of viewers exploded in joy.
“Tomorrow I will join the Republicans,” Justice added.
“As a coach, I can tell you that it’s time to jump into another game.”
Trump has previously promised to the people at a meeting in West Virginia an important announcement.
Trump won in West Virginia with 42 points and Justice did not support Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
According to Forbes magazine, Justice, the only billionaire in the country, was elected in 2016.
Forbes adds that Justice inherited a large fortune from his father and is the owner of several coal mines.
The value of his property is estimated at <0x24>1.59 billion.
In the meantime, the Republican National Committee issued a statement on Thursday evening stating: "The passing of the Governor of Justice is another wound for a democratic party that puts obstacles in our way, rather than causing the rise of our country."
“For a democratic party that has only 15 governors and controls the least legislative bodies in history, the announcement of the Governor of Justice is the last drop for the already corrupted party without a leader, who is desperately trying to find positive and unifying reports,” he told CNC News.
Sebastian Coe commends Russia’s “sincere” apology for doping scandal
Former sportsman Sebastian Coe on Thursday praised Russia for his sincere apology for the doping scandal, but reiterated that the time has not yet come for Russia to return to the sporting world.
Russian head of athletics Dmitry Shylakhtin said on the occasion of the IAAF Congress - which was held on the eve of the MS in athletics - that the expulsion of his country from the world of sports was correct and that he was determined to fight doping.
He apologized to “all the athletes who lost gold and silver medals in this way.”
Despite his comments, IAAF members voted in favour of maintaining the ban, which entered into force in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) revealed that Russia supported the doping of its athletes.
"I think we've seen very honest responses and presentations today," IAAF President Sebastian Coe told reporters.
“All the members of the Council and Congress were pleasantly surprised that Russia has admitted its mistake and is working with all its strength to correct and restore the proper function of the whole federation.”
Coe said he was also “happy” that Russia had accepted the criteria for its reintroduction.
"I think today has been very successful and we have moved to the next level, but Congress supports the recommendation of the crisis staff to maintain the punishment imposed on Russia," Coe said.
“In the coming months, we need to do everything we can to stabilize the situation.
"Our goal has always been to separate honest athletes from dishonest athletes," he said.
19 Russian athletes will compete under the neutral flag at the IAAF Athletics Championships, which starts on Friday in London.
IAAF Head of Crisis Staff Rune Andersen said on Monday that Russia still has to meet several criteria before it is allowed back.
Drug testing is still inadequate and exclusion coaches continue to carry out their activities, he told reporters in London after a presentation by the IAAF.
The CzechTrade State contract was acquired by Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ka Savova, whose state is prosecuting.
The public contract of the CzechTrade state export agency was awarded to the publisher Mladá fronta Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ka Savova.
Officials awarded him 100 percent points in all qualitative criteria.
They did not care that the Czech state is prosecuting Savo for tax fraud and demanding his extradition to the Czech Republic.
In April, the CzechTrade Ministry of Industry and Trade’s pro-export agency issued a public contract for the four-year provision of editorial content for the BusinessInfo portal.
The contract amounting to SEK 30.8 million was awarded to the publisher Mladá front of entrepreneur Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ka Savova.
The Czech police have accused him of tax evasion in 2014 and are prosecuting him for escaping.
Savov fled to the UK and the Czech Republic is requesting his extradition.
The server has notified you about this.
According to the original criteria, CzechTrade had to decide on the 60 percent price offered and the remaining 40 beauty competitions, i.e. the quality of the project.
The second criterion, however, was very helpful for Savo’s company.
According to the information, Dotak.cz received 100 points in all the quality criteria.
It was the result that moved her before another candidate, Vltava Labe Media VLM, which offered a better price.
While the Young Front operated for 404,900 SEK per month, VLM offered 324,350 SEK.
Unlike the Young Front, however, he received an average rating of 62 points from the assessors in all qualitative criteria.
The tender was also attended by the consulting firm BDO Advisory and the digital agency R-Media, which as well as the server Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz under the publishing house Economia.
The VLM publishing house raised several objections against the result of the tender, with its assessment being considered by the Nga unjustified and insufficiently justified.
Following their rejection, it was decided to challenge competition with the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS Competition Protection Office.
It is believed that CzechTrade has acted in violation of the law.
"The applicant is convinced that the contractor has reached the decision on the selection of a supplier for public procurement on the basis of the rigour of subjective evaluation, which unambiguously favours the participant Mladá fronta, a.s., who, at the expense of the applicant, will ask the suppliers,"
According to VLM Director-General and Chairman of the Board, Michal Klyma, the selection committee’s rating appears to be unbelievable and a 100% evaluation of the Young Front project among all its members as extremely suspicious.
“Any independent observer must consider such a miracle success of one of the competitors as unlikely and suspicious,” he said.
CzechTrade has not yet commented on the situation.
The CzechTrade Agency does not comment on public contracts prior to their closure.
All information about the contracts mentioned by you is published in accordance with the law in the Contracting Authority’s Profile and in the Public Procurement Office.
"A full written report will be published after the end of the contract, however, during the duration of the contract, we cannot express our opinion on its course," said <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>pán Dlouh<0xC3><0xBD>, media representative of the agency for Dotyk.cz.
The Young Front responded with a statement that it considers extremely problematic that the publishing house of Economia has entered the competition with an article in Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz, where it has its own business interests.
However, this fact was stated in the aforementioned article.
In the tender, it could have helped her that she was the one who provided the BusinessInfo editorial service for the previous four years.
The contract was first contested in 2013, when the Ministry of Industry and Trade led Martim Cuba ODS.
Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ka Savva blames the police for tax evasion in connection with excessive VAT deductions to his companies, which caused alleged damage to the Czech state up to 770 million kroner.
The Czech Republic has been asking the UK to issue it since 2014.
According to Savva, his criminalization is led by the head of the ANO movement, Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1>, whose influence falls from the Mafra publishing house.
Last year, the London court rejected Savo’s appeal against the extradition, but the businessman appealed.
"In our view, the case hasn't moved anywhere since last year, we have not received any explanations in terms of obtaining legal power from the United Kingdom until today," <0xC5><0xA0>tepánka Zenklová, a spokeswoman for the Prague City Prosecutor's Office, told Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz.
In addition to the ownership of the Young Front, Savov represented Harvestor Limited, headquartered in Cyprus, which controlled the Czech brewery Samson, and in the Cypriot company Maraflex, which profiles itself as an investment fund, buying endangered assets.
It is also expected to control the collapsed company Heavy Machinery Services, formerly Legios, which owes over <0x24>3 billion.
In the past, Savov was also associated with the expropriation of property from the former Socialist Youth Union.
The motorcyclist ran through the pedestrians and park, ended up in steering wheels.
The motorcyclist paid attention to himself by a reckless ride through the streets, pedestrians and park roads in <0xC3><0x9A><0xC5><0xA1>ovice.
When the patrol started chasing him, he decided to go in the direction of Stanovi<0xC5><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>e.
"Policemen with increased caution were chasing the city when he was unable to drive on one of the side roads behind the Marian Baths and drove on a motorcycle into the field where he was injured," police spokesman Daniel Dvo<0xC5><0x99>ák said.
Finally, a rescue helicopter had to arrive at the accident, which transported the injured motorcyclist to the hospital in Plze<0xC5><0x88>.
Afterwards, the police discovered that the motorcycle driver did not own a driver's license, the motorcycle registration marks were stripped, his production number was armored and the production label itself was removed.
It is possible that the machine was stolen.
The origin of the motorcycle is subject to further investigation.
"A breath test conducted on the spot ruled out the presence of alcohol in the driver, but the test found a positive result on the substance methamphetamine," a police spokesman said.
How the financial rules of football will affect Neymar's move to Paris
The rules restricting the financing of European football clubs do not in any way disrupt Neymar's record transfer from Spain to Paris-Saint-Germain.
Any penalty for Paris Saint-Germain will be carried out by EUFA, which oversees European football teams and has the authority to prohibit teams from participating in the prestigious Champions League.
The Financial Fair Play Rules (FFP), introduced by UEFA in 2011, stipulate that PSG will have to prove that Neymar's move was not funded without major losses.
Barcelona has paid a total of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>222 million to buy Neymar from his contract and Neymar will demand a salary of several tens of millions of dollars a year.
It follows several financial conditions for Neymar's move to France.
As the PSG team is funded by a wealthy Qatari family that has been enriched with energy sales, it can afford to bring Neymar into the already star football family.
Clubs can spend huge amounts to buy players, but on the other hand, they have to prove legal sources of income, allowing them to cover the regime’s costs of soccer-related business.
FFP introduced Michel Platini after reaching the chair of UEFA Director in 2007.
The former French player believed that clubs that are in debt in pursuit of new reinforcements are ultimately deceiving and risking bankruptcy if banks or owners refuse to secure them.
In 2011, the rules of the FFP redirected its attention from club debts to monitoring their losses.
This change meant that the business model that used Roman Abramovich with Chelsea in 2003 – to buy a club with potential and to spend the sums of money for players y to build a global brand – was suddenly not so advantageous.
Within the current three-year trial period, which ends in 2018, clubs can lose up to EUR 30 million.
And despite Platini having to leave his post in 2015, his successor Aleksander <0xC4><0x8C>eferin is determined to defend the ban on excessive spending.
“The rules of the FFP continue to apply and we are determined to strengthen them in the future,” Andrea Traverso, who oversees compliance with the rules of the FFP, told the Associated Press last week.
Although PSG has paid the amount for the purchase of Neymar in a one-time payment, for accounting purposes, it may divide the amount over the entire duration of the contract.
Neymar signed a five-year contract, so the transfer can be split to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>44.4 million annually for five years.
The first wave of FFP’s highest sanctions hit PSG in 2014 along with Manchester City, which owns the group Abu Dhabi.
PSG took a fine of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>60 million (<0x24>82 million) - which was later reduced to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>20 million - and an order to reduce the Champions League team to 21 players in the 2014-2015 season, instead of 25 players.
UEFA is paying attention to teams that can try to circumvent financial regulators by increasing their revenues through companies affiliated with club owners.
Thus, even if the Qatari company sponsors PSG as soon as the financing exceeds the standard market rate, UEFA has the right to prohibit the invoicing of the amount.
A similar measure was adopted by UEFA in 2014 after deciding that the amount of funding provided by the Qatar Tourism Authority to the PSG team was too high.
A portion of Neymar’s PSG revenue could be reportedly paid by the organising committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.
However, PSG and representatives of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar denied that Neymat should become the ambassador of the World Cup in football and that such a maneuver could be easily detected by UEFA officials.
The previous sanctions imposed on PSG mean that UEFA will closely monitor any attempts to circumvent rules.
According to the official statement on Tuesday, UEFA has not initiated any investigation into Neymar's transfer to PSG.
The source of the report wanted to remain anonymous as he is not allowed to comment on the situation with PSG, The Associated Press said.
The latest published financial statements show that PSG concluded 2015-2016 with a net profit of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>10 million and a turnover of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>542.4 million.
The financial statements for the current financial year have not yet been published.
PSG expects Neymar’s arrival to be a huge opportunity for sponsors, merchandising and sales of shirts.
The club promises to increase its turnover by up to 30 percent from the signing of the contract.
Officials of the Spanish league, apparently concerned with the departure of one of the biggest stars, sought to stifle Neymar's departure, arguing that PSG is violating the rules of the FFP.
“This is a clear case of ‘financial doping’ both the club and the state,” the president of the League Javier Teba told Spanish newspaper AS, referring to the ownership of the club by the Qatari union.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club owns an American sports magnate, shares the same La Liga stance on the club's funding.
“It’s a result of ownership that has fundamentally changed the football world over the past 15 years,” Wenger said.
“As soon as he becomes the owner of the club, everything is possible.
Compliance with the rules of financial fair play is very difficult because the state may have different interests in participating such players in its club."
Spartan backer Rosick<0xC3><0xBD>: Changes are painful, but we have to believe.
Sixteen thousand applauding fans on their feet.
Tomás Rosick<0xC3><0xBD> goes to the square.
Same scene as in the Sunday match against the Bohemians.
The Spartan goalkeeper moved against the Red Star game, invented a few goals, but his co-players did not turn to black.
The flight team, pumped by new multi-million-dollar forces, ends after the opening doubles in the European Cups.
Was it hard to do anything with the match after the Belgrade fire?
After the goal was scored, it took four shots, which was difficult for us.
At least we didn’t want to lose, to raise our self-confidence, so that we could get back to the next game.
We had some chances.
We need to work together as a team and move our game forward.
Why did Sparta not get into the game for so long?
The game is horribly crafted.
The combinations of the opponents were much better than ours.
We didn't get anything, maybe we fired once in half time.
This is, of course, very little when you have to win by two or three goals.
The second half was much better, we were able to play with them in the final quarter.
But you have to push the opponent more often into such positions.
Is there a problem with a large number of changes in the composition?
Of course, this is one of the pain when a new crew is formed.
We’ve only played three matches and the setup is changing.
The goal is for the coach to find the perfect 11 that fits.
Is it an encouragement to you that you have already played part of two games in a row?
It's still just part of the game.
I don’t know how my condition will develop and when I can finally play from the beginning.
Are you still optimistic about the changes that have taken place in Sparta?
We have to be, otherwise we can't.
It's the same as an injury.
If you don't believe, you can't come back.
Sparta has made a decision, we have to be optimistic, otherwise the situation will be even worse.
The fans came again in large numbers, but they left in despair.
What can you show them?
There was a wonderful visit here again, as well as with Goda.
I'm so sorry that we can't make them enjoy a better performance.
I'll show you something that they'll come next time.
We can thank them for coming.
I don't remember those visits when I played here fifteen years ago.
Can a season without cups at least be an advantage for the league?
So far, we're fighting with ourselves, we're playing, so it's not such an advantage for us.
In case of extreme tax evasion, the entrepreneur must stay for 10 years.
The Constitutional Court has rejected the complaint of businessman Ji<0xC5><0x99>í Toman, who is expected to be sentenced to ten years in prison for tax cuts.
The numbered damage amounts to 645 million kroner.
In the complaint, Toman claimed that the justice violated his fundamental rights, the factual findings of the courts in Zlín and Olomouc are said to be incomplete.
However, the constitutional judges considered the complaint unsubstantiated, <0xC4><0x8C>TK found out from the court database.
The Court of Appeal is not another court of appeal.
"As a fourth instance, it cannot judge the factual or legal errors alleged to have been committed by the general courts if they do not constitute a violation of constitutionally protected rights and freedoms," the resolution said.
Tom was tried as a fugitive.
The verdict has been valid since November 2015, when it was confirmed by the Supreme Court in Olomouc.
At that time, Toman was in a publishing house in Argentina, where he was also at the time of the U.S. decision, according to the resolution.
The penalty imposed is at the upper limit of the legal rate, which according to the verdict corresponds to the damage incurred.
The Supreme Court called the case an extreme tax evasion, which has a macroeconomic impact on the state budget.
He served from 2005 to 2008 as chairman of the board of World Services.
The damage of SEK 645 million occurred only in the period from January to July 2008, the total leakage, according to experts, exceeded <0x24>1 billion.
For procedural reasons, however, it was no longer possible to prosecute Toman for the full amount.
According to the complaint, World Servis did not include all invoices in its tax returns.
Instead of monthly VAT and consumption taxes in the order of at least SEK 10 million, they paid taxes in just hundreds of thousands.
World Service and some of the companies with which the company traded have a relationship with the entrepreneur Radomir Vybíral, who was charged with 13 years in prison for VAT machining in fuel trades.
His complaint was also rejected by the Constitutional Court.
"Summer to Survival" and "Comrade Detective" series play nostalgic string
This iteration of the story is nostalgic for both characters from the famous 80s; both for the dirty 90s (when the geniuses David Wain and Michael Showalter introduced the comedy sketch "The State") on MTV; and of course also for the modern era, specifically the year 2001, before starring in the likes of Elizabeth Banks and Elizabeth Rudd.
As a cultural artifact, it is a light parody and at the same time an embodiment of our modern Facebook era of lasting memories.
From the point of view of the franchise, it looks like someone is breathing.
The "First Day of Camp" series worked surprisingly well - not just because of the absurd humor (for example, the story of the formation of a talking can with vegetables, which was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).
The authors turned away from the main joke points - middle-aged actors playing teenage teenage kids - and could not draw from past events.
The continuation of "Ten Years Later", in which adults play, doesn't put much pressure on the emotional level and satire is a sporadical place, including a parody of thrillers from the 1990s as "The Hand in the Cage".
In one moment, the character finds a pile of Apple Powerbooks, wheel slides, and “a bunch of other things from 1991.”
Many of the main storylines are repeated.
Charity Coop (Mr. Showalter), now a writer, still does not move through his love for Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still panicking.
Not to mention the insane conspiracy that involves Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter), encouraged by George H. W. Bush (very well-occupied Michael Ian Black).
As always, the best part of the franchise is many side stories.
It’s particularly fun to watch an eternally young, long-haired Rud, alias of Matt Dillon’s character from the film Youth, whose once respectable character Andy is now behind an old pepper.
The franchise could start moments of random insanity, such as a return to the series "Seven Up" until it reaches what I assume will be a logical twist: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," when in the final scene the entire group will be released to the premiere.
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon in the meantime appeals for another type of nostalgia: Cold War revivalism from the series "So Normal Americans", the film "Atomic Blonde: No Regrets" and even the series "GLOW", in which the icons of Eastern and Western wrestling collide.
The comedy by creators Brian Gatewood and Alessandra Tanaka, directed by Rhyse Thomas, is set to act as a television drama: a drama about two Bucharest policemen from Romania in the 1980s who fight for truth and atheism in the way of Marxism-Leninism.
The main roles – persistent Gregor and idealistic Joseph – are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Cornelius Street, who immersed in the English language Channing Tatum (executive producer of the series) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a great idea.
Unfortunately, that's not much more.
Some jokes make you laugh (such as policemen watching chess on television - parody of American football).
The series was voiced by many well-known actors, including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershal Ali and Chloe Sevigny.
“Comrade Detective” is too focused on a ruthless propaganda drama – which includes a killer with Reagan’s mask – and it also looks like that.
Six long episodes are too stretchy and comedy moments are not enough.
In the shorter run, the propaganda satire in “Comrade Detective” could function, for example, in a scene where Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the U.S. Embassy, in the hall of which two thickeners studded hamburgers on a large pile.
A clear message for the imaginary communist public is the fact that Western culture can turn everything into a pot and an orgy.
The thinking of the Romanian creators was not mistaken: we do so with our own culture as well as with their own.
Russian athletes did not expect a ban on startups from the IAAF.
The International Athletic Federation (IAAF) has confirmed the extension of the international ban on Russian racers due to a state-sponsored doping program at a congress in London.
The vote in the history of the world championship, which will begin on Friday, was expected to be very clear.
166 delegates voted against the extension of the ban.
The main reason for the rejection is, above all, the fact that Russia fails to meet all the requirements for the introduction of the anti-doping system, as noted before the congress by the head of the IAAF Special Investigation Group Rune Andersen.
His group recommended that the ban continue.
Some of the older doping cases remain unresolved, a number of suspected athletes have not yet been interrogated, and coaches with a disgraced reputation are still working in the country.
The Russian anti-doping agency RUSADA is not fully functional yet, which does not meet the standards of the World Anti-Doping Agency.
However, RUSADA can already conduct tests under the supervision of foreign experts and British anti-doping agencies.
"Although progress has been made, there is still a lot of work to be done," IAAF President Sebastian Coe said.
The Russian Athletic Federation was suspended in November 2015, with Russian athletes losing to the last Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
Despite the ban on the upcoming MS, 19 Russians will participate, who have previously proved that they have been tested for a long time outside the Russian anti-doping system.
But they will not be able to start in national colours at the championship and they will not play the Russian anthem if they win.
Bank of England supports interest rate of 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce that the interest rate will remain unchanged, following a slight economic growth and weakening of inflation, which has added speculation about sharp growth.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will continue to be “backwards” in terms of maintaining interest rates – despite cravings for family budgets.
Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) politicians voted six to two votes to keep the interest rate at 0.25%. The results of the vote to increase the interest rate supported a sluggish economic growth backed by weak growth.
In its annual inflation report, the Bank predicted growth to 1.7% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018 and warned that the reduction in family budgets would continue. The Bank expects inflation to rise to 3% in the fall.
At the same time, the Bank indicated that in the next few years there should be growth due to inflation caused by Brexit and also stated that rents from mobility should grow more than expected in financial markets.
The committee members also voted to remove part of the Mammut package, which was designed to support the economy, and which was put into practice a year ago in response to Brexit.
As a result of the foregoing, it should start to pay from next February onwards on a timely financing plan that will offer cheap subsidies to banks, although the Bank of England said it will now offer <0xC2><0xA3>15 billion less compared to the <0xC2><0xA3>115 billion planned.
Shortly before the decision, the bank said: “MPC predicts that gross domestic product (GDP) will stagnate in the short term along with pressure on real household income and consumption burdens.”
On the issue of rates, the bank said it would need to “remove the belts of monetary policy” to calm inflation, and this “at a higher rate” than markets expect.
Markets are currently forecasting the first growth in the third quarter of next year and further growth in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that any increase would be "slow" and "limited".
The Bank’s growth forecasts for this year and next year were reduced from 1.9% and 1.7% forecasts in May.
The expected growth of 1.8% in 2018 remained unchanged.
After the publication of estimates, the pound fell against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell by 0.5% to <0x24>1.31 and by 0.4% to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.11.
The decision to maintain the current state came after the disappointing growth buried hope for further growth – GDP stalled at 0.3% in the second quarter compared to 0.2% in the previous three months.
The increase is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although at the end of the year it is expected to increase slightly according to the bank.
The latest report on inflation is a poor comfort for households affected by rising inflation and miserable wage increases. The Bank said that the situation will worsen before it rises.
The report also said monetary policy "can't prevent" revenue cuts in the coming years, but that wages are expected to rise "significantly" by the end of the three-year forecast.
The economy is also expected to grow thanks to a strong interest in British goods due to a weak pound, which offsets a lower percentage of consumer spending.
This decision came a year after the rate was reduced to 0.025 per cent last August in response to the shocking vote on the EU referendum, which led to a drop in the pound.
The Bank estimates that the full consolidation of prices and the economy will take at least four years.
Prior to the bank’s decision on the latest rates, many demanded an increase in rates along with rising inflation, which was developing more and more pressure on households. Three politicians demanded an increase of 0.5% in June.
Inflation fell back to 2.6% from 2.9% in June last month, despite the fact that the bank said it expected such a change and that inflation should rise again over the next month.
The Bank stated that the exceedance relative to the 2% target was "completely" due to a weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, CEO of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: “Given the recent fall in swap rates, it seems that competition in the mortgage market will only increase as soon as creditors start competing for contracts with a good outlook at the end of the year.
The market looks particularly good for those who end up with existing contracts and re-hypothecations - there are no-charge options on offer, as well as low rates that they get at will."
NHS Prescribes Controversial HIV Drug to 10,000 Patients
Patients will be given access to ‘transformative’ treatment to prevent HIV from September on the basis of a decision by the Supreme Court on funding the NHS drug.
The British National Health Service (NSH) has announced that the pre-exposure prophylaxis pill (PrEP), which is taken before sex and reduces the risk of infection in high-risk patients by up to 86 percent, will be offered through health services to approximately 10,000 patients within the country.
NSH agreed to finance the trial period after the appellate court backed the Supreme Court’s decision last year by stating that the NHS has the funds to pay for PrEP despite the statement that the drug should be funded by local authorities.
The decision, which was announced on Thursday, was taken by the NHS England from the mouth of CEO Simon Stevens as “significant intervention,” while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described the decision as “a decisive moment.”
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to start receiving patients. Further clinics will join in October and will be fully implemented throughout England by April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an HIV medicine given before sex to reduce the risk of HIV disease.
Tests have shown that PrEP significantly reduces the risk of HIV transmission among endangered patients.
The application of PrEP before sex means that there are sufficient amounts of specific drugs in the patient's body to prevent infection.
These medications can be taken every day or at least two hours before sex.
Patients tested include homosexual or bisexual men, transgender people, and people with HIV-positive partners who are not successfully treated.
The clinics shall identify eligible participants who sign the consent to participate in the testing, including men, women, transgender people and individuals with a partner whose HIV status is not yet controlled by the appropriate treatment.
People living and enrolled at the UK GP can also sign up at their local sexual health clinic and apply for a potential participation in the test.
The program comes taxpayers at <0xC2><0xA3>10 million and the NHS of England signed a drug distribution contract this week after obtaining an international public procurement.
The trial period is designed to gather clinical evidence and assess the full potential of PrEP, its targeting, use and implementation on a large scale.
Simon Stevens added: “This important intervention should complement and fully burden the ever-expanding and increasingly successful HIV prevention effort.
It’s another milestone in over 30 years of trying to stop one of the biggest challenges to human health.”
Deborah Gold, NAT (National Aids Trust), said: “We are witnessing a crucial moment in the fight against HIV.
If PrEP is given correctly and patients are at risk, it will offer the possibility of transforming the English HIV epidemic.
Since September, NSH will offer patients at high risk of HIV infection a new powerful tool that is individually controlled and not subject to the need to negotiate with a partner, which will lead to an improvement in the quality of many lives.
We are pleased to accept this statement."
Ian Green, CEO of Terrence Higgins Trust, said: “Priority number one must be the rapid deployment of tests across the country; we need to ensure that it is available to every patient.
We now have the PrEP test drug available, and we are on a good path to protecting more than 10,000 people at risk of HIV infection.”
Sharon Hodgson, Shadow Minister of Health, said: “The beginning of the PrEP trial period is a welcome and long-awaited change after months of postponements and delays by the government.
Evidence suggests how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to preventing HIV and stopping the transmission of this life-threatening infection.
Subsequent tests will bring us one step closer to a full understanding of the benefits of PrEP.
Now it’s important that we start testing across the country as soon as possible to protect people who are exposed to HIV and, together, to end the spread of HIV in society.”
Life on high feet: the interfloor and smart design turned this small apartment at Earls Court into a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, exchanged a large house in Knightsbridge for an apartment at Earls Court in 2014.
Located on the first floor of the smart terrace of Queen Anne - it is a visual demonstration of modern design that makes the most of the space available.
“I used to live with my ex-husband in a much larger house in the Knightsbridge neighborhood,” Joanne said.
“I was looking for something at a more reasonable price.
I hit this apartment in Earls Court and had the same ceiling height.
I fell in love with him right away, and the same day I fell in love with him.”
Since then, the apartment of 1000 square meters has undergone complete renovation.
One-bedroom apartment with a complicated layout - to get into the bedroom, you had to walk through the kitchen - Joanne wanted to add deposition spaces and the interstage to use a high ceiling.
“I enjoyed the high ceiling, the large windows and a lot of light.
Those were my demands,” she said.
For this purpose, she employed Erfan Azadi from the design and design studio Duck & Shed, based in Notting Hill, and used a nearly four-meter ceiling to create a home that was not only a project, but also a place to live.
The ceiling did not reach such heights as to allow two gaps to penetrate one another - the challenge for architects was to create an interstage on which one could walk upwards.
Erfan had to engage his creative thinking.
“The steel structure is quite complicated,” he explained.
“We had to arrange both spaces so that we could walk straight.
It wasn’t just about building a simple platform, but at the same time, bending the steel structure so that it is at the right height above and below the ceiling.”
This arrangement allowed Erfan to build two full-fledged rooms on one another - and at the same time add to the drama.
In the interstate, the beautiful living room features an old copper window frame in the design of Retrouvius.
Mirror furniture in gold, silver lines and the retro mirror Serge Mouille creates a unique style.
The use of mirrors plays an important role in drama, space and lighting.
The short corridor is equipped with mirrors on both sides and looks longer.
Mirror bars in the kitchen look like a window to another room.
At the entrance door there are storage spaces equipped with mirrors for storing accessories and glasses.
The advantage of the living room, which lends the whole apartment the impression of significantly larger space, is the ability to separate it from the kitchen if it is not used.
Folding kitchens are nothing new.
However, what is unique to this solution is the folding door.
“We had to deal with the technical side,” Erfan says about the fortified smoke doors.
“The door is equipped with counterbalances so that it is very easy to unfold.”
Thanks to the smart use of space and storage spaces, Joanne gained an additional 16 square meters, a second room and a better overall layout of the apartment.
“When it comes to that, what you’re selling is a residential area – or appreciation of your property,” Erfan said.
"A real broker basically when entering the apartment calculates its price based on the residential area."
In this case, it has managed to increase the living area while preserving quality materials, which lend the space a luxurious appearance.
“The material is very important because you touch it and create an emotional bond with your home,” Erfan added.
“You don’t like the electricity in the walls.
Yes, they are important, but your hearts are not gaining.”
As it turned out, high-quality design and increased living space can turn an ordinary apartment into an exceptional work.
And just like Joanne, you can finally decide to stay.
The United States is disbanding.
The cultural and political divide between the blue and red states is deepening.
California has declared a ban on citizens travelling to Tennessee and seven other states.
The state of Tennessee has paid her the price and declared a repatriation ban on her citizens travelling to California.
Of course, this is not a ban in the full sense of the word, U.S. citizens can travel freely through all fifty states.
California has banned spending state money on citizens’ travel to eight other states, including Alabama, South Dakota, Kansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, Tennessee and Texas.
Who will stop this madness?
California is strong for LGBT and any expression of disagreement with the LGBT lifestyle is considered discrimination.
Tennessee, however, has passed the Consciousness Reserve Act, according to which a psychotherapist who has a moral problem with the therapy of LGBT patients is not obliged to provide it to them, but is obliged to provide these patients with another therapist who does not have such a problem.
Texas and other states have enacted laws according to which religious charitable organizations that have received children from mothers after birth for adoption are not obliged to provide these children with adoptions to same-sex couples.
As a result of these conscience reserve laws, California has banned the funding of its citizens from travelling to eight states of the Union by its means.
In practice, this means that California professors are not allowed to have trips to a scientific symposium, for example, in Texas paid from their universities because they are co-financed by the state of California.
Similarly, school sports teams cannot travel to tournaments or competitions, for example, to Tennessee with the financial support of their schools.
They have to get either federal grants on their trips, but it is absurd for the federal government to fund citizens’ trips from state A to state B, or private sponsorship.
The state of Tennessee has gained patience and its parliament has passed the law with a resolution that it also dislikes California’s policy of high taxes, high state spending, high deficits and tolerance of illegal immigrants, but still does not approve the travel embargo in California because of it.
It is a revenge for the California travel embargo on Tennessee.
And the same will happen to every State of the Union that would impose a similar ban on travel to another State for whatever reason.
At the same time, he called on parliaments of all states to stop this madness.
The facts, now the comment.
The situation is toxic.
First, all of this is constitutional, nothing unconstitutional.
States have the right to pass laws on the reservation of conscience, as well as to decide what their money will go to and what they are not allowed to do.
Secondly, what is wrong with the reservation of conscience?
If the carpenter has a religious problem selling pork, why can’t he offer only beef, lamb, poultry, and fish?
Why should he be forced to sell pork under penalty, when the pig-offerings are enough?
In Colorado, one baker faces an anti-discrimination lawsuit and a high fine for refusing to make a cake for a gay wedding.
But he also refuses to bake a cake for Halloween or alcohol.
Why not punish him and not leave him in the room and the cakes to order from hundreds of other bakers?
Thirdly, the beauty of the federal system is that the constitutional rights of all the citizens of the federation are guaranteed, but individual states can adjust their internal, domestic policy in powers that are not federal according to their own, i.e. according to the preferences of their citizens.
Then there is diversity, diversity, diversity.
California can be California and Texas can be Texas.
But California wants California to be California and Texas and seven other states to be California too!
Fourthly, LGBT members were once rightly striving to tolerate their lifestyle.
Today, many members of this community are governed by the rule of living and letting live, which should be governed by all reasonable people, but some activists strive not for tolerance towards themselves and others, but for extreme intolerance towards others.
No one should ever again express a moral, religious or philosophical disagreement with the LGBT lifestyle, and if they do, they should be criminalized.
The mentality of these activists is totalitarian.
They are the modern enemies of freedom.
Fifthly, I do not know the situation in American history where states have done so for political reasons, except for one case.
Even during the Black civil rights struggle, where the North and the West were on the side of integration and the South on the side of segregation, the states did not impose sanctions on each other.
The only case was in the 50s of the 19th century, the political cause was slavery and the war of the North against the South.
Of course, nothing like this will happen now, but the situation is still toxic.
The cultural and political divide between blue-democratic and red-republican states is deepening and the United States is mentally internally disintegrating.
Unauthorized agitation.
Putin's critic received a heavy fine.
Russian opposition politician Alexey Navalny was fined 300,000 rubles for violating the rules of the campaign before the presidential election next year.
The court imposed a fine on him for calling people to participate in unauthorized demonstrations.
Navalny has organized two major anti-government street protests over the past two months and announced that he wants to run for the head of state in March next year.
Kremlin chief Vladimir Putin has not yet announced his candidacy, but is generally expected to do so and win again.
Navalny said the police came home this morning and took him to court.
He was fined for urging people to take part in demonstrations through videos posted on the YouTube website.
The fine is three hundred thousand.
"We will later tear them off the judge's salary," a Kremlin critic jokes on Twitter.
The Russian Electoral Commission recently concluded that Navalny could not participate in the presidential election because he had previously been convicted of disbelief.
Navalny, who is considered a fighter against corruption, however, considers the relevant judgment to be politically motivated.
A fine of 300,000 rubles, including 25,000 rubles, was imposed on Thursday by the court on two members of the Naval Pre-Election Team, Leonid Volkov and Nikolai Ljaskin.
Navalny entered Russian politics as an anti-corruption blogger and gradually became a dominant figure on the fragmented opposition scene.
The authorities are trying to defend Navalny in the campaign.
In February, he was sentenced to five years in prison for stealing the forestry company Kirovles.
The judgment was confirmed by the Court of Appeal in May.
The verdict is so valid that Navalny is prevented by Russian law from running.
The brothers are fighting for an empire worth more than <0x24>500 million.
Two brothers now, more than four decades after their Italian family founded the empire, are relocating one of the most expensive Victorian properties worth more than <0x24>500 million.
Former director of the Carlton Football Club and developer Colin De Lutis resides in Toorak, just three rooms from his younger brother Paul, who ran a joint property and commercial property dispute to the Supreme Court.
Paul wanted to leave his family business in 2014, but the sharp dispute is constantly being denied to the Supreme Court.
Together with his mother, Anna, the brothers own a total of 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars. The first store was purchased by the family in 1973 on Smith Street in Collingwood.
The Westco Jeans family was founded here, which grew into a chain of 160 stone shops.
In 1999, the family sold the entire company for <0x24>85 million.
For the money, additional properties were purchased and the De Lutis family portfolio now includes offices, construction land in Brunswick and Sorrento, apartments on the Gold Coast and Mt Buller and shopping centers in the suburbs.
Paul owns about one-third of the company’s assets, while his father Colin, who is Paul’s “significant driving force and dominant personality” of the De Lutis family, owns less than two-thirds of the assets.
The court records state that Colin owns <0x24>316 million in property, while Paul manages the property for <0x24>176 million.
For Paul, the distribution of assets and financial resources has just become a problem.
"Colin's proposal was in my eyes a significant step forward in his favor," Paul wrote in a deputy jury statement in 2015.
Last Friday, after several unsuccessful attempts at peace, the first meeting of the Supreme Court was held.
The brothers are also now competing for who will control the existing business - from which Paul, according to his statement, cut Colin.
Colin argues that this is not true and accuses Paul of mishandling certain properties.
In a previous Deputy Priestly statement, Colin stated that he believes in a viable solution to the conflict.
“My Italian origin dictates to me that family is the most important of all,” he wrote.
Hundreds of pages of jury statements, emails and news from companies including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer flood lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC and lawyers from both sides.
Mrs. De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who had been operating dairy bars and treats since the 1950s and bought a bar in Brunswick in the 1970s.
They bought a property in Collingwood, where Colin opened the first family-owned jeans business.
Colin said when he founded Westco "in the last year of college, Paul was still a little boy, about 10 years old."
Anna De Lutis said that together with Luigi, who died in 2012, they hoped that the transfer of property to his sons would take place well.
“Luigi often said he never wanted his sons to end up in court,” she wrote.
The other two brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis family group. Colin said that Mark was compensated by <0x24>10 million at his departure and Luke by <0x24>26 million.
As Paul, Luke and Mark said, “they were not satisfied with the terms of their financial compensation.”
Colin has been holding back ever since, despite the fact that he is a former board member of the AFL, as Eddie McGuire, a well-known television personality and Colin’s best friend, said in his 2015 autobiography.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul de Lutis and their lawyers on Friday.
Colin replied only through a text message, stating that given the fact that the dispute is being settled in court, “I have nothing to add.”
“It is very sad that my brother Paul has decided to settle the whole matter before the court,” he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin said in a court statement that he was trying to adapt to his brother’s demands.
“Our father would be very dissatisfied if he saw our current situation,” he said, adding that he “still hopes for a viable solution.”
On Friday, all hopes were lost.
“Our disputes will be resolved in court early,” Colin wrote.
Vedro in the Czech Republic.
Teachers shower children.
MHD drivers fascinate water and summer clothes.
At the Na Chodovci maternity school in Prague 4, where about 35 children are present, they only go out in the morning.
The school is after reconstruction and planted trees do not provide a large shade yet.
There is no swimming pool, but the teachers shower in the nebula.
In the afternoon, children stay in classrooms where blinds and curtains are removed.
The air is trying to cool with clean air, because they do not have air conditioning.
This is also very difficult for teachers and cooks.
"The temperature, which is in the interior and exterior, exceeds the hygienic limits for the kindergarten, so in this period we should not actually have an open operation," said Miloslav Makovi<0xC4><0x8D>ková, director of the school.
In the nursery there is a glass corridor, where according to her the temperature moves about 40 degrees.
We wind up in the morning after 6 a.m., the windows close, and we have the blinds on the south side to protect ourselves.
"But it won't help much," she added.
Better conditions are in the Na Hrázi Forestry School in Hostivice, where children spend most of their time outside.
We have grown trees on the ground, so we're under them.
"We have a beautiful nutmeg there, under it is a table, and we do different things there," said Barbora Kompan, director of the school.
Teachers and children are trying to walk into the woods, where there is a bigger mud.
Children wet hats and on the program have different games with water.
"We have a hand-pressure sprayer that is used for spraying flowers, and we use it for showering children," Kompan said.
Jitka Vilimovská, the director of the nursery in Novoborská street in Prague Proseku, said that the teachers of the children are trying to keep them in the shade and dripping them with water.
"We have a fairly grown garden, so they're under the trees," she said.
She goes out in the morning and then until 3 p.m.
Every child has to have a head cover.
Teachers are also reminding children that they should drink.
They can choose, for example, a little sweetened tea or diluted juice and have a drink of water in the garden.
Every day they also have a vegetable salad to eat and a snack of fresh fruits and vegetables, which their parents sometimes bring to them.
"Perhaps one mother brought about ten pounds of melon for the children today," added Makovi<0xC4><0x8D>ková.
Drivers receive water or summer equinoxes.
The Prague transport company DPP provides them with water, ion drinks or summer eclipses on hot days.
Cabins of drivers on trams and buses are air-conditioned in most cases, DPP spokeswoman Aneta <0xC5><0x98>ehková said.
In addition to the cabins of some trams, there are also air conditioning in the passenger area.
High-temperature tramways have not been seriously damaged so far.
Little damage occurred in the loop in the Hostivara.
At current high temperatures, we make sure that the drivers have sufficient amounts of drinks available.
"Cool drinking water is available in all loops, switching points and cars," said <0xC5><0x98>ehková.
In cars and at some places of exchange, employees have available so-called soda bars, which produce refrigerated soda.
Drivers also receive soluble protective ion drinks.
"They can also use a summer uniform that increases the comfort of drivers in their daily shifts," the spokesperson added.
Hot and dry weather in the last few days has resulted in an increase in the number of fires.
On Tuesday, the firefighters eliminated 108 firefighters across the Czech Republic, double the long-term average.
On Tuesday through the day when temperatures in the Czech Republic climbed over 35 degrees Celsius, firefighters mainly used fire fighting.
"The fires in the natural environment and also those associated with the fireworks are prevalent," fire spokeswoman Nicole Zaoral said.
The firefighters were not relieved by the evening weather change, when the heat was replaced by storms and rainfall in a number of places.
In connection with the storms, the firefighters proceeded to 236 raids.
It was mainly about the removal of fallen trees and branches.
"The most affected in Central China region," continues Zaoralová.
Firefighters also needed help in Stvolínka, Czechoslovakia, where 60 people were evacuated from a children’s camp due to storms.
Tropical temperatures have also allocated work to Prague rescue workers.
On Tuesday and Wednesday night, ambulances went to dozens of cases of carbon dioxide poisoning.
People should therefore have their water heaters checked, rescuers warn.
Carbon dioxide is a colorless, odorless gas that is released when inflamed.
Symptoms of poisoning include nausea, vomiting, headaches and a feeling of dizziness.
In case of suspicion of poisoning, you should leave the frozen room.
Trump’s New Chief of Staff Plans to Limit President’s Media Diet
Many have tried it before and have always failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly really can do it.
If so, it will be the first.
Politico said the new White House chief of staff plans to curb the flow of Trump’s information — including reports in television reports — in the hopes of keeping Trump on top.
Here is the report by reporter Josh Dawsey:
“When the new White House Chief of Staff, John F. Kelly, met on the first day in office with his new employees, he outlined the key problem of the Trump White House that he intends to fix: the wrong information that is being handed to the president.
Kelly told employees that he must personally approve all information – whether on paper or in a word – because the president can make better decisions on the basis of the correct information.
Kelly’s diagnosis actually makes sense, but many of his predecessors took control of Trump and his presentation in the media brushed his teeth.
Trump’s relationship with the media dates back several decades – and now, as he sits in the White House, his habit of watching television news is even stronger.
“If Trump as a candidate was upset by honest reporting, it was appropriate for him to show that he was being talked about in a positive light by a lot of other media, which was easier to convince,” Sam Nunberg, a former campaign adviser, told Politico in February.
Tara Palmeri of Politico at the time wrote that “the key to keeping Trump’s tweets on the cusp – at least in the words of six former campaign organizers – is to make sure that Trump regularly watches the media that praises him.”
All right.
But the idea that Trump’s tendency to post his views on Twitter was once “under control” is ridiculous.
Perhaps these campaign organizers know something others don’t know about – that Trump’s tweets would be more inspiring if someone didn’t control them.
The tweets that Trump has never sent will most likely never be known.
If his employees managed to keep him on the bench at least a few times, then their effort did not go unnoticed.
However, no one has been able to prevent Trump from stirring up controversial topics on a regular basis.
Part of the problem lies in the fact that in the White House, which consists of rival factions, people are regularly trying to strengthen their agenda by pushing Trump's materials - which can, but may not be, reliable - that support their view of the world.
The Politico portal, which covered the issue from all sides, published a report on the tendency of advisors to submit dubious information to the head of state in May.
Here is an example of such information from Shane Goldmacher’s pen:
“Current and former Trump officials claim that the president often reacts very furiously to negative media reports, especially news leaks, and seeks to find their origins.
This happened at the end of February when someone leaked to the president a copy of an article from GotNews.com - the website of provocator Charles C. Johnson - that accused staff deputy chief Katie Walsh of being "the source of many leaks of information" from the Dole.
Regardless of the fact that Johnson was forever reported from Twitter for harassment; or that he did not substantiate his claims; or that he had already published false accusations in the past and later dismissed them.
Trump read the article and began to question Walsh.
Goldmacher added that the then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and Secretary of the White House Rob Porter were “trying to implement a system for managing and documenting the information that President Trump will receive.”
Would that work?
Kelly is now, three months later, trying to implement the same strategy.
It may turn out to be a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump’s impulsiveness just won’t go away and his assistants are still competing for power.
These immutable factors Kelly's mission will certainly be burdensome.
Tourists are negotiating for landfill and return to ‘Millionary Quarter’
Several of the most influential homeowners in the English county of West Midland are again deserted in spite of determined tourists negotiating with local authorities the right to regain the field behind their residences.
Tourists parked 20 caravans on the field near a blooming street in the city of Solihull, which is nicknamed the ‘millionaire district’.
Bringing horses, children and an army of caravans, the tourists return after being deported in May. They did not even dig a trench, which was excavated on the spot under the regulations of the authorities in order to prevent their entry.
The tactical group found gaps in the defense and penetrated into the field with an unprotected caravan gap that served the way.
The fugitive residents of Solihull's neighborhood attacked the city's board of directors with a statement saying it was "not able to solve the problem."
One resident, who wanted to remain anonymous, said: ‘They occupy the place on Monday evening after being moved to Bentley Heath Street, where they threw stones at other people.
The Board of Directors should be ashamed of its inability to resolve the problem.
All the tourists were relocated to a different location and now they're back.
Last night there were more, and today there will be more.”
She added: ‘The Birmingham Board of Directors knows how to deal with this problem. It uses court orders to protect parks.
I live in Streetsbrook and I don't want to pay any more taxes until the board of directors deals with tourists."
Another anonymous resident said: ‘It’s ridiculous. We just recently watched the last tourists leaving and now they’re back.
And this time there are even more of them, and this time they brought horses with them.”
Solihull’s spokesman said: “We are aware of the unauthorized stay on the property near Streetsbrook Road and, in cooperation with the local police, we are taking the necessary legal steps to apparently solve the whole problem.
In order to gather as much evidence as possible, it is essential that as many locals as possible report any non-social or illegal behavior of the police at number 101.
We will get the overall picture that we will present to the court.”
A woman’s car crashed in Brussels.
He was brought by a government special.
The government special transported the injured Róbert <0xC5><0xBD>it<0xC5><0x88>ansky to Bratislava on Wednesday afternoon.
Two ambulances were waiting at the airport and on board the plane was under constant scrutiny by Slovak doctors.
The long-planned flight went without complications.
Róbert <0xC5><0xBD>it<0xC5><0x88>ansk<0xC3><0xBD>, according to TV JOJ, had a serious accident in Brussels at the beginning of the summer.
He was hit by a car and has been in serious condition since then.
After being transferred to his homeland, he was transported to a specialized workplace in one of the Bratislava hospitals.
The economic analyst is the husband of Slovak MEP Jana <0xC5><0xBD>it<0xC5><0x88>anské on behalf of NOVA.
She didn't want to comment on the incident.
The couple together have three children.
Italians join the fight against rescue ships of NGOs with migrants on board
Italy has announced that it will prevent the arrival of rescue ships of NGOs sailing to the coast of Italy with migrants from the Mediterranean unless it signs new rules governing their operations.
“If NGOs do not sign the new rules of conduct, it will be hard for us to imagine that they could continue their operations,” Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with Turin daily La Stampa.
Minniti’s warning came a day after Italian authorities seized the ship of the German rescue organization Jugend Rettet on suspicion of trafficking in human beings, which greatly facilitates illegal immigration.
The rescue organization, which operates in its first year, refused to comment on the whole case on the grounds of accusations by Italian state prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosia.
"For us, the number one priority is and always will be the rescue of human lives, so we are very sorry that we are currently unable to operate in the rescue zones," the organization said in a statement on social networks.
“We can only comment on any current allegations after collecting all the information and assessing the whole situation.”
The Italian authorities have been monitoring the Iuventa ship of Jugend Rettet since October.
Her crew is suspected of carrying immigrants on board, which were handed over to them by human traffickers, over and over again.
At least one meeting was reportedly just 1.3 miles off the coast of Libya, according to the prosecutor’s record.
The crew of the ship is suspected of violating the law and circumventing the Italian Coast Guard, which oversees rescue operations in this area – from humanitarian enthusiasm, rather than anything else.
The Code of Conduct establishes the presence of an Italian police officer on board ships such as Iuventa to monitor activities.
Only three of the nine non-governmental non-profit organizations involved in rescue operations have so far agreed to comply with the code: Save The Children, Maltese MOAS and Spanish Pro-Activa Open Arms.
The last-named organization said on Thursday that the new rules are not necessary, but acceptable, as they do not represent any “substantial change or obstacle” with regard to rescue operations.
The adoption of the new code of conduct was also rejected by MSF, which is the recipient of the Nobel Prize.
Minniti, meanwhile, said that the sharp decline of immigrants landing in Italy in recent weeks as part of rescue operations suggests that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast guards and cooperate with local mayors are fruitful.
“In the last few days, we are beginning to see light at the end of the tunnel,” the minister said.
He also revealed plans for further negotiations this month with Libya's mayors on the economic development initiative, as well as with representatives of Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in hopes of reaching Europe.
Unshameable Mesaro<0xC5><0xA1>ová: Silicone and cellulite came from her overlapping!
The hot summer days are quite appealing, to take on only the most necessary, which covers the most intimate parties.
Only Dominika Mesaro<0xC5><0xA1>ova does the opposite.
At an afternoon meeting at the Prague zoo, where actors, moderators, singers and all those who had anything to do with TV Prima, just squeezed their bodywork into a mini overalu.
And just a few ordinary moves were enough, and the model showed everyone her silicones, but also the ass.
Overal, for how many times he had cut her in half, and he had to cut her so high that she had to fix it all the time.
The attention of the gentlemen and the present photographers certainly did not have an urgency.
Michelle Carter Convicted of Sending Text Messages Calling for Suicide by Conrad Roy
A Massachusetts woman was sentenced to two years in prison for inciting her boyfriend to commit suicide through text messages and phone calls.
Twenty-year-old Michelle Carter is sentenced to 15 months behind bars and then spends five years on parole.
Carter was convicted in June of the unintentional murder of Conrad Roy, who took his own life on July 13, 2014.
Roy’s father said Thursday in court: “The whole family is devastated.
My son was my best friend.”
Carter was left free until the decision was made.
She was threatened with 20 years of detention, but her lawyers argued that she and Roy suffered from mental illness.
Dressed in red pants and a cream blouse, Carter stood in the courtroom with tears in her eyes, her hands shaved, and her eyes toward the ground.
“She was murdered by Conrad Roy,” the prosecutor told the judge.
“She ended her life to relieve herself.
She couldn’t take on her own responsibility,” she said.
"She didn't show any hints."
However, Carter’s lawyer said it was “unfortunate circumstances that he was extremely sorry for.”
Judge Lawrence Moniz added that “her age or level of maturity or even mental disorders have no significant impact on her behavior.”
The prosecutor read Roy’s mother Lynn Roy’s statement: “It won’t run a single day so I won’t mourn the loss of my son.
"I want him to be proud of me - I take care of his sister and together we will bear the immense pain that we will bear with us forever," the statement said.
Roy's sister Camdyn Roy has testified that she is "persecuting" her knowing that she will never attend his brother's wedding and will never be his children's aunt.
“The loss of the person I’ve seen since I was born is the pain I’ll carry with me for life,” she said.
The State of Massachusetts does not have a law in force that would enforce a person assisting in the suicide of another person.
Carter was 17 when Roy was found in a car seat poisoned by carbon dioxide in 2014.
The case attracted the attention of the whole nation after the text reports of Carter were published, which prompted suicide.
"Maybe you hang up, jump out of the building, or get down, I don't care," Carter wrote in a text message just two weeks before his death when Roy was on family vacation.
A few minutes before she committed suicide, she wrote to him, “You have to do it, Conrad,” and “You just have to hit the generator and you’ll be free and happy.”
Judge Moniz said Carter wanted attention through Roy's death and ordered her to refrain from any comments in the press.
The case raised a lot of questions.
One of the people who stood by Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted of murdering her British roommate in Italy in 2007. Two years ago, the charges were dismissed.
Ms. Knox, 30, published a statement in the Los Angeles Times: “Michelle Carter deserves understanding and help, not prison.”
Audi to modify up to 850,000 diesel vehicles in response to sharp response
Just a day before the announcement, Audi said it would offer its customers a software update in more than 350,000 vehicles.
BMW said the company believes "there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions" in response to European cities - including Munich, which are headquartered in BMW - that are considering banning or restricting diesel vehicles.
Daimler said on Tuesday that it will regulate three million Mercedes cars across Europe to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies called this decision a withdrawal.
European car manufacturers have largely promoted the use of diesel atomobiles in Europe and the United States to comply with the Carbon Emissions Regulations.
However, nitrogen oxide released by diesel engines is considered carcinogenic and can cause asthma.
At the same time, there is an increase in the cost of automotive installations to neutralize gas emissions from diesel engines, which makes it easier for cars to compete.
While German automakers are facing careful scrutiny, Chancellor Angela Merkel faces charges of smearing powerful automotive companies and ignoring their problems.
The company is trying to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen, which, in an effort to meet the emission limits, installed software in its cars, which reduced the amount of emissions emitted during testing, but under normal conditions, the software was deactivated.
Several senior Volkswagen officials have been charged in the United States and the rest are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, a former head of thermodynamics of the engine development department at Audi would be arrested in Germany.
Former manager Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is of Italian nationality and is not subject to extradition, so he can face trial in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi took part in a criminal investigation by the German police into a Volkswagen car case after authorities accused Audi of installing a system to circumvent European emission limits – expanding the allegations Audi faces in the US.
Audi’s inclusion in the investigation can have a relentless impact on Volkswagen: luxury car manufacturers make a disproportionate share of Volkswagen’s profits.
The plane landed on the beach.
A man and a girl are dead.
The accident occurred on the beach of Praia de São João in the Costa da Caparica area, about 30 kilometers south of Lisbon.
One of the witnesses told the SIC News television channel that the plane flew just above the people who landed on the beach before landing.
Some people from the beach reportedly fled from danger to the sea.
Unfortunately, two people failed to escape from the machine.
A 50-year-old man and an eight-year-old girl died on the beach, according to local media.
"The plane crashed and they were dead on the spot," local police chief Pedro Coelho Dias said.
Their nationality is not yet known.
Two people were on board the plane, both of whom were taken alive from the accident, and the police took them to interrogation.
D11 or how not to build a highway.
Are the motorways in the Czech Republic complete?
I'll give you a puzzle.
It is not available, although it began to be built in 1978.
Even if it's not delivered, it's constantly corrected.
And it can't be built further, even if it has a building permit.
What's that?
Yes, the Castle Highway D11.
The construction of its next section for at least a few months was again halted by the movement of the Children of the Earth.
We, the Easterners, get the highway in pieces, as if we cut salads.
They'll take a wheel and then we'll only see when and if we get another one.
At the same time, we don't want anything miraculous.
We just want to shorten the driving time and we want to get trucks going to Poland or from Poland from villages and cities.
The infinite flows of trucks flow directly through the city of Jarom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99> or Náchod, which is not as reasonable as the object.
But so far, the last section of our dream highway was implemented in 2008, that is, nine years ago.
Not a single word since then.
Therefore, when the remaining four kilometres of unfinished section to Hradci Králová and other sections to Jarom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>e<0xC5><0xA1>i started to be built recently, an archaeological exploration was started with the construction beginning at the end of the year, you could have heard in the eastern Czech Republic.
No one ever believed that anymore.
Last week it turned out that there will be no building this year.
Or maybe next year.
The Children’s Country-Klub Movement for Sustainable Transport from Brno has broken down.
The children of Earth repeat their tactics from D1.
They attacked the building permits decisions on a full scale.
In the breakdown, they request a review of all the binding opinions already issued by all the authorities concerned.
For example, the Castle Magistrate, the Ministry of the Environment, but also the Ministry of Defence or the Dra<0xC5><0xBE>ní út.
So for now, from the D11 we go near a village called Poh<0xC5><0x99>eba<0xC4><0x8D>ka.
So we go downstairs, we just walk along the highway, and suddenly we stand on the side road, and we prefer to then rank in the column.
The worst thing is that you see similar stories all over the country.
An awkward, constantly crowded road to Bene<0xC5><0xA1>ov, D1 or D8.
Everybody has their own funeral.
What do the children of the earth want?
What is the essence of the problems of building communications in the Czech Republic?
And why is it that in the existing system, the highway network is practically incomplete?
Read in the new reflex.
Lavender from Provence threatens climate change
Lavenders have become a symbol of Provence in southeastern France, but are now at risk of climate change.
Lavender is deteriorating due to dry climate and harmful insects, causing fear on the faces of researchers and farmers looking for solutions.
Eric Chaisse, expert at the CRIEPPAM Agricultural Research Institute in Provence, said: “The cultivation of lavender in Provence is under threat because in the last few years this plant has been exposed to climate change, which brings with it less precipitation in spring and autumn.
This affects the longevity of lavender.
It is also the fault of the cycads and beetles that carry micro-bacteria, which succeed in a dry climate.”
There's a lot at stake.
Lavender attracts tourists and the oil produced from them is an important component of perfumes and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: “Instead of long and beautiful flowers, smaller, undeveloped and often weak plants grow.
The amount of oil obtained from these lavenders is, of course, less."
The possible solution can be more efficient distribution of water and slowing water evaporation from the ground, but also spraying of lavender with a protective mixture of clay and water, and the nobility of several species resistant to dry weather.
Assassination of Journalists Emphasizes Rising Threats in Mexico
Riodoce weekly staff meet regularly every Wednesday to discuss news about the unrest in the Sinaloa region with the participation of organized criminals, corrupt officials, and unleashing drug wars.
Today, however, it is meeting under the auspices of recent events mainly for its own safety.
They learn that it is important to change their habits.
Two well-deserved journalists talk about what would be safer: taking their children with them to the office that someone attacked with a grenade in 2009, or leaving them at home.
Security experts wrote three simple words on the blackboard: opponents, neutral and allies.
They ask journalists to give names to every word - no evidence is needed, just use imagination and forethought.
Choosing them out of what - drug dealers, politicians, traders and journalists are suspicious of taking money from the government or drug cartels - a directory of criminals whose task is to cover up criminal acts.
Violence continues and bodies are being carried out across the country; journalists are constantly growing: at least 25 of them have been in power since President Enrique Pena Nietzsche's election in December 2012; 589 journalists have been under the control of the federal government.
Among them is co-founder of Riodioce magazine, editor and inspiration for colleagues, Javier Valdez Cardenas.
“The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and work as a journalist,” Valdez wrote in one of his many books about the violence related to drug trafficking.
Its loss is tangible, although its presence is all-encompassing - large photographs of Valdez with the inscription "Justice", on which the mediator shows, hang in the perimeter of the building; two journalists - Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez - aged over 30 years, have a t-shirt with a t-shirt on the forehead, and a t-shirt with a wrist.
The meeting takes place less than two months after his death; journalists talk about mutual trauma, nightmares, insomnia and paranoia.
Despite the fact that a special federal prosecutor’s office was set up in 2010 to deal with journalist cases, the Committee for the Protection of Journalists has so far sued two suspects.
Most of the thousands of murders that occur every year are linked to drug trafficking and organized crime, and the murder of journalists is so exceptionally common.
Reporters from Rio de Janeiro insist that they will be informed of the violence taking place in Sinaloa; although they are devastated and the territory is currently very treacherous.
Without information about the killers and without a view of justice, the security meeting is pointless, Ibarra says.
“It’s ridiculous to waste time on such meetings,” he adds.
“If we don’t get more information, we can’t trust anyone.”
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the headquarters of Riodo in Culiacan, the capital of Sinaloa.
He managed to escape several blocks when his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men who pulled him out of the car and killed him with 12 shots, according to the title of the article - which can be translated as the Twelve River.
Shooters then entered his car and shot her near the scene of the crime.
Valdez died at the age of 50.
He left behind a wife and two adult children.
It seems that rumors are spreading rapidly in Culiacan.
In Valdez’s case, however, there is a suspicion of silence.
Since last year’s arrest of Guzmán and his January extradition to the United States, Sinaloa has become one of the country’s bloodiest fights as a rival faction tries to fill the vacant spot.
Every day, several people are killed in the streets of Sinaloa and cemeteries are full of double-storey mausoleums for drug kings, many of which are larger than houses.
Forget for a moment that the word “armistice” means that one drug cartel controls the coastal state with precious ports and important routes to the United States of drugs.
Despite, as well as the fact that Valdez was intimately familiar with the risks of his employment, Ismail Bojorquez, 60, the co-founder and director of Riodoce, continues to blame him for not protecting his friend.
They believe that two mistakes contributed to his death.
The first was the February issue of an interview with Damaso Lopez, the leader of one of the rival drug cartels that led the war with the sons of Joaquín Guzmán.
Peace could have angered the sons; the suspected gang members stole all copies of the newspapers at the moment they landed on the counters.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after the seizure of other newspapers in which the same story was printed.
Valdez has become a legend both in Mexico and abroad, and his death is regarded as an important milestone in the fight of Mexican criminals against journalists.
He managed to survive so long, and all his friends and colleagues believed that it would never change.
In the journal Noroeste, he was virtually a veteran when in 2003 he decided to sell his <0x24>50 shares and set up with five Riodoce colleagues.
In Sinaloa, “it was impossible to run a journalist without mentioning the drug trade,” Bojorquez said.
Riodoce gained a good reputation over time for courageous and true news; the news began to prosper.
Journalists liked to search for problematic topics and published texts without censorship - readers were fascinated by reading stories that no one else dared to publish.
Eight years after it was founded, Riodoca won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Award for Latin America Reportage.
In the same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award from the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his bold reports on Mexican drug trafficking.
Valdez openly admitted that he was afraid.
“I was worried about my life,” he said when receiving the award.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa is “a way of life,” Valdez said last October in an interview with Rompeviento TV.
“You have to take on the role of a journalist – or play a fool.
I don’t want anyone to ask me, ‘What were you doing face to face with death... why didn’t you tell me what was going on?’”
The staff of Riodoce misses Valdez. The man was known for his jokes and his non-selective language. He was a good friend who liked to give advice and hugs - a teacher who knew how to survive.
Everyone relied on his daily routine.
He always wore his hat.
He often went to El Guayabo bar in front of offices and sat at the same table.
Now they ask: Did this routine blame his death?
His death in them also raised questions about his own assumptions – how to do his job as best as possible and stay alive?
"They don't like it when you hang out with their wives, children, clean shops, secret landing areas."
“These things were forbidden,” Bojorquez said.
As a result, there is a high level of self-censorship and self-esteem.
You have to trust your instincts.
If you feel that something isn't playing here, get your hands off.
The problem is that, Riodoce editor Andres Villarreal said, “there is a sense that can be confused...and then there was the thing with Javier.”
According to him, the old rules, like the others, no longer apply in Sinaloa - just like in the states of Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states, which are home to a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak governments and corrupt politicians.
The country is constantly changing.
In the room where Riodo employees meet, no mobile phones are allowed; a few days ago, spyware was discovered, which governments bought to monitor Mexican journalists and activists.
In front of the building, two policemen find relief in front of forty-degree winds in the shade of a nearby tree.
They were elected by the state to protect the offices of Riodoca, located in a four-story building in the urban district of Culiacan.
Journalists question whether these police officers are not one of the 50 percent of lawmakers who are corrupt according to the government’s statement.
It’s been a few months since the last time journalists moved to the mountainous areas that are essentially controlled by drug cartels.
There are three main stories on this week’s program.
The first is the murder of the brother of former boxer Julio César Chávez in Sinaloa.
They have also been informed about the suspicious government spending that took place in the home town of the governor of the state.
Recently, there have also been several kidnappings in one of Culiacán’s most luxurious restaurants, just a block from the office of the Attorney General.
Officially, no one announced the identity of the kidnapped people or the circumstances of the kidnapping, so the journalists had to be on guard when they were about to write about what every resident of the city knows: that it is a favorite destination for drug dealers and politicians.
One journalist read from the public records that the restaurant was registered under a name that is associated with a certain politician who is a member of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), controlling all levels of the political scene almost throughout the last century.
Several PRI governors have recently been accused of corruption in high-ranking offices.
Villarreal asked journalists to write about earlier incidents in the restaurant, including an incident in which one of Joaquín’s sons “El Chapo” Guzmán escaped the military intervention unit.
A month ago, readers would read about it in the Valdez section, which was the best source of information about the kidnappings.
“Valdez would certainly solve the case,” said Villarreal, 46, nicknamed ‘El Flaco’ for his slim figure.
“Now all the informants have turned their backs on us.”
Valdez’s office turned into a warehouse of papers and stickers for protests against the killing of journalists. Employees certainly did not expect them to become activists in the media representation.
Journalist Miriam Ramirez got a few notes and went to the office of the state prosecutor for another journalist the following morning.
Salvador Adame disappeared just three days after Valdez’s assassination in the western part of Michoacán.
Only a dead body has been discovered, and authorities say it's based on the DNA analysis of Adame.
The activity of journalists is increasing across the country. Many of them organise protests and sneak on the pedestrians and buildings "SOS press".
The director of the Bojorquez newspaper is on a visit to Washington, where he seeks international support and justice for Valdez’s death.
At a meeting with Governor Sinaloa, held the day after Valdez’s murder, Ramirez accused the authorities of monitoring journalists and their murders for telling the truth.
In the meantime, she asked for a transfer to another department for fear that her anger could jeopardize her impartiality.
Valdez reiterated that Mexican journalists are "obsessed" by organized crime, corrupt officials and an impartial public.
In his latest book, Narco-Journalism, he wrote that journalists are dying not only by the hands of drug cartels, but also on the orders of politicians and security forces who cooperate with organized crime.
The media watchdog Articulo 19 has accused more than half of all attacks on journalists and public officials.
“You’re going to die in Mexico because they want to silence you,” Ramirez added.
The murders obviously work.
No one will forget the death of blogger Marie Elizabeth Macías, who died six years ago at the northern border of Tamaulipas.
Her body was found along with a message allegedly signed by the Zetas cartel: “This is how I ended up with my messages.”
A keyboard and headphones were located next to the unlocked head.
Some branches have decided to shut down activities, such as El Norte newspapers based at the northern borders of the state of Chihuahua in response to the March murder of reporter Miroslav Breach.
The others are still continuing, as did El Manana of Nuevo Laredo after the murder of their director in 2004.
In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed drug cartels with an article on the home page entitled “What do you want from us?”
Some journalists have fled their homes or even across borders.
It's a difficult decision.
Finding a job in expulsion is difficult as well as getting rid of the feeling that someone is constantly chasing you.
And journalists are persecuted and killed, such as in the case of Ruben Espinos, who was murdered in 2015 along with four women in an apartment in Mexico City, three months after fleeing Veracruz.
For those who choose to stay and not give up their jobs, every day is a big risk.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that writing about drugs scares him.
“Mexico is going to hell, that’s why I became a journalist,” he said.
It’s Friday midnight and Riodoce employees sit in the hallway in front of the office — the latest edition sent to the printer — drinking beer when suddenly the phone starts ringing.
It is reported that 19 people were killed in a shooting between gang members and police officers near a beach resort in Mazatlan.
The war is escalating, as promised by many messages left in this area by the members of the syndicate.
Journalists publish this news from their mobile phone on Riodo’s website.
Not a single day goes by and the title changes again.
The sounds of the police sirens point to another shooting.
Bojorquez takes a careful look at the police station to see if they're paying attention.
If they're afraid, they don't make it clear.
Under the huge portrait of their fallen co-founder, whose mediator is a slogan for the entire Sinaloe, all Riodo employees follow his steps.
"How could we just think of leaving," said Bojorquez, "when the same day that Javier was killed, one intern asked me to send her to the streets?"
Dinosaurs used camouflage to avoid enemies
At first glance, it looks like a statue, no matter how scary.
Researchers have now uncovered the conclusions of the first discovery of an amazing creature about the size of a rhino whose perfectly preserved remains — which experts have called ‘Mona Lisa dinosaurs’ — have been found by a Canadian miner.
The remains have been preserved to such a degree that experts have been able to determine the color of the reddish-brown skull and say that the dinosaur had a ‘problem past’.
The article in the journal Current Biology said it was “the most conservative defensive dinosaur ever found and one of the best dinosaurs in the world.”
The dinosaur is a new genus of the family Nodosauridae. Dinosaur lived in the Cretaceous period, about 110 to 112 million years ago.
His perfectly preserved condition was literally shocked by the researchers, who described it as “perfectly remarkable.”
According to National Geographic, the defensive white fox is the best-preserved rock of its kind.
Shawn Funk, who discovered rock on March 21, 2011, drilled in the Suncor Millennium mine near Alberta, Canada.
He encountered something that looked like a foreign object and decided to explore it more closely.
The stone was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
The researchers spent the next six years working to uncover an animal from a huge piece of land weighing 1100 kg.
Upon completion of the work, the dinosaur is ready to be discovered.
"It's enough to close your eyes a little bit and believe you're sleeping," said Caleb Brown, director of the work and naturalist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the animal is exhibited.
“It will certainly be recorded in history as one of the most beautiful and well-preserved dinosaur species – the Mona Lisa dinosaurs.”
By studying his skin, the researchers found that this squirrel - despite being covered in armor and reminiscent of a walking tank - was most likely facing a serious threat from carnivorous dinosaurs.
The heavily defended dinosaur used red and white camouflage to protect against predators and used a masking system that uses many animals today.
Experts claim that it allowed him to blend better with his surroundings and avoid enemies. The masking system suggests that he was a favorite food for larger dinosaurs.
Reports of the 110 million-year-old dinosaur family Nodosauridae first appeared in the papers in May. Currently, it is available for viewing at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
Researchers named him Borealopelt Markmitchell after the museum technician Mark Mitchell, who spent more than 7,000 hours with the team discovering the fossil.
Thanks to the amazingly preserved state of the fossil, Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists were able to document the formulas and shapes of skulls and armor throughout the body.
They discovered the masking method commonly used by today’s animals in defense – the upper part of the animal was darker than its lower part.
Although this masking effect is common in nature, the findings of researchers are surprising, because the size of Borealopeltauva far exceeds today’s animals using the same technique.
It is therefore possible that the dinosaur was such a predator that evolution gave survival preference to masking rather than confrontation.
Many contemporary animals with masking - for example deer, zebra, and or belt - are much smaller and also more vulnerable than the prey, suggesting that the nosodaurus had to literally fight for its survivors.
“The betrayal of a huge and heavily defended dinosaur visually illustrates the dangers posed by predators during the Cree period,” Brown said.
Chemical analysis of the organic components contained in the squirrels also revealed that the skin dinosaurs were likely to have a reddish-brown color.
The researchers continue to study the animal and look for further information about its life, including the retained content of the stomach, to look for its last meal.
They believe that after his death the dinosaur fell into the river and was taken to the sea, where he drowned at the bottom.
In the Alberta region at the time, there was the same climate as in today’s Florida, and rivers and oceans were stretching much further into the interior than it is today.
“This nodosaurus is truly remarkable in that it is completely covered in perfectly preserved spider skin and at the same time it is preserved in three dimensions so we can see its original size,” Brown said.
“For these reasons, the animal looks virtually the same as at the time of the Creation.
You don't have to use your imagination to reconstruct it; just narrow your eyes a little and it seems like he's just asleep."
During the Creation period, giant theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs, moved on two legs, passed through the Earth.
Although the king of all dinosaurs - Tyrannosaurus rex - lived several million years after Borealopeltau, this defensive dinosaur could have been a favorite of his equally terrifying ancestors.
Among them is Acrocanthosaurus, a 11.5-metre-long monster weighing over 6 tons.
Researchers, whose latest findings have been published in the journal Current Biology, believe that the body of Boreal Pellet was floated into the sea after it was mummified in mud.
Shawn Funk, who discovered the fossil on March 21, 2011, during a drilling at Suncor Millenium near Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the world’s best-preserved defensive dinosaur, including skin and armor, which is also complete from the cage to the hip.
The animal reached an average length of 5 meters and weighed up to 1300 kg.
Two 50 cm scissors stood out from his shoulders.
Scientists believe that this white man swarmed the territory of today’s Canada until he ended up in a river that floated it into the sea.
His undersea tomb kept the body in perfect condition.
Fossil residues of this species are also preserved to the extent that the shielded patches around the skull still cover the skin remains.
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, “the finding of such a preserved individual can be compared to winning a lottery.
The longer I watch him, the more shocking the finding seems to me.
Fossil residues of this species are also preserved to the extent that the shielded patches around the skull still cover the skin remains.
On his side lies his right front leg with his fingers upwards.
I can easily count the skulls on his leg."
How did one activist find out the answer to the question, ‘Whose Streets?’
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell shook her entire body.
The day after she arrived in New York, a St. Louis native sat down on her bed in an Airbnb room and browsed Facebook posts on her phone.
She was surprised by the contribution of a high school student.
“The police just shot an 18-year-old boy whose body is still lying on the street,” he said.
She complained that no one else wrote her this post, so she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
Viewing posts from user <0x40>TheePharoah has consistently retweeted her posts on the wall.
A St. Louis rapper tweeted the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old man shot by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He posted a photo of Brown's body lying powerlessly on a street where no one took him for four hours.
“It’s crazy,” Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new for her and her community.
She postponed the phone to return to him in the evening, following tweets about the people gathering at Canfield Drive.
She was following pictures of police tapes and screaming people, one of the men claimed to be the father of the victim and held a notebook in his hand with the inscription "The Ferguson police killed my unarmed son"!
She was watching live news - one of the policemen stood in front of a group of protesters, holding a guide and at the other end of the dog.
In another video, another policeman held a gun in his hand with which he pointed at the crowd and shouted, "I'm going to kill you all... animals."
“That’s not normal,” Ferrell said.
“This isn’t the kind of murder we’re used to and we can call it normal.
I felt the skin tingling all over my body.
“I was angry and I was crying.”
She immediately booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After landing at 23:00, she picked up her six-year-old daughter from her father and decided to move to Ferguson in the morning.
The story of what happened to Ferrell and the city of Ferguson over the next three years describes a new documentary, "Whose Streets?", which will be featured in theaters on August 11.
It’s a story of survival and protests, love and resistance, strength and unbrokenness told from the perspective of people living in the community who go out to the streets and ask for answers.
On the way to Ferguson, Ferrell's dialogue with her daughter - dressed in a floral suit and the same flower headband - introduced a topic that they had discussed many times before - "the experience with blacks".
“Do you remember how I taught you how black people had to fight for what they believed in?” she recalls.
“We’re going to Ferguson right now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that’s not right.”
“It didn’t seem to me that I wouldn’t take it with me,” Ferrell later said.
“Today’s events are the culmination of what has happened in the past.
She had to know and see it with her own eyes and grow up in it.
She needed to develop not only in activism and organization, but at the same time she had to know the difference between the different layers of black experience and what we need to do to liberate ourselves.
Although I am able to provide her with conditions in which she does not experience racism on her own skin, she is in no way different from any other Black child-woman.
I feel that if I were to protect her from this experience, I would only hurt her.”
After arriving in Ferguson, the first stop was South Florissant Road opposite the police department, which became the base for activists who expected Darren Wilson’s words about his possible involvement in the incident.
Here Ferrell met his daughter with a local businessman who was preparing for the rest of the meal.
Together they prepared food in bags and helped distribute it to the Protestants.
In Ferrell’s eyes, a new type of activism began to be born slowly.
“My activism turned upside down after August 9,” Ferrell said, adding that while studying at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, she was president of the Minority Student Nurses Association Assn. and sought to introduce health care and food in the Black Panthers.
“I didn’t have any experience with the organization.
It was natural.”
A few weeks later, during an evening demonstration, Ferrell met the documentary’s later co-director, Sabaah Folayana.
Folayan said he and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to “just document” the ongoing events.
But Ferrell thought, “Are you working on a document or are you trying to find a story that could be used?”
Such skepticism penetrated the community through many people, often white people, who wanted to earn on pain and determination.
As Folayana explained in a recent interview, “We heard that the voices of people who were born and raised in Ferguson are very often neglected and we wanted to change that.”
Folayana has already collaborated with co-director Damon Davis, who is a recognized local artist who deals with the subject of prisoners in the death row.
His involvement in the project was also of interest to Ferrell and six other locals who watched the Whose Streets team in the years following Brown's assassination.
“No one in this document speaks for us, but it’s our confession,” Davis said.
"It was important to me - how these people will be represented - because in the same way I will be represented."
While the document’s goal was not to focus on Ferrell’s experiences – in an effort to show that the movement “is not about the rescue leader, but about the rapprochement of the community,” Folayanova said – it turned out that she is the most open to filming.
The documentary "Whose Streets?" describes a very personal aspect of Ferrell's life, such as how she fell in love with her wife.
“I felt naked,” said Ferrell with a smile on her face as she thought about the first moment she looked at the final version of the document.
“But I realized that in order to do this work and polish the blacks, I have to open myself up.”
Ferrell’s story also highlights the role of a prominent black woman in the broader aspect of the Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement – who created in response to the killing of teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 on social media campaign under <0x23>BlackLivesMatter – call themselves strangers.
“Black outspoken women in leadership positions ultimately stand behind the movement’s preservation,” said Ferrell, “because we are constantly fighting on multiple fronts.
“Black middle-aged women have to endure the gravity of these events.”
Folayanova agrees with this statement, adding that “the movement is actually supported by black women and a large number of extreme black women.”
She insists, however, that "this is not a mere affirmative matter" and Ferrell is not the main protagonist of the document because of her views.
“That was the driving force and the source of energy,” she said.
“It’s not a coincidence that she was in the front lines, because life at these crossroads in the skin of a black stranger woman is dangerous.
You can feel the energy in front of the screen.”
Meanwhile, back in Ferguson, the TV cameras have cleared their position, but the heavy racial bond between the community and the police persists.
Ferrell has been suspending two and a half years for blocking the highway during demonstrations.
The socially political atmosphere in the area, which she called home, was described as "Disorder."
Still, she does not stop in her quest to which she has committed herself from the moment she went to the streets of Ferguson three years ago.
“It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We need to love and support each other.
The only thing we can lose is our chains.”
The field was on fire in Cologne.
Dozens of firefighters came to the scene and a helicopter helped.
Near the <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xBD> Brod in Cologne, between the villages of Bylana and Liblice, a field of about 15 hectares has been set on fire since 14:00.
At around 15:15, the fire ceased to spread, and firefighters declared a third degree of fire alarm out of four possible.
According to spokesman Ladislav Holom<0xC4><0x8D>ík, the fire from the air also helped the helicopter.
At 18:00, firefighters managed to extinguish the fire, causing damage of 700,000 crowns.
Dozens of professional and volunteer firefighters fought with the flames on the ground.
The fire was caused by a technical failure in the engine space of the van.
Hasit was also assisted by a helicopter, which carried out a total of six water sprinklers.
"Instead of the intervention, we handed it over to the owner, until 8:00 tomorrow, he will be guarded by a volunteer fire brigade," Holom<0xC4><0x8D>ík said today.
A Becoming Ressemblance: Artist Creates Portraits Using Chelsea Manning’s DNA
In the middle of one of the rooms of New York's Fridman Gallery is located several faces of different shades of skin - white, black and brown - hanging from the ceiling on the wires. Each of them as if the previous one fell out of the eye.
All 30 portraits were created by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from mouth and hair embroidery sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent her samples from Fort Leavenworth Prison, where the former analyst sentenced her to 35 years for unauthorized publication of secret cables on WikiLeaks.
The new exhibition, which started on 2 August, is called A Becoming Ressemblance.
It is the result of a two-year correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, which combines his experience with technology, information technology, and art, and Manning, a transsexual and pioneering dissident whose sentence Obama reduced three days before his resignation as president of the United States.
By algorithmic analysis of Manning's DNA and using 30 portraits to illustrate what a person would look like with this genotype, Dewey-Hagborg's brainwash, if not an intellectual commentary on the subtlety of DNA - as well as the identities of many other ways of interpreting DNA.
Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward Manning, spoke from her youth about her being considered a woman. She was convicted in 2013 on 20 charges, including violations of six spy laws, computer fraud and theft.
All her photographs were held by the prison staff, and only one black and white photograph of the lower quality escaped in the public eye, on which Manning, visibly concerned, is sitting on the driver’s seat in a platinum blonde pants, with which she is now connected.
In 2015, they still had a positive reaction to the Dewey-Hagborg project of 2012 Stranger Visions.
As part of this project, Dewey-Hagborg used various forensic subjects – such as cigarettes and chewing gum – to create an image of possible images of these people.
And it was at this time that she received an e-mail from Paper Magazine.
“They had an interview with Chelsea Manning in prison and wanted to supplement the article with a portrait,” Dewey-Hagborg explained on the occasion of the opening of the new exhibition.
Visits and photography were not allowed, however, so they turned to Chelsea to ask if she was interested in the DNA of the portrait.
The artist and her imprisoned museum have been scammed for two years through correspondence.
They even created a comic book called Suppressed Images, illustrated by Shoili Kanung, which presented a vision of what would happen if Chelsea were to be loved and could attend the exhibition in person.
President Obama actually asked for the release of Manning a few days after the comic book was released, which was a welcome change after several unbearable years spent in a Kansas military prison.
It’s really interesting that the exhibition is taking place right at a time when Donald Trump is at war with people trying to disclose government information and transgender soldiers, while trying to find new ways of encouraging blockade in areas that he should support.
In response to a question about this particular timing, Dewey-Hagborg stated that “it all happens for some reason.”
Under the statement of the artist on one of the walls of the gallery, Manning calls with her huge signature (the letter "i" in the surname is squeezed out of the heart) after the end of "singular factionism based on sex, race, sexuality and culture".
On the opposite side are the sequences of its mitochondrial DNA - a stack of letters C, G and A recorded with a pencil.
By typing 200 letters (or nucleotides, according to the sophisticated scientific dictionary of the artist), Dewey-Hagborg wanted to illustrate how surprisingly similar, at least biologically, we are all.
“I hope that people will learn that our genome doesn’t matter who we are, and that genetic data is subjective and everyone can interpret it their own way,” Dewey-Hagborg said.
“DNA tells a lot of different stories, that’s 30 of them.”
The last exemplary of the exhibition, located in a separate room, is the only page of the above graphic novels.
It depicts Manning as King Kong from the United States Disciplinary Barracks prison with a megaphone in his hand.
“As soon as it stops you in the speech, they will win,” it says.
“Never be silenced.”
"It's a direct transcript of one of the letters," said the Philadelphia artist.
“When I think about it, my skin is swollen.”
Manning hasn't visited the exhibition in person yet - which was predicted in the comic book - but when that happens, she will be welcomed in the middle of the room with her masks, her own genome imitations, classified as a crowd of Protestants.
This was also the purpose of the exhibition, including the nearly 160 cm tall statue of Maning, on which its genetic haplogroups are recorded with a pencil.
"In the past they were placed on the walls, but this time I wanted to make them feel like a crowd," Dewey-Hagborg said of the portraits.
“I wanted to convey the impression of a mass movement that takes on the form of Chelsea and liberates her.”
Northwestern University Professor and Oxford University Employee Accused of Murder
These days, a nationwide search is underway for a Northwestern University professor and Oxford University staff who are being prosecuted for the murder of a man who was found smashed to death in a luxury Chicago apartment, police said.
A first-degree arrest warrant was issued Monday for the murder of Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, according to the Cook County court record.
The document says Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died as a result of several point injuries.
Chicago police said the body of the deceased was found on July 27.
The police were notified by phone of the incident and found the victim in one of the apartments with several market wounds upon arrival at the Grand Plaza Apartments.
Cornell-Duranleau was declared dead on the spot and detectives are investigating the case as a murder. Meanwhile, police are looking for both suspects, authorities said.
Lathem has been a professor of microbiology and immunology at the Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, vice president of the University for Public Relations, said in an email statement that Lathem is now on administrative leave and was banned from entering the university’s school premises.
“The whole matter is now being investigated by the relevant authorities and the Northwestern University is fully cooperating with them,” Cubbage said.
Warren is an executive financial manager at Oxford University.
A spokesman for the University of Somerville College said in an emailed statement: “The British police have contacted us and we are ready to assist the American police as well.”
The statement also states that Warren's colleagues were shocked by the whole fact and wished he could join the police.
Anthony Guglielmi, the head of public relations at the Chicago Police Department, said he was calling on the suspects to surrender to the relevant authorities.
“The police have information about their whereabouts and the attempt to find the suspects is escalating,” Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi added that local, regional and national authorities were assisted in the search for the suspects.
According to Guglielmi, police received a phone call from the administrator of the Grand Plaza building, who was alerted to the incident that was supposed to take place in apartment no. 1008.
The police described the whole scene as very violent.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident occurred on July 27.
He added that Lathem and Warren were captured by security cameras.
“We believe that Professor Latham knew his victim,” Guglielmi said.
The Grand Plaza executive issued a statement for all residents: “The police are now working on a timeline and victim profile and are investigating various motives, including domestic violence.”
“We will complete WADA plan in the near future” – Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said that it will not take long and that the rest of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) criteria will be implemented and the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) will be re-established.
“At present, some of the criteria of the new plan have already been completed and RUSADA has already acquired the right to plan and test in cooperation with the UK Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD).
In view of this fact, the WADA plan has been updated," Mutko said on Thursday.
The Vice-President commented on the second part of WADA's plan to comply with the code - which outlines the criteria for the renewal of RUSADA - which was recently published on the organization's website.
According to Mutka, the code does not contain anything that should concern Russia.
“Everything has been announced and everything will be implemented.
The results will be available to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future," he added.
One of the aforementioned criteria, however, calls for a public announcement of WADA’s findings, which Richard McLaren investigated, about allegedly sponsoring Russian athletes’ doping by the government.
Mutko said: “We know the investigation because our anti-doping system has obviously failed.
All the measures have been taken.
But there were no state programs in our country and so we can’t admit to something that never existed.”
Vitaly Smirnov, director of the Russian Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission, confirmed Mutko's words.
In an interview with Russian RSport Smirnov admitted the problems of Russian anti-doping agents, but added: “We have stated on many occasions that the report contains controversial attitudes and regulations.
No one intends to accept the report completely without reservations," Smirnov concluded.
WADA suspected RUSADU of conducting doping controls within Russia in November 2015 immediately before the doping scandal.
However, the organization approved the planning and consolidation of testing under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD) in June this year.
After a visit to the WADA headquarters in Moscow in July, WADA Director-General Olivier Niggli said that RUSADA is "on the right track" to renew its validity.
Police have charged three people, one is a juvenile.
Police have accused three men of setting up a fire Wednesday at a rare wooden church in Trinidad-Guatemala in Frydecko-Misteck.
One accused is a juvenile, all three are Czech nationals.
They will be sentenced to up to 15 years in prison for a crime of general threat.
The Moravian Police Director Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Ku<0xC5><0xBE>el told reporters today.
He said it was an intentional crime.
"It's a very fresh matter and the police are currently working on the subject of the whole matter," Ku<0xC5><0xBE>el said.
He said that the police will deal with the possible detention of the accused.
Further information, according to the director, cannot be published.
"I can't tell you much yet, because the criminal police and investigative staff are actually working on the case, and the prosecutor who is overseeing the case," Ku<0xC5><0xBE>el said.
The wooden church of the body of God in Gutach dates back to the 16th century.
It was a valuable monument with many original equipment and paintings from the first half of the 16th century.
Substantial damage will go up to tens of millions of crowns according to preliminary estimates, but the historical loss is incalculable.
After the fire, the church was rebuilt.
Most of the costs should be covered by insurance, the additional costs are ready to be shared with the Ministry of Culture and the City, a public collection is also prepared and is calculated with the contribution of the owner of the monument, i.e. the local parishes.
A similar wooden church of St. Catherine of the 16th century in Ostrava-Hrabova also destroyed a fire fifteen years ago.
This was caused by an electrical fault at the time.
In his place, an exact copy was created.
The state counts with its citizens in the defense of the state.
It will support their training.
With financial support for the associations used in the defense of the state, with a voluntary shooting training or with a team of training trainers, the Act on the Readiness of Citizens to Defend the State counts the practical intention.
The Ministry of Defence, which was given the task of processing it from the government, promises from it that it will be able to increase the physical abilities of the Czechs and their abilities, which could then be used in crisis situations.
This is based on a proposal prepared by the Ministry.
If the law were passed in the future, the state would spend hundreds of millions of crowns to support the order’s defense.
The main objective of the proposal is, according to its authors, to create an effective system that would help to increase the readiness of the population of the Czech Republic to defend the state, beyond the performance of the defence duty and on the basis of voluntary.
For example, the state would financially or materially support associations of radio amateurs, shooters or cynologists and would allow to increase the capabilities of their members.
In return, it would obtain information about people who are willing to come to the country in times of crisis, if necessary, and about their abilities or material equipment.
Accredited instructors could also be available to assist unions and other interested parties in training or training.
It also counts on organizing words with war veterans or people who have behaved heroically.
One possible option assumes that a new office would be created, which would be in charge of the administration and coordination of the project.
The authors of the proposal stress that people should be involved voluntarily and the state would use their capabilities only after the state of threat is declared.
"The whole concept must respect the gradual blurring of the previously obvious boundaries between the different types of threats," it said, referring to the dangers of so-called hybrid threats.
Ministerial officials noted that, therefore, it is necessary to focus on supporting as wide abilities as possible, not just those of the military.
"The basic aim of the intention is to create a very broad base that will allow every citizen to respond qualifiedly to situations threatening the sovereignty of the state or the lives, health and property of persons, to protect themselves, if necessary, to contribute to the protection of others, and to prevent misconduct by the Republic."
The adoption of the law would lead to minor financial claims.
The above will depend, according to the Ministry, on the chosen variant.
For example, the Office expects financial support for projects to prepare citizens for the defence of the state up to 100 million kroner.
If an administrative and coordination centre were set up, its operation could cost around SEK 60 million per year.
Further money would be spent on salaries or on building an information system.
The proposal also specifies that the scope of regional military commanders should be expanded, which would employ 42 more soldiers together.
Ministerial representatives said earlier that the law should also help resolve the disagreement of some Czech politicians with the introduction of the European Union directive on the possession of weapons.
Its adoption would allow shooters, who will be part of the system, to keep some of the weapons announced by the directive.
Startups that will help your company not become the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure the level of satisfaction of the employees of her e-commerce startup, but did not find the appropriate survey.
The answers were often inaccurate, useless, or even misleading.
And despite promising the anonymity of the survey, some employees expressed their distrust throughout the process.
“I was looking for consistency and objectivity,” said Errett, owner of e-commerce company Madison Reed, based in San Francisco, which employs 75 people.
So she asked for outside help.
New human resources start-ups are constantly emerging on the market, helping companies with employee satisfaction surveys.
By creating and licensing software with the specific intention of measuring employees' obligations, they allow startups to perform quick voting, target specific teams and demographic groups, and offer complete anonymity to the employees, and provide a hot line of information for the employees.
“There are tools like Strava and Fitbit on the market that monitor your health, but where is Fitbit for your company?” said Jim Barnett, co-founder and CEO of Glint’s Reedwood City startup.
Errett said that thanks to Glint, she gained more awareness of what her employees think and feel in three years’ time.
In addition to quick surveys and voting by specific teams, Glint offers a company temperature map and a regular overview of the groups with the highest number of complaints, as well as an overview of managers with low ratings – allowing users to work on the correction.
Companies are beginning to realize that it is necessary to take care of the culture of the work environment - in case it would become another Uber - which is confused in scandals after a former employee posted a blog post describing the company's environment, harassment and harassment.
For startups like Glint, the demand for corporate culture surveys is a lucrative business opportunity.
According to the website Let’s Talk Payments, which deals with technical and financial progress, the value of the global control, regulation and compliance sector may exceed <0x24>118.8 billion by 2020.
The Denver-based startup Convercent, which helps companies to prevent and detect inappropriate behavior, saw a slight increase in interest and activity at the beginning of the year, just before the Uber scandals.
Almost 600 Convercent customers include Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber has also been under its wing.
Just like Glint, Convercent allows companies to send customizable “flash” surveys, collect confidential information in real time, and display temperature maps of problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous text hotline that allows employees to report inappropriate behavior.
If the Director-General is involved in the problem, complaints are sent directly to the Board of Directors.
“The Court of Public Opinion has authorised regulators,” said Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of Convercent.
If the company is convicted of mishandling its employees or of unethical behavior – and if the regulators do not act – it can face costly consequences as a result of customer boycott, employee exhaustion or legal proceedings, Quinlan added.
Ruby Tuesday’s restaurant network, which employs over 25,000 people across 500 locations, has been using Convercent for more than a year to raise employees’ awareness of corporate policies and procedures and ensure an easy way to contact corporate management.
Earlier, if the employee wanted to report any problem, he had to check the phone number or e-mail to the company’s management, officially file a complaint and hope for a viable solution.
It was often a daunting and unpleasant experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby’s attorney general, Tuesday, according to which there was no previously reliable way to monitor employee complaints.
Now that the company is using Convercent, it ensures quick detection and resolution of problems that have never before been reached by managers sitting in offices, miles away from real complaints solution - such as discrimination, harassment or unfairness.
“This is approaching a holistic, overall perspective on employee experience,” said Vitrano, who leads Ruby Tuesday’s Risk Management Group.
“At the same time, we are protecting shareholders from legal disputes on the part of employees.”
“Companies stopped taking a lightweight employee’s ethics, values and participation in 2002 after accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed following Enron’s fall in the abuse of employees’ ethical rights,” Quinlan said.
But it was only after “you’ve been enlightened to the whole thing on social media,” that companies began to realize that in the online world they can’t simply hide their skeletons in the closet.
“Before people began to use technology to monitor ethics, they relied on faith,” Quinlan added.
Glint and Converter offer their software in the form of a service for which companies pay regular fees.
It is a business model and an opportunity approved by bold equity investors who have supported both startups.
As part of his February campaign, Convercent picked up <0x24>10 million from companies like Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, and eventually took a <0x24>47 million capital.
Glint earned <0x24>10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners in November and <0x24>60 million during the entire campaign.
These investments are hardly surprising given the mutual nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
The growing number of researches clearly confirms that today’s employees expect more from their workplace than ever before.
And in competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high wages and interesting projects are not the main advantage.
Employees want to realize that they are accepted and appreciated and that they devote their time to a company that strives for a positive mission.
“When people are happy with their work, they feel that their voice is heard, and that their work is rewarding, they are striving for the success of the company,” said Nina McQueen, vice president of global benefits and employee benefits at LinkedIn, which uses iConvert.
Investors earn if the company benefits and the company thrives if its employees are satisfied.
And when the market comes up with an analytical tool that ensures employee engagement and commitment to the company, it’s no wonder that there are a lot of investors to support this endeavor.
According to experts on work culture, it is important to have data on employee satisfaction.
But the data itself is endless unless the company takes the necessary steps.
The fact is that as soon as a company requests feedback from its employees, major changes can occur.
And if the change does not happen quickly - in the worst case at all - it can cause disappointment and disinterest of employees.
“As soon as you ask for 4,000 opinions, you need to be ready for 4,000 conversations,” said Russell Raath, Counseling Director at Kotter International, who has witnessed many companies relying too much on data.
“Because as soon as you don’t get things done, employees start to ask themselves, ‘Have they ever heard me?
They're interested in me?
And if not, then why should it interest me?"
Madison Reed, which now conducts a monthly employee survey, is able to solve the problem within one day thanks to Glint, Errett said.
After gathering feedback from employees who were frustrated with slow decision-making and communication quality, Errett was able to reorganize several teams within the company and start communication training to solve the problem.
Ruby Tuesday is gaining a very important view of its employees and hopes that in the long run it will achieve high employment in the industry, which is known by frequent dismissal.
“If you’re not committed to creating a transparent work environment, employees won’t trust you,” added Vitrano.
“And once you start losing employees, you lose customers.
And with the influx of customers, the whole society collapses.”
Thursday was the hottest day.
Thursday is the warmest day of the year in the Czech Republic, with 38.3 degrees recorded in the Guard in Hodoninsk.
It was the warmest day of the year, with 37.3 degrees.
This was reported by the staff of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
However, compared to Tuesday on Thursday, there were not many temperature records.
Vedra mainly affected Moravia, in the Czech Republic it was mostly cloudy.
On Tuesday, records were exceeded or leveled at 35 of 145 meteorological stations measuring over 30 years.
On Thursday, the record was only nine long-term measuring stations.
For example, today's temperature was the same as the previous record of 2013.
In Lednica in B<0xC5><0x99>eclavsk today, the original maximum exceeded 37.4 degrees by four decades and in Pohorelice in Brno, the current 37.1 degrees exceeded the record by three decades.
Both records, as with the Watchtower, came from 2013.
High temperatures today appeared mainly in the south and east of Moravia.
After the Guard, the biggest heat was in Dyjakovic in Znojemsk and Brod nad Dyjá in B<0xC5><0x99>eclavsk, where mercury rose to 37.8 degrees, but it did not exceed the record.
In contrast, for example, in western and northwestern Czechoslovakia, the highest temperatures so far were only about 22 degrees Celsius.
"The temperatures started to rise there until now later in the afternoon," the meteorologists said.
According to <0xC4><0x8C>HMU, the current rainfall in the Czech Republic will gradually deteriorate and more heavy rains could come on Sunday.
In most parts of Moravia, however, high temperatures will remain on Friday and in the southeast of Moravia on Saturday.
There's such a mess in here.
Billionaires don’t get the same vote in elections as every single adult in the country.
They want to decide directly, and because not everyone is as reluctant as Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1>, who wants to own the state, they buy political parties.
The owner of Penty Marek Dospiva, along with other colleagues behind the water Martin Burda and Antonín Fry<0xC4><0x8D>, sponsors the Realists of Robej<0xC5><0xA1>ka.
The second life of the Civil Democratic Alliance is financed by the owner of the insurance company and the entrepreneur in the realities Pavel Sehnal, who is also the chairman of his party.
The convicted corrupt and king of Czech gambling Ivo Valenta acquired the Party of the Privates.
The political movement Agrofert, as the project of Andreje Babi<0xC5><0xA1>e did not want to be named by the mayor of Krom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice, Jaroslav N<0xC4><0x9B>mec, is a chapter for himself.
The billionaire was also recently captured by the mayors.
It is Dalibor Grandfather, the owner of the company on Jablotron security equipment.
In his own words, he enters politics in order to do good.
But Grandpa's entry into the mayor's suit was not very successful.
"I've never dreamed of small goals," he said at a press conference.
That is, my goal is to make the Yes Movement, to make the Mayor's Movement win twenty percent in the election.
Leckdo is ugly.
My grandfather's conviction is rather symptomatic.
Billionaire Dalibor Grandpa is a man of strong opinions.
Although he intends to apply for votes in the Electoral Council, he continues to support Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1>.
My grandfather supported Grandma in the last parliamentary elections.
"Babi<0xC5><0xA1> is not a shot speaker and will not rule the libelous rhetoric of political snakes," he wrote about him before the 2013 election.
But he certainly doesn’t go into politics because he wants to improve himself.
For me, Grandma will remain a hero.
He is willing to step out of his world that is under control and do something for all of us.
Shortly after the Mayor presented it as a new reinforcement, he re-acknowledged his admiration for Grandma.
And he said he wants the Mayors to learn how to imagine possible cooperation with Grandma.
Some may appreciate that Grandpa does not change his mind and is behind him no matter what kind of shirt he is wearing.
Others may speculate that Babi<0xC5><0xA1> sends to the Mayors to build his nest for someone so immature.
Others may ask whether Jablotron's boss, for example, hasn't broken up with Agrofert's boss in the mall and is not looking for another way to defend his business rival.
But Grandpa’s first public performance was not just about Grandma.
Grandpa promised to send the mayors ten million kroner for the campaign.
And if they say they need more money, send more.
A few years ago, it would be hard for anyone to stop a similar statement.
By the way, court-recognized gauner Zden<0xC4><0x9B>k Bakal distributed millions to all parties before the 2010 elections.
The political division of the security agency Víta Bárta, TOP 09 and civil democrats have gathered at least thirty million.
But today is a different time.
The law prohibits any political party from giving more than three million dollars.
When Grandpa is in politics, you could at least study the rules of the game.
Maybe you shouldn’t ask why politics has such a bad reputation with us.
His first days in politics were crowned by the Grandfather with a proposal for tax benefits for families with studied children.
People with high school education come to us about 50,000 a month.
You're basic on less than 20.
A man of fifty thousand is rich in the circumstances of this country.
The poor man of twenty.
In D<0xC4><0x9B>dko’s vision, the poor pay taxes honestly and the rich enjoy the benefits of the functioning of a social state, in which they do not participate too much.
In short, the rich need to help them not to deal with misery.
The mayors can congratulate each other on their new acquisition and Babi<0xC5><0xA1> will raise their hands.
The rest of us, thanks to Grandpa, can confirm that billionaires are not good people.
There is still the question of who to vote for.
For me, those who know the rules of the game and want to follow them.
Those who are members and members of their party or citizens of the state do not have for their employees and country for their property.
And finally, those who want to live well in a rich country for all people, not just some.
No one wants Trump’s paradise.
The villa complex must have discounted by 234 million.
Selling a property is sometimes not easy.
And often it won’t even help him 11 bedrooms, a magnificent sea view, or the fact that the property is being sold by US President Donald Trump.
When the villa complex Le Chateau des Palmiers was sold, the price went down by an incredible <0xC2><0xA3>8 million.
Informed about this web Mirror.co.uk.
The pamphlet reads, "Hello, Donald J. Trump."
Escape to a place like no other.
But even the association of the real estate company with the U.S. president did not promote an extreme price tag.
Donald Trump had to cut the price of his Caribbean headquarters by <0xC2><0xA3>8 million.
The original price of the property was <0xC2><0xA3>21.5 million, the final price fell to <0xC2><0xA3>13 million.
Even after the discount, the villa complex costs about 76 average apartments in the center of Prague.
And there's no wonder.
The stunning 5-acre residence on the Caribbean island of St. Martin has 12 full-fledged bathrooms, 11 bedrooms, many dining rooms, gym and other rooms.
It consists of several buildings.
The property also includes a swimming pool and a tennis court.
Dozens of palm trees are planted on the ground.
From the terrace there is a wonderful view of the sea.
According to real estate experts, the price showed the fact that a connection with the president is not enough to attract potential buyers.
The property is now closer to the normal prices of property on the island.
Trump bought the property in 2013.
According to speculation, he paid about <0xC2><0xA3>15 million.
The property had to be bought for rent.
Le Chateau des Palmiers was the most expensive property on the island of St. Martin.
With the new price, however, he ranks second.
The property in the neighbourhood was valued at <0xC2><0xA3>13.5 million.
The NCAA has decided to finish two training sessions a day. Long days are coming for the Bruins
The eleventh in the morning is approaching and American football players at UCLA University are chatting at the sidelines of the new school playground.
Some of them are wearing shirts and revealing a sweaty back, a staggering sign of the first day of training camp.
For most members of the team these few minutes, no-working takes a lunch break.
Players enrolled in the summer semester will go to the rooms after a three-hour training session to study for the final exams before returning to the Wasserman Football Center for a meeting that will take place the next morning at 6:30 a.m.
"For these guys, the next three days will be a good kick," Bruins coach Jim Mora said just before Monday's kickoff.
By excluding two training sessions in one day, the NCAA wants to ease the players – paradoxically, the training days are even longer – at least until Friday, when the final exams are over.
That’s why the first three UCLA training sessions are scheduled at 19:15 – to fit into the already so crowded diaries of many students.
For the first time in the six seasons Mora has spent as a coach in Westwood, the Bruins training camp starts a week earlier than last year and training is limited during the summer semester. It also has an impact on the decision to limit the number of trainings to one day.
A total of eighteen training sessions are scheduled for August 20, starting with formal preparations for the first game against Texas A&M, which will take place in September.
He must have heard that he supports the NCAA decision, despite adding another item to the already loaded player diary.
“Three or four days are the players under a lot of stress and it’s very exhausting for them,” Mora said.
“But no one gave up, everyone is trying. They’re great.
I think on Saturday, when we have more time, everything will calm down.”
UCLA will be closed after the end of the training camp, which will not be easy when you look at the clear line of surrounding land from the nearby parking lot and the luxury Luskin Center hotel, which was occupied by players after harvesting the protective net behind the bar.
Bruins players are expected to occupy the hotel as of this week, but Mora admits that once the rooms are empty during the season, there could be a problem.
“The land will be overseen by the security service,” Mora added.
“Safety is taken care of, but it is not excluded that someone can rent a room and record our training.
This kind of material is well traded.
Fortunately, the hotel will guard the security guard, as well as the parking lot No. 8.
We will make the most of our resources.
I'm sure everything will be fine.
Everything is planned.”
Facebook Plans to Take More Fact Checks to Limit Fake Messages
Facebook will send more potentially fake articles to third parties and display findings under the original posts in an effort to fight the so-called “fake news,” the largest social network said on Thursday.
The company says in a statement on its website that it will start using up-to-date machine learning to detect potential hoaxes, which it will send to third parties to verify and potentially display survey results under the original posts.
Facebook has been identified as one of the main sources of fake news, and many believe that these unconfirmed news influenced last year’s presidential election.
In Europe, political debates are taking place. French voters are flooded with a plethora of fake news about the May presidential election, and Germany plans to impose a fine on the social media network in advance of the September election if it does not rush.
Facebook on Thursday said in a further statement released in Germany that it is launching testing a new fake news control feature in the US, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
“In addition to displaying third-party verified messages, people are asking for more content to be better informed and be able to make the right decisions about what they can share,” Facebook’s product news manager Sara Su said on her blog.
She added that Facebook continues to test the “related articles” feature and is also working on further changes to reduce the number of fake messages.
Creating a Graphic Novel: A Story of A Castle in England
The small castle of Scotney Castle recently starred in Squeeze's music video, and Margaret Thatcher also found her refuge in it during the 1970s and 1980s.
However, Scotney witnessed 700 years of turbulent history from his cozy Bewl River location in Kent, UK, that inspired the squirrel Jamie Rhodese of York County – a popular preference in historical documents – to create a graphic novel.
“Looking at the font of a man 300 years after his death fascinates me,” says Rhodes with a serious face.
“When I hold a letter in my hand, I feel a personal connection.”
The graphic novel A Castle in England documents the life of families who lived at Scottney Castle from the Middle Ages to the Eduardian period. Each story is illustrated by a different British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
However, it is not Rhodes' first book inspired by archives: he is also the author of Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories (2014), a collection of British Library inspired documents - a project that was very emotional for him.
“He gave me a fingerprint on a letter written by a double agent in the 1970s who worked for Jacobity,” he said.
“That’s his fingerprint!
And the letters always smell like smoke, because in those times you had to light a candle to read.
When I get to the letter now, 300 years later, it's like I'm back in time.
“I love the archives!”
For someone who is so fascinated by old papers, the support from the National Trust and Arts Council England and the opportunity to stay almost four months in the castle is almost like a dream.
Rhodes spent time exploring the Victorian "new" castle, browsing the archives, and studying many treasures and curiosities, such as the head of hyena on the wall and bottles that had been buried in the dungeon for centuries.
He wandered around the land and explored the ruins of the old castle, talked to gardeners, gardeners, and sometimes to artists who worked on illustrations for his book.
He drank whiskey and wrote.
The confidential history of Scotney is relatively largely unknown, as the National Trust did not gain access to documents until 2006 after the death of the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey.
When Rhodes arrived in place a decade later, the employees had only begun to penetrate the archives, which Rhodes described as "as aristocrats for many centuries spread the words: 'Take it to the attic'."
Journals, letters from the time of the British Empire, maps depicting property: "You may think the land dispute is boring," said Rhodes, "but I encountered one case where two families were retiring on the brink.
Let go of the people!"
Some of the stories in the book use the castle as a reflective bridge and dig deeper into English history, including a story called The Labourer, which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the English uprising of 1381.
“I found a record of the 1380 uprising in the castle, which was called the Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex,” Rhodes said.
“The English uprising actually started in this area and I thought the uprising was a good starting point.
Maybe in the end it’s connected.”
Other stories are closely related to the history of the castle – for example, The Priest, which tells the story of a Jesuit priest who was hidden by Darrell’s family after seven years during the English Reformation.
Or The Smuggler about an 18th-century smuggler named Arthur Darrell, who allegedly painted his own funeral when he filled a rocket of stones (which was discovered only a few years later after the discovery of the box).
Rhodes’ favorite family are Darrel’s: “I was satisfied with the male generation—the men of that time were always indebted and spent money on things they couldn’t afford.
The different generations of the Darrell family have solved this by marrying rich or old panties — I imagine they were the kind gentlemen who liked to shake the heads of the heirs.”
With the end of his stay at the castle, Rhodes is looking for further adventures.
Recently, he returned from a two-week-long steak in the Finnish wilderness, where he was inspired by his next book about Elmänmäki, a former sanatorium from the early 20th century that was absorbed by nature.
This is a special place for Scotty.
“I was sad when I left,” he said.
“I thought, ‘Now I want to go back to real life.’”
Washington Changes Green Card Grant Terms
The media has released President Donald Trump’s words about the new U.S. immigration plan, which will also change when granting the green card.
The number of legal immigrants is expected to decrease by 50,000 annually as a result of stricter rules on temporary work visas and restrictions on family visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and the President.
The bill will soon be submitted to Congress.
“This law will reduce poverty, increase wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers, and we will achieve this by changing the rules for issuing green cards to residents of other countries.
The law will limit the number of immigrants and replace the current scheme.
“The new application process will prefer English-speaking applicants who are influencing financial resources and demonstrating abilities that will benefit our country,” Trump said in a statement.
Sexual robots are on the rise - we should be on the lookout
Just as it seemed that 2017 could not be more bizarre, a report on the technological development of sex robots will appear on the Internet.
Yes, I do.
Sexual robots are very popular at the moment.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently released a statement on the development of sexual robots over the next five to ten years.
According to former Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at Sheffield University and co-founder of FRR Noel Sharkey, the rise of sexual robots should be taken seriously.
Customers can choose the color of the eyes, the form of the warts and the appearance of the robot’s nails.
“People are pulling out of them, but sales are growing and we need to be prepared to see them more and more often,” Sharkey said in a statement.
Modern sexual aids turn from inflatable pans to robotic women with silicone skin, which is pleasantly warm to the touch - of course, artificial intelligence that mimics a man's behavior.
The user can "adjust" the robot to his image - from the color of the eyes and form of the wart to the appearance and color of the nails.
However, it is very worrying that many robots have their own “personality” that would embarrass the Stepford Panic.
Modern inflatable virgins developed into robotic women with silicone leather.
The owner of the RealBotix robot can set a variety of character traits to his replacement wife, including shyness.
And then there’s the sexual robotic woman Roxxxy Gold from True Companion, which comes with pre-programmed personalities, including “Frigid Farrah,” which is characterized by a shy character and “wild Wendy” with a “good-natured” character.
“Roxxxy Gold’s personality is set to suit your personality as much as possible,” the company’s True Companion website says.
He likes what you like and vice versa.
She's in a mood, just like people.
It can be tired, talkative, or “in a mood.”
The rise of sexual robots is alarming right away for a number of reasons - among which there is no confusion for real interpersonal relationships. Worried are rather subordinate female character traits and violent attacks - e.g. frigid (read resistant) Farrah.
True Companion on its website resembles Roxxxy as a vibrator for men.
“If a woman can have a vibrator, why can’t she have a Roxxxy husband?”
However, sexual robots are not just fetishes or sexual aids.
Their origin and almost perfect sophistication point to something darker and deeply rooted in our culture – a deviation from ideal or gender equality towards the desire for submissive sex with an optional attachment.
Of course, most men don’t buy a robotic woman and while FRR talks about their growing popularity, sexual robots still remain on the edge of the general public’s interest.
However, this marginal interest can become a mirror set by the modern era.
And most people aren’t weird or violent until they’re skeptical of the free market.
It is no coincidence that these sophisticated sexual robots emerge at a time when women around the world are gaining their rights, and in the White House, a president who often expresses himself very shamefully to women.
The most terrifying aspect of The Story of the Servant is not what we see - hanging bodies and weakened eyes, as the reality of these visions.
The maid's story book template is a step in the right direction, but at the moment it seems to be a small step.
Sex robots should be as much like real women as possible (although with pornography rates).
Their creators design them so that they are pleasant to the touch and act at first glance as a real woman.
But when it comes to their “personality,” the robot cannot replace a real woman.
They can’t break up with their partner or just leave.
They have no work or history, nothing that would induce their independence or interfere with their loyalty to their Lord.
In other words, they are pleasant slaves.
The 21st Century: Serving.
The NBA star on the green pasture.
Curry is fighting for a cut in California.
Star basketball player Stephen Curry did not lose, despite the shattered first shot at the premiere start among professional golfers.
The double winner of the NBA award for the most useful player played at the Ellie Mae Classic Lower Series Web.com Tour in California’s Hayward First Round of 74 and will fight for a cut.
Golden State, who won a second NBA title with the Warriors this season, started very nervous and his first shot ended up in a drink holder in a golf cart parked at the fairway.
Even then, he was not as accurate among the holes as under the basketball basket, yet he left a dozen professionals behind with a balance of four wounds over the pair.
"It wasn't the ideal way to get started, you had to call the referee right after the first shot, but then it got a bit sad," Curry said with a huge tremor falling on him.
It was very nervous to kick off the first morning of the tournament, but it was all I hoped for.
"If you told me I would play 74 in the first round, I would take it right away," he added.
If Curry manages to break through with a cut that is likely to be set for two shots under a pair, he will become the first representative of another sport to do so on the Web.com Tour.
"I want to play better next time and now that I've gotten rid of the tremor, I think it's going to work," said the enthusiastic golfer, who has already played in celebrity tournaments and mixed competitions for amateurs and professionals in the past.
He starts in Hayward for the first time in a tournament that falls under the PGA.
To participate in the Ellie Mae Classic, he was granted a sponsorship exemption and retained amateur status.
The Web.com Tour Series is a category under the elite PGA Tour.
Trump's big victory?
In contrast, Mitt Romney is the embodiment of common sense.
An unmistakable sign of Trump’s era is political turmoil that divides American voters and also disrupts entire families on a microscale.
During the Christmas and Thanksgiving period, the U.S. newspapers had tips on how to deal with relatives who chose Trump.
We're just supposed to wait until our nerves allow us.
However, less attention is paid to Trump’s ability to stifle the family.
I'm talking about it because this week my cousin, a poet and left-wing fan who lives in Chicago and paid for a Republican fool in our family for a long time, visited me in New York City.
She reminded me that the facelessness in the face of a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
Now, with Trump in the White House, all of a sudden, the whole family — including all the Republican siblings with whom she has been harassed for years — is in one wave.
It is a good thing to have dinner at the family table; but I am shocked that in the wider context it poses a significant risk.
Trump is strengthening the left, but the negative effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.
When we talk about “normalization” and Trump, we refer to the scary possibility that his chessboards may one day lose their attractiveness.
However, there is an even more terrible long-term scenario in which Trump “normalizes” right-wing Republicans who, contrary to his standards, will suddenly embody what can be called rational.
In these today with nostalgia in my heart I remember Mitt Romney and his version of crazy behavior - a dog on the roof of a car, 14% tax on income (at least we were aware of his tax confession) - of which both examples look in comparison to Trump's comparison as great.
After Trump’s departure, it would be enough for the next Republican candidate to be at least normal, which would be a huge improvement.
We used the visits of my cousin and took the children to Central Park to the largest park department that runs the New York Parks - for its <0x24>3 you won't find a better use unless you need caffeine.
Horses are huge, the middle cylinder is covered with glazing - clowns and animals are filming and horrified looking at their own shoulders - a completely cloudy view and zinc-plated music reminiscent of public transport.
Many clichés will soon be confused: a view from high-rise buildings, a panorama sweeps, a place to breathe an atmosphere and the reality of the city does not reach your imagination.
Thirty-five years later, I still didn’t move on to the fact that Swiss Cottage isn’t really Swiss cheese – it doesn’t count on the thematic Ye Olde Swiss Cottage – but the London metro station.
The cycling in Central Park, however, creates a remarkable magical experience, to the extent that two two-year-old children, as well as two mature women, will have great fun on it.
If I could rate the scooter, he would deserve the maximum of points, but fortunately no one is asking.
This week I had a similar experience in the store when I was asked to rate my “experience” on a scale of one to five when paying by credit card.
In the cafeteria on the corner of my street, it's the same, with the difference that I can come up with a 15% discount for something I buy behind the counter.
Not only will it slow down the otherwise fast sales, but the waiter is thus forced to quarrel with the tender buyers when it is not needed.
A woman in the store apologized to me with a smile when I reluctantly evaluated my five-star credit card transfer.
Oscar Pistorius was transferred from prison to hospital for chest pain
This is the second time Pistorius has been taken to the hospital.
Last year, he was treated for cutting wounds on his wrist, which, according to a prison statement, caused him to fall into a cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after appealing against the original murder sentence.
His girlfriend Steenkampova was killed early in the morning on Valentine's Day 2013 by several gunshot wounds through the toilet cabinet door of his Pretoria home.
Pistorius claimed to have misled her with a thief.
The prosecutors announced their intention to appeal again, this time against the six-year sentence of Pistorius, which they say is too mild.
The National Prosecuting Authority said it will appeal to the South African Supreme Court and the trial will take place later this year.
In the event of success, Pistorius will be sentenced to 15 years.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
For the first time in her history, she gave birth to a captive panda who was stranded in the wilderness.
The Panda Rescue Program is a huge success.
The center is trying to expand the genofond pands held in captivity.
An employee of the center, Chang Chung, told the New China agency that the breeding of panda is at high risk from the kinship crossing.
At the end of last year, there were only 471 pandas.
In the wild, there are only 2,000 of them.
Trying to let the captured pandas tie with the wilds is thus the first step towards helping the breeding of the pand to protect this species.
The 15-year-old Cchao-cchao was released into the nature reserve at the beginning of the pandy pairing period on March 11.
Thanks to the tracking device on the neck, scientists were able to observe every step of it.
Cchao-cchao met her chosen one 12 days later.
Sexual intercourse with the male panda lasted a minute and a half and ended successfully.
Even this can be considered a small miracle, because pandas males are not considered to be the most successful lovers of the animal kingdom.
Males relatively poorly estimate the time when the female is ready, in addition, they are often confused and do not know what to do.
The young was born healthy and, even since Chao-chao had an extraordinary appetite during pregnancy, weighed 216 grams after birth.
The average weight of a newborn panda is 70 grams lower.
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced the detention of two Bulgarian tourists in Greece for illegal camping, a statement quoted BTV as saying.
A group of tourists, including two Bulgars, were detained on August 1st in the morning by the Sithonic police.
All were released on the same day, but the investigation continues.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs told bTV that Bulgarian tourists were later released.
The Greek authorities have tightened the rules of free camping and impose strict fines on anyone who is landed in a place where camping is not allowed.
The inspections will take place throughout the season.
The Ministry said the court could impose a fine.
After the first round of the British Open, Spilk is in 50th place.
Golfer Klara Spilkova plays the first round of the major British Open in the split 50th place.
The playground in the Scottish Kingsbarns was scored one hit under the pair when she played three birdies and two bogeys.
The twenty-two-year-old Czech player is so hopeful that she will go cut for the first time on the famous major.
The <0x24>3.25 million grant was awarded to American star Michelle Wieva, who won the first round in the record-breaking 64 runs, eight under pairs.
Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands are removing millions of toxic eggs from the market.
The Netherlands itself has temporarily closed 180 poultry farms due to the incident.
The Dutch Food Safety Supervisory Authority (NVWA) said it is investigating 20 percent of all Dutch poultry farms, meaning 80 percent of the eggs on the market are inexpensive.
The Authority stressed that the risk represents only a limited number of egg types recognizable by specific numbers.
According to the German authorities, the amount of toxic substance in eggs is small and does not pose a danger to adults, but it is a potential threat to children.
Czech SVS spokesman Petr Majer said that eggs and chickens from the Netherlands and Belgium, where authorities also joined the closure of farms, have not recently migrated to the Czech Republic.
However, veterinarians have taken mollusc samples of eggs and chicken meat originating in Belgium, the Netherlands, France, Italy, Germany and Poland, in which there have been problematic insecticide markings on the markets.
Eggs from Belgium were last placed on the Czech market in April and eggs from the Netherlands last in May, according to veterinary reports.
In the Czech Republic, chicken was introduced for the last time in June.
In the Czech Republic, however, there is a certain amount of chicken from the Netherlands.
Fipronil is a substance that is part of the anti-blister, all-in-one and fungus medicines.
However, it must not be given to animals whose meat is consumed by humans.
The World Health Organization (WHO) considers the preparation to be mildly toxic.
Its high doses lead to a feeling of nausea and dizziness.
Riga is gorgeous, I will miss it, says the goalkeeper Settler and is looking for engagement.
I'd like to catch another ten years.
"Maybe I'll be back there one day," laughed 27-year-old Settler, who could start the season in a Zlin shirt.
It depends on whether he will get engaged by the start of the new year.
What were the four years you’ve spent in Latvia?
If I were to rate it both in school and in three.
The first year I didn’t get much, I had an experienced goalkeeper ahead of me.
I've learned.
The second year I started catching.
The third season, I thought they would give me more space.
But they brought a new golman with whom I turned again.
Last year, I assumed I'd still catch.
But during the first ten games, we probably only got five points, so the coaches started spinning it.
In the end, my colleague caught more.
But that's how it's done.
They wanted to play it for next season.
What was life like in Riga?
It's beautiful.
It's a little Prague.
Beautiful, European, historic city.
I'm gonna miss you.
I found my girlfriend there.
We're together for the third year, and we're getting married next year.
So I brought something.
How difficult is KHL for goalkeepers?
The top 10 teams are really good.
Then there are teams like us or the Slovan who have to change their playing style against them.
Skill is on the other side, so you have to replace it with something.
It means playing more backwards, fighting more.
I didn’t see a problem in the playground.
The difference is that the Russians want to play in the empty.
They shoot less, and even if they have a half-empty gate in front of them, they prefer to record.
In the Czech Republic, more is being shot.
Didn't you have a problem travelling and moving across seven time zones?
If you don’t have a family, that’s not a problem.
He can sleep in peace.
The program is usually done so that you play for example four games outside and then you have two days off.
How do Latvians feel about their club in KHL?
As a national team.
The whole of Latvia is watching hockey, along with basketball it is a national sport.
Everybody's a fan.
Even though it didn’t work, a lot of people walked.
Did Dinama’s involvement in KHL contribute to the fact that Latvia has barely moved to the quarter-finals at this year’s World Cup?
KHL has been playing since 2008 and Dinamo has been there since the beginning.
And from the same time their results for the World Championships began to go up.
At the 2014 Olympics in Sochi, they fell in the quarter-finals with Canada just 1:2.
It was an incredible result for them.
Thanks to KHL, they got to a higher level.
More and more Latvian players are heading to the Czech Extraliga.
Roberts Bukarts settled in Zlín and Ralfs Freibergs before signing the contract.
Why do so many people come here?
They're not beetle players, they're really good.
The teams here are looking for cheaper and younger players from abroad, Latvians are among them.
It's a natural direction.
The KHL starts in three weeks.
Why are you still without engagement?
By the beginning of February, I knew that I would not continue in Riga.
By the fall we started looking for something.
Sparta was on the table.
But because they didn't have a budget for the goalkeepers, we didn't have a deal.
Then it was a classic.
We played with different teams, but in the final they decided for someone else.
So I'm training at home in Zlín and I'm gonna wait for something to appear.
Aren't you nervous about that?
That was four years ago when I left here and didn't know what was going to happen.
The current situation is not the best, on the other hand, I have been home for some time.
I caught something in the KHL, so I'm taking it differently.
The only question is when and where to sign.
How real is the possibility that you will be celebrating the new year in Zlín?
Anything can happen.
We'll see what's going to happen in a month.
Now I can only wait for the agent to agree.
Do you prefer a competition?
The last season wasn’t so good that I could choose.
So I'm waiting for the phone.
The government's flight to Let continues.
In January of this year, I wrote in the article With the care of a good host? about the camp in Letek near Orlík.
The essence of the problem remains the same, so allow me to remind the complaining passages of the article.
We have been talking about camps in Letok for many years.
For readers who don’t know exactly what it is, it will probably be best if they look at the official site of the cultural monument Pietní instead of Flight.
There, at the beginning of the historical survey, it is learned that the camp was two kilometres east of the village of Leta, that from 8. 8. 1940 it served as a labor camp, from 1. 1. 1942 it was a gathering camp, and from 2. 8. 1942 it became a gypsy camp.
The next text describes the course of life in the camp, including inhuman conditions, until March 1943, when the first air prisoners were included in Auschwitz transport.
On 4. 5. 1943, 370 people were transported to the extermination camp.
There were a total of 420.
A very sad history of the immense depravity of human beings caused by human beings and their ideologies.
There is no controversy about the need to constantly remember these events.
There is no dispute that this reminder should take place at the memorial in the place of the suffering experienced by these people.
The problem is elsewhere.
After socialism, the camp was a little forgotten, and in the 1970s it was built near and on part of the former camp.
The history of the camp was accidentally discovered in 1992 by the American Paul Polansky, and in 1995 a monument was discovered in the Years.
In the mid-1990s, the government promised to buy and dismantle pear, but this has not happened yet.
In 1998 the monument was declared a cultural monument and since 2009 its report falls under the Lidice Memorial.
In July 2013, the United Nations Committee on Human Rights called on the Czech Republic to close the session.
So very briefly the facts about the post-war fate of the camp.
In the fall of last year, the government approved the purchase of beef and decided to make a scientific assessment to determine the price.
According to the Minister of Agriculture, the government will then buy the rice.
According to Culture Minister Herman, "there are some numbers, but I think I'd miss those intentions if I went with them in public."
We'll see what the expert judgment will bring.
According to some unofficial estimates, it can be hundreds of millions, according to others, the price can reach up to a billion.
As in any case, it will not be a cheap thing.
At the same time, only a few hundred meters from the former camp stands a monument, in which the state invested almost ten million crowns in 2010.
Even if the entire transaction was financed by the UN Human Rights Committee, which is not likely to be a threat, I think it would be a waste of money.
Doesn’t the government have other priorities?
The monument, a worthy place of worship, stands the will of history practically in the immediate vicinity of the tragedy that took place, and anyone who wishes can worship the memorials of the suffering and the murdered.
I don't see any reason to change this!
Let's keep it as it is, and keep the boiling place with the utmost care.
The responsible person, in this case the Government of the Czech Republic, should take care of the entrusted property, i.e. the money of the taxpayers.
At least with one like in your own company!
Of course, the Minister of Finance and the Deputy Prime Minister is not the whole government.
But still, from the above facts, I perceive the motto of the leader of the YES movement only as an empty pre-election proclamation.
In May this year, I took a look at the place.
Very decent access road, car park, replicas of wooden camping barricades.
In one exhibition, in the other integrated toilet with running water.
A small natural amphitheater with seating and a view of its own piety area, which is made of stones placed in a mild slope.
Lots of flowers and gifts.
All attributes corresponding to the significance of this place as it fits and belongs.
Archaeological research is currently underway at the site of the original camp.
It would be reasonable to consider whether it would be possible, for example, to preserve some of the discovered foundations and to make them at least visually accessible in an appropriate way.
In this regard, the Minister of Culture, Daniel Herman, may be able to renew his efforts.
If he succeeds in getting the money from the government, it will be just another unfortunate step in his already quite problematic role as Minister of Culture.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate can alleviate symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
For your digestive system, red meat and dairy products can be a nightmare.
However, a new study suggests the opposite: a diet rich in animal protein and dairy products could help relieve symptoms of inflammatory bowel diseases.
Untreated disease, which affects up to 1.3 million U.S. residents and 300,000 patients in the UK, causes abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
Patients are usually reminded not to eat meat and dairy products to alleviate symptoms. However, researchers at the University of Washington have found that the essential amino acid tryptophan contained in the protein helps to build immune cells that support intestinal resistance.
The study’s lead researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells protect the intestines and ensure that harmful microbes are recovered from food.
The number of inflammatory cells is balanced by the number of cells that support tolerance and protect the body without damaging the sensitive tissue.
Once the wax plates tilt to the side of the inflammation, an inflammatory bowel disease can occur.
As part of the research, the researchers found the presence of immune cells supporting the body's tolerance in the stomach of mice with a particular bacteria.
This bacteria requires the presence of tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to form cells.
Professor Colonna said: “We found a connection between one type of bacteria – Lactobacillus reuteri – that is a common part of the intestinal microbiome and the development of cells that support the body’s tolerance.
The more tryptophan the mice had in their diet, the more these immune cells had."
At the same time, he suggested that if it turns out that the same applies to humans, then a combination of L. reuteri bacteria and a diet rich in tryptophan would help develop a more tolerable and less inflammatory intestinal environment.
Postgraduate researcher Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barraganwas, in a study of some type of immune cells supporting the body's tolerance, found that one group of test mice had these cells, while the other group of the same mice treated separately the cells.
It was derived from the fact that one group of mice has a different intestinal microbiome - a community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally reside in the gastrointestinal tract.
The mouse intestine was tested by a DNA sequence method and the researchers found six types of bacteria in mice with immune cells missing from the second group of mice.
Mice, who were bred in a sterile environment and lacked intestinal microbiome - so they didn't develop this type of immune cells - were given the bacteria L. reuteri - and formed their immune cells.
To understand how the bacteria affects the immune system, the researchers grew L. reuters in the fluid and then transferred a small amount of fluid – without bacteria – to undeveloped immune cells that were stored in isolation.
Immune cells have evolved into tolerant cells.
After removal of the active ingredient from the liquid, it turned out to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism known as indolyl-3-octaic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mouse diet, the amount of these cells increased by 50 percent. After dilution of tryptophan doses at the same time, the number of cells decreased by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that humans have the same tolerant cells as mice, and most of us keep L. reuteri bacteria in their gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known whether the by-products of tryptophan from L. reuteri cause cell development in humans in the same way as in mice, but gene defects associated with tryptophan have been detected in people with inflammatory bowel disease.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan added: “Each of us should probably try to develop these cells because they control the inflammatory interior surface of the intestines.
Potentially high levels of tryptophan in the presence of L. reuteri may increase the cell population."
José Mourinho considers the signing of contract with Neman Mati<0xC4><0x87> and his transfer to Manchester United as ‘general’
Manchester United have gained a "genius" in the form of Nemanja Mati<0xC4><0x87> - at least that's what José Mourinho thinks after the defender debuted Wednesday against Sampdoria.
Mati<0xC4><0x87>, who signed a <0xC2><0xA3>40 million contract, made his debut in the first 2–1 win in Dublin - the last pre-season match before the UEFA Super Cup, where United will face Real Madrid on Tuesday - and played as backers alongside Paul Pogba and Andrea Pergby.
However, as he did not participate in the team’s pre-season Asian tour, Mati<0xC4><0x87> did not have the form and only played 45 minutes, which, according to Mourinho, must be worked on before the start of the next Premier League season.
"It takes time, but he's experienced, intelligent, and he's brilliant - he thinks football," Mourinho said.
"We'll help him get in shape as soon as possible."
Like Mati<0xC4><0x87>, his new co-players Victor Lindelöf and Romelu Lukaku also played their first match at Aviva Stadium and Mourinho is slowly starting to form their eleventh for the next season.
An independent source announced this week that Mourinho still wants to sign a contract with three other players, but insists that the club has done "fantastic work" and brought three of the four most important players to the team.
"Thank you to the club for helping me get three out of four players," he added.
“Four out of four would make me more happy, but I admit they did the best for me.”
The life challenge of the king of chicken skins Ladi Hru<0xC5><0xA1>ka.
He wants to learn from Pohlreich!
This promising picture began to be painted thanks to the new TV program of the Prima Zdenek Academy.
The pepper immediately opened up a chance.
"Dear Zdenek, I'd like to apply for this at your cooking academy because, hand in hand, I think I can learn a lot from you," he said in a video on social media.
And since the two of you have been dancing for a few years, Ladá hasn't forgotten to irritate him.
"In return, I can teach you to eat suede from diet chicken, American cucumbers, or to invite you to water and show you why fried cheese is your favorite," said Hru<0xC5><0xA1>ka.
His participation in Pohlreich’s new show is really serious.
It is time to move up the level and learn from the master.
"The question is what the boss is about," said Blesku.
Pohlreich, however, did not comment because he was filming new parts of his next series Yes, Boss!.
Only Prima responded to Hru<0xC5><0xA1>ka’s participation in the culinary academy by taking the whole matter as his personal activity that goes outside of television.
He planted a large wound to Hru<0xC5><0xA1>ka Pohlreich in December 2004 with his first chef.
Within a few days, it sold over 300,000 pieces!
The new program, which Prima presented yesterday at a press conference for the autumn broadcasting scheme, is a non-fake cooking school.
Pohlreich selects his students from among the spectators and in the twelve works he introduces them to the twelve cooking techniques.
In the last part of his show Now cooks the chef in November 2014, Zden<0xC4><0x9B>k made himself chewed on the back of his t-shirt.
If I had my face there, I'd laugh a lot.
"I'm just laughing at the pepper - the pepper is a healthy fruit and has a lot of vitamins," Ladja said.
He thinks of Lacey’s culinary art.
"To cook according to Lada Hru<0xC5><0xA1>ka does not come into consideration at home, because I will not let go of gastropunk at home," the boss said.
I really appreciate Pohlreich’s steak, even if he says I make chicken on honey.
In my show, however, his recipes will definitely not appear," Hru<0xC5><0xA1>ka did not apologize.
He's stupid!
He's not a cook for me, he's a TV clown.
"Gastronomic illiterate or stupid," Pohlreich said of Hru<0xC5><0xA1>ka in a lecture.
"I don't have twenty to be able to shake hands over them, but I don't deal with them that way anymore," Hru<0xC5><0xA1>k said on the account of the insults expressed.
British inventor uses microchip in his hand to unlock car and house by bending
The British inventor became the first person in the country with a microchip inserted into the body. With a simple hand-swipe, he can unlock the door from the house and office and even start the car.
Thirty-three-year-old Steven Northam has implanted a tiny chip between the thumb and the indicator and is currently offering the same service through his company BioTeq to companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives using technology.
Dr. Geoff Watson, anesthesiologist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, oversees the procedure for implantation and treatment.
The technology works on the same principle as microchips implanted in dogs and cats and the whole procedure takes 30 seconds.
Northam's company also offers a door and car lock replacement service compatible with a microchip. The price of one lock is <0xC2><0xA3>300.
The married father of one child has allowed the technology to be integrated into his home and his BMW Z4 car, which he starts with a simple hand bending.
The White House Reconstruction Costed Taxpayers Thousands of Dollars
The White House decision to fly a naval helicopter to South Lawn on the occasion of a celebration of the American manufacturing industry, which took place last month, came to <0x24>24,000, according to naval records released by TIME.
The green white helicopter Sikorsky VH-3D, also called the Marine One in the presence of the president on board, was the highlight of the July 17 program in the White House, which was an overview of U.S. design programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and several senior White House officials were watching a product overview from all 50 states.
A Connecticut helicopter was exhibited next to a Maine yacht, a fire truck from Wisconsin and a forklift truck from Mississippi.
A military officer of the White House issued a fragmentary order or FRAGO and requested the presence of a helicopter less than 36 hours before the helicopter landed on South Lawn as part of an “extraordinary” event, said records Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HM-Squadron).
“I wanted to make sure you were aware of such a significant event,” HMX-1 Commander wrote in an email to his chief, a representative of the Navy Commander the day before the event began.
The report indicated that the helicopter would arrive at South Lawn on July 17 at approximately 7:00 on the occasion of the sightseeing, whose start is scheduled for 15:00 and will remain in place until the complete clearance of the entire site, which was scheduled between 6:00 and 21:00.
In addition, the e-mail stated that if there is a delay in the departure from the White House, a replacement crew will be sent for the return flight due to the working time regulation.
The original crew remained in place that evening, along with the helicopter and with them a security guard unit.
From the records obtained by the TIME Weekly, it was not apparent whether the second crew was eventually sent.
The Hatch Act prohibits government officials from using government property for political purposes.
Records indicate that HMX-1 is investigating possible violations of this Regulation.
“We were wondering if it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were assured that everything was okay,” the commander wrote.
"It sounds like you're being blocked," said the deputy commander.
This “Made in America” tour was marked by the White House as an official event and the Hatch Act would therefore not be included.
But the official events also have political subtexts.
During his participation in the event, the president advocated a health reform that passed through the Senate and talked about trying to keep the government’s regulations at bay.
The use of aircraft such as the Marine One or Air Force One for political purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents use them when traveling.
However, their presence, purely for presentation reasons, is unusual.
Trump ordered a check in February after the presidential plane crashed in the background at his first meeting as part of a campaign in Melbourne, Florida. His Twitter account is charged with complaints about the use of the presidential plane by his predecessors.
“The White House is pleased with the ‘Made in America’ overview, which presented products from all 50 states that Americans make from American materials,” said Lindsay Walters, a spokeswoman for the press.
The HMX-1 helicopter crews often train landings in the Washington and South Lawn area and practice possible flights with the President of the United States to the White House with maximum precision.
While Trump attended a G-20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 conducted 58 exercise landings at the White House.
The flight on the Made in America tour was part of the current crew training, the state prosecutor said.
On the same day, the helicopter's unit found another 11 hours as part of "non-presidential support missions".
The White House said no additional assets were paid out of the taxpayers’ money.
A spokesman for Sikorsky said the company was in no way interested in the negotiations on the South Lawn helicopter exhibition.
The HMX-1 does not keep budget records for the presidential flights, and the exact costs associated with the overview are difficult to determine, according to the Navy.
According to the Ministry of Defence, the hourly price for the fiscal year 2017 is <0x24>24,380 per flight hour.
Unit records indicate 30 minutes from Marine Corps Air Facility Quantico base in Virginia and back.
The White House argues that the actual operating costs of the helicopters are significantly below the stated amount.
“To list the costs of taxpayers based on estimates of expense reimbursement is very misleading,” Walters said to the whole case.
“These estimates include personnel, maintenance and many other hidden costs that are included in the annual costs.”
According to the 2015 RAND study, DoD expense reimbursements do not include staff costs, but include fuel price, maintenance and contract costs.
White House press secretary Sean Spicer defended the use of the helicopter for the tour.
“The idea of the show this week is to introduce products made in the US,” Spicer said.
“I am aware that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud of the fact that they are contributing to the defense of our state and providing jobs to hundreds, if not thousands of people.
I think, like most Americans, that we are proud of helicopters and other military facilities, which are made by countless American citizens.
This fact deserves to be remembered."
It is unclear whether Trump was also looking at the helicopter during his trip to South Lawn. With certainty, it can only be said that he sat behind the wheel of one of the fire trucks.
Back in the White House, Trump addressed Sikorsky’s representative and joked with the media about his own product fleet.
“I know Sikorsky very well,” said the president, “I have three right away.”
The young woman was tied to the basin by Lake Mach, and the police sailed to her.
The girl went to the beach on Sunday at about two o’clock in the morning.
Instead of bathing, she remained trapped in the wetlands.
When she decided to ask for help from a policeman on her mobile phone, she had the last 12 percent of the battery.
"Because of this, policemen soon lost contact with her," police spokeswoman Ivana Baláková said.
Several police guards came to the place she described, but finding a young woman was not easy at all.
"Some of the police officers had to sail hundreds of meters of crumbling wetlands before they felt solid ground again under their feet," Balákova said.
And similarly, she was missing.
The police were oriented according to the direction on which her call for help was based.
"In order not to lose at least this connection, they agreed with her that she would be counting down loudly," the spokesperson said.
Police found the woman up to three-quarters of five in the basins in Born<0xC3><0xBD>.
She was on the verge of physical and mental strength and had signs of a cold.
That is why the ambulance called took her to the Czechoslovak hospital.
The Grandfather's Connection?
The bride becomes a saleswoman.
That's a little irony.
With his web project suchameslusny.cz as if a billionaire told voters essentially that the STAN is suffering from a deficit of decent people.
And he also argued that the politically uninsured party of the lesser-known mayors and independents, in fact, has no national program for parliamentary elections.
Her election candidate will simply become a decent person after an interview with Grandpa, no matter what political opinion she has.
This is how Vit Bárta started, and it didn’t work out very well.
With his zeal for decent people and personalities, which may be replaced by some of the mayors on the candidates, which Gazdík also admitted, in addition, Grandpa cancels the popular argument of the head of STAN that the greatest value of the movement is the political examination and experience of the mayors.
They are now quietly replacing the quickly collected unknown personalities.
The total separation from the people, after which STAN changed the logo and slogan, Gazdík explained that the movement does not want to lose its identity on the candidates of the people.
But if STAN was suspected of identity by a few people at that time, after the arrival of Grandpa, a mere game of identity ends.
Not only did Gazdík for a long time outline his YES against Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1>, but Grandpa, who is publicly praising Babi<0xC5><0xA1>a, said: "My goal is to get the YES, that is, the Mayor's movement in the next two percent of the votes."
Let's hope you didn't mess with the movement.
Grandpa is a successful businessman and a billionaire is certainly not a coincidence.
He often talks about politics like Babi<0xC5><0xA1>, but unlike him, he does not build his own political label.
STAN has been reminiscent of a reality show for some time rather than a real political party, and Grandpa’s helper hand seems to make the requested bride even more a saleswoman.
For some time STAN went with TOP 09, then with people and now looking for decent people for change.
Let's hope someone calls.
Police Dogs Exercise in Mosta by Helicopter
Dogs specializing in the search for explosives and search dogs today practiced by helicopter at Lake Bridge.
The police dog must not be fearful and fearful of flying, said Petr Tomá<0xC5><0xA1>ek, head of police cynologists in the <0xC3><0x9A>stice region.
The training of a police dog takes about two years.
At the bridge they practiced both adult training dogs, and those who are just going through the training.
In addition to the standard training, in which they were to reveal sharp samples of explosives around the lake and look for the lost figure, all 12 animals had to step into the helicopter and fly over the lake.
The main purpose of the exercise is to test dogs in a helicopter.
In order to immediately touch the helicopter, the dog could go to work so as not to have a problem with the helicopter road.
"The helicopter is sitting, the dog is going and looking right away," Tomá<0xC5><0xA1>ek said.
A dog that is restless or on the way by helicopter is not able to start working immediately is excluded from training.
"Most of the time, they leave them in the garden for example," Tomá<0xC5><0xA1>ek added.
The police have 76 dogs in the <0xC3><0x9A>stek region with different specializations.
German Shepherds are dominant, but there are also more Belgian Shepherds.
The dog takes care of him from the puppy.
"He is nurturing it himself, preparing it for the service that the dog will do for us," Tomá<0xC5><0xA1>ek added.
The animal undergoes repeated veterinary examinations, which may detect possible medical disabilities.
If the dog is healthy and careless, he will take the first tests in 20 months.
"A sharp intervention takes about two and a half to three years," Tomá<0xC5><0xA1>ek added.
The length of service at the police department depends on the health of the dog.
It usually serves for eight to ten years.
Most of the time, they live with their dogs.
Trailer for Season 3 Narcos: Pablo Escobar is out of the game and Cali Cartel becomes the hub of the hit series Netflix
Despite the end of the second season of Narcos, when the killer of Pablo Escobar is revealed, the Netflix series is far from over.
Confirmation by the streaming service has already reached the third and fourth season - the first named already reached the first trailer and a host of other negative characters.
In the third season, the DEA focuses on the world’s richest drug cartel: Cali Cartel.
Under the leadership of four influential monkeys, they operate “as a Fortune 500 company”, only with the difference that they are escalating violent acts and paying more government agents.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) plays brain surgery, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) is in charge of connections with Mexico and Chepe Santacruz London (Pepe Rapazote) controls New York.
In the new trailer, Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Peña, a character depicting American and Colombian drug rights fighters.
Other actors include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishé and Arturo Castro.
The third season of Narcos will premiere on September 1.
U.N. says Afghan democracy relies on women in politics
Elections can only be credible if all members of the company, including women, are involved, the UN representative in Afghanistan said on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, head of the UN Assistant Mission, said that hundreds of women participated in local elections, three women applying for the post of vice president, and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.
“The role of women cannot be overlooked,” he said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can only be fully representative and credible if women also participate in them, as well as in all related processes related to elections.
Local and presidential elections in Afghanistan will be held on April 5.
The Taliban has issued several threats against the electoral process, which moves international combat activities to a second rank.
In this year’s elections, for the first time ever, a democratically elected government is handing over its power to a peacefully succeeding government.
Haysom said the strong role of women will strengthen Afghanistan’s democracy.
The Afghan Independent Electoral Commission said that out of a total of 3.6 million registered voters, 1.2 million are women.
A unique brewery is again cooking beer.
A good beer in a re-breasted brewery.
The enthusiasm and honesty of the new owners returned to the life of the brewery in Lob<0xC4><0x8D>a u M<0xC5><0xA1>ena a few years ago.
The brewery, mentioned for the first time in 1586, has a Renaissance core and in the nineteenth century it was rebuilt for parish service.
It followed years of flourishing, when the brewery was famous mainly for dark beers.
During World War II, production was unfortunately stopped and in 1984 the brewery was nationalized.
Since then, the buildings have served the state ship.
The work of destruction was done by the brewery owners after 1989.
The abandoned area was devastated and decomposed into building materials.
In 2007, however, new hopes emerged in the form of new owners, architects Jana and Pavlo Prouzów.
They began repairing the buildings with the utmost respect for the spirit of construction and every detail.
They have carefully devoted themselves to the study of archival materials, trying to preserve the original materials and building elements.
The brewery has the same shape as in the nineteenth century, when it began its golden age.
Their work was rewarded by the declaration of the brewery as a cultural monument by the Ministry of Culture and the construction has also become part of the European Industrial Heritage Trails.
In 2015, the tradition of beer was rebuilt.
To taste great Lobby beer in the picturesque landscape of Koko<0xC5><0x99>ínska, visit the brewery’s premises.
When cooking beer here, they use coconut water originating in the protected landscape, salt from the Lobec fields and <0xC5><0xBD>atec chmel.
In the snack bar you can taste the traditional light bed, but also dark beers and specialties.
And don’t miss the tour of the brewery, which takes place on Saturdays and Sundays at noon and in the second half.
The largest artillery force in Czechoslovakia?
One of the largest fortresses of its kind worldwide?
Such a unique building was to be the Stachelberg fortress between Trutnov and <0xC5><0xBD>acler, at the top of the ground back above the village of Babí.
Originally, it was supposed to consist of up to twelve bunkers connected by a vast underground.
There was to be a command, a cash register, ammunition warehouses, materials, power plants, machinery and hospitals.
The construction was completed by the Munich Agreement.
In less than a year, the only huge concrete bunker was built and underground spaces were destroyed.
Thanks to the enthusiasts of the Stachelberg Association, who began to reconstruct the unique building in the early 1990s, you can also take a look here.
It’s available from 75%!
In addition to the infantry shell T-S 73, there is also an exhibition and underground armored object of light fortification, two deployed infantry shells, trenches and the Fortified Trutnovsko educational trail.
Freshness, cozy terrace and breathtaking views to the countryside are guaranteed!
This unique and magnificent Czech building has been listed next to such monuments as the Great Wall of China, the Port of Traian near Rome, or the Assyrian Palace in Nineveh and Nimrud.
Chote<0xC5><0xA1>ov Monastery originally from the beginning of the thirteenth century, which now forms mainly a huge four-winged building of the convent over a beautiful garden.
The list he got, but unfortunately belongs to unique buildings that are threatened with extinction.
However, enthusiasts do not want to give up and organise a lot of events in support of the monastery.
One of them is the annual Evening for the Chot<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xA1>ov Monastery this Saturday, August 5th, where Ms. Vladimír Mi<0xC5><0xA1>ik, Ivan Vos will perform, you will see the <0xC5><0xA0>ermír performances and look at the places of beautiful large buildings that are usually inaccessible.
You will enjoy the atmosphere of this great place.
Do you want to look the neanderthals in the face?
Exhibition Welcome to the Neanderthals at the Anthropos Pavilion of the Moravian Land Museum in Brno attracts you to an unusual excursion to the deepest ages of the Stone Age, into the world of our ancestors.
You will learn how the Neanderthals were able to cope perfectly with a wide variety of extreme weather conditions, mainly by alternating the ice and ice ages.
Despite their simple material culture, they were incredibly successful predators of their time.
You will also learn how they looked, what their anatomy, technological skills and hunting mind were, but also their aesthetic senses.
Wouldn't you say that to the Neanderthals?
Let yourself be convinced in Brno.
The fourteenth KELT & WORLD MUSIC festival will be held on Saturday, the fifth in the castle of Veve<0xC5><0x99>í.

Get to know the plant with one click.
The new free Pl<0x40>ntNet app will help students with herbalists and ordinary plant lovers.
If they are interested in what plant they have just encountered on a walk, this application will advise them.
The only thing they will have to do is to photograph the plant and the application itself will recognize what kind of plant it is.
The new app, which is available for iOS and Android, was presented on Tuesday by representatives of the CEEV Ethics and Environmental Education Center in Bratislava’s Mountain Park as part of the Secret Life of the City project.
Students from 50 Czech and Slovak schools were also involved in the project, who photographed and added plants from their surroundings to the application database with their teachers.
The newly created French app is free to download on the Secret Life of the City page.
The main goal of French programmers was to get as many people as possible to contribute to the application with their images, thereby increasing the number of plants that the application can recognize.
"Already children holding tablets or mobile phones in their hands can go to the woods," said Ivana Polá<0xC4><0x8D>ková, coordinator of the project.
Based on a sufficiently high quality photo of a flower, leaf or fruit of the plant, the application can recognize its name in a matter of seconds, which is then assigned to the photo in Czech and Slovak.
The French allowed us to translate the application into Slovak and Czech into the Secret Life of the City project.
Therefore, after creating an account, users are welcome to contribute a picture of a plant that does not yet exist in the database.
"Francouzi will evaluate whether it is profitable, and then add it to the database," Polá<0xC4><0x8D>ková said.
GMB concerns about investment in McVitie's plant in Glasgow
Trade unions are demanding assurance from the managers of McVitie's dessert manufacturer about the long-term production commitment at the Glasgow factory.
The Scottish trade union GMB said that the company was still silent about any investment in the Tollcross plant.
The factory employs more than 500 employees who produce, among other products, Hobnob and Rich Tea cookies.
McVitie's owner, Pladis, said she had invested more than <0xC2><0xA3>5 million in the entire area over the previous few years.
She added that the employees and representatives of the trade unions will be “among the first to be informed” in the event of changes in the operation of the factory.
In a letter to the construction company, GMB's Scottish trade unions expressed concern that McVitie's "would not receive its promises of financing and modernization of production lines."
GMB Chief Organizer Drew Duffy added: “The lack of clear answers from the construction manager regarding the needs of the company and the future investment plan at Tollcross is very worrying for our members.
Generations of families have worked here, and employees come mostly from the local community and Glasgow area, where work in the factory is a critical pillar of decent employment in the area of high unemployment and social segregation.
In terms of work, wages and profits – and despite the prospect of Brexit, rising living costs and slowing production – the eastern part of Glasgow needs a desperately thriving producer like McVitie’s.”
A spokeswoman for Pladis said: “Tollcross received a letter from GMB only yesterday and the company will issue a statement as soon as possible, as we appreciate our continued commitment to the employees and representatives of the departments.
The regular meeting with employees and representatives of GMB in Tollcross took place two months ago and there were many issues openly discussed at this meeting.
We talked to our employees that, like all companies operating in extremely competitive and unsafe economic conditions, we evaluate our operations on a regular basis, which applies to all of our operations so that we can continue to compete successfully with others.
She added: “In recent years, we have invested <0xC2><0xA3>5 million in the Tollcross area, especially in production lines and efficiency.
We greatly appreciate the heritage of Tollcross and its locations, and in case of any changes in the operation of its factories, employees and representatives of the trade unions will be informed immediately."
Did PSG warn Barcelona about Neymar’s move three years ago?
La Liga may regret his interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not allow Neymar to be on his side in an effort to get <0xC2><0xA3>189 million, the amount needed to buy Neymar out of the deal, but has this French team warned Barcelona of its record attack three years ago?
This sensational transition has developed the waters of summer transfers, with Ligue 1 club ready to beat more than double the previous record amount for Paul Pogby's transfer to Manchester United, who paid <0xC2><0xA3>89 million for him last season.
Upon confirmation and completion of the transfer, Neymar will become the most expensive player in the world and at the same time the best-paid professional athlete in the world - after taxation, he will collect over <0xC2><0xA3>500,000 a week from the PSG team.
Barcelona is outraged by the way Neymar exited his contract, despite a confidential source confirming that the club has always tried to satisfy Neymar in everything since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world warned of this fact three years ago by the president of PSG?
When Manchester City expressed an interest in Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi warned all clubs that would be interested in intercepting one of the best PSG players.
“I’m not afraid, because once someone tries to get one of our players, then we’ll definitely address one of their players,” Al-Khelaifi said.
“We respect all the clubs.
But if they try to get one of our players, they will face the consequences."
Barcelona seems to have exceeded the conceptual limit when it expressed an interest in PSG backer Marc Verratti in the summer.
PSG has made a clear statement in the sense that under no circumstances will it allow the departure of the Italian representative, so it is possible that Barcelona will now swallow a bitter pill with Neymar's departure for its treacherous negotiations.
Who explains the sanctions?
Does political punishment have broadly understandable rules?
Donald Trump called for anti-Russian sanctions.
Yesterday, the United States imposed sanctions on Venezuelan President Madura.
And even a day earlier, Trump wrote that China is doing nothing to the North Korean threat and that it will not go on.
And it cleans up the idea of sanctions like straw from the boots.
You can't throw those things in one bag.
Maduro’s Venezuela has really embarked on a path to dictatorship, totalitarianism.
China just doesn’t act the way the US president would like to do.
Russia is a chapter for itself.
But if anyone wanted to summarize this in such a way that even ordinary voters, Americans, Europeans or others, would understand what it is and what kind of system of rules a sanctions policy is based on, that would be almost impossible.
In the sanctions against Russia, President Trump only covers what President Obama has already imposed, only gives it an enforceable stamp.
So why such a stir?
Last year, Europe was afraid that if Trump wins the US election, he would hug Putin and lift sanctions.
That's a terrible idea.
In practice, it is the opposite.
With Trump, sanctions are not released, they are tightening.
But Europe is even more frightened.
German Minister Zypries says Trump’s sanctions are in violation of international law.
Is it like the kosher are just sanctions approved by the UN Security Council?
But then there are neither kosher nor anti-Russian sanctions from the EU.
European Commission chief Juncker complains that Trump’s sanctions threaten the EU’s energy security.
Is it just like they're supposed to use sanctions so weak that they don't threaten anyone?
Ordinary voters are drowning.
For three years, he heard that the fate of the anti-Russian sanctions depends only on the implementation of the Minsk ceasefire agreements in Ukraine.
It is now learned that it is the EU's energy security.
The voters are even broader.
The sanctions are coming to Russia because it is too mounted where it does not have.
China's awkward because it's a little crowded.
The Venezuelan president is convicted of building a dictatorship within his own country.
All these punishments or just considerations have their rationality.
But does anyone see a system, order, or rule in it?
Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1>: I don’t think about working with Okamura.
Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1> is married, crossing the republic with his visionary book and finalizing the election program.
In addition to the Pardubice region, all candidates are already ready.
According to him, he did not intervene in any way.
He even agreed to lead the Moravian Slovak Hejtman and Shadow Minister of Education ANO Ivo Vondrák.
"But if he succeeds, he will have to choose whether he wants to be a member or a hajtman," Babi<0xC5><0xA1> said in a statement.
You have angered many representatives and state-wide politicians with your thesis that direct elections to mayors and mayors should run the towns and cities themselves, with only managers.
Is that what you mean?
That's not what it was.
I am in favour of direct democracy, we vote directly for the president, and I am convinced that we should also vote for mayors and mayors.
In my book, I'm not talking about disturbing representatives, they can be there.
The question is how many will be.
When I presented your book of what I dream about when I sleep by chance, I heard from my own ears that you were talking about the abolition of representatives.
I don't remember that.
I was talking about direct election and a reduction in the number of delegates.
New York, with a population of nine million, has five districts and 51 representatives.
Prague, with 1.2 million citizens, has 1171 representatives.
And the mayor is calculated to build little and has not prepared large projects, but she has no competence for it.
The same is true of a government ruled by only two people in our history, Klaus and Zeman.
Which I'm not saying they did well.
The current prime minister, however, does not control anything, he only moderates the debate.
That's not how it works.
Is that why you want to implement the majority system?
It would be perfect, but it's hard to implement.
In the program, we only have a change to a single-chair election to the Senate.
We have also proposed a slippery mandate of ministers and a modification of the House's rules of procedure so as to prevent unnecessary exhibitions of Members, who are to work mainly in committees and committees, from presenting themselves at the meetings of the House.
It is certainly not true that I want to destroy the parliamentary system.
But that’s exactly what your opponents are afraid of.
That as a dictator you will lead the government, control the house with 101 MPs, cancel the counties and the Senate, and control the whole country through grateful mayors and mayors.
I'm sure it's not.
After all, there is nothing wrong with debating the number of Members.
French President Macron has announced a third reduction in the legislature, with 57,000 French per legislator, and 17,000 Czechs in our country.
However, no one blames Macron for endangering democracy.
Even if someone wins the elections in the Czech Republic by a majority, we have mechanisms that would prevent him from making some dramatic changes.
For those who have a parliamentary majority, however, the gaps are large, it is enough to look at Poland or Hungary.
There is no such thing in the case of a yes movement.
We just need a team that will work for people in the government, not for their parties or resorts.
I do not understand, for example, why we have not been able to agree that only the salaries of teachers, cultural and social services workers will increase.
Why did they re-vote me and add 21 percent to the GIBS members who are already taking 60,000?
Would you like to know that as Prime Minister?
The prime minister is expected to intervene when ministers behave uneconomically, trick the government into travel agencies and would like to do business for the state money like Marian Jure<0xC4><0x8D>ka, who wanted to buy forests in Romania and land in Africa.
The ministers in the government are not to argue, they are to cause controversy outside of it.
The finished material must go to the cabinet, there is no room for coalition crackdowns, force votes and offices, there must be a decision.
How do you want to have a cohesive team when ministers behave mainly sideways?
There is a constitutional law above the parties.
When it came to breaking bread, Sobotka said that the coalition agreement was not valid, and left Babi<0xC5><0xA1>a from the government.
Any Prime Minister can do that.
However, if he is a personality and has control skills, a similar gesture is not needed.
It measures everyone the same and requires perfect performance from everyone.
Do you know who you would suggest to the Minister of Finance?
I don't think about it at all, because we probably won't be in that government, nobody wants to cooperate with us, even if I don't know what I've done so badly.
There's not that much skepticism in place.
The mayors got the entrepreneur Grandpa, who would like to work with you, maybe the wing of Ji<0xC5><0x99>í Cunk will win with the people.
I don't think so.
<0xC4><0x8C>SSD is led by Lubomír Zaorálek, who does not exclude the coalition with the ANO, in the ODS may be implemented by Václav Klaus ml., who will also not oppose.
I'd leave it to the voters.
Vice-President and Vice-President ANO Richard Brabec said that you have many points in common with SPD Tomia Okamura, for example in the field of economics.
So the okamarovs come into consideration as a coalition partner?
Mr. Brabec says he didn't say that.
Mr. Okamura has his political history, he nominated Víta Bárta as a puppet for the VV, then he got money from the Dawn for his company, there was some blow.
He is, of course, a strong personality.
It's kind of infuriating, though.
If I take his program, he has a broad involvement of people in the management of society, a direct democracy, he can agree with that.
I'm not asking you at all.
I wonder if a person who has xenophobic opinions is acceptable to you to speak at demonstrations with squabbles and wants to leave the EU?
We don't think about working with Mr. Okamura's side, I can't imagine it.
Obviously, he went into politics to profit from it.
And what about the silent support of the Communists to your minority government?
I can’t imagine that, but voters are determined.
It will be about negotiating the winner with the second in the order, but God knows who will win and who the two.
Of course, it is important for them to be able to agree on a coalition government program.
Let’s go back to your efforts to govern the state as a company.
But the government just has to take control, Prime Minister Sobotka left everything to be avoided, he never decided.
Coalition issues such as CEEB or EGAP did not work.
Sobotka is his puppet, and I think that was the reason why he threw me out.
As soon as he did so, the <0xC4><0x8C>EZ controlled the Czech government.
It is unbelievable that the prime minister has brought a resolution written by the management of the <0xC4><0x8C>EZ, which requires the finance minister to vote on the <0xC4><0x8C>EZ general assembly.
If you became prime minister, would you change the staffing of the Supervisory Board and replace the top management of <0xC4><0x8C>EZ?
Jesus, if I'm prime minister, I'll see you.
I'm not eating it yet.
It is rumoured that the CZE has already sent signals in your direction.
Good cooperation with <0xC4><0x8C>SSD would like to exchange for even better with YES.
Maybe after the election, everything will go on.
I don't know anything about it.
I don’t have a lobbyist for Pokémon or Ro<0xC5><0xBE>i<0xC4><0x8D>ek, I’m a separate unit and I don’t solve this at all.
So answer it directly.
If you become the head of the government, will you seek to replace the leadership of the <0xC4><0x8C>EZ, Czech Television or the General Health Insurance Company, that is, the institutions that you are criticizing?
I would like the CZE to be a transparent society.
So far, he has been doing what he wanted for years, thanks to the provision for traditional political parties.
All you need to do is look at Mr. Schwarzenberg's statements.
Although the state has a majority in the <0xC4><0x8C>EZ, it has never ruled it, it was only in the number, which is bad.
It's a trivial thing for me.
<0xC4><0x8C>EZ is going to take Dukovany, appreciate them, squeeze them into a subsidiary, arrange financing, make a supply competition or get a co-investor and build a new nuclear block.
The idea that the state should finance and build new nuclear blocks is absurd.
What about Czech TV?
Some of her shows against me lead a permanent purpose campaign, but I don’t have and won’t have any powers to throw anyone out.
But to control it, yes.
I don't want to control anyone.
I'm just saying that citizens pay about <0x24>7.2 billion a year for public radio and television fees, but they don't actually know how these institutions will manage.
How come they don't know?
After all, the House approves the report on their management, which has a direct impact on the positions of CEOs of <0xC4><0x8C>T and <0xC4><0x8C>Ro.
Look at how the news is being discussed, about the super power pact Sobotka Kalousek, which has always worked.
This applies both to the current parliamentary committee on the leaks from the investigative files and to lex Babi<0xC5><0xA1>.
And Sobotka was so stupid that he let Kalouski push me out of the government, which earned the TOP 09 percentage, but the CSSD wore them.
They are afraid of disrupting their system of corruption, and so they are talking about threatening democracy with Babis.
No one's immune.
What do you say to the articles describing how the first Vice-President Jaroslav Falt<0xC3><0xBD>nek builds power grounds by appointing his son to the supervisory board of Tepláren Brno and arranging contracts with the associate lawyer of Kv<0xC4><0x9B>toslav Hlín with municipal and state-owned companies like <0xC4><0x8C>epra<0xC5><0xBE>ní dvi
We have a lasting dispute in that.
I don't like it and I've read it several times.
Falt<0xC3><0xBD>nek argues that this lawyer works at significantly lower rates and is reliable.
I wouldn't do that.
As a finance minister, I had no one.
We, unlike the Socrates, have never had a corrupt affair, no Pelt, Kratochvílova, B<0xC5><0x99>ezina.
If there was any sign of clienteleism, we immediately fired such a person.
I am uncompromising in this regard.
If something like this happens, we'll get rid of anyone, no matter who it is.
