The UKIP survivors who reject those living with HIV are a perfect example.
You talk about when Nigel Farage says the NHS should not be used to pay for those coming to the UK to do health tourism, and when, with that in mind, he answers yes when the interviewer specifically asks him if people living with HIV are included in the undesirable.
First you use special arguments, then you discredit them with barely veiled homophobia.
Every time I or my family need the NHS, we have to get the tail behind chronic hypochondriac intolerants who think everything is due to them.
I think you're the one who uses special arguments.
Health tourism, as defined by the right swings, practically does not exist.
I think that’s what we call democracy.
So no one would be affected by UKIP’s measures against health tourism, so there is no problem.
Only in the parallel universe of UKIP can Carswell appear as a revolutionary.
A quote taken from a torch is not evidence.
Yes, so shoot the messenger.
The Mail did not write the report, he only commented on it.
Those who control the majority of the media in this country should be shot for propagating such populist propaganda as if it were the reality.
I don't think you know what a special argument is.
You also don’t know anything about my personal situation or my identity, so you should be careful when you try to kill the debate with accusations of homophobia.
Farage’s phrase surprised me a lot, but only because so rarely we talk about this problem.
He did not make any homophobic remarks.
You're gonna have to be able to get back to it.
I’m not sure where you want to come from, but I imagine you don’t like it when the media talks about what you don’t like.
It is so rarely spoken of because unlike Farage and his shy disciples of Thatcher who think that AIDS and floods are a sign of God and not a reflection of their own inability to understand that humanity’s complexities are something good, so no.
Eventually, the situation is as fragile in Ireland as in Spain.
With the new crisis coming, the period of austerity will not have arranged anything.
Expecting nearly 5% growth in 2015 is a big joke.
Ireland boasted of the ''Tiger of Europe'' a few years ago.
We've met the suite!
It starts to read the article again.
We are trying to make Ireland believe that it is a virtuous country and that a “NEW ECONOMIC MIRACLE” is happening.
With the Brussels agreement, tax on the lowest societies in Europe, a very flexible labour march, an emigration that continues.
With these ingredients, nothing to "pavoize" for the time being with the arrival of the Poles.
In the 80s of the twentieth century, Ireland was one of the poorest countries in the European Union, with Portugal considering a constant perimeter, without the new countries, the situation is always better than it was.
Greece was ahead of us.
That their development was not a long, quiet river, it is evident in view of recent events.
The lowest tax rate in Europe?
That's wrong!
Latvia has a 0% corporate tax rate.
Now there is a real hypocrisy in France on the part of the policies on taxes actually paid by multinationals.
If you believe in a report published in 2008 or 2009, they pay less than 5% in France in general.
Only SMEs pay full pot.
Now I confirm that road traffic has become huge again, and there are new (and expensive) cars in every corner of the street, just like before the 2008 crisis.
I have been living in Dublin for 14 years, the recovery is evident in the daily lids since returning home.
Is this supposed to be economic news?
Don't worry, I'm sure the comments will be on fire soon.
In another article they are writing, 2 Vauxhaul Astra are involved in a hangover on the A140.
Does Ryanair now intend to transfer passengers from one flight to another in this way?
I think Mr. O'Leary will soon buy a whole new fleet of aircraft, so a few bosses and scratches on the old ones will soon be forgotten.
That said I’m flying with him next week, so I hope it won’t be on one of those two once rigged.
Then it would be entirely the fault of the other driver.
Has Ryanair paid passengers an extra fee for the additional fear that we wanted to provide them?
But without this kind of Irish business, you couldn't afford to go on vacation, young man.
I never took Ryanair and the last three times I took the plane it was with BA.
I prefer when the airline offers a quality service.
No, but it's Ryanair, so they can be happy.
Any article on Ryanair triggers dozens of comments from people who would never take Ryanair in place of those who like to take Ryanair and think that those who pay anything other than the basic fare only have to take care of themselves, etc.
It's pretty transparent.
Ryanair will not be satisfied with the additional costs due to this incident.
I wonder what the delays will be and whether it will be necessary to compensate passengers and, if so, whether Ryanair will be able to avoid paying by saying that this was a mistake of the airport air controllers.
Passengers were put on another plane in less than an hour, they are not entitled to any compensation.
Sorry to disappoint you and your dreams of compensation.
Welcome on board this British Airways flight that takes the English ISIS to Syria, not true as you say.
Good travel
Last Sunday in Paris, rue des Francs-Bourgeois: the Marais is largely pedestrian, and is literally crowding around the world.
People don’t come in mass for the quality of restaurants (some, for the most part) or for the White-Manteaux Magazine (hyper-intellectual and slightly dusty).
The reason for this crowd is that the shops are all open and that the neighborhood is incredibly lively and lively.
With a lot of foreigners spending.....
Do you think the opening of Sunday will create jobs?
Go to Paris Rue des Francs Bourgeois where the shops are open on Sunday, filled with 50% of tourists.
<0x40>Aloe is wrong.
The only argument that seems acceptable to me is that of the areas receiving a significant number of foreign tourists and it is nuanced by the fact that they purchase in detaxe.
Tourist areas lose a considerable volume of turnover each year for the same reasons.
It remains the industry where expensive equipment, operated on Sundays, allows to lower prices.
Sunday rest is a right to which, except for exceptions, employees are entitled.
This is why it is provided for and regulated by the Labour Code.
Neither the Minister in charge of the economy nor the Minister in charge of foreign affairs, have the slightest competence to reform the Labour Code.
While they're locking it.
What's the law for?
To satisfy a part of the population and businesses who wish to work on Sunday.
In Montreal on Sunday apm I take my young children to the municipal library.
In my city of 30,000 inhabitants where I live in France the municipal library is open 4 days a week but not the we!
This is access to culture...
This is also the regulation of working time.
the way of life that he defended with tenacity against fascism
the way of life that he defended with tenacity against fascism and bolshevism
What if his daughter's succession was, against her will, used to pay the succession fees?
There are paintings.
Some are good, others are not terrible.
No doubt his succession would want his share of the cake, if you pass me the expression.
His preference for a victory of the Nationalists/Franco in the Spanish Civil War...
And its hostility to the independence of places like Ireland and India and its fascist ideas as a whole and also add its well-known hatred of Jews.
Churchill was not perfect.
Neither do I.
But for five years, and only for five years, it was perfect.
In 1940 he headed the other aristocrats of the government who wanted to discuss a “deal” with the Nazis and he won very skillfully.
Thanks to his magnificent rhetoric and energy, he united the country in the idea that fighting fascists was the only way to win.
The inhabitants of the United Kingdom, and of France, and of Belgium, and, in the end, the whole world, can thank God for having had during these five years, just those five years, Churchill at the bar and no one else.
Churchill’s greatness has nothing to do with this discussion.
That his descendants sell the paintings on the free market to collect the money from the succession fees, they could even make a profit.
If the public wants to be able to admire one in a museum, let them raise the money to buy it.
It's as simple as that.
But we could use the tax money.
No one can deny that, when it was “the moment of truth,” Churchill’s personality was a positive advantage for his country during World War II.
A relaunch of the internal market through public works will only favor large companies, which will increase their dividends by avoiding hiring, as infrastructure works are by definition not renewable.
As for the social reforms advocated by the Minister, they reflect the real French evil: distrust of dialogue.
Return to Principles.
A reform of unemployment insurance is not contradictory.
May the weakest of us not be in need!
Either solidarily we come to his aid, or he has DROIT in exchange for the services he renders or has rendered to a minimum of resources.
The SM40H I prefer smic matches this vision.
There is also the taxpayer who lives on income from his property.
It is necessary to differentiate the person who invests for a return at the time of his retirement and the person who lives from his pensions.
A property to rent or even two for a couple above is vice
The little genius of Finance is singularly lacking in imagination.
The new deal was a policy of great work, but in an era of shortage of large infrastructure.
Today, in Europe and France, this is not the case.
Developed countries are over-equipped.
The need for infrastructure is marginal so in no way a new deal could be a solution.
Especially at a time when the question of decline arises in response to a recession which is only a brutal wild decline.
You would have been right 30 years ago: more needs (or possibilities) of dams, coal mines, highways...
But if we want to make the future climate-energy shock less rough, then the need for investment is screaming: isolation, rail network renovation, urban transport, transport and energy storage etc...
A tax that promotes high incomes and rents.
Who's in power?
Obsessed with smartphones.
Charles Arthur is really a galo.
Samsung’s profits are undermined by the iPhone 6 and its competitors of the same range
Apple’s mid-September introduction of larger screens for iPhone 6 and 6 Plus may have seduced buyers who would otherwise have bought a Galaxy
I tested all of these phones and decided on the LG G3.
So Samsung lost me as a customer, but not for Apple.
I think it is essential that we have an alternative.
When Microsoft established this philosophy, we experienced a decade of stagnation that was finally broken by Google, Apple and the open source community.
We need to have several dynamic platforms to stimulate competition and development.
In addition, we all have different needs and they can not be satisfied by a single manufacturer, because they are not compatible.
For me, I tend to buy Apple, because I like their underlying philosophy and I appreciate the design.
Some people don’t attach any value to design, for them the options, functionality and price are rewarding.
There's nothing wrong with that.
Let’s stop looking for a “better platform.”
Is there a “better car manufacturer”, not really, they are different, but similar.
I would like to see a thriving mobile industry, with radically different approaches for different people and markets.
It is healthier and should be encouraged.
This is in our interest to all.
I’m glad you found exactly what you were looking for and it’s not an Apple product, even though I made a different choice.
Most of the people I know have iPhones.
Our combative friends who, according to one of them, fight ideas and not men (on the contrary, much about Parisian idiots) could tell us which author(s) they are fighting ideas about the genre and point to the works that they just want to fight.
Or are they just attacking the genre as described in Le Figaro, Minute or Current Values?
Are their sources Judith Butler or Eric Zemmour?
Well, Jean, I love you well, and you're a smart and cultivated person.
I said this about Judith in Furusato's vein, referring to Holopherne, a rapprochement that had not come to me (I don't have her spirit vividness).
Otherwise, in the "depth" as you refer to it, I am not interested in this topic, and honestly I don't see where the problem is: I hoped you and your friends could get me out of my retreat, because I'm slow but I understand well...
<0x40>Jean: Recognize that, culturally, sending Judith back to Holopherne, it does.
Who is afraid to ask the world?
What are we afraid of those who are afraid of?
Furasato and <0x40> give us answers.
The first by invoking the Judith of the Bible, the second by calling Judith Butler a very symbolic neck cutter.
We can see how much these studies affect the most intimately in their home.
We are obviously no longer in the debate of ideas.
It's something else, much deeper.
<0x40> Have you read, John, that the World has published an article on the necessity of theology?
<0x40>: As for an idea debate, I thought we should go to the sources.
Pretending to fight ideas from the sole expository of their detractors (Cardinal Ratzinger, inventor of the theory of genre or X Lacroix, theologian) does not seem very rigorous to me.
But, as I explained to our friend, the whole difference is between having an informed opinion and a simple opinion.
I’m not sure that the nuance is understood.
I did not read Judith, the very symbolic neck cutter, I was satisfied with the "Second Sex" (it was more of my time) which I believe is the source of "the source" according to Lo's wishes.
As I watched the eclipse from Melbourne, I saw red lights when the moon briefly showed up when the clouds opened.
This sudden appearance of the red moon had its charm and compensated a little for the disappointment of having sometimes the view blocked by the clouds.
It was fabulous here at FNQ.
Yes, last night’s cloud would really close the coast of Victoria and NSW, while most of the rest of Australia had clear weather.
Flash special blood moon.
Tony Abbott/Joe Hockey makes the Labor responsible.
But if Labour accepts our unfair budget, we will give it its true color as soon as possible.
You're obsessed, aren't you?
I was in Melbourne then of course I saw only clouds.
Melbourne has also managed to cover up the entire week of the Persian meteor shower and for virtually all the major astronomical phenomena of recent years.
I begin to think that there is a bad genius whose sole purpose is to prevent the people of Melbourne from seeing anything from the sky.
Melbourne is really not the best place for an observatory, even though things are getting much better on the other side of the Cordillera.
There were periods of 10 to 20 minutes when I couldn’t see the eclipse because of the clouds above the suburbs of Melbourne.
I'm going to put a tax on this eclipse.
Whatever looks at this eclipse should pay a tax.
I bet your first thought of the day is for Abbott, just like your last thought before you go to bed.
Who or what will watch you when it ends up disappearing?
It seems that you spend a lot of time reading the discussions looking for messages in which people criticize the Abbott government and then accuse EUX of being obsessed.
Wonderful photo of the moon above Sydney's Harbour Bridge.
It looks like Mars is going to collide with Earth!
Nothing about stock and real estate speculation.
Nothing about the inequalities between labour and capital income.
Nothing about tax fraud.
Ultra-liberalism is killing Europe.
Nothing about the Gardens of Babylon...
The article says too much or not enough.
The details and arguments of these recommendations are not given.
There is no hyperlink to the original documents so you can make an opinion.
Today on Tuesday, October 15, you will see the results of the miracle recipes: in Spain, exports have been at their lowest in five years.
In Greece, the stock market collapsed.
However, it seems that these are the examples to follow.
The reform of the notaries would generate a claim for compensation of the order of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>8 billion.
The Ministry of the Economy says that these claims for compensation are not justified.
What if the Ministry of Economic Affairs makes a mistake?
Will the decision-makers who have engrossed in the political benefit resulting from the courageous attack of the notaries have the same courage when presenting the bill to the state budget?
The sequel in his time.
Okay, thank you, JYL...
<0x40>lol Non the State is not comparable to households in terms of the management of its budget because the time horizon of the State is theoretically infinite while that of the household is limited by the lifetime of its members.
In addition, unless public spending is considered to be improductive, it contributes to the financing of material and immaterial investments that guarantee future growth and therefore future revenues.
Some of the answers.
A regrettable decision.
But remember the sacred oath of Hippocrates: the health of the profits of global pharmaceutical companies must be preserved above all.
Nice theory of conspiracy.
Unfortunately, the truth does not correspond to your fantasy.
Medical staff would like to be able to use it, but they have the hands tied by the law as written by politicians.
This is the same situation as for the product that causes medical abortions rather than having risky surgical interventions, safe shooting rooms for drug addicts rather than having them on the streets, etc.
On these issues, politicians want to please the uncult masses.
In fact, doctors don’t make money with medications.
That's why there are pharmacists.
Doctors don't make money with medications Since Liberals want our health system to look like that of the United States, you should learn about how it works.
Doctors all over the world are courted in the same way, but it is more or less visible.
It may have been wrong to put the blame on the bullies, but the reality is that many countries, including Australia, prioritize the profits of businesses and “research”.
So read the few rare reports on our Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme spending and on negotiations with pharmaceutical companies compared to other countries.
Compare the global prices of medicines present everywhere, as well as the differences from one country to another on what is on sale free of charge or only on prescription.
It is a political and economic process, not a medical or scientific process, directly or indirectly.
In fact, some companies are currently testing marijuana inhalations for oncological pain, despite the laws that block them and the expensive necessary permits.
Although manufacturers of certain medications may not be happy that alternatives such as marijuana are being used, those who arrive at a version offering high-quality products at known doses will benefit greatly.
I'm sorry to tell you, ma'am, but you're wrong, there's a lot going on behind the scenes for doctors and pharmacy.
As for this hospital, they were happy to use it until someone puts the chip in the ear of an official of this hospital.
You can't hold patents on grass...
If “researchers” in social sciences were doing research rather than politics and networking, they might be using their “works.”
A researcher investigates, he does not compare a fact to another.
Comparing is not looking.
To compare is to make pedagogy not research.
You can’t say “the research is done, you have to apply it” and then in the same jet “you have to experiment at all.”
If your research is done, why experiment?
If your research isn't done, why do you ask for it?
Can you explain to me how a “researcher” can deduce that a student who cannot assimilate mathematics alone could more easily assimilate mathematics and other subjects?
New technologies allow us to learn on the condition that students learn to use new technologies, but how would they learn new technologies if they did not know how to learn?
Pisa tests are just an indicator we make an indicator that allows us to find indicators that are satisfactory to us.
What’s the use of building an indicator that informs you of what sets you apart, a self-promotion will, a scam?
There is only one way to train teachers: to distance sophists and ideologists from training and that practitioners teach practitioners.
re-read the paragraph on internships (which unfortunately is not very well-argued) and you will see that your conclusion leads us to the most inefficient conservatism: “It is a device that leads above all to the reproduction of the practices in force, and which does not make the system progress.”
Given the general consensus on the state of the French system, it is not possible to wish that practitioners only teach practitioners, even if they have all their place in modern teacher training.
Theorists of education must have no place.
Practitioners must have one.
Would you like to be operated on by a surgeon whose training is purely theoretical, and who has never put his foot in an operating block before?
There is no consensus on the causes of the problems of the education system.
Giving more weight to education theorists would be destroying it definitively.
Your analogy is totally fair: if I didn’t want to be operated by a practitioner who has only theoretical training, I’d even less like to be operated by a surgeon who has no theoretical training and who has learned about the tas.
Mike Weatherley, Conservative MP in charge of the fight against copyright infringement by David Cameron
Why didn't he just tell Cameron to stop?
Someone should make a popular arrest.
MDR exmayers thank you.
If one day I start to feel guilty about violating copyright, I’ll just read an article like this one.
In an information economy, copyright infringement <0x3D> stealing.
It is the same as they must cite their sources correctly.
Often, getting a license costs nothing.
No, it's a copyright infringement.
Not at all the same thing.
By using content without having the proper license, you deprive artists of their bread making.
You can still argue about pedant assumptions - but it's theft.
And you can repeat it as much as you want, it won’t be as true as it is.
This is a violation of copyright.
Come on, repeat it again.
If one day I start to feel guilty about violating copyright
Obviously, it doesn’t bother you to deprive artists of their income.
If they think they should receive money for images used in school duties, a near-perfect definition of what should be reasonable use, then I am happy to deprive them of this fictitious income.
Lesson No. 1 should be to show how, if children themselves create anything and post it on their favorite social networks, they give up any intellectual property on the site under the general conditions they have been through with a click.
Perhaps if they share the headphones of their mp3 walker with a friend in the school bus, they should be expelled for breaking the law that way.
Ah, if we could export that resource that we are loading up on, the scammer who says everything is wrong....
If it is a member of the PS who says it, then we have to believe it.
I have 2 children and when they are old enough to choose, I would advise them to leave France if nothing has changed by now.
France pulls people down by assisting them continuously.
I do not want my children to bear the debt that this policy will have created.
The thing that pulls France down is the speeches like yours.
<0x40>gus I have always been working in a private company.
I had the chance to have worked in companies run by excellent business leaders: it exists in France but it is rare.
I’m an employee because I know I don’t have the skills to run a business and this choice allows me to shoot red balls on the zero bosses I meet frequently.
Comfortably in my baskets I totally share the post of Jean-Pierre Bernajuzan: he says the horrific truth!
<0x40>gus, if you compare with the German companies that French business leaders are constantly citing to ask for reforms in France, in Germany companies have managed to structure their industrial fabric to make it competitive, especially by ensuring the link between large and medium-sized enterprises?
That the state holds their hand?
Is that the state they're accusing of impertinence?
<0x40>Jacques L.
Always this anti-corporate couplet on your part!
Remind me, what did you create as a job, as a value added, to be so severe?
<0x40>Pat I understand your reaction.
In fact, France is facing an unresolved problem: the incompetence of French business leaders unable to create jobs and who build and undermine while waiting for the permanent assistant of the state!
That's terrible!
But they have solutions: removal of the Labour Code, employer charges, taxes, working 45 hours/week paid 35, and some, walking on eggs, dare to demand the reduction of wages otherwise their removal!
I look forward to seeing all the “negative” comments on this subject.
What is ironic is the way people always complain about First Group.
Based on what I see from where I am, Last hasn’t really been an investment for us taxpayers.
They tried to keep themselves flowing rather than transforming themselves.
This does not mean that the Scottish railroads have not improved since Last took care of them.
But they also improved with their predecessors, including British Rail.
Unfortunately, we do not have the power to do that.
I've tried to have them recently, but I haven't succeeded.
Well, Labour is going to get us bored, isn't it?
It is an international subsidiary.
They already operate trains in Germany.
Nothing stops people in the UK from creating a more moral business and taking part in bids.
But it seems that we are not very good at managing, most of our privatized services end up being managed by a foreign operator.
I still remember the scandal and criticism when First won the Virgin contract, all so that the decision was finally cancelled.
And there’s better: MTR, a Hong Kong company won the Crossrail operating contract for 8 years.
Well, Labour, as they repeated it to us during the referendum campaign, is totally for sharing and sharing and thinks that workers should all support each other across borders.
We can therefore assume that they will be happy with this decision ;)
Perhaps it is because the management of the Dutch is on good tracks while the management of the British is not.
What ScotRail needs is not just a change of ownership but, above all, new ideas.
Abellio is perhaps the least bad choice possible, but the real problem is the ridiculous franchise system, not the franchisor.
“It was a batting girl.”
God, I hate it, but I really hate that kind of expression.
Assuming that being "battled" is a higher quality than many others, the concern of others, the intelligence, listening, for example, being "battled" has nothing to do with surviving a disease: cancerous "battled" who are not less dead than I am.
Getting out of an illness has nothing to do with merit.
Let's start again, too.
I’m not telling you that it’s the condition to manage, I’m telling you that it helps.
Nothing to do with any merit...!
When in the example of your life, there is only you to judge them.
I'll start again.
Insinuating, whether for a moment, that one may have the merit to get out of a disease or that one may be demerited not to get out of it, is simply monstrous.
The body either follows or does not follow.
A body that's cowardly, everywhere, despite the will, despite the trust in medicine, you have a vague idea of what C is?
Desired to think otherwise, if, having a solid morality may make it easier to accept heavy treatments and prepare for them, to try experimental treatments like this woman did and not refuse them out of fear.
Someone who is battling in medicine is first and foremost someone who trusts in medicine.
But if you prefer to go back to the "Lord" it's something else.
Not with merit, not with courage.
These considerations are typical of moralists.
When you catch a dirt, a real one, you're getting rid of yourself to the point of becoming just a zombie.
Personally, I caught two of them, dirt, big ones, and if I got "fighted" as these psychologists say, it completely escaped me.
Unless this fight consists only in tightening the teeth, suffering hell, and getting kicked.
I thought the charge against Milosevic had been decided and finalized about a decade ago.
I haven't seen that name in the newspapers since at least that time.
What's going on?
It's a birthday.
A Forgotten Birthday.
His trial was conducted “quickly” and then wiped under the carpet.
Is that the story we told at the time?
The communist became a nationalist who sparked three wars in the Balkans over the past decade?
The Communist President of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia?
So please ask what we have voluntarily left aside: 1.
How could NATO’s bombings be legal under the SMALL rule of international law?
Which country has Serbia been attacked by?
About RTS (Radio-Television-Serbia), why not mention that NATO destroyed this same building by killing civilians and then considered it a valid target.
Milosevic had no way out of it: if he did not defend his country against NATO attacks, he would be crucified as a traitor.
And if he defended it, he would be swallowed by the western compressor roller.
The Westerners used a smoke screen to detach a part of a sovereign State that later unilaterally proclaimed its independence and was well-recognized by the Western States that later ended up lying about the situation on the ground.
The Serbian population has now completely disappeared (ethnic cleansing).
Vojislav Kostunica, mentioned here, died politically after his first term of office because he did not understand the situation that had developed.
Zoran Djindjic was one of the most controversial figures in the political world of the time.
In the end, the Guardian should not qualify Milosevic as a tyrant (even if we didn’t like him).
As far as I know, there is only one method for predicting earthquakes in Greece that works roughly, measuring the piezoelectric level in the quartz.
This kind of study is undoubtedly useful and thank you for letting us share the results.
This water has nothing to do with that of an exoplanet called HAT-P-11b, located about 124 light-years from Earth in the constellation Cygnus that would be "the smallest and coldest planet in the Universe to present a detachable, draconian water molecule.
The method to follow.
Just like those involving animals feeling a threat to come.
Thank you, Passeur de la Science, for often taking advantage of these experimental prowess that are realized in the world.
How Do Animals Know (Advanced)?
Undoubtedly by the perception of other elements whose rate evolves in the event of an earthquake.
Like radon, for example.
A gas has a priori odorless for humans but may be noticeable by animals.
All these methods are undetectable for man, but not for the measuring instruments at his disposal.
But we don't have a reliable result on these tracks...
It has been observed many times (and for centuries) that some animals act strangely for a few hours with an earthquake, especially chickens, cows, dogs but especially fish and snakes.
I had seen an art report about the fight between two scientific teams, one in California and the other in Japan, to recognize the validity of their work on animal sensitivity to terrestrial magnetic fields, and more particularly their modification before an earthquake.
I am not a scientist, but their assumptions convinced me.
Or are we doing these researches?
Why is there so much disdain for this track?
We should learn to listen to nature again.
If you examine things calmly and rigorously, you publish it in a serious journal, and no one despises it.
As soon as we talk about the “signs” given by the animals, we clash in the same way: everyone will remember that 5 minutes before an earthquake the red fish turns bizarrely round.
I don't understand that we can think Boris would make a good leader for the Conservatives.
He has done too much as the mayor of London.
When you listen to the LBC program, you can't stop thinking that this man knows nothing about it and that he's always trying to entertain with a joke.
He never responds directly to anything.
He also said he agreed with Farage, and then Nick Ferrari the presenter asked him about what.
He couldn't name a single point.
He made so many promises to be elected mayor and did not keep one.
It's just pointing out how much the rest of the Conservative Party is just a bunch of shit, isn't it?
Because it's popular.
Because it's funny.
He was in “Have I Got News For You.”
Because it's a celebrity and people have been inculcated in the worship of celebrities.
The Londoners voted for him, and so will the rest of the country.
When (and not if) he takes the lead of the party, the popularity rating of the Tories will crack the ceiling I'm sure of.
May God help us.
I’m not so sure about it: people like jokes, but they don’t want their prime minister to be a joke.
That’s exactly what the Londoners said.
He should have brought his friend the parpaing, smarter than him.
In many ways, I think he's trying to copy R Branson
The Americans had one as president.
The French really and always disinterested in the history of the Pacific War.
For all those who have given themselves the opportunity to read a few books (there is one, including a French and excellent B.
Millot), the “South” and the “street of iron” speak, as unfortunately as the dead who remained there.
It is understood that the Australians, who know (one of their heavy cruisers, Australia, has always been there since the Battle of Savo) did not want to return there.
We actually passed the island of Savo, in the “Iron Bottom Sound”.
Even if the mission comes to an end.
It's the little ones.
But the ecolo side is a total smoke.
Calculate the kerosene consumed to achieve the goal of fully decredibilising the concept.
Just browse the list of sponsors that philanthropists.
An operation of com more does not do nor does.
The cow, it gives too much desire!!!
I look forward to the web series!
Your recit makes me reevaluate, identifying myself a little at the crossing (I also learned to navigate with the Crocos de L'Elorn at the Moulin Blanc in turn of Brest!).
Hat also for the ecological message, although some criticize the impact of travel.
The end justifies the means.
Continue to make us review, and proudly show that the Bretons are great travelers!
Pierre, from Trinidad and Tobago.
Bonsoir I think the red badge that has been shown against taxes is happy to know that this trip is sponsored by the Region Brittany and the City of Brest.
More seriously, it seems to me that local communities and public bodies of any kind should not dedicate one of our taxes to financing the dreams of some even as friendly adventurers as they are!
Are there any players in the current Serbian training who are of Kosovo origin?
I know that Dusan Bajevic in Lyon and Milos Krasic, once at Juventus and now at Fenerbahçe, are from Mitrovica, but I don’t know if they are still in the team.
This is Bisevac, the defender of Lyon, not Bajevic.
Bajevic was in midfield or before in the 70s and 80s and has coached many teams in Greece, but I don’t know where he is from.
Bajevic is from Mostar, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and played as an attacker in the large team of Velez who, under the tutelage of the legendary Suleman Rebac, finished twice in second place in the Yugoslav league (and also had scores such as Vahid Halilhodzic and the teammate We'Arboré.
Well, thank you, Mole!
Of course I know Halilhodzic and Primorac.
Just by curiosity, what happened to Krasic?
It was said that he was going to be a great player when he was at Juve, he is currently in Turkey, but the last time he appeared on my radar screen he was tied to Blackburn *frisson*
There, I can't help you.
I know he lost his place when Conte arrived, then he went to the Fener and as far as I know there's no holder.
Maybe he's still doing something, maybe in the Indian Super League?
Seriously, Serbia.
Seriously, Albania is not afraid.
You should love Albania because you are neighbors.
The thing is that the flag of this drone is not the flag of the true Albania of today.
Apparently it was the flag of Greater Albania, which encompasses all regions where there is an important Albanian presence.
A bit of exaggerated nationalism, in fact.
Fortunately, there was not much damage (that I know).
In fact, it was an Albanian flag with the map not of what is called Great Albania, but of Albania before 1913, when the great European powers decided to end the country to neighboring countries.
How could one have felt “an explosion of joy” when two towers collapsed knowing that women, men and undoubtedly children were inside?
How???
What bothers me a little in this "testimony" is that the only fact that I could, if only once, spontaneously rejoice in the horrific death of thousands of people, bears witness to in my eyes of a "border line" personality whose "testimonies" should be taken with greater circus.
Without a doubt, in the short moment of "joy", we will not have thought of the dead or the reality of the horror inflicted.
One would have just thought, for a moment, that, for once, Muslims had succeeded in doing real and apocalyptic harm to the great evil Satan in his very heart.
It's a powerful QQ.
That's great.
It seems that this feeling has been shared by thousands of Muslims plundered by their sense of humiliation.
With testimonials filmed in Palestine.
Classical delight.
We doubted it a little bit.
The West "Christian/white/gaulish" cannot measure the degree of frustration, anger, hatred of the Muslim when he contemplates the general misery, the social and cultural underdevelopment of the Muslim world today.
I'm talking about the suburbs of Cairo or Algeria, not the towers of Dubai.
The splendour of the past, certainly magnificent, is not a consolation, on the contrary.
How to get the Muslim world out of this diabolical funnel?
Totally in phase, two major poisons irrigate the Arab world: bigot conservatism of the powers in place and fascist nihilism.
The common point, the freezing of thought and the excommunication (soft or armed) of its critical expression.
As we have seen before, we must not turn back the Muslims.
That's the only way.
Edwy Plenel reads this article.
I suppose that is true in many countries.
But in Britain, autumn marks the beginning of six long dark, wet and depressing months that affect the well-being and mood of many people.
In addition, everyone gets sick.
Seasonal depression.
I'm suffering from it myself.
When the light goes away, it becomes hell for me and those like me.
A dose of vitamin D should help a little for mood and well-being.
Autumn is beautiful in Great Britain, with or without rain.
The campaign is particularly breathtaking in the autumn.
Not so much to cut off the breath as the green of summer when everything is alive instead of being about to die.
In the UK, if you are lucky, summer falls on a weekend.
We had a beautiful summer this year, don’t make your grinch that radones pictures!
Not everyone.
You rarely get sick in winter.
But now I'm retired and I'm no longer developing immunity to the germs out there, it can change, I suppose.
It's not about to die, it's just a step in a cycle...
A wonderful step full of odors, with a febrileness culminating with festivities like Halloween, Guy Fawks, Christmas, the risks of snow and full of other wonderful words.
It’s enough not to stop doing things!
Here are my recommendations for the holidays for you.
Yes, these dark and grey months actually make me much happier and more relaxed.
For the taxation of child allowances , the amount collected by the State is essentially derived from deciles 8 to 10 .
However , as regards the number of households that have seen their tax increases following this measure , it is mainly the deciles 4 and 5 that are concerned ( median income ) as shown in Figure 2 .
The elimination of half of the part concerning especially widows is not at all discussed in the article or rather its impact is completely under-evaluated: 230M euros is a joke that does not take into account the impact in 2012 and 2013 and assumes that it is painless.
And he's not ready to fix it.
Well, we're not on the stick, of course, but thinkers
For once the PS is doing a policy rather left-wing, we won’t cry...
It is obvious that those who are among the richest 20% must bear much more than 75% of the tax increase, why not 90%?
Keep doing this and you will encourage these 20% less to work or leave.
Well, I know, it's not politically correct, but I say it anyway.
Live the recycled Trots and OCIs in the PS: they got it all.
Adam, you don't see what you're looking at.
The proportion is still the same, here or in Bahrain: 20% of the population owns 80% of the wealth.
A fair tax is when it prohibits anyone from collecting as much as they can.
Beyond a certain limit, money loses all its utility.
And once the utility of money is outdated, money serves only to make money, that is, to make the misfortune of the greatest number.
They are among the richest 20%.
Undoubtedly also the 20% of households that work most (and create wealth some of which is logically redistributed).
A fair tax must enable these households to enjoy part of their efforts.
Or so much lowering your arms and living social minimums, especially if you have a social housing.
Fortunately, the utopias of the Khmer Rouge head cutters have survived.
I recently made two AirBnBs in Norway.
No problem.
In one of the two, we had things we wouldn't have had in a 5 star hotel and we didn't have to show up at the reception or face the slightest trouble.
All you have to do is go to someone's house, sleep there, camp behind you and leave.
This will be my first choice when I travel.
The logo has changed, people...
Check your insurance before renting your home.
In most cases, you will need some kind of owner insurance.
Be sure to use a service with the right logo!
Ah, 6:00 too late.
I love Airbnb.
“It’s very dangerous and highly risky” No, it’s not true.
You've just really missed your chance.
According to the link provided in the article:
At its discharge, Airbnb’s response to Teman was fast, almost absurdly fast.
Within 24 hours, according to an email provided to Gawker by Teman, Airbnb had sent a locksmith to change locks, made arrangements to spend a week at the hotel and transferred <0x24>23,817 (for which Airbnb is insured, but still).
So why does this article quote Teman complaining that he has not received any support from Airbnb?
I LOVE AIRBNB, to receive as to travel
Hello I am looking for people who have already used air bnb just to reassure me.
I’m considering paying a deposit and one month rent at a time but I’m a little afraid to send <0xC2><0xA3>1,600 to a site I’ve never really heard of.
But where are we going?
“Supporting the troops,” the Bu<0x24>herie sang in every tone.
Weapons are inoffensive.
I am sure it will please the families and relatives of the thousands of Kurds who died in Halabja to learn that their parents and friends have succumbed to anything other than the chemical bombings of Saddam Hussein.
Unless the content of the article has been radically modified by the author, your comment is inappropriate (to stay polite).
In addition, what would this mass murder committed in 1988 prove that chemical weapons discovered nearly 20 years later were still usable?
It is not hyper clear the author's style: "in search of weapons of mass destruction.
We're fine.
You think it's time to weaken the army to strengthen education.
This is never the time to strengthen education, because we are still at war.
Alternative: Is it ALWAYS the time to strengthen education, because we are still at war?
Education would be greatly enhanced if we had “they” to work 35 hours instead of 17 hours.
At the moment, our teachers are earning more than engineers.
And don't let us believe that teachers spend 18 hours a week preparing their program.
But this cannot be seen since the National Education does not have the means to provide an office to the college/lycée to its teachers so they work at home.
A kind of forced teleworking as a whole, except that the employer pays neither the computer, nor the internet connection, nor the supplies.
By the way, it's so much the board at 17h a week and 4 months of vacation that we can't get to fill the CAPES of maths, come on, we're waiting for you.
How come you don't want to breed poorly educated puppies that your parents scare you off by treating you like a slut?
I think that the priority in this area is to disarm the jihadists so that the people of the Kurds can flourish better.
Where it is seen that the Bush administration has absolutely everything through.
My first graduate job was in the sale, in London, to win three times nothing and it was still a job that required a degree.
A year later, I saw an ad to be a worker for the London Underground, it was paid <0xC2><0xA3>5,000 extra per year and we didn’t even ask for the patent.
I've never regretted it.
In this regard, don’t worry if you don’t find a graduate job, try to find something either that pays well or that you like to do.
If I had stayed in graduate jobs, I would still be paying my student loan
I don’t like business work so much, so I hope to eventually move either in the public service or in the university world.
LOL LOL LOL This article is really late!
Exactly, when I graduated in 2011, there was already a three-year delay.
The best way to reduce the number of unemployed graduates?
Getting rid of biased strands such as art / letters / theatre / media / philosophy / political sciences, that is, what are called unemployed degrees.
I have one of those degrees and I'm finished production manager.
It turned out that the important was not the degree but, as the article above says, a good career path, starting at school and throughout the university.
Of course, the starting salary was lower, but the scales are rapidly rising because in the real world what counts is the results more than the knowledge.
This debate of engineering/artistic studies has been going on for years.
Scientists can’t solve all problems, it’s more important to be able to get up in the morning, get to work on time, and interact with people in order to get results.
Letters, philosophy and art are biased strands?
That's ridiculous.
I guess you're talking about media studies degrees or whatever the absconde sector you've been to.
Letters, philosophy, political science and art are real branches.
We need people who can explain the big questions to high school students, who understand the importance of the basics of culture such as literature, art, etc., and value them.
Wouldn’t it be better to have a real territorial policy to dismantle Paris and dynamize the rest of France?
Personally, I do not see the inhabitants of the end-fond of the Essonne and the Val-d'Oise doing 80km round-trip every day by bike to come to work in Paris.
Intra-muros and small belt residents already have many more convenient means of public transport (metro, bus, tramway).
> Several secure and closed parks, as they already exist in northern European cities, in Dijon or Lyon, will be installed on the road.
That's a good idea.
On the surface, the space is cannibalized by the 2RM.
Incidentally, it is hoped that the City of Paris will work with professionals from the Netherlands and Denmark.
So much benefit from their extensive experience in the field.
Well, we didn't find room for A ONLY bike hanging device.
Motivation seems stronger when it comes to finding an office for Bertrand Delano<0xC3><0xAB>....
Well, it's not okay at all.
When we talk with pedestrians and other users of the common transports, we don't talk about the common reasons why they don't pedal before it seems to me that the main reasons that emerge are: 1/ it's very dangerous to go with all these vans, these trucks, these scooters (these are super fast driving, the motor scooters are super fast, and the speeding of the bikes is very fast.
Cycling trails are apartheid, we need to cohabit but rebalance the occupancy of urban space.
Nothing on the bike in the big Paris?
Not a word about the place of the bike in public transport?
EELV is right.
The goal of 15% sailing is ridiculous.
I'm beginning to believe that Anne Hidalgo drove the greens into the flour.
Moreover, according to the OR report, the adjoining EELVs seem skeptical.
I prefer to be optimistic.
Before the racket starts, it would be better to find out who really hides behind this massacre.
Note: This is not Russia.
Not sure how to love how the world evolves.
That looks awful.
My children are not a financial asset.
A lawyer has expressed his intention to bring the case to the CEDH, but I have not heard that a complaint has actually been filed.
In addition, they would have to file a complaint first in Germany or Ukraine.
I also expect these cases to be postponed pending the outcome of the accident investigation report and the criminal investigation that would result from it.
Yes, but Libya did not blow up Pan Am 103 either.
Malaysia Airlines is not wrong, the fault lies with the airspace security authority, in this case the Ukrainian government.
Was the accident predictable?
Other aircraft had previously been shot down, Ukraine was launching in the area of airstrikes against the rebels, and any aircraft could of course be considered a possible and immediate threat.
Has the Ukrainian government taken reasonable precautions in view of an obvious threat, or has it chosen to play with the lives of innocents so that airlines pay the rights to fly over the territory?
Where are all the pro-Kiev trolls who defend their usurper government / the ultranationalists of Western Ukraine – and who want to demonstrate in bulk that Putin shot down the MH17 flight.
As far as I know, there is already a complaint against the Kiev government because they are responsible for what is happening in their sky.
Previous: A 1986 International Court of Justice ruling that the CIA’s supply of weapons to the rebel forces of the Contras in Nicaragua did not mean that the United States was responsible for their actions.
There is no chance that Russia will not let this matter go to the CIJ.
It’s funny to think that Abbott means to Putin that Australians were murdered by rebels supported by Russia.
I hope he can present evidence to support his allegations.
So far, the investigators have not said anything like that.
To be called Ricardo and to be such an eco-friendly, it's awful!
To be called Polaire is to lose the north is joyful.
There is only one question: is the poor of today poorer than the poor of yesterday?
I can’t help but notice that those who criticize Piketty’s book most virulently haven’t read it!
It is easy to read, I took a few days.
It shows the statistical evolution of income-production, income-capital, inequality-concentration, inequality of labour income, capital ownership, merit and inheritance in the log term.
It shows that today’s concentration of capital joins that of the beginning of the 20th before 1914, it shows that it was the two world wars that reduced the concentration of capital from 1914 to 1945, and then how the concentration resumed after...
Bernajuzan: You said no to what.
I ask you how long it took you to read this pavement knowing that an individual’s concentration capacity has some limits.
Then the question is not whether it is easy to read.
The question is whether the summary of the central thesis given by the press is correct or not.
If it is right, one can argue about it without having read the book, the main thing being to argue unilaterally in favor of it.
No, it's easy to read...
Bernajuzan: How long did you take to read it?
Is the central thesis of his paper summarized by the press false?
I haven't read it and won't read it.
I therefore trust in the summary of his central thesis and it is that which seems to me pure fumistry.
The difference between rich and poor is subsidiary.
Hasn’t humanity been enriched in general?
And this enrichment added to an increase in the population is the real political issue today.
Malala Yousafzai is an impressive personality and certainly deserves the award.
But remember, she's only 17 years old.
An age at which most people just start to find their place in the world.
I hope that this award will not be a burden to the girl and that she will find her way to a happy life.
The problem is not the price but the political capital of Western governments who want to prove the old adage that the perverse colors are the incarnation of evil.
All my wishes of happiness to Malala, but she must realize that she is being used and that nothing will be done to educate girls in Pakistan or elsewhere - not even in the popular neighborhoods of Great Britain!
Somebody thought his speech was a little weird.
She thanked her father for giving her a lot of freedom but mentioned that, if she wasn’t where she is now, she would have been married at the age of 14.
Isn’t Malala herself one of those “perverse colors”?
You should not have “antenna time” on this site.
You yourself are a terrible perverse.
It's absolutely revolting.
No, her father was not going to marry her at the age of 14.
She was 15 when she was shot.
His father runs a school where girls are schooled and he is in favour of equal rights for women.
He is, and has always been, for her to receive higher education and to have the right to decide for herself on her marriage.
However, he is an unusual person in Pakistan, as he thinks that women are equal to men.
What she said is that an average Pakistani girl often has to marry at age 14, without having her word to say.
I'm sorry she didn't say it eloquently enough for you.
This may seem contradictory, but may she mean that, if her father hadn’t given her freedom, she would have been married at the age of 14
Rather disappointed by this entry in terms of season 4 and especially by Jessica Lange who apparently has a bit of difficulty finding her marlene dietrich's soulmate character.
I just watched the last two seasons that are quite different but I have to admit that this is one of the best horror series, one of the most successful!
A fascinating first episode.
The performance is close to perfection and the show of Jessica Lange singing Bowie’s anachronistic Life on Mars is simply overwhelming.
I haven’t watched this new season yet (which will be the last for me, without Lange bof bof).
In the case of American Horror Story, I’d rather have all of a sudden than watch 13 episodes spanning 3 to 4 months.
But one thing is for sure, apart from the extraordinary Jessica Lange, is the risks of set-ups and set-ups that overwhelm me.
There is an avalanche of original plans in AHS that ridicules the acceptance of today's productions.
It's a little tricky to see you throw the sponge in advance for the coming seasons without even waiting to be able to gauge the quality of it.
Jessica Lange is certainly a pillar of this series but, you say so well, there are many other things.
It’s not just that for me Jessica Lange (and above all her way and how she uses it) is really one of the pillars of the series beyond the technical qualities.
I'm looking at her a lot.
Then I find that the series sins by writing, it wants too much to do things at the same time.
Season 3 was slightly below, in season 2 it was too dispersed despite a few excellent episodes.
I don't see them doing 10 seasons of American Horror Story or it's gonna end up like 24 hours chronos what.
Everybody does what they want!
It’s by what I say “I won’t look again” that everyone is obliged to do the same!
I just share my point of view nothing more, nothing less.
The loss of Jessica Lange, I think she'll be fatal to him.
But after that, that's just my opinion.
Let's talk less about tax increases, please - cut rather in state spending.
No, let's increase the expenses, please.
Those who wanted to know about the expenses failed.
Causing controversy about relatively small spending positions, such as development assistance
The problem is that this represents less than the margin of error in government spending in the UK.
The truth is that we are all talking about nuances rather than change of orientation that voters seem to call out of their wishes and during this time some, in each camp, make it seem that these nuances are much more important and substantial than they are - and voters see them clearly and play with their faith.
Less than 1% of expenditure.
The “debt” is an asset held mainly by financial institutions in this country.
The “debt” is nothing to worry about.
I would see no problem with the government appropriating a third of my income (before even talking about consumption taxes) if I thought it was going to be used in good faith.
But this is not the case, and many taxpayers have the same feeling.
It is said that Nigel Farage has not been quite honest about how to reduce taxes, but good, if you add our net contribution to the EU, development aid, High Speed 2, wind turbine subsidies that are almost unnecessary and nuclear power plants that cost twice as much as they should cost them, and we're going to get to them.
Your first <0xC2><0xA3>10,000 is not taxable.
This means that someone who earns <0xC2><0xA3>35,000 a year will pay about <0xC2><0xA3>5,000 (a seventh of their salary), someone with <0xC2><0xA3>50,000 would pay around <0xC2><0xA3>10,000 (a fifth), etc. and someone with <0xC2><0xA3>200,000 will pay about <0xC2><0xA3>70,000 (a little more than a third).
What about social contributions?
Plus social contributions, plus local taxes, plus parking fees and car widget, and that's before VAT.
Almost exactly 30% of my money is taken from the source before local taxes and the car widget.
I'm paid decently, but not extravagantly.
Not that it’s a problem, of course, I’m happy to pay my taxes.
But let’s not pretend to believe that money falls from the sky, or that it’s not important to know where billions of pounds of taxes go.
How can an unemployed who is looking for door-to-door work prove it?
Even if 20% of the unemployed would not search, that means 80% would search and not find.
Being myself unemployed, do I have more interest in what others are looking for or not?
If a potential recruiter gets 10 or 20 CV, that increases my chances.
Actually, I haven't had any news from Pole Jobs in months, that means that agents are more busy with checking operations than really getting job ads back?
I don't see the interest.
Because it is not for the state to provide work.
If Pole Employment does not provide enough jobs, then you need to switch from Pole Employment.
What is it about a sensitive subject?
We all have rights and duties, in which case we ensure that the unemployed perform well their duties in return for their rights.
Just as a controller asks the users of a means of transport for their transport, a service manager or employees of their work, etc.
No one cries at the scandal in these cases, right?
It is indeed good to remember that the unemployed have rights: the only two times that I had to deal with Pôle Emploi, my rights to the ARE had been poorly established, and on one of the files, amputated by 40%, it had to be fought hard.
It's gonna take time!
I'm not an expert in law.
Fixing and control is taking over at present, while statutory Pole Employment is close to being, in fact, an insurance company.
I would add that the subject of compensation should concern only the employees, they are the ones who pay the contributions.
Politicians and non-paid French people are giving themselves rights that they do not actually have!
That's not normal.
I would add that a decent unemployment insurance contributes to the promotion of paid labour.
More Than Waiting for Assassin's Tweets in Arabic
In fact, there needs to be a direct military response in Iraq/Syria that will stop ISIS so that the virus does not reach this conflict zone.
The situation would then resemble the spread of the black plague in 1348/9 in connection with war and population displacement at the time.
The Saudis had the spirit to ban Hajj in Mecca this year from Muslim pilgrims from the three affected countries.
El País reports that 7,400 have been denied their visa application because of their country of origin or recent travel.
In fact, there was the case of a pilgrim from Bosnia who contracted the variole in Mecca during the Hadj in the 1980s, probably contaminated by a pilgrim from Somalia, where the disease still exists.
I hope the rest of the world will have the same spirit.
Does it mean being heartless to propose to prevent Ebola patients from taking a plane to Europe?
I thought it was simple common sense, but apparently those “knowing” decided that we could risk the lives of tens of thousands of people...
Those countries in West Africa where Ebola is out of control should be placed in strict quarantine.
No one's coming out.
Only health personnel can enter.
21 days of waiting after treating patients before they can leave.
If they contract the Ebola virus while they are there, they stay there until they are cured.
These are not draconian measures.
Only last week, people were contaminated after having had contact with people in West Africa although they took “all the necessary precautions.”
We can stop the progress of this disease.
It is predominantly spread by airlines.
We forbid them to offer to fly to these countries.
In addition, customs officers at airports should be trained to identify people with typical Ebola symptoms, so that they can be placed immediately in quarantine.
Let him pass the message of the first individual and of the group (including religious) second and he will have earned the Nobel Peace Prize.
I doubt it will be able to erect in dogma the image of God characterised by the total cortex of the planet in operation.
It is still far from that conception there.
It has only been 20 years since information has emerged as the given premium of humanity, while religion, coming from the brain, has been directing our actions since maybe Lucy.
What is the point of becoming a Protestant church?
For those who have not noticed, Catholicism is largely a minority in France today, no one is forced to join it.
Those who criticize would not in any way put their feet on the Church, there is only a small number of Protestants in France.
What is the next step, to remove the notion of sin, too "anxiety"?
<0x40>louise: Sorry, the church does not have a limited vision of France.
And in the world, it may be that it will affect more people...
<0x40>Martine E, to be honest (as usual) respect for others as you consider it to have preexisted with Christ.
Hillel once said, “Don’t do to others what you don’t want them to do to you, that’s the whole Torah and the rest is just commentary: go and study!”
Christianity goes far beyond a mere reciprocity but introduces agape.
Your "progressing justice, peace, fraternity" but without God?
Is it a return to communism? :-)
The next step is to remove incarnation and resurrection.
Jesus will remain the hero who has disrupted moral laws by redefining respect for others.
Christians will then be ready to take on their role in the ethical debates of our societies and to advance justice, peace and fraternity.
Not very Catholic?
I think I remember that the low number of Protestants in France is mainly due to the fact that their ancestors were exterminated and then converted by force and pushed to immigration a few centuries ago.
I'm too hesitant to buy this, the new Alien game, or Wasteland 2.
And the new game Elite is coming out soon.
It's not invented.
Personally, I would choose SoM.
I like Wasteland 2 (I even participated in its fundraising campaign) but I don’t think it’s worth <0xC2><0xA3>30.
If you are interested in the PC version, Green Man Gaming currently sells SoM for <0xC2><0xA3>30 and also offers a 20% discount coupon.
Green Man Gaming currently sells SoM for <0xC2><0xA3>30 and also offers a 20% discount coupon.
I'll take a look.
Obviously not at work.
The IT department's discounts block all nice sites.
Hello, is it <0xC2><0xA3>30 then 20% discount, or does the <0xC2><0xA3>30 include the 20% discount?
Attention, however, the PC version is only for DX11.
It took me by surprise, I bought it, but I can't play it.
Besides, I bought it on Steam, so no refunds, it's null.
It's time to buy a new video card *make the mouth*
It's a Brazilian site, but you get a valid Steam identifier, I think.
Caveat Emptor and all that: I didn’t use it myself.
Amazon <0xC2><0xA3>30 for PC, <0xC2><0xA3>35 for Xbox 360 and PS3, <0xC2><0xA3>44 for Xbox and PS4
Thank you, I'd be afraid that one day they'll delete it from your library if they decide to force it against the people who buy it there while they're out of the planned area.
So join the beta version of Elite: Dangerous.
So, was France in 1940 a "putrid terror"?
So, tell me, this Nobel Prize looks like a poisoned gift to me.
Should we love the France of 40, the France of the “Strange Defeat”?
When you see who gets the Nobel Prize in literature, you wonder if Proust or Dostoyevsky would have it today.
The Nobel Prize is not even an event, we don’t even want to read the award-winning authors.
Will Brazilians, Chinese, or Australians read Modiano, which is already difficult to read in French and which describes a universe so limited and so egocentric?
I hope the other Nobel laureates are more credible, but I honestly doubt it.
Modiano, Levy, Musso have only a distant relationship with literature.
Did you at least read it?
Or another Nobel Prize?
It would be better to judge.
As for the Chinese, the Brazilians and others, don’t worry about them.
Foreigners are very sensitive to French literature and culture, they are.
They will appreciate M.
Modiano at his fair value, if they don't already know him!
On your side, continue to attend Lévy and Musso.
I share your opinion.
Marc Levy and Guillaume Musso keep all their chances.
So let's see who won the Nobel Prize in Literature: H.
Pinter and 2005, D.
Greetings to the cowards.
Ever since I drove one in Iceland, I’ve never stopped seeing Kia Sportage everywhere.
I think this thing has followed me so far.
Maybe she's trying to crush me?
Or do you think I'm going to be the horror computer of Superman III?
Hello Dantra, still hating you?
Hello DQ - no, not today, I took my doctors.
It's Wednesday!
I had a few days of rest.
That was cool.
Last weekend I went to the Nottingham Beer and Cider Festival.
It was borderline.
I managed to taste 19 different beers, Wobbly Weasel being one of my favorites.
I was pleasantly surprised by the mix of people there, there were not only CAMRA fanatics (not to be confused with the camera fanatics).
Driving on Sunday's return was really hard.
On Monday night we went to a friend’s grandfather’s house to play nine card brag.
Thanks to a real chance of a beginner I was able to go back with several decent bets.
I hope that if I reach the age of 95 I will be as vivid as he is.
Last night I went to a chic cocktail bar in Farringdon.
One of my drinks arrived with a piece of shit on it.
I admire M.
Read a bit of Buddha and you will understand how wrong you are, dear Christian.
That being said, without wanting to bother you, I think you're getting a little off the subject.
This famous totality forbids quests for jihadists at the exit of the mosques.
They report weapons trafficking without delay.
Either you have big eyes open like Meddeb and Taïa or Boubaker or you have big eyes closed.
We have to choose.
It is not by keeping your eyes closed that you can access the light.
Forgive me, dear Christian, but once again you make a monumental counter-sensitivity: all the representative authorities, organizations or associations, whether Muslim or not, having formally condemned ISIS and its crimes, the French, Muslim or not, have nothing to add to these official convictions.
They don't say a word of consent.
The problem is that people like you see them first as Muslims, Arabs or Africans.
Not like the French.
Unfortunately, dear Kentoc'h Mervel, doubt exists for everyone.
As I have said a thousand times, some doubt the approval by the French Jews of the Israeli massacres in Gaza, but it would be stupid and indecent to accuse them a priori and demand that they manifest publicly to prove to the rest of French society that it is wrong.
This principle is, in my view, the denial of the republic and can only contribute to the delinquency of French society.
If there is no doubt, so much to say.
Who doesn't say a word of consent, but consent to what?
Allows for proximity to ISIS or the conviction of ISIS.
Silence is very practical, it is the main weapon of those who want to domesticate the goat and the goat.
Your position is intellectually honest but pragmatically unbearable.
Alex Salmond predicted that Scotland could "venge" the parties represented in Westminster during the election because a huge gap between their proposals for decentralization and what they promised on the eve of the independence referendum.
Cameron must be petrified with the idea of losing all these seats in Westminster...
Cameron must be laughing.
What are these threats?
The Conservatives are completely wrong about Scotland because they have no seat there.
They can do whatever they want with all impunity.
I don’t think even Cameron is stupid enough to believe that the Labour losing seats in Westminster for the SNP is a good long-term thing for him and the Conservatives.
Who will pour a tear for the Labour Party.
They will be completely eliminated in Scotland by the SNP and UKIP who will cut their heads in the north.
Ed Miliband joined the “PROMESS” thinking he was saving his party but without realizing that he was signing the death sentence of his Scottish deputies.
Not surprisingly, some Labour MPs are asking for accounts from their leader.
If the SNP wins 20-25 seats and there is no majority in parliament, even if the seats do not come from the Conservatives, then they will be in a very good position to negotiate any coalition and they will be able to force both the Conservatives and the Labour to do what they have decentralized.
I think that's what's important.
Not if the Labour or the Conservatives want to be re-elected someday in England.
Turning the pumps by 8% to the detriment of 85% is not a super election strategy.
In addition, once Scottish MPs are no longer able to vote on topics that concern England, the Conservatives will win all votes.
Oh, I think he is.
Cameron may not have much to lose, but Miliband does.
Maggie did it with the unionists of Ulster and it worked well for her.
However, he is still in line to be Prime Minister in 2015 and since he won the leadership of the Labour Party.
So, in general, these boxes will be virtually behind each reader to look over his shoulder and see what he reads, how he reads, and to the end.
It is the “life of others” of East Germany or the KGB applied to the world of FRIC...
Always the same fascination for surveillance techniques.
In the end, this will at least have a sterilizing effect.
I’m waiting for the next ticket: Amazon makes YOUR book based on YOUR profile and automatically thanks to its secret algorithm!
It's gay like the world.
Strongly stimulating.
Thank you for the article.
As under this system, DRM management is not implemented, I have to read pirated files, public domain books or purchased from a few publishers who have the intelligence to offer files without a whip.
Given the price I paid the Kobo, it's without regret.
I am ahuri of the widespread abdication of users to the widespread appropriation of their privacy.
At your public librarian, you will systematically notice that everyone gives their loyalty card (fn*c, d**itre, ...).
There are also demanding masterpieces whose opening and completion rates are undoubtedly ridiculous.

It is the data published by Kobo that does not allow to identify readers or authors.
But Kobo has all that information, him.
There have been so many exaggerated, erroneous and contradictory statements by the Turkish government in recent days that the country seems to be led by a class of mothers full of schizophrenic under-acid boys.
It’s even worse if you take into account Erdogan’s religious fundamentalism.
It is interesting that some of Erdogan’s supporters think Islamist is such an insult that they delete your comment, but not mine. ;-)
But Turkey doesn’t want to shoot a ball in the foot unless it wins something.
If she attacks ISIS, ISIS will respond, so it is actually shooting a bullet in the foot.
A retired diplomat wrote on his blog: “The AP reports that Iran has warned the United States that it would be a mistake to try to overthrow Syrian President Bashar al-Assad because it would jeopardize Israel’s security.
It is not clear in the article whether Iran was sending a serious warning of retaliation or simply advising caution.
“This second option is more likely and, in any case, what really surprises me is that today’s Iranian and American diplomatic commitment concerns Syria, Israel and the security of the region.”
The reading of Indian Punchline is highly recommended to anyone paying attention to the details rather than to the c*neries balanced by the traditional media. The short article you give the link is important and should be read by keeping in mind the 1980 realistic comments/warnings from the previous19.
Who are these “moderates” who seriously fight the horrific secular Assad and at the same time ISIS perverts?
The pipeline policy is pushing the world to the abyss and I would suggest to those who refer to non-existent "moderates" to pay more attention to the facts and alternatives before sending the children of others to fight in World War III.
“It’s even worse if you take into account Erdogan’s religious fundamentalism” Are there other religious fundamentalists in power in the Middle East?
I've got one in my head.
A Nuremberg trial would be needed for the Armenian genocide committed by the Turks.
Is it “should”?
Do you realize that neither the criminals nor the victims have the slightest chance of being alive?
It's a little late for that, my friend.
Wouldn't criminals just be 120 years old now?
It's a little late for that, isn't it?
Particularly concerning the triumph of the CUP that planned and directed the genocide, Talaat and Djemaal killed just after the First World War by the Armenians by revenge, and Enver killed by the Bolsheviks in a pampered place in Central Asia at about the same time when he was there.
What a delirium!
An impressive mastery of fatal slope sophism, but apart from that, we seek in vain contact with the real.
There are some clichés without argument.
The fetus will always hear a heart that beats even in the womb of a bearer mother.
Lesbian couples may simply have a desire for a child and not a desire to be accepted.
Sterile hetero couples too.
As for the kids!
What a shame to call them future psychological imbalances.
One day, they will have the age to defend themselves, to say that they are happy to live, to earn their lives and to pay the retirement of this lady (?)
GPA is undoubtedly a temporary “solution” in the evolution of medicine that our world knows.

The important thing in this regard is that this practice is framed so that the "marketing" of the body is limited.
But aesthetic surgery, cosmetics aren’t they just as merchandising the bodies?!
Anacronic Fareinheit...
It is certainly more elegant to make a good one grow in a faraway country via the Internet and Pay Pal than to lay down its responsibilities and or to avoid the scandal in another centuries close to home without yelling at that time on all roofs! ...
These practices were no longer done in the name of the church! ...
There are not only Christians and believers who reject these practices...
It remains to be seen that the exploitation of the bodies is a real problem.
Oh, shut up, this man is passionate about something.

I don’t know why there are so many contemptuous comments here about what Paul Mason says, maybe they’re posted by people who have never been cool, even for a few years!
I think in the sports section there is an article on football waiting for your comments.
Great article, very true.
Since Tony Parson’s film, there is a shortage of reports that really reflect the reality of the culture of Northern England.
Not surprisingly, Paul Mason has grasped the social and political context, he understands things well.
The Northern soul still lives, but it was vampirized by capitalism and today it is essentially a surface phenomenon.
That said, you can listen to it if you are in the London area in November: 99psoul will again pass soul vinyls, including Northern soul, on Saturday, November 15 at Betsey Trotwood in Farringdon.
I also thought “always the same story”, but here’s a little well-written and well-thought-out article.
Your critics really need to be more constructive.
It's a great article.
I loved your documentary.
I guess you're glad you escaped to Newsnight.

The Palestinians do not have a partner for peace.
Unfortunately, Netanyahu never misses an opportunity to miss an opportunity to negotiate peace.
<0x40>Jonathan: Netanyahu does not seek peace as he wants to continue to occupy-colonize (incidentally, that was also the case with Rabin).
It is obvious that Rabin, Netanyahu and their voters all preferred the occupation-colonization to peace.
He took off his clothes, put them on the rock, and went into the water.
An Israeli had stolen them from him.
The Israeli representative got angry and shouted, "What are you talking about?
The Israelis weren’t even there at the time!”
The Palestinian representative (UN) smiled and added: and now that things are clearly established
Israel and the majority of its population have no confidence in the Palestinian Authority’s bipolar government and will not lower guards.
That this displeases the anti-Israeli is obvious, it is not the purpose sought...
Anti-Zionist: But I answered you, I translate: the global geopolitical report ...
And it has always been so since politics has been globalized...
Avoidance, avoidance...
In the Israeli-colonialist conflict, for the creation of the Palestinian state, it is certain, it will continue!
You do not respond to the creation of Israel.
What force ratio allowed the creation of Israel?
Anti-Zionist: The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is still a force report today!
Do you have any doubts?!
In addition, it’s not just about Russell Brand, but Guardian journalists seem to have a hard time going beyond anything he doesn’t have to say.
Many of what he says are just pseudo-chomskystic bullets not written by others.
This proves that you don’t understand what Russell Brand says, or what Noam Chomsky says.
It’s just a series of personal attacks and insinuations (but 13-year-old girl likes it, which would mean it’s a matter of immaturity).
A really vicious charge, with just a suspicion that Russell Brand is telling certain truths, perhaps truths that one prefers not to think about.
Hang on, this feeling will be more and more widespread!
I can understand why Brand horrifies some: he sometimes speaks pretentiously and after all the absurdities of the tabloids he actually gives the impression of being a populist novice, but the whole story of not voting has been completely misunderstood in my opinion.
The general consensus seems to be that it just tells people to not vote, and rather to cross the arms, and to ignore the whole political process - but if you look at the interview of Paxman and other articles/videos that he posted, he says that it will limit them, that to vote, from political to political, to political, to political, to political, to political, to political, to political, and to political, to say, or to local, to local, to ignore the whole political process.
I do not say that I agree with her solution (because I think that being politically active in presenting her requests can go hand in hand with voting, since politicians are giroflets who will change their mind if they are really going to lose the elections), but it's just a rage to see all of these answers.
Its solution is extremely controversial and it would be good if people were debating what he actually said rather than simply labeling it as irresponsible and putting aside the concerns of him and a large number of people left to account.
Yeah, thank you.
The thing about the vote has been completely distorted.
The inutility of dragging a bulletin in an urn every 5 years annoys me deeply since my vote doesn’t really count for anything.
I want more referendums, electronic voting, direct democracy and MPs who report locally to their voters.
In addition, I oppose the idea that Russell Brand’s statements are not his (written by others).
He is smart enough to have his own words and ideas, even though these are strongly influenced by the kind of anti-establishment thinkers and scholars from the counterculture that Suzanne would like to group under the label “pseudo-chomskystical bullets.”
I am rather convinced that in a debate he will succeed in convincing Suzanne.
Maybe that’s what the Guardian could do, that Suzanne would do like Polly Toynbee and interview Russell on a veranda, with even the headlights added to the assembly!
Like Max Keiser, who initially attacked Russell but ended up becoming one of his fans and by inviting him to his show, it’s too easy to attack him without really understanding where he wants to come from.
It stems from a political discourse that has existed for generations, but has been marginalized by traditional media – including the Guardian – for generations.
This “flag” reveals especially to me that the intellectual debate has not been held for a long time in the RDVs of History where trade historians have become minorities and where trade exchanges of specialists have become poorer for the benefit of condensed-to-think type Sciences Po for press files.
For my part, I had seen in the intellectual attitude of Pierre Bourdieu as well as that of Michel Foucault, a need to take care of a guilty, an emissary bull.
They develop each other very rational reasoning, but this rationality is based on these emissary bullets that are the key to their thought.
Rather, I believe that for Foucault the state was indispensable as a culprit.
This comes from a very archaic thought, sacrificial thought, which is also magical thought.
The problem of relation to each other is solved by eliminating it.
There is an anarchist, neo-lib and/or/liberal slope (the second of the two terms marks a hardening of the desire for the eradication of the state, the first knowing to go to seek the aid of the state for its markets) in the sense of at least state / not state at all at Foucault.
The old dream of the base that is well-organized.
Her thought is built on the guilt of the state: without that guilt she cannot stand.
Who says guilty, says elimination, murder, sacrifice.
This is not a position taken against the three intellectuals cited here.
There is no support, no support.
The totalitarian left remembers the good old days, that of its then god, Stalin, the little father of the peoples.
Oulala, you probably read a chouya too quickly if you took Foucault’s texts on the Iranian Revolution for an apology from Khomeiny.
Today, even Pierre Manent would no longer have fun attacking Michel in this way...
Left puts a deep reflection on the contemporary individual and the collective, on the difficulty of the accession mechanism in our advanced liberal societies.
Whether we agree with him or not, he is an original and respectable thinker.
Seeing this cavalry orchestrated by hard-left humanities researchers who don’t tolerate being moved from allegiance to their mantras is quite ridiculous.
The narcissism and authoritarianism of these people is limitless.
An important point to add to me seems to be the posture of these "rebels", which is only intellectual and theoretical.
The treatment of the Chinese and other “yellows” I have witnessed in Russia is absolutely incredible.
You didn't have the pleasure of hearing our Australian friends about this, then.
And where was it in Russia, that a Russian could meet a Chinese and have a personal opinion?
I don't remember the last time I saw a Chinese man.
In London and they were nice to me when they learned that I was Russian.
In Russia here - in the 1990s last time, in a market.
The Chinese think the same of the whites.
My family lives in Australia after coming from Hong Kong and Guangzhou a long time ago, in the middle of the 20th century, and I still hear some of them holding violently anti-White speeches.
My father is not happy that his eldest daughter is like a White man.
I also believe that attitudes in Russia have changed since the 1990s and especially in recent years: they are becoming more and more rich, prosperity is spreading outside the big cities, and thanks to this prosperity people travel abroad and see how others live.
From what I have been told, the Russians mainly have prejudices against unskilled temporary workers from the Caucasus and Central Asia, who work in trades and in areas where they are very likely to be exploited by their employers or face high crime and violence.
Although I lived on the banks of the Ienissei River in Siberia.
Unfortunately, I have heard the opinions of Australians about the Chinese and Aboriginal people.
It's really weird that a stranger tells me that I can't stand the Chinese, while I met two in my life (one of them abroad), didn't keep bad memories of them, all the people are worth it and, in fact, those in London were very nice.
Otherwise we don’t remember who we meet, everyone is worth it, how to remember who was who.
You know what's weird?
That you and the other Russian here talked about the Chinese as a kind of unique fascination, as if they were an attraction in a zoo.
And yet you always go out with that white guy.
How many Chinese men are with white men, by comparison?
None, because there is a lot of chance that the parents of these Whites would physically attack them.
No measure of impartiality of justice.
Yet it is the mother of all battles and justice in France remains manipulated by strongly marked groups on the left such as the union of the judiciary...
<0x40>Marabout: Sorry, but the judiciary is frankly branded right.
In the Judiciary Syndicate, it represents only 25% of the judges.
If a measure of its partiality can be made from the relativity of law enforcement in the courts, it orders to remove two obstacles.
The political view of the observer as the factual interpretation of the magistrate.
It remains the mandatory tool of the law to reassess the assessment of fundamentals.
Measurement of its non-compliance in all judicial acts of magistrates, including prosecutors, force a distinction between error and partiality of magistrates.
It would be futile to claim that the acts of justice are not distributed among these three groups.
Pretension and ignorance are not subject to objective analysis.
And so if all this is not analyzed, then how can we say that justice improves in France?
If it is only through statistics that implicitly reveal that it starts from very low.
The preceding preamble makes it possible to properly inscribe what follows in the third ratio.
The corruption of the judiciary.
A sensitive subject in proportion to the power of nuisance* which is conferred on the judicial institution capable of such a heresy.
The area considered is the spoilage* of heirs committed through fraud to the procedure* by successor genealogists mandated by notaries.
This profession gets a good year and a bad year of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>150 million while benefiting from the coverage* provided by the French notariat’s near-impunity*.
For the understanding of their mechanism, a part of it was reported in the comments following the first publication.
Where this goes along with the said statistical improvement* moderated by the previous comment, it is that the judiciary has produced, in many disputes between the genealogist and heirs reluctant to thus become spoiled, a whole set of jurisprudences contrary to all laws favouring heirs.
Is not the presentation of European statistics ignorant of this kind of rational criteria then an elaborate form of lies?
Absolutely prohibitive prices.
There's more equipment to scam people with disabilities.
One can say that, but my brother has one of those all-terrain tricycles, built to suit his size and weight and it really allowed him to enjoy the outdoors like never a normal wheelchair, with loaded wheels and tires, could not.
As they say, the drops and the colors...
The Tankchair looks like what Jeremy Clarkson could invent for a challenge in Top Gear.
The tank chair sounds epic.
I think the inventor of the Whill never had to clean a dog scraper on a chenille.
I'm sure my sister would love the all-terrain tricycle, but it's just too expensive.
The ultra long-distance wheelchair would be perfect for a disabled person with a slope for the longboard.
There are hills that they would like.
Prices really seem high, but there really are people who put that kind of price on a bike, so “you see.”
The all-terrain tricycle seems particularly useful to me.
Not all people with disabilities are poor.
Many of them have a reasonable amount of insurance at their disposal.
Only if they have become disabled.
The thing is that the wheelchair market is a niche, so they can afford to practice high prices for things they know properly that we need them.
We can’t really say that the Whill is minimalist.
This is an example of excessive design.
Unfortunately, it's just a draft, it's not planned to make it.
I agree that the “long-distance” wheelchair does not arrive on the market, because apparently there is no way to drive this shitty thing.
Nearly 20,000 homes were destroyed by the Israeli army in Gaza during intensive bombings of densely populated residential areas.
Two million human beings have been prisoners of the Israeli blockade of Gaza since 2007 (Israel is the occupying power of the Palestinian territory, not Egypt).
Half are children and young people under the age of 18.
Eight-year-olds have lived their entire lives under Israeli blockade!
Unique situation in the world, unacceptable situation, illegal situation as well, as this blockade inflicts a “collective punishment” on all Gazan civilians.
“Entrepreneurs working on their projects are turning a little bit of their cement into the black market.”
Ah, it's not the wooden tongue, rather the concrete and armored lady...
References are there to support an argument or fact.
Anti-Zionist...
The right cement goes into the tunnels!
There is a black market, that's for sure, and acknowledged.
Two million human beings have been imprisoned in the Israeli blockade of Gaza since 2007.
Unique situation in the world, unacceptable for anyone who has a heart and moral sense.
The United States has a well-maintained territory: Saudi Arabia.
Morsi did not have the time to rule because the dictatorship (supported by whom you know) ruled out him!
Remember also that after lifting it, Morsi had restored the blockade!!!
And I'm a Westerner, so I approve...
Jonathan...
The blockade is Israeli-Egyptian...
The children of Gaza live on an underground fortress, built opposite the people who chose their masters!
Having a boat is a lot of work, Alex.
I hope you've thought well.
Couchsurfing is much cooler than Airbnb.
This is the very definition of the non-profit sharing economy.
Many are looking for just one shot of an evening on Couchsurfing.
So it’s about getting paid (or at least hoping) in another way.
It is always much cheaper than a hotel, if you need to find the right addresses.
In addition, trusted landlords and tenants often stop using Airbnb and deal directly in cash, thus circumventing Airbnb.
Where is the community in all this?
“What is it for rent?”
No problem with the verb, what's the problem with your grammar?
The word “to let” is not used in the United States.
The author simply used an American expression.
It's an international newspaper now, in case you didn't notice.
It would be better to have the right insurance for the boat, make sure it is 100% compliant with all safety rules and ask those who manage channels and rivers permission to do business there (what they will certainly refuse) I have a boat on it, I've really tried (how to praise it)
Have you ever thought about the fact that boats can be moved, stolen and painted, melted, etc.?
The penises are so slow that if someone was trying to steal it she would always be near where you left her.
Or distracted by pirates...
All these Somali immigrants who come here and attack our penises...
Where are you going to tie it up?
Marine Le Pen is not right.
Populism?
There is no truth other than that which exposes the facts.
Poverty is increasing in France.
More than 150,000 young people leave school without training.
The increase of wealth in the hands of the richest is a reality.
Who's defending who?
Who's defending what?
In 2017, Mass will be celebrated!
Capitalism is not going to get rich!
The high finance, speculates, plays with our companies, therefore our jobs, with our raw materials, therefore our purchases, our food, therefore our food, with the structures of care, therefore our health, with our debts, therefore our institutions.
They are a threat to our daily lives by the same and by our money they hold.
All this for the benefit of a few hyper-mega-obese fries.
FH said, “My enemy has no name, my enemy has no face, my enemy is finance.”
It was in 2012.
In 2014, he appointed the Minister of Economy a former Rothschild bank, a history of better defending the interests of banksters, alone responsible for the 2007 crisis.
Was there anyone else who was competent?
What do you call it: turning her jacket, lowering her pants?
Primary and populist reaction
I don’t really know what Marine Le Pen thinks.
Where did you see that?
Because the Germans refused to rescue the survivors.
I’m not sure if Spee really “refused” to rescue the survivors.
One aspect of this battle was that none of the parties seemed certain of the exact strength of the enemy.
Robert Massie in his book “Castles of Steel” suggests that Spee quickly left the area because he had received a report indicating a British courier in the area.
The sea was stormy at the beginning of the day; I don't know if it was still the case at the end of the battle?
Similarly, the fight ended after sunset, making any rescue operation more difficult.
Compare this with the next battle, the Battle of the Malouines, where, in the photos showing the survivors being rescued, you see a calm sea and in full day.
In addition, the rescuers knew that there were no more German fighters in the area at this stage.
Hmm, that doesn't really fit what I remember reading about this battle, so I did a quick search on Wikipedia:
“There was some confusion among the German ships as to the fate of the two cruisers, who had disappeared in the dark after they had stopped shooting, and a racing race began.
Leipzig saw something in the fire, but as he approached, he saw that it was only a wreck.
The Nürnberg, slower than the other German ships, joined the battle late and saw the Monmouth, sloped and severely damaged but still in motion.
After pointing his headlights on the ship's flagship, the proposal to return was refused and he opened fire, eventually flowing the ship.
Without reliable information, von Spee felt that the Good Hope had to escape and stopped the search at 10:15 p.m.
Worried about reports indicating a British courier in the vicinity, he headed north.”
So, if this is true, the Germans, who were in the dark before the invention of the radar, did not know that a ship had crashed, and therefore could not search for survivors.
They also thought that there was a larger Royal Navy squadron in the area that could have severely damaged them, so in the confusion they decomposed to take advantage of their advance.
They were far from their base and Spee was well aware that they should scrape a path through many Royal Navy ships.
Cradock's sacrifice had already caused them damage and had cost about half of their ammunition, thus condemning them when they were finally taken.
A number of votes rise to the UMP to request that it be enshrined in the law that a permanently convicted election is thus definitively ineligible.
This is a bold position, which would also touch left-wing voters well on.
But nooon, it's a joke.
FOR THIS IDEA I PROPOSSED A MUR OF THE CONS OF THE MAGISTRATS
When is the ban on trade unions in already protected sectors?
How long will this distortion of equality between citizens be tolerated?
Maintained by politicians (s) whose vision of society is limited to these sectors, always ready to appease those who will take advantage of their immobility to hinder the actions of true politicians, who really try to move things, not the beautiful speakers whose immobility is to the extent that they are sufficient.
I met them in the subway around noon with their little banners of "Subs for Justice" they came from the province and didn't make a difference between Bercy and the POPB.
It supports the existence of political unions whose members put the enormous power they hold in the service of their party.
It would not defend the same thesis if right-wing, or even far-right, unions targeted the personalities on its side and waged a legal-media war against them.
Your affirmations are completely free.
If, right now, the right defies the legal status, it is simply that it has committed the facts that fall under it!
There is no example of a leftist personality who has had so much to do with the Justice, but all those who have been the subject of his attention have not received any favourable treatment.
On the other hand, it should also be recalled that the union of the magistrates on the left is not the only union of magistrates and that it is a minority.
That a minister supports unions with so much commitment shows how useful they can be.
<0x40>MCR The union you are citing may be a minority among the magistrates, but its influence is great at the Chancellor’s office, it’s not a secret.
It is now questioned whether the "mission" of some judges is not more to go out than to instruct.
<0x40> gus - You should be satisfied, the SM is minority.
What are you complaining about?
<0x40>Pivoine: You forget that the magistrates are not officials like the others: they are the only ones who have the power to indict and imprison everyone.
Jade Goody?
What if none of the participants ever came back?
Hello, Katie Waissel.
I think even the stupidest starving of glory realizes that X-Factor can only mean the end of a career, so I’d be surprised someone accepts their offer.
Many have used it as a stepping stone to start a successful career.
One Direction fills stadiums all over the world.
Others then sold a lot of records or left for West End.
Popstars, the forerunner of all these programs, launched Chreyl Cole, who, in fact, is one of the jurors.
Even ABBA, Olivia Newton-John, Céline Dion, Cliff Richard, all competed in the Eurovision Song Contest, as so many others.
While others such as Frank Sinatra and the rest have participated in competitions in the United States.
In the 1970s and 1980s, New Faces and Opportunity Knocks launched most of the UK's light entertainment stars.
Of course, some have fallen into oblivion.
But that’s what happens to most of the stars who don’t participate in the competition anyway.
There are few who, after a tube, manage to make others.
Either way, most singers/groups can best hope for three albums and a best of.
Yeah, but now Cole, or whatever his name is, he only has fans in the UK.
Her celebrity comes in part from her marriage to a footballer who breathes through her mouth.
Most Americans know who Jeremy Clarkson is.
It can only mean the end of a career.
In fact, it's more likely to lead to a career than the typical rock path, even if in your dreams you think that all the guitar fritters who smoke grass in their father's garage and balance three chords on a primary school level poem will surely become even the stars and that the only question that comes out is that it's a single album.
And worse than ridiculous: it establishes a completely artificial distance between the Western public and the peoples studied – a distance that turns quite quickly to racism, because Sacralist ethnologists present these distant peoples as infinitely inspiring, superstitious and inspiring, who are inspiring, who are practically bigotry-like, and wholly-striquitely-like.
Unless you interpret it in the opposite direction.
Yes, but rather than saying that the drum is devoid of sacred character, is it not better to admit that our Marianne and our Molière are also not a little sacred character?
Our bias is as recalled to see the sacred as a sort of well-defined and circumscribed object to the religious sphere.
Very interesting article, whatever it is.
This is the ephemere deco to furnish the vacuum.
Nothing more.
Great article, thank you.
The recent Pantheonization of illustrious figures of the Republic is an illustration that the feeling of sacred still lives.
Who still believes in the interpretations of archaeologists?
Any other discipline would throw to the fore the interpretations of not scientists at all that last the life of a mandarin, rarely less.
When is a comparison of disciplines to make a little joke?
Because what is valid for archaeology also applies to the interpretations given by other disciplines.
This would bring a dose of healthy modesty.
Your contempt for archaeologists is completely unjustified!
It is thanks to them that we constantly discover treasures, valuable testimonies to reconstruct history, understand societies, and the example here of comparative archaeology is exciting.
This method is not very old and archaeologists used to rely on their “instinct” and knowledge, and could be mistaken.
Nowadays, technical and scientific means are so powerful that the interpretation of excavations is better but can still be questioned by other discoveries!
There is a full (and old) controversy about the shamanism advanced by the prehistoric Jean Clottes (cf. his book “The shamans of prehistory”, particularly the increased re-edition of the scientific controversy, published in The House of Rocks).
Thank you for this instructive article
Do heterosexual men like anal sex?
For you, Mike, I could put myself in there.
So it's over between us?
I don't really understand why can't we keep on at three?
This newspaper is supposed to be serious, made for adults.
Do you really need to fall into the canopy?
No, but we're not against a play over there.
We couldn’t watch a musical comedy over there on the other hand, it would be too gay!
You could expect to have this kind of comment on your part.
Looks like Mary Whitehouse's back from the dead.
Since your trial offer is almost complete, I can suggest you switch to the Catholic Times.
I'm sure you'll feel more at home.
He prefers Mikedow.
May I suggest that we all look for a newspaper that pays for real journalists, courageous, so that they write about the Middle East, Ebola, etc. at their own risk and danger.
Instead of getting rich with these pussy ass jokes.
Not very smart.
Then go on.
If these "puerile ass jokes" shock you so much, you don't have to participate, do you?
Do you also know that this newspaper also covers the Middle East and Ebola and that it is quite possible to do both and publish an article on anal sex?
Is it the subject that shocks you, or the fact that people are laughing at you?
However, we find the amateur video of crash on the net...
Video of the crash on the net...??
If the FOM has chosen not to display these images it is only to protect its interests under no circumstances those of the driver.
If the FOM wanted to protect the drivers, it would have come out of the safety because at the time or another vehicle (e.g., a shuttle) was entering the circuit.
But it had to end soon before the typhoon that we knew was coming, but for which the FOM did not consider it good to advance the time of departure (TV right, pub, money...).
But besides that, they protect the pilots well.
Of course, I also share this opinion.
But there is also that if the very British FOM makes it into the SC, it will allow Nico Rosberg to have a chance at restart to beat the Englishman who was driving then...
You are on this blog my dear Dayrton.
But it's okay, I've got some time to clear all your c******s.
No, just no.
There have been lots of F1 conspiracies, but never one that puts commissioners at risk of death for a distant story of the possibility of winning one driver to the detriment of another.
It's not the FOM that gets out of safety because it's the FIA.
Nuance of size.
In view of amateur images, the lack of image above all enables the FIA to avoid the annoying questions of the type: How does the Commissioner agitate a green flag in full intervention and continue to do so after the accident (see the full video after the accident)
No, it is not because the video is deemed too violent that the FIA blocks images of the accident but because one of the commissioners clearly shakes a green flag, a sign that the race can resume normally and that one is more under the yellow flag regime.
Some comments show a dark misunderstanding of F1.
Yes dear Etienne, the race is no longer under the yellow flag regime APRES the place of the accident, hence the green flag shaking.
This is the usual procedure.
The post of commissioners just downstairs of the accident (depending on the case, it can be 10 meters or 100 meters after the accident) shakes the green to tell the drivers to take back a normal ride.
Sensationalism sells the public.
I used to think that the media was an integral part of the government’s “patriotic” propaganda offensive, but I’m afraid that, in the end, it’s just for the money.
And sex, don’t forget sex, the fear of not having sex life, the pub and the media are good at selling us things supposed to improve our sex life.
The information does exactly the same.
Making the buzz with information that you don’t really need to worry about is just to keep scaring people so they can keep controlling them.
“When the tabloids whisper about Ebola, we all catch the fear.” It should be “derailing,” not “all.”
Given the medical reference, “to cough” is much better said in this context than “to derail”.
I wonder if all the people who are saying that Ebola could spread by air realize that they now believe in evolution?
You're giving them too much honor.
They probably think that this is the end of the world and that Ebola is just one of the signs of the nearing apocalypse.
Ebola is the Antichrist!
You confuse Ebola and Murdoch.
Great article, thank you!
A short and concise article that ridicules this abject pseudo-journalism beautifully and solidly.
It made me laugh. It made me laugh.
I am disappointed that the media is talking about most of the things with this optimism in reverse.
The goal is once again to keep us scared and anxious enough (without getting hysteria) so that the government can take us off when it needs it.
I believe that it is perfectly logical that, if we have to undergo a budget emergency in the absence of any crisis, a terrorist emergency in the absence of any attacks, why not have an Ebola crisis in the absence of any evidence?
It seems that this government is trying to save us from the crises that it himself has invented.
Is there anything fundamentally problematic about the idea of governing by fear?
Congratulations on this post, and for being still out of this world almost 35 years later.
In the beginning it must have been horrific, given the context of the 1980s-90s.
I’m bluffing, living with the certainty of spending years there .....
Testimony is completely useless.
As always when we talk about science.
Not only do the testimonies serve nothing: taken in isolation, they cannot serve as scientific material.
But they have a negative influence on the objective assessment of the facts.
<0x40>trafic: Testimonials cannot be used as scientific material.
Perhaps this is why we refrain from asking questions to patients in psychiatry when we have reliable observations from relatives.
My psychiatric record mentions that my psychiatrist mother explains that I was telepathically educated by her stepmother.
This is an objective symptom.
When I say it's a scam, it's a subjective testimonial that doesn't matter.
Ah, because the testimony of a fact (<0x3D> here this testimony, which proves the contamination and effectiveness of new treatments) serves nothing in a scientific approach?
So what is the research based on?
On ghosts?
Are you putting fantasy theories and facts at the same level (<0x3D> giving rise to verifiable testimonies)?
"Resilience": the word bidon worn by grandparents, fans of J-L Delarue, who consider themselves great psychologists after reading D'Ansebourg.
<0x40>Jim: There are plenty of meaningless buzzwords in the psys.
Cyrulnik struck us with “resilience”.
Since he is a great scientist, Cyrulnik, I hope he has given us a reliable scale of measurement to quantify it, this famous resilience.
I wonder if the Air Sentinels could all save us from Farage and company??
Doesn't that make you think of Team America?
Seriously, it's not *not * a good idea to bring out the Air Sentinels...
And why, then?
It was a great series and it seems that those who come out of it are aware of it!
So let us leave our salvation to the Almighty who can perform miracles.
But how are they going to get the kids to hang up?
The only solution that comes to my mind is the pipi-caca genre humor, which would kill the series.
It was already a series for children.
The children hanged.
Oh, because it's a children's series?
The UKIP works for the Mysterons.
So keep your team America.
Still in Supermarionation?
It won't be the same if you don't see the wires and the animation is well done. :-)
I look forward to seeing this (although being an adult), but I hope it will give the idea to a chain to re-broadcast the old ones.
The series has almost never stopped airing here in Australia; it’s been at least 40 years since we have one-hour episodes on Saturday and Sunday at 6:00 p.m.
Since the arrival of free digital television a few years ago, it has been on one of the second-rate commercial channels and can still be seen at these times.
And in addition, half-hour episodes now pass at 05:30, Monday to Friday!
Okay, I'm probably a "sad" 60-year-old guy, but I don't watch this series every day!
There is no "Mount of the Temple" in or under the mosque of the skyscrapers!!!
The radical Zionists invented this to give themselves political legitimacy to colonize Jerusalem.
In addition, all the Israeli excavations under and around the mosque of the expanse for several decades have not been able to find anything.
The mountain of the temple, if it exists, is elsewhere.
Could it be in Argentina??
This mountain is not sought for the simple reason that it is the hill on which the mosque esplanade was built.
Its summit, or Rocher dome, stands out in the middle of Omar Mosque.
For Muslims, Muhammad has ascended to heaven from this rock.
For the Jews, it is Mount Moriah where Abraham was about to sacrifice his son Isaac.
From the moment it was taken and contextualized, there is no propaganda, but information, dear K1K1.
Israel also counts its extremists, it is good to remind him regularly, and they are unfortunately relayed to the government (Naftali Bennet, Avigdor Liebermann, and even Netanyahu, the latter had accepted the two-state plan, and continually ignored it!).
It is also good to show how much the annexation of Jerusalem is not a peaceful fact.
Will God be able to recognize His people?
The shortest Jewish joke: “Praise be to God!”
In order to boast of tourism in Israel, we are often shown young naive to half-disgusted, aligned on the beach.
The reality is, as usual, very different from what advertising shows us, as you can see in the photo that illustrates the article.
It's a little scary anyway.
And this photo is a wonderful work of propaganda!
Too bad the Reuters photographer did not take a picture of the hundreds of Palestinians allowed to go to the Temple Mount and who prefer to drop the Jewish faithful downstairs, praying to the Wall for complaints.
<0x40>Mat, if this photo bothers you, it's right, it's not the newspaper or the photographer, but this woman and the ideology she conveys that we have to condemn.
This system is not viable and will end up crying.
The only way to end this system is through the revolution.
Since the economy seems to be breaking up, large companies have benefited greatly from their employees.
They have succeeded in convincing their employees that they are fortunate to have a job and that they cannot afford to raise wages, while at the same time and without hiding, they have given the small summit elite ever greater wages.
You are right, it is not viable, but it will only change in this country when workers really speak with one voice.
Instead of laughing and whispering when someone else is on strike, support them, show some solidarity and understand that their strike is not only about their problems, but also to show your employer that people are not being bullied with impunity.
Unless democracy is abandoned, in which case it is viable.
I totally agree with you.
The only thing you have forgotten is that British and American companies have sold our industry and now our services to countries where social and environmental conditions are the worst.
For example, China and India.
All this can't end well.
That’s because we are in a democracy.
Have you voted for PTCI?
The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (PTCI) aims to increase the profits of companies held by these people by short-circuiting national governments through secret courts.
It sounds incredible, but that’s exactly what the Investor-State Dispute Resolution Mechanism (ISDS) proposed by the agreement is for.
The Greens are against this project and are trying to warn people about the unimaginable damage this deal will have on our lives.
It’s only recently that we’re starting to talk about it in the media: Independent Guardian World Development Movement So look at these links and you’ll understand what’s being negotiated in your back.
Didn’t Churchill say “blood, sweat and tears”?
These are the ones that make great profits, while digital money has no reason to fall and even less to grow on the trees.
The next weak mesh will probably be the car market.
This gentleman is right, in the eighteenth century there were trade unions in all regiments.
In the very Catholic French army, there is a sacrificial dimension.
Let it (finally, its officers, the others, no one knows anything) believe in the safe of the eternal values of France, and it will fight and close its mouth.
And then with the decline of the country, globalization, Europe, the crisis of values, in short: the dissolution of the idea of a nation, having this little relic, it is comforting.
Even if for her, it's getting more and more uncomfortable...
You still miss the union of married men, celibataires, married women, celibataires, lost dogs and I don't know what yet
If you don't write French correctly, I'm syndicated.
You've been warned, it's your fault.
For the defence of categorical interests, protected professions with trade unions are already undergoing considerable damage, which has created a breakdown of equality with other citizens.
We are asked not to laugh about the fear of risk on the part of an official.
One can very well imagine a system that ensures certain freedom of expression without unions, or even without the right to strike as in Germany, in exchange for the protection they enjoy.
Otherwise, a disaster is insured.
And with the carts getting ready, the government welcomes it.
What security are you talking about?
Ignorance indeed...
Ignorance for Ignorance Sybille I was referring to the military and other officials, as this is the subject here commented...
Suppress "by means of its delegates" in article 8 of the preamble to the 1946 Constitution.
It will be: "8.
Every worker participates in the collective determination of working conditions as well as in the management of enterprises."
This is absolutely necessary with the breakdown of information power.
And yet you opened, probably read, and then commented on an article specifically titled “The Great British Bake Off review”.
Wait, the section was there, empty.
I thought we had to start the conversation.
Anyway, it's Joffrey's wedding I've been watching, and I can tell you, some of them have been well savored.
In the episode of Joffrey's wedding we have one of the best moments (although misleading: it was wine) in the history of television.
Also, from the cake mmmh...
Game of Thrones!
I love the GBBO!
This is the second time in a row that, strangely, the show ends with a victory of the worst baker; no one has done such a "boum, this is my goddamn cake now buff it and lean in front of your master"!
Maybe the extra pressure of friends and parents outside eventually had an effect on them?
In the previous weeks, all of these outsiders were kept away.
And there’s also the idea of “playing security, there’s always next week” that disappears last week.
I love cooking, but I don't think I'm going to do that.
I am grateful to those who do so and thus offer us super fun and drives us to try new things.
Go ahead for GBBO 2015!
I agree, last year's last challenge, the wedding cake, was absurd.
Professionals usually take days to do them and they had to briquete one in 3-4 hours.
The three challenges were really hard to get started, I don’t know how they could choose a winner.
At Luis, the only real flaw they were able to find was the base a little dry (even though I agree with Hollywood to say that the green ice cream on Richard's mill didn't give up, anyway Richard had already lost at the time).
I have to admit that several challenges in this series seem a little artificial because of the time spent.
There is also cancer that controls, with solar wind blows.
Definitely, everything is working for us right now.
A bad time to spend for humanity, I hope.
You confuse solar wind and ultraviolet rays.
UVs are blocked mainly by the ozone layer which is formed precisely by the impact of residual solar wind particles and UVs.
So even if the magnetic field weakened, there wouldn’t be enough solar wind to “hunt” the ozone from the stratosphere.
There would be even more, and therefore less UV and “cancers.”
Fortunately, the ozone layer does not block UV.
They have a lot of useful functions that you don’t suspect.
If we limit ourselves to humans, they have the interest in allowing us to have bones (vitamin D synthesis), to warm us (less than infrareds), to modulate our immune system and, apparently, to improve our morale.
The ozone layer blocks carcinogenic UVCs and lets UVA and most UVB pass.
Do you know that you do not have to be condescending and consider your interlocutor as a stay-at-home when you post a comment?
Especially for a minor precision that was under-entended in the commentary, which itself intends to prove pedagogy.
Not to mention that I am a habituated to melanoma, the UVs only accelerate its development.
They don't try it.
For proof: not all bronzed people have melanomas.
So, when a toubib tells you that you should avoid the sun and live at the bottom of a cellar, it is better not to listen because UVs are necessary for all humans.
Excess, on the other hand, is like everything: it kills.
But for other reasons.
UVs directly cause melanoma.
Can we fold it up?
And, more importantly, can we pass it to the mixer?
Or switch it to the mixer...
I believe that the majority of those who are interested in it have established that anything can be folded if enough strength is applied and the robustness of the iPhone 6 is perfectly acceptable, for the use for which it is intended.
I think the military would need something more resilient and therefore have not yet adopted the iPhone6 as a front-line communication equipment.
But for us others,
It's still a good choice.
The majority of those who are interested in it have established that everything can be folded if sufficient force is applied to it.
The Nokia 3310.
More specifically, is it already folded?
This is a joke in every discussion.
I decided to count them.
This is the fourth fold joke I read in the comments today.
It's hard to understand how a prototype can be distributed like that.
Before installing specific software, it is assumed that the phone has been removed from the main production chain and we can hardly see how it could get back there.
So, don't worry, don't worry.....
Most likely it is a production unit on which the iOS has not been installed correctly and is therefore stuck with the factory-installed test code.
I don't know at all how they do these things.
But would they put test software on all of them?
Photos on Ebay clearly show the absence of FCC or CE logo and the presence of a red prototype connector.
It's an excellent article for boobs.
We want cheap products and we're surprised that industrialists produce in "industrials" but we highlight super u but all the signs and meme the small business are concerned How to bouffer good, organic avac 1650<0xE2><0x82><0xAC> (mean salary in France)?
But to answer your post, if it is possible to eat correctly with a small salary.
After all, everyone is free to prioritize where they hear it.
For me, food is one of them.
Go without rancor, I kiss you
They are called fools, or rather boboecolos, people who see the world through an ideological “software” that leads them to disconnect from reality.
This is the total decomposition of reason-thinking.
They are experts in gesticulation, for example claiming to save the planet because they avoided taking a shower.
They are also experts in truffles, joining the left-caviar, from which they sometimes come, for example by condemning CO2 emissions while spending their holidays in the Maldives.
The vast majority of our fellow citizens do not tolerate this mixture of heavy ideology and truffles, nor be surprised to meet often critics about them.
Waouh, thank you for this complete and comprehensive theorization as well as for all the associated details (plane, shower...).
I'd like to be a part of it, but I'm not.
The concept is not so complicated.
The boobs are monobloc.
Do you understand the concept of left-caviar?
And you are able to understand the concept of boboecolo.
It's the perfect copy with just an ideological nuance.
Classification would be more complicated if we were interested in short-lived eco-friendly.
The boboecolo is part of it but only represents the most visible of the ecolo because it is the one that infests the media.
This is a beautiful giraffe.
Apparently, no one wants to look at this giraffe in front of you.
She's so badly hurt that she looks vaguely like a female nude.
Fall, you're next to the plate.
It is necessary to be part of the microcosm of art to understand the amazing beauty of the truth of this work.
But you simply don’t have any legitimacy to make a comment since you haven’t spent countless decades studying and flattering great artists.
The important thing is not that Emin does not know how to draw and seems always obsessed with the same subject.
The important thing is that she really managed to become fabulously rich and famous with no artistic ability.
That's art, that's art.
No, it's a pig.
The fact that Emin doesn't know how to draw
This is not really a proven fact.
It is rather an opinion.
Unless the only thing you can enjoy are realistic reproductions of dogs that smoke while playing billiards.
Judging art can be problematic, but not in that case.
Drawing is much more than just representing the real thing.
If you’re just looking for that, a camera will do the job.
The author also talks about Emin’s expressionism.
Look again and let the image speak of itself, without comparing it to the kind of drawing you might prefer.
If it's so easy, why don't you do it yourself?
There is still a lot of savings to be made: riding activities, the number of Republican guard horses or the status of generals who are no longer in active service.
L(honesty requires to say that France is decreasing its staff, but as all countries, sometimes even more drastically, have done, starting with Britain.
It's only half-encouraging...
Operating without support, it quickly finds its limits!
A unique approach, at a time when we are observing the weaknesses, the insufficientness of our defence tool, especially in the Sahel.
A bad blow to the local communities concerned, who are losing a dimension of their activities, or even part of their history.
Where is the promised sanctuation?
<0x40>edmond: Well, that’s what I was saying, look elsewhere where to save money but especially not at my house, at my house it’s really not possible...
That’s exactly what you’re proposing to do, look elsewhere where the ugliness is certain.
Let all those who have sided with little or enough the military thing dare come here to say, eyes in the eyes that there is no money wasted in this perimeter and this without bursting out of laughter...
That the same potion be applied to the entire public service and the public finances will be a little better.
And for Josi: really loud: look at the inflation of public jobs in the other departments and you will understand why Defence can be a little burdensome!
Well yes, the savings that everyone agrees to say we have to do, but we have to see it somewhere, don't we?
Lack of pot, those on whom it falls to get to murder when it happens at home, the poor darlings.
It should be done, but above all, it does not fall on me because, in this case, it is a crime and not an economy.
Guignols, go!
How will closing the Grace Valley weaken our defence tool in the Sahel?
As for the local communities, history repeats itself at every closure of posts, maternity, hospital, home.
But everyone is for savings, of course.
This is strange, a UMP mayor who wants compensation and is not happy with the savings made in public spending.
This article is really the coolest thing I’ve ever read!
This is an embarrassing moment when the first three people who comment are making the same bad joke.
It’s depressing to make his Facebook line scroll and to see that 80% of his friends started their status with the phrase “This Shameful Moment.”
I think they're going to make a movie.
It will probably be based on hilarious scenes where someone accidentally falls on his ex in the bus while going to work and only realizes that his skirt has gone home in his pantyhose.
It's not embarrassing, it's completely con.
Not really, in my opinion, the author adopts the role of the typical British man who has always been taught to bury his emotions and to tighten his teeth.
I’m sure if you’re a fan of Kate Bush, the announcement of her return to the stage after 25 years of absence has been something strong.
Do you realize that your comment is now at the heart of a battle to find out who will have the rights?
I don’t have the “Internet”.
So I don't think I can comment.
I don't have a computer.
Oh, my God, I need to see this movie before I die!
I can't believe how amazing this article is the most amazing thing I've ever read!
Charlie has really demonstrated that he is at the top of the cosmic universe that satirical journalism is!
I'm falling backwards!
It is absolutely necessary that I share with all my friends on Facebook and Twitter so that they finally have the illumination and discover the incredible luminosity and the unsurpassed genius that springs from Mr. Brooker’s keyboard as a divine spark.
Oh, my God, it was really null.
Especially if it's not women or transvestites.
I'm a parasite.
This shows a positive development within democracies: the rise of effective regional policies and associative initiatives.
Until new order we are confiscating the right to save our planet by States playing the truffles at each meeting to save the planet.
We, therefore, as citizens, decide to take things into our hands.
With the commissioner they planted in the energy, all these beautiful recommendations have flown....
Wind farms and solar farms are the round points of tomorrow.
All funded by the taxpayer.
Please stop this pro-nuclear speech.
Pollution is not limited to CO2.
Radioactivity is much more harmful at the level of its waste and in the event of an accident.
As long as the sector is not controlled in its entirety, it is better to limit it to the laboratories.
Renewable energies are our only salvation, provided, of course, that our consumption is drastically reduced.
Renewable electricity to combat CO2 emissions?
France has nothing to do with it.
Nuclear electricity is zero CO2 emissions to production and epsilon for the other stages.
Renewable wind or PV electricity is already more GES in the other stages and especially gas, or worse coal as in Germany, to compensate for the intermittent.
Replacement of nuclear power by renewable wind or PV would go against the fight against CO2.
Christal I do not insult you I am a Doctor of State in Physical Sciences 1981 more I have done research in nuclear physics I challenge you to prove the opposite of what I said.
For what I did not say is you who lend me ideas I did not say anything about Germany nothing in fact you did not answer what I was saying and as all the right people demolished the interviewer I never do.
I also quote the conclusion of experts mandated by the German government: Germany's current renewable energy programme is a non-profitable and inefficient means of reducing GHG emissions and should be stopped.
0 emission if you do not count the extraction of uranium and construction and if you do not count the greenhouse gas water vapor of less effect than Co2 it is true recalls two-thirds of the energy produced by a nuclear power plant part in water vapor and a little in the water of the rivers.
I stopped reading when you spoke of Pakistan as a “South Asian giant”...!!
Last time, Pakistan won against Hindustan.
Not surprisingly, most Indians who post comments only want to read and comment on articles against Pakistan.
By the way, it shows well your state of mind.
It would have been the same if they had described India as a South Asian giant.
I have nothing against the fact that some Pakistani players are involved, but having a Pakistani version would be unacceptable.
It would simply open a box of Pandore full of corruption and mafiosi.
As for the ISL, today’s opening game was surprisingly interesting, with Athletico de Kolkata scoring 3-0 against Mumbai.
Pakistan still has a lot of work to do.
Compared to the billions and billions that India devotes to IPL cricket and now to football, how could we one day compete with our “noisy neighbors”?
The race or low-cost launcher pays cash.
Too bad for such a beautiful project.
For the incident, the possible design defect manifests itself only with too cold helium.
So we may not be in a lack of design, but of implementation...
Unlike arianspace which is a private company, it seems well that soyuz belongs to the Russian state...
And if the rule is the same as here the state is its own insurer..
They may be paying for satellites in frigates who knows.
This is all the more awkward as many media take up the titles of articles alone in loops – and many readers retain only those titles.
Overall, this creates an incorrect impression contrary to the content of the article itself.
Totally agree with you, the title is not appropriate, it unfairly challenges the project while it is just a launcher problem.
