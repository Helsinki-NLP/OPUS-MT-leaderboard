I'm just kidding you.
I'm just so proud of you.
I'm just starving.
I'm just surprised.

I'm not shy.
I'm not even sure he likes me.
I'm not even tired.
I'm not that hot either.
I can't find the equation.
I'm not a local.
Tom's not giving me enough help.
I'm not going to the point.

I had no breath.
I won't be in town next week.
I moved to a new house last week, and yesterday I studied the library.
I overcame the shock.
I don't mind waiting here.
I don't want him.
I'm looking for him.
I'm pretty hungry!
I'm pretty sure Tom likes you.
I'm pretty inflated.
I'm trying.
I'm quiet.

I'm sure he'll pass the exam as close as possible.
I'm sure I can find him.
I'm sure I can find them.
I'm sure I'm right.
I'm not sure that's what it was.
I'm sure Tom's never been to Boston.
I'm sure Tom agrees with me.
I'm sure Tom didn't know about it.
I'm sure Tom will know how best he is.

I'm taking you to school.
I'm talking about him.
I'm in trouble.
I'm telling you, you could be a professional carpenter.
I'm the madman.
I'm the madman.
It was me who wanted to meet Tom.
I've been kicked.
I'm the one you love.
I'm the only one here who knows where you've hidden Tom's treasures.
I'm the only one who understands Tom.

I'm a tree.
I'm wet.
I'm willing to help.
I'm willing to pay you a lot of money to do that.
I am with the person I want to be with.
Now I work in Boston.
I'm working on it.
I'm at work tomorrow.
I'm working.
I'm worried about your health.
I'm afraid Tom's gonna get confused.
I am writing my will.
I'm your new partner.
In accordance with our agreement, he stopped asking me personal questions.
I did it.

I had no doubt about that.
I didn't lose hope for a moment.
I didn't get an answer from her.
I didn't get an answer from them.
I've never been caught.
I didn't hurt them at all.
I never hate people; I let them hate themselves.
I didn't learn to write.
I never lied to you.
I'm never looking for handcuffs.
I didn't say I believed him.
I never say anything, even if it makes me nervous.

I never intended to deceive you.
I never wear clothes.
I'll never win.
In Hawaii, you can cruise all year round.
In many ways, men and women are very different.

In the woods, monkeys descended from the little ones.

I talk to her often.
I often hear him playing the melody on the drum.
I often play volleyball.
I ski often.
I only have one minute.
I just exercise to look nice when I'm naked.
I need to break your neck.
I owe Tom a lot.
I owe this to Tom.
I paid the penalty.
I'm planning on skipping lunch.
I'm planning on visiting Tom in Boston next weekend.
I like dogs more than cats.
I'd rather be a goat cheese than a cow.
I prefer eggs from the bottom.
I'd rather be black.
I'd rather sit down.
I would walk alone first.
I'm sure I sound funny.
I promise you I won't do anything that hurts you.
I hit him boxing in the trailer.
I pressed the button to turn on the radio.
I signed the word "Alice" to highlight it.
I offered it.
I put three teaspoons of brown sugar in your tea.
I opened my umbrella.
I quit smoking for a long time.
I gave up.
I'm growing goods.
The Iranians are a peaceful people.
I read his book.
I read Tom's story.
I realized I hadn't eaten yet.
I'm really getting married.
I really like you.
I really don't know.
I really like what your hair looks like.
I really like the wine.
I really like your website very much.
I really love your older sister.
I really missed him.
I really miss my mother's cooking.
I really miss them.
I really want to help him.
I really want to know what's going on here.
I really want to learn French.
It'd be really nice to be quiet.
I got this fax from her.
I recognize a guy.
I refuse to do that.
I refuse to work.
I remember when I met the queen.
I despise his ruthless attitude.
I respect the decision you made.
I rinsed one.
Iron is harder than gold.
Isaac Newton died as a virgin.
I said I'd bring him.
I said maybe it'll turn out.
I told you to open the door.
I said we're closed.
I agreed.
Is there anyone in there?
Is anyone surprised?
Is anything missing?
I saw a ghost last night.
I saw an unidentified flying object.
I saw her a week ago.
I just saw him.
I've seen playing cards with all of them.
I saw him there.
I saw my sister pulling the letter.
But I didn't see anything.
I saw that.
I saw them.
I saw the sponge in the sink.
I saw Tom do it.
I saw Tom with Mary.
I saw Tom.
Is Boston far away?
Is Buddhism a Religion or a Philosophy?
Is Dan aware of what he did?
Are the potatoes caloric?
I don't see a conspiracy here.
"I see," said the blind man.
I see Tom every day.
I see you're awake.
I sent Tom to Boston with me.
I left early to catch the first train.
Are they all busy?
Are they all happy?
Are they all having fun?
Is everything there?
He's breathing?
Does his aunt eat an apple or a banana?
I sneezed with my head.
I should definitely buy you a drink.
I should be sorry about them.
I should take her home.
I need to pack up.
I need to go get dressed.
I should go home.
I shouldn't have trusted her.
I shouldn't have done that without you.
I shouldn't have eaten so much ice cream.
I shouldn't have gone to Tom.
I should sue him.
I'm supposed to look.
I should try to help them.
I should have asked her first.
I should have asked them first.
I should have asked you first.
I was supposed to be more cultural.
I should've checked.
I was supposed to do that yesterday.
I should have known you'd be here.
I should've refused.
I showed him my room.
Did you study outside?
Is it ready?
Is it far from here?
Is Datoeba really too slow today, or does it seem to me?
Is that the last lesson?
Is it time to go?
Is that true?
I've put a slippery slope on him.
I sleep on my feet.
I'm sleeping standing.
I slept like a slut.
I slept on the bill.
I slept on the bus.
I cut off the sandwich.
Did Mike stop drinking alcoholic beverages?
I was smiling.
Isn't that exciting?
Couldn't Tom have done this?
Isn't that unusual?
Isn't that dangerous?
Isn't that enough?
Isn't that too much?
Isn't that good news?
Isn't that the guy who wants to buy your house?
Isn't this great?
Somehow, I like it.
I spent the whole day cleaning up the snow.
Is she a taxi driver?
Is she pregnant or just fat?
Is she really so beautiful?
Is that your mother?
I looked at the man.
I started seeing him.
I started thinking about him.
I slipped something weird.
Is that all Tom does?
Is that all we need?
Is that a rhetorical question?
Does that mean "yes" or "no"?
Is there that word at all?
Is that necessary?
Is that necessary?
Is that what I said?
Is that satisfactory?
Is that Tom's coat?
Is that what Tom thinks happened?
Is that what you did to them?
So there's Tom?
Is that why I'm here?
Is that why you're here?
Is that why you don't want to help him?
Is that why you don't want to help us?
Is that your package?
Is the bridge safe?
Is the coffee hard?
Is the house ready?
Is the lake deep?
Is it paying for the delivery?
Is there a doctor here who speaks English?
Is there food?
Is there anyone else?
Is there anyone else here?
Is there any sugar?
Is there anything else I can do for you?
Is there a problem?
Is there a reward?
Is there anything specific you want to see?
Is this about Tom?
Is this a good time to talk?
Is this in place?
Is it really a diamond?
Is that moral?
Is this just in English?
Is this Jupiter or a bull?
Is this our cabin?
Is it your radio?
Is anyone sitting here?
Is this place free?
Is that all the excitement?
Is this your picture?
Is this your bag?
Is this your bag or his?
Is this yours, Tom?
I still can't believe Tom's gone.
Somehow I still don't believe it.
I still don't understand.
I still don't know how to do that.
I still don’t understand women.
I'm still respecting Tom.
I still love the horse.
I stole it from them.
Does Tom know how to swim?
Is Tom back?
Is Tom aware?
Is Tom contributing?
Is Tom dead?
Is Tom dying of cancer?
Is Tom funny?
Is Tom in Boston?
Is Tom interested?
Is Tom looking for them?
Did Tom bother you?
Is Tom safe?
Is Tom still alive?
You're the man, Tom?
Is Tom alone there?
Is Tom with you now?
I stopped paying attention to Tom.
I ignited a scissor in the dark.
I'm studying art history.
All of a sudden I felt old.
I suffer from asthma.
I suggest you learn more.
I'm suggesting that we focus on asking for a way out of the cave.
I suggest we go home.
I'm hungry for you.
I suggest you send someone out to see what's going on.
I guess I should go talk to Tom.
I guess that's okay.
That's how I doubted it.
I suspect that Tom broke the window.
Swimming in the river.
I swear it wasn't me.
I swear it was them.
I swear, I wouldn't catch up with you to burn, and you'd be the last bucket of water.
I sweat every day.
Is the freezer still working for you?
Is your head full of straw?
I'm taking the opportunity to thank her.
Italian cops are driving me crazy.
I talked to my advisors about what items to take.
It all makes sense.
It seems pointless.
It always happens the same way.
It can't be a coincidence.
So it wasn't.
It's not possible!
They're yours for now.
It did a lot more than I expected.
Never, but just never, could that happen here.
There's no way it was Tom.
That would be a disaster.
It would be good.
I didn't care.
We didn't mention that.
It didn't get so bad.
That disappointed him.
It would look good.
Don't bother me.
It won't get better.
It doesn't look very different.
It doesn’t matter that you don’t want to do that; you have to anyway.
It doesn't matter.
It doesn't seem to help.
Doesn't sound like who knows what.
That doesn't surprise me.
I'm teaching Chinese.
I'm learning English.
That's my day.
That gave me an idea.
I have something to do.
It had to be done.
It has to come from somewhere.
It depends on your decision.
It happened too quickly.
It's happening.
It's happening.
It's cold.
It has nothing to do with luck.
It wasn't easy for us.
It has sentimental value.
I've been thinking about it all day.
I think of him every day.
I think he's right.
I think he's right.
I think he's hiding something?
I think I can.
I think I could get used to seeing you every day.
I think I'd better help him.
I think I'd better help them.
I think I found one like that.
I think I'm stuck.
I think I know him.
I think I know how to find him.
I think I know how to stop him from happening again.
I think I'm going out to eat.
I think I'm gonna go visit Tom and see how he's doing.
I think I love you.
I think I made a good statement.
I think I write pretty well.
I think I'm a pretty normal guy.
I think I can whisper.
I think I'll be fine.
I think I should take a look at Tom.
I think I should have asked for help.
I think I speak French pretty well.
I think it's too risky without any help.
I think it would be best if I stayed here for a while.
I think it's time to start getting ready.
I think it's time you left.
I think it's time to start getting ready.
I think it would be a mistake to lend Tom money.
I think I realized what time we had to leave.
I think I'm wrong.
I think I might be able to help her.
I think she's good at dancing.
I think so.
I think that hotel will be a little expensive for you.
I think that's awful.
I think that's ridiculous.
I think that's Tom.
I think you're right.
I think the box is empty.
I think they saw me.
I think Tom can help.
I think Tom's gone.
I don't think Tom's breathing anymore.
I think Tom's soulless.
I think Tom's conservative.
I think Tom is brave.
I think Tom's crazy.
I think Tom's dying.
I think Tom's funny.
I think Tom is wonderful.
I think Tom's rude.
I think Tom's hurt.
I think Tom's a bad guy.
I think Tom's nice.
I think Tom's fat.
I think Tom's a little kid.
I think Tom's a spider.
I think Tom's rich.
I think Tom's right.
I think Tom's angry.
I think Tom's a slut.
I think Tom's sensitive.
I think Tom knows who stole my wallet.
I think Tom might have a boyfriend.
I think Tom moved to Boston.
I think Tom needs a shuttle to the airport.
I thought Tom was just bluffing.
I don't think Tom's gonna go.
I think we can catch him.
I think it's better not to drink this water.
We'd better not go out on a storm like this.
I think we'll join in.
I think we're close to a solution.
I think we're done.
I think we should call him.
I think we should help him.
I think we should hire him.
I think we need to wait a little longer.
I think we ate enough.
I think we found one.
I think you did it.
I think you did it intentionally.
I think you know the rules.
I think you know Tom.
I think you know what I'm interested in.
I think you know who I am.
I think you're gonna have to help them.
I think you should call him.
I think you're scared.
I think you're exaggerating the problem.
I think you're too good to go to school.
I think you should choose her.
I think you should do this yourself.
I think you're helping me.
I think you've been here before.
I think you've lived in the jungle for too long.
I think you were exposed.
I think you're spending too much time with Tom.
I think you should go out alone with this.
I think it's helped enough.
I thought about what Tom said.
I was thinking of you.
I thought he had bigger tits.
I thought he was there.
I thought I'd ask him for help.
I thought I'd ask them for help.
I thought I lost all my money, but I seem to be wrong.
I thought I'd never find him.
I thought I'd never find Tom.
I thought it was causing me.
I thought you had already found a place to stay.
I thought they found him.
I think this is over.
I thought Tom had a good time.
I thought Tom was retired.
I thought maybe Tom knew where Mary put the key.
I thought Tom might not want to go with us.
I thought Tom was from Boston.
I thought Tom was gonna be here.
I thought Tom was sick.
I thought Tom would be busy.
I thought Tom wouldn't want any help.
I thought Tom wouldn't want to go with us.
Didn't we agree?
I thought we could help you out.
I thought we'd stay here for a while and talk.
We wanted to visit the museum together.
I think you'll have work to do.
Didn't you want the prize?
I thought you found another one.
I thought you'd lost your watch.
So don't you hate him?
I thought I was tired.
I thought you might be able to help.
I thought you might be interested to find out.
I thought you were just dating girls that were lower than you.
Didn't you know how to play the piano?
Didn't you say you know how to swim?
Didn't you say you wanted to come with us?
I thought you were playing chess better than me.
I thought you were crazy about Tom.
I thought you were funny.
I thought you'd live with us.
I thought you were in Boston.
I thought you were planning on staying in bed all day.
I thought you weren't gonna be busy.
I didn't think you'd like it, Tom.
It hurts awful here.
Mary gets nervous when Tom leaves the lid of the cup lifting.
It's a multi-stage process.
It depends on whether we buy it or not.
It's his first day at school.
It's impossible for me to answer the question.
There's no theoretical chance I'll finish the job in a day.
Today it's less wet than yesterday.
It's not cold at all.
It's not expensive.
It's not over yet.
It's not that bad.
It's not wrong.
Can I use it for that?
I'll pay.
He's not coming in.
They say the old chapel is cursed.
It starts to come into our mind that we can’t ignore nature.
It's warm since yesterday.
It is worth citing a well-known passage of his essay.
It's on his forehead.
It's written on his face.
It seems to me to be wrong.
I just don't feel safe about it.
It just sounds boring.
It's happening all the time.
It's gonna be okay.
Soon it will be Christmas.
It'll be hard to convince them.
It's gonna be okay.
It'll be worth it.
It looked awful.
You looked funny.
Looks like you're right.
It looks very tasty.
It looks different.
It seems familiar to me.
Looks like an egg.
Looks like I drank too much last night, it's my head.
Looks like these two are in a relationship again.
Looks like these two have calmed down.
Looks like we're going to have a snowy Christmas this year.
Looks like we're the only ones here today.
It looks nice.
That's how I got closer to Tom.
You figured me out.
I'm worried.
It could be dangerous.
Maybe it'll be hard.
Maybe it's too late.
It might sound like a proposal, but it was an order.
Maybe it'll turn out tonight.
Maybe it sounds weird.
Maybe it'll be a long time before you see me again.
Maybe it's him.
It could be risky.
Maybe it's not just a coincidence.
It might be raining today.
It must have been her.
I must have invented it.
It has to be perfectly symmetrical.
I told him when I saw them, and I told him.
I told the police that Tom was with me at the time.
I told Tom about you.
I told Tom he wasn't welcome here.
I told Tom the truth.
I told Tom to tell you that.
I told you I couldn't.
I told you it would be hard to get out.
I told you my dad died when I was thirteen.
I told you this would be painful.
I told you the truth.
I'm a teacher, too.
I went on a trip to Boston.
I took care of that.
I'm together.
I got back on the bus.
I took Tom for lunch.
My pants are off.
I couldn't sleep all night.
I totally understand.
Probably won't be worth waiting.
It came back two days ago.
It resulted in a lot of difficulties.
I tried to explain it to him, but not the button.
I tried to find Tom.
I tried to get him to come.
I tried to make them stop.
I tried to pretend that I was something I wasn't.
I'm sincerely sorry about that.
I trust the teacher.
I'm trying not to worry about you.
I'm trying not to cut myself.
He's ready to turn.
It's a classic.
It was a real disaster!
It is advisable to check if there may be any negative effects if you drink alcohol while you drink the medication that you have been prescribed.
It's a children's game.
It's a good system.
It's all in the file.
It's all in the room.
It's all over.
Now it's all over.
That's all they're talking about.
It's all very strange.
It'll be over soon.
It's almost midnight in Boston.
It's almost summer.
She's gonna have to go a little further.
Epten's funny.
It's seven o'clock.
It's eleven o'clock.
It's already open.
That's a minor mistake.
It's a miracle that you survived.
It's an honor.
There's nothing to think about.
It's a shame you've ruined everything.
It's about integrity.
That's a reasonable compromise.
That's a false trace.
It's a risky plan.
It's a shame the concrete doesn't burn.
It's fast enough to walk.
It's simple.
It's a special occasion.
It's a stupid rule.
It's a great idea, but it'll take a lot of work.
He's been disbanded.
He just gave me a blowjob.
It's been coming back for a week, up and down.
It's been three weeks since Tom moved to Boston.
Too much time has passed.
This week is extremely hot.
It's best you don't talk that much.
It's better to be alone.
It’s better to be optimistic and to stand out than to be pessimistic and to be right.
“It is better to die on your feet than to live on your knees.” – “Then why are you still alive?”
It's empty.
The sauna's here.
It's new money.
You scared me.
There's no one.
It's time to shut down.
Study here.
It's well known that you don't care, Tom.
It's dark here.
It's deeper than that.
Definitely they are.
It's definitely Tom.
It's different now.
It's hard to evaluate his ability.
It's hard to explain.
It's disturbing.
It's easier like this.
It's easier not to end up in prison than to run away.
It's easy to see why people love Tom.
You can easily distinguish them.
Looks like I misjudged it.
It looks like her style.
I think that’s the only possible conclusion.
It looks very well written.
It's empty.
That's what you need.
It's bad to be pissed.
It's exactly 10 o'clock.
That's exactly what happened, too.
It's very rare.
It's fair.
It's a fairy.
It's to protect you.
It's from the Bible.
It's funny.
Watching TV is fun.
Get dressed.
It's getting darker.
It's getting harder to breathe.
It's gonna be superstitious.
It'll get even colder.
It's gonna happen soon.
I'm glad to see you all again.
It's a good training.
It's good.
It's getting better.
It's a lot of fun.
It's happened before.
It's happening right now, isn't it?
It's hard to explain.
It's hers.
It's hot here in hell.
That should be possible.
This shouldn't take long.
I don't care what you think of Tom.
It is impossible for him to quit smoking.
It's impossible to get out of the cell.
It's a safe place.
She's in great condition.
She's in the basement.
I'm just guessing.
It's a simple question.
It's just invented.
Just sit there.
It's a little ahead.
It's locked.
It is made of leather.
It's my decision, Tom.
That's my only hope.
It's nice and fresh.
It's nice and warm.
It's nice of him to wear such gifts.
It's nice to feel like someone needs you.
It's not a big miracle.
It's not a big miracle.
It's noisy here.
It's not your business!
It's no secret that Tom doesn't agree with you.
That's not a big priority.
That's not a mistake.
It's not attractive.
It's not the other way around.
That's not exactly what happened.
It will not be easy to do that without much help.
It's not hard to stand out if you're surrounded by fools.
It's nothing terrible.
It's not just a guess.
It's not usually a pen.
There is not enough light to read.
It's not that we're doing something.
It's not my decision.
It's not my fault.
You don't have to.
It's not absurd.
It's not that small.
It's not spring yet.
I'm not surprised.
It's not that deep.
It's not too early.
It's not up to you.
It’s not often that someone buys a <0x24>1,000 hat.
It's not worth it.
It was snowing last night.
Obviously it's a printed error.
It’s obvious to everyone that he’s in love.
It's just a temporary solution.
Sounds like Tom.
Sounds very loud.
Sounds very good.
Our job is to help them.
It's deep white.
It's poison.
His presence is important to me.
It's probably hard.
It's probably true.
Probably still has it.
Probably it's still available.
It's a duck.
Actually, it's very frequent.
It's delicious.
It's possible I'm wrong.
It's possible Tom wouldn't help us at all.
It's very simple.
It's really exciting.
It's really ugly.
It's a real shame.
It's really weird.
It's red.
It's so beautiful.
It's so complicated.
But it's strong!
It's the law!
It's so obvious we don't need any evidence.
It's starting to fade.
It's still dark outside.
It's still on sale.
It's still working.
It's still not valid.
It's still growing.
It's still there.
It's strange how people in tropical areas eat spicy food like curry.
It's stuck.
Its surface was flat like a mirror.
It's time for that again.
This is the best steak I've ever tasted.
It's a spider's chestnut.
I'm so scared, I'm so scared.
It's time to get to work.
It's time to get up.
It's Tom's office.
It's too impressive.
It's too late to help you.
It is too risky to fight them in the place of their choice.
Epten is strong.
It's shit.
It's all wrong.
You can't stand the heat.
It is unique and irreplaceable.
It's unnatural.
It's really hot.
I need to see Tom immediately.
Very relaxed.
It's very simple to understand.
It's warm here.
I guess it doesn't matter.
There's wind.
It's from work.
You're losing.
It's yours to ask, Tom.
It's yours.
It only takes three minutes to boil the water.
It lasted all night.
It took a lot longer than I thought it would take.
It took me a long time to get rid of those ants.
It turns out you're unexpectedly flattering.
I turned on the fan and pointed it to the wall.
I turned on the lamp.
I turned off the TV.
I turned Tom down.
It was a great honor for me to give a speech.
It was so wonderful.
That was a shame.
It was after midnight.
It was an arena day.
It was a great series.
That was all my idea.
It was okay here.
It was so easy.
It was an amazing evening.
It was a session.
It was a terrible sight.
It was an honor.
It was an offer I couldn’t refuse.
It was a shame for me to spend the night with a smart, spiritual and beautiful girl like you.
It was an extraordinary experience.
That was a surprise.
It was a wonderful experience.
It was a tough test.
It was a warm night.
It was a wonderful day.
It was a great day.
It was a lovely night.
Such behavior was childish on his part.
It was disgusting.
It was effective.
It was pretty funny.
It was too late.
It was for her.
It was from her.
It was one of them.
Yesterday was fun.
It was overnight.
It was dark.
It was ironic.
It was my fault.
That was my suitcase.
It's nice of you to buy Tom such a nice gift.
It was kind of you to let me stay here last night.
It wasn't as hard as I thought it would be.
It wasn't easy for me to admit I was wrong.
It was not easy to solve this problem.
It didn't matter.
It wasn't my idea.
It wasn't very good.
It was pretty disgusting.
It has been proven that dogs’ turtles jump higher than cats’ turtles.
It was so majestic.
It was pretty funny.
Epten was cheap.
It was really good.
It was really nice.
It was really nice.
That was really touching.
He was smoking a lot.
It was wonderful.
I had to.
It was seven and a half.
It was such a beautiful day that we decided to go hiking.
It was so obvious.
It was weird.
He was still there.
Tom gave me the picture that was hung on the bucket.
It was Tom.
It was too little.
It was a pity.
I arrived in Tokyo two months ago.
That was unbearable.
It was very generous of you to buy us all these things.
It was very thick in that room, because all the windows were closed.
It was Better.
It was worth a try.
It was your fault.
It's not gonna be okay.
It won't be enough.
I'm not going to be alone here.
It won't cost you anything to fix.
They won't help the lies.
It won't help you.
It works well.
It would be normal for you to be mad at Tom.
It wouldn't matter.
I'll talk to you tomorrow if I catch you to explain everything to you.
I need you urgently.
I've heard you before.
I used to dream of becoming a ballerina.
I used to hate you.
I use it every day.
I'm using that computer.
I'm using this.
I've already packed up.
I've read it already.
I’ve already written everything I needed to write.
I've already written my part of the report.
I've always admired Tom.
I've always been careful not to say too much.
Someone's always been helping me.
I always thought you were from Boston.

Write down your date of birth.
Write it to Tom.
If it were, it would be repaired... when the worm gives birth to the grape.
Yeah, bring me some cashew.
Yeah, anyways.
Yeah, I said that, but I was wrong.
Yes, my angel.
Yeah, and?
Yeah, well?

You'd better go.
You better let me do that.
You deserve a medal.
You deserve a higher salary.
You deserved better.
You would have taken my place, too.
He did the job badly.
You did the job nicely.
You didn't buy that, did you?
You didn't give me a chance.
Didn't you know that Tom's a coward?
You didn't listen.
You didn't see anyone coming in, did you?
You didn't tell me what was wrong.

You know I don't eat meat.
You know me better than you think.
You know me very well.
You know, sometimes you need to hear it.
You know what I need.
You know, you don't mean anything to me anymore, Mary!

You saved my life.
You look disoriented.
Looks like you already know the answer.

You jumped a button.
You've probably seen a lot worse.
You've been postponing this for too long, you've got to finish it tonight!
You've seen what I can do.
You were unbelievable.
He was in love with Tom, wasn't he?

You were right, Tom.
He was driving fast.
He was great.
