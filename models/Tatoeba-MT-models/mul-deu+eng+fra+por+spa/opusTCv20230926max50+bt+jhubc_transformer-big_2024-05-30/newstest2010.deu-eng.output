Barack Obama is the fourth U.S. president to receive the Nobel Peace Prize
U.S. President Barack Obama comes to Oslo, Norway for 26 hours, to be the fourth U.S. president in history to receive the Nobel Peace Prize.
In addition, he receives the diploma as well as the medal and a check over <0x24>1.4 million for his extraordinary efforts to intensify world diplomacy and cooperation among the peoples.
The head of the White House will arrive tomorrow with his wife Michelle in the Northwestern metropolis and will be busy all the time.
First, he visits the Nobel Institute, where he meets for the first time with the five committee members who elected him in October from 172 people and 33 organizations.
The presidential couple then planned a meeting with the Norwegian king Harald V. and Queen Sonja.
In the afternoon, the visit reaches its peak with the ceremony at which Obama takes over the prestigious award.
He is the fourth U.S. president, but only the third to receive the award directly in office.
The White House has already announced that Obama will talk about the war in Afghanistan when he takes over the prize.
The president does not want to evade this issue because he knows he is taking over the prize as a president who is currently at war in two countries.
He reinforced the war efforts a few days ago by sending further troops to Afghanistan, which none of his critics will forget to highlight.
At the ceremony, Obama also received the gold medal, diploma and cheque of over 10 million Swedish kronor (about 24 million Czech kronor).
The money he intends to donate for charitable purposes, but he has not yet decided on a specific charitable work.
The event programme will then include a banquet with the President and his wife, which will include the Prime Minister and 250 other invited guests, in addition to the King and Queen of Norway.
Obama was very restrained at the price from the start.
For example, he claimed that he felt that he didn’t deserve the prize.
He also repeated repeatedly that the price is not only for him, but for all those who strive for the same values as he.
Immediately after the announcement, he noted that this was for him "a call to action".
Nature Conservatives Accused of Extortion
The Leitmeritz police accused the chairman of the association "Naturschutzgemeinschaft Leitmeritz" of extortion.
In several cases last year, he introduced professions against some construction procedures, for the withdrawal of his professions he demanded money from investors in his favor, said Leiteritz police spokeswoman Alena Romova.
The chairman of the Leitmeritz Nature Conservation Community is Lubomir Studnicka.
Now he is in prison and he is facing a prison term of up to three years.
The sorter mull containers in Brno don't smell good
In Prague, people can sort the beverage packages, in the southern Moroccan towns you can find the sorter containers step by step.
And in Brno?
There you have to book a few minutes to find the right garbage tones.
I do not want to say that the waste separation in Brno would not work at all.
But it seems to me that the councillors do not care enough about this problem, even if we are the second largest city in the Republic.
Brno is in the waste race in the original forest league, not only because we as citizens here are always allowed to dispose of only paper, glass and plastics in the sorting containers, but above all by the number of tons of waste for such waste.
Have you ever tried to get rid of the PET bottles in a collection basket, for example?
This is art, and above all it takes time and strong nerves.
The only place I have found so far by chance is the marching place in front of the affected gangs.
Mr Underka, his colleagues should not bother us, but I do not like that much.
Apart from the fact that the separation of waste in other parts is also not a honey leak.
A lot of my friends prefer not to sort the waste at all.
It's a faculty.
They are too far away from the garbage.
I'm not surprised.
I even offered to get rid of a few glass and plastic bottles after the celebration.
But on the Konicova street I have not seen any coloured garbage in sight.
Fortunately, I came to the right place for the tram.
The garbage was almost over.
This is still the center of Brno, which represents the whole city, isn’t it?!
However, ecology and some kind of aesthetics probably cool down the Brno socialists.
You’d rather buy the city an ice hockey league that shames us all over the Republic, rather than buying a few more tons of garbage and offering the sorting of other raw materials for a cleaner well.
I’m glad that I was able to confirm my assumption with official statistics after searching the internet for a while.
According to the company EKO-KOM, Brno is the worst in the entire district of Südmärchen.
The "Paroubek" budget has withdrawn the money for pensions and sick money
After the left party gave farmers and officials more money despite the government’s view, there is no money in the budget for pensions, sick money and construction savings.
But not for the debtors of the state or for the international court dispute.
This will cause even more problems to those who will be in the government in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and Communists implemented the wage increase for some groups, they expected the government to borrow the money in addition for the delicate expenses, old-age pensions or the sick money. "That's just a push for the problems in the future," Minentagen says yes.
In fact, higher interest rates are being paid from the loans, and you need to refund the money sometime.
Too much to choose from, the state treasury is empty.
If the social benefits or costs for the State operation are not reduced, the tax is to be increased.
For all those to whom the left party now gave more money: the fire department, the teachers, the farmers.
Later on, too, for their children.
To get the pensions or sick money, from which the 1.8 billion account has disappeared, people don’t have to be afraid to get that money.
But for the price that the state owes itself even more - next year, not only 163 billion will be missing in the state treasury, but much more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota, the debt increases more and more rapidly, along with the cost and interest.
The state will need the money for the compensation, then it will no longer be enough to only slightly increase the VAT or cut the maternity allowance, as the government did in its regional deficit package.
Due to the money lapse in favour of some electorate groups, there will also be a shortage of five billion in the next year for the expansion of highways and railways.
These are mainly the sections won in the competition, which can no longer be redesigned and possibly approved.
At the very least, get what is not free.
This means the delay or closure of thirty large buildings, the European monetary accumulation is also at risk, warns the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka.
The CSSD has proposed that it solves the flow of money Salomonically - it attacks the share dividends of CEZ, where the state is the owner of the majority, and from which the money is poured into the transport funds.
The problem is that the amount of the dividend is never certain and is by no means an infinite source.
Last year, 18 billion of CEZ fell into the budget.
Annually, the dividends pay for environmental damages and liquidations, the pension account is replenished and this money also serves as a reserve for the planned pension reform.
With this trick, according to EU rules, the actual budget deficit rises to the level of 5.7 percent of GDP.
However, the carnival of the revolutions is not over yet.
Almost <0x24>3 billion dropped the budget for various compensations for victims of communism and crimes or for expenses in court proceedings, even for building savings.
Whether the state can handle it without this money is not certain.
This is pure gambling.
If we lose an international court dispute, we have to pay for it anyway, explains Janota.
The minister must then save the money to the reservoirs or, at worst, attack the government budget reserve.
Hundreds of millions are also missing for the already initiated two-billion-billion-dollar project "State Treasury", which is intended to allow on-line monitoring, for which the individual authorities spend the money.
The first stage starts in January.
If the finance minister does not find the money elsewhere, the project should be stopped and in this case sanctions will come, warned Janota.
Your next smartphone will dominate two operating systems
Americans expect for the future a mobile phone on which the user can switch between different operating systems by pressing a single button.
The plans presented look promising.
It’s enough to just press a button, and Windows Mobile will switch to Android within a few seconds.
This is precisely what the American company VMware wants to present, which focuses primarily on the development of virtual software for computers.
We allow you to run two user profiles simultaneously on your phone.
You can switch between these, you can separate them into two home and work profiles.
Both will work in parallel, Srinivas Krishnamurti told VMware in an interview for Computerworld magazine.
It was presented in November last year and presented for the first time a few days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
Virtualization of smart phones is not fiction.
VMware has already successfully presented the smartphone test pattern with two operating systems to the journalist.
One was a modified Nokia N800 with 128 MB of RAM on which the mentioned Windows Mobile and Android systems were running simultaneously.
The development of new technology for mobile phones is in full swing.
Now VMware is working with European and American operators on the virtualization of smartphones and the devices are expected to arrive to the customer by 2012.
Snow deficiency in the mountains torments hotel owners
Scneeless slopes are not just worrying about the giant mountains.
The lack of snow also frightens people from ordering ski stays in hotels and pensions.
This is why you can still get free rooms in Giant Mountains for all winter dates including Christmas and New Year's Eve.
Our pages are often visited.
People go through the offers, set the prices, but now they are afraid to order bindingly.
And when they call us, they immediately ask if we think this year's Christmas party will be on snow or "on match", said information portal operator Spindl.Info, Martin Jandura.
If you want to spend the New Year in the spindle mill exactly according to your ideas, do not hesitate to order.
If you prefer savings and where the quality of your stay comes in second place, you can try to wait a few more days.
The Spindelmühle hotel owners now offer only weekly weekends for the New Year’s Day.
I think they will try to sell these for a while, but then they will also have to surrender, and enter for shorter periods of time.
And then the free rooms will disappear quickly, appreciated Jandura.
Free beds at all times of winter are always offered by the travel agency Ingtours in Vrchlabi.
Now we are most interested in the Christmas week, which has not yet been sold out.
In our offer, about half of the seats are still available.
That’s why we’ve already prepared some cheaper Christmas holidays for the last minute, said the director of the travel agency Ingtours, Petr Schiefert.
The Vrchlabi travel agency can also offer you the New Year’s Eve in Giesengebirge, but there are fewer vacancies here.
Good sales also find the first fourteen days in February, the remaining winter dates are sold on average.
This year’s interest in winter stays is also negatively influenced by the fact that there is always no snow in the Giant Mountains.
People are waiting to see if snow falls.
No one wants to spend the end of the year in the mountains without snow.
If the slopes are snowy within a week, Christmas will also be sold out, says Schiefert.
Conversely, and a little better than last year, it manages to occupy the rooms at the Hotel Horizont in Pecpod Snezkou.
We are about 5% better than we were last year.
On New Year’s Day and Christmas, we only have a few free rooms left.
There is great interest in the Polish holidays in Janua, and in February the business will also run well, informed the director of the best Pec hotel, Karel Rada.
80 percent for the New Year’s Eve stays are also occupied by the Hotel Omnia at the central parking lot in Janske Lazne.
On the other hand, half of the beds remain free for Christmas at the newest hotel in Janske Lazne.
We were pleasantly surprised by January this year, for which we are already about 60 percent occupied.
A little weaker is now in February, but the moment when the snow comes, the interest in staying in the Giant Mountains is also definitely increasing, said the director of the Hotel Omnia, Erik Sporysch.
The hotel owners of Giesengebirge are now waiting for greater snow protection.
On Thursday it should cool down and if it is raining, it should be snowing on the mountains.
But after that, there will be warming again, Jiri Jakubsky from the site of the Czech Weather Agency in Hradec Kralove.
USA: Repeat as Mother of Wisdom
It is almost funny with what student ambition Barack Obama, the president with his reputation as the wisest, repeats the strategy of his predecessor in the Afghanistan issue, which he himself considered the dimest.
When he finally sold out his long-awaited doctrine of Afghanistan, it turned out that he had written it off the copy paper from the Bush-Iraq scenario for three years.
Not only did he use the wording “as in Iraq” several times in the text itself, he even used the name of the January 2007 Bush Declaration as the name of his own declaration: “New Way forward” without damaging it.
Three years ago, he himself criticized Bush’s idea of sending fresh contingents into Iraq, plagued by the civil war, as “irresponsible and catastrophic decision.”
Months later, however, showed that the Bush strategy, based on military recommendations, was the only possible and, to this extent, very successful, that the news about Iraq is no longer spoken at all today.
Bush’s reputation was not improved by this, as he objectively left his successor a much more grateful starting situation than expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes that the miracle will happen again.
The military again asked him to increase the contingent, especially the commander-in-chief of Operation General Stanley McCristal, who, despite the subordination habits, harshly criticized the deplorable gunmen in the White House.
He demanded 40,000 soldiers to be able to reverse the situation for the better.
The president hesitated for three months, but did not come up with a better idea, so he cheated on the general for 10,000 soldiers.
From Europe, he has pushed the pledge for another 5,000, even though he originally expected at least 10,000.
The ultimate problem with the entire Obama strategy is his plan to withdraw troops from Afghanistan in 18 months, and to complete this process in three years. The entire Obama Doctrine leaves more questions than answers.
Some doubt that the cut-off will have the same effect as the action in Iraq.
Despite the civil war of recent years, the Iraqi society is relatively well structured, its leaders respect the values.
The Afghan situation is characterised by the contraindication - no one can be trusted and no agreements are held.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces, who are accustomed to changing their minds every day.
The political institutions, even if formally established correctly, remain only seemingly constructs, behind which the patriarchal tribal relations will continue to grow.
The balance of interests between the different ethnic groups is unusually complicated, especially because of the unclear conditions that further complicate Pakistan and Iran influences.
The construction of a "actable state", which is the minimalist goal of the whole operation, is also very unrealistic.
Time horizon of Obama’s strategy alienated by his volunteerism
Over the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only deteriorated further and is now on the verge of the explosion.
Believing that the little soldiers who broke out in the war cry about the "early homecoming" can create a miracle here, only a truly romantic soul who cannot be impressed by the facts.
From a political point of view, the date for the withdrawal of troops is pure irresponsibility, because the Taliban will take this as an indirect confession of American defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that the willingness of Europeans to take part in the fighting in Afghanistan is negligible.
Europe’s politicians cannot and do not want to explain to their voters how Germany’s or Italy’s security is linked to the war in the Hindustan mountainside.
Another possible factor that can radically influence the situation is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the increased sanctions on the Iranians do not affect, there is a very difficult question for the United States whether the problem can be solved with troops.
This question must be answered during the period when America moves after Obama to win the withdrawal from Afghanistan.
However, any solution will also mean a dramatic reversal of the Afghan situation.
The only consolation for Barack Obama is the fact that there are still three years left until the presidential election, and so there is still enough time left for him to take on another strategy if it turns out to be a total failure.
Bank Goldman Sachs managers will no longer receive bonuses in cash
The top executives of the American bank Goldman Sachs will no longer receive bonuses in cash this year.
This has been announced by the company, which responds to the sharp criticism of its wage practices.
A group of 30 top managers will receive shares instead of the money, which can only be sold in five years.
In addition, the shares can be withdrawn to the managers in the case if they act excessively risky.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs is at the forefront of efforts to connect Wall Street premium bonuses with long-term performance.
I believe that Wall Street is aware of the further direction in which it has to go, said former JPMorgan company banker Douglas Elliott.
The problem lies in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs became the target of criticism after putting aside nearly <0x24>17 billion for bonuses for the first three quarters of this year.
The total amount of bonuses over the course of this year is likely to exceed <0x24>20 billion, despite the measure announced today.
The high premium bonuses in the banking sector have become the hottest political issue in a number of countries with the start of the financial crisis.
The UK reported on Wednesday that it intends to charge the bankers’ bonuses, which exceed <0xC2><0xA3>25,000, once with a 50 percent tax.
Similar steps are being taken by France.
This year, women have won the Nobel Prize in all disciplines, except in physics.
Today in Stockholm, five record women from the hands of King Carl XVI of Sweden Gustaf took over this year’s Nobel Prizes in the categories of specialists and for literature.
Among the four scientists was the German writer of Romanian descent, Herta Müller.
Two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, together with their countryman Jack Szostak, have won the Nobel Prize in Medicine for their research in the chromosomes field.
The prize for chemistry was awarded to Israeli Ada Jonathan, along with the Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz, for illuminating the Ribosom structure and function.
The last laureate won the Nobel Prize in Economics, which the American Elinor Ostrom and her countryman Oliver Williamson received for their analysis of the economic report.
The only category in which no woman received a Nobel Prize this year was physics.
Today, scientists Charles Kao and George Smith, together with Willard Boyl, have won this award for research in the field of fiberglasses for the invention of the CCD chip, which is the basis of all digital cameras, fax devices, or astronomical telescopes.
Each of these winners has received the diploma, the Nobel medal and the certificate of acquiring the money prize.
It is worth 10 million Swedish krona in each category.
If there are several winners in each category, the money prize will be divided among them.
According to tradition, U.S. President Barack Obama received the most anticipated Nobel Peace Prize this afternoon in Oslo.
In his speech, he acknowledged the controversy of his appointment because he is only at the beginning of his journey, and is also at the forefront of the country leading two wars - in Iraq and in Afghanistan.
In keeping with his policy, however, he added that wars are necessary in certain situations to fight for world peace, even if the price is high.
Minister Janota considers resignation. Klaus invited him to the castle
On Friday morning, President Vaclav Klaus welcomes the Minister of Finance, Eduard Janota, who is considering his stay in the government because he disagreed with the implementation of the state budget for the next year in the form it was released by the House of Representatives on Wednesday.
It is assumed that the budget and perhaps the stay of Janota in the cabinet will be the topics of the Friday meeting.
The budget is also criticized by Klaus.
According to him, the deficit is too high, which further deepens the crisis of public finances.
Speaker of the meeting, Radim Ochvat, informed about the meeting.
Janota will be negotiating with Prime Minister Jan Fischer on Monday.
According to the budget law, which Klaus is now getting to sign, the Czech Republic should run with a deficit of 163 billion kroner.
On Wednesday, however, the parliament voted on the left-wing proposals for money laundering and increased money for civil servants' salaries, for the maintenance of social benefits and direct wages of farmers.
The government has opposed the proposals of the Social Democracy to increase the budget deficit in secret.
A sharp internal political dispute has arisen between the left party on the one hand and the government, Klaus and the right party, on the other hand, and the question marks on the further work of the Fischer Officers’ Cabinet, on which the ODS, CSSD and Green Party have been formed.
Critics argue that the budget, as adopted by Parliament, practically liquidates the package of austerity measures implemented by the Fisheries Government in the autumn, and that it understands that government debt should end.
Klaus, who can sign the law on the state budget, but does not have to, explained today at the discussion breakfast with the entrepreneurs that politicians have neglected the "serious problem" that is "the unsustainable deficit" of public finances for a long time.
In his opinion, there is no good solution today.
An improvement could only bring about a strong government that could build on a broader consensus of political parties.
ODS chairman Mirek Topolanek said the budget is ugly, and the government should consider its continued existence.
The ODS Deputy Chairman, Petr Necas, told the CTK that the Cabinet concept with the support of the CSSD, ODS and the Green Party obviously no longer works.
Prime Minister Fischer described similar words in the editorial as "strong statements".
The CSSD chief, Jiri Paroubek, responded to Topolanek’s words that the state deficit is appalling that the former government of Topolanek had prepared for this year, and that it exceeds 200 billion kroner.
On Wednesday, the CSSD assessed the approval of the state budget for the next year as a success.
The People’s Party was also pleased.
Mandela starred in Morgan Freeman's new film by Clint Eastwood
The South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film "Invictus: The Undefeated" shows a lot about the country, of whose struggle and victories despite some criticism, that the main role was occupied by an American actor.
The story tells about sports, race relations, and about Nelson Mandela.
The tireless fighter against the racist apartheid regime in South Africa and its first black president, Nelson Mandela, is portrayed in his life story by American Oscar actor Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said he was asked by Mandela, ninety-nine, if he could play him in the Eastwood film.
Matt Damon plays another important role.
I said to him, "If I'm going to play you, I have to meet you.
The seventy-two-year-old actor, who had received the award for his role in the Eastwood drama from the boxing field "Million Dollar Baby", was already the leader of the movement for the abolition of slavery, from which, in the end, it has become so important to many, and is also a fictitious god in all of the U.S. states.
The former South African statesman was imprisoned for 27 years for his active activity in ending apartheid in the South African Republic.
He was set free in 1990 and for four years he became the president of the country.
In 1993, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
"Invictus" is the Latin word for "unpunished", and at the same time is the name of a poem by English author William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The challenge was how he spoke.
The film depicts a true event in which Nelson Mandela merged his forces with the captain of the South African rugby team, Francois Pienaar, to agree on the country. The new President Mandela knows that his people remain racially and economically divided even after apartheid.
He believes that he can agree with his people through sports, so he decides to agree with the rugby players who belong to the outsiders around the world.
Finally, the South African team is up until the World Cup of 1995.
Freeman worked for several years to bring the Mandela story to the screen.
“He had no other goal but to play this role in order to bring it as close to reality as possible,” Freeman said.
The biggest challenge was, of course, to speak like him.
The actor said if he and the world politician were in the same country, he would try to meet Mandela, have dinner with him, and be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing for him was to shake Mandela’s hand.
I noticed when I shake your hand, I take over your energy, it is transmitted, and I had the feeling that I knew what you were feeling, he said.
It’s important to me to be a different person.
Matt Damon is portrayed in the film as François Pienaar, captain of the national rugby team, in which the white players have prevailed.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for the role in the tough rugby world.
It was a big surprise for him when he first met Pienaar in his house.
I remember when I called the doorbell that he opened and the first thing I said to François Pienaar in my life was, ‘I look much bigger in the movie.’
Despite the obvious differences in the actor's stature compared to their actual models, he received positive reviews under the direction of director Eastwood "Invictus: Unsuccessful" and is also talking about prospects for an Oscar.
The film critic of the Daily Variety magazine, Todd McCarthy, summarized his assessment in the following words: "It was a very good story, a very good film."
In the film reviews on rottentomatoes.com, Invictus received 76 percent positive reviews.
Light Secret Revealed About Norway: Russians Tested a Rocket
A special light effect of unknown origin was observed over Norway.
The Russian Defense Ministry admitted only yesterday that an intercontinental ballistic missile had been tested near the Norwegian border.
The launch, however, was again unsuccessful and the missile called the type "Bulava", which was originally supposed to be the pride of the Russian army, will slowly become the nightmare of the Russian generality and of the Prime Minister, Vladimir Putin.
Even his repeated presence on the ground during the missile test did not have a positive effect on the success of the test flights.
Bulava is usually not started at all or has been damaged in the air.
Russian newspapers have already written about "Bulava" as a "missile that does not fly".
A rocket that does not fly but lights
This 13th attempt, at the beginning, went normal.
It was only at the end of the flight that technical damage occurred to the rocket.
Probably the engine exploded in the third stage of the rocket.
This time, "Bulava" was launched from the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donsky, which was flying under the waters of the White Sea.
This type of rocket allows the launch from the submarine.
Therefore, it is likely that the mysterious light caused by an indeterminate flying object over the North Roads was actually the damaged "Bulava".
In addition, the Norwegians have not doubted since the first moment that it is a Russian missile.
This time, the generality has defended itself, claiming that it is not possible to speak clearly of a failure.
The first two stages of the rocket did not fall out and only the third stage was affected by the accident.
In the previous cases, the engines were damaged in the first stage.
Even if no test start was made without error, the Department of Defense’s leadership considers only six out of thirteen to be unsuccessful.
The nearly fifty percent success therefore meets the generality with optimism and so it is continued to be claimed that the "Bulava" will fly once without problems and will even carry up to ten hypersonic atomic explosive heads with a total weight of max. 1.15 tons.
The legendary Fetisov has signed an annual contract with CSKA Moscow at the age of 51
The legendary defender Vjaceslav Fetisov is again playing professional ice hockey at the age of 51.
The former World Champion, Olympic Winner and Stanley Cup holder is helping his team CSKA Moscow in need, and is likely to play in the KHL duel against Petersburg on Friday.
Fetisov, who completed his career at the age of forty, in 1998, is currently the president of the CSKA.
After Denis Kuljas got hurt, we urgently need another defender.
Fetisov has regularly trained and agreed that he will support the team.
We just need to clarify a few remaining formalities, the AP agency quoted the coach of the Moscow club of Sergei Nemcinov.
It is not yet clear whether the comeback of the famous ice hockey player will be just one game.
“I think Fetisov is one of those who can raise the morale of other players,” said Nemcinov.
When Fetisov returns to the ice surface, he will become the oldest Russian professional ice hockey game according to AP.
In the NHL, legendary stormer Gordie Howe played a full season for Hartford at the age of fifty-one and was able to score 15 goals and 26 assists.
The oldest of the famous Five, Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov, is one of the best and most successful ice hockey players in history.
In the Soviet Union, he won two Olympic gold medals, seven world championships and also triumphed in the Canada Cup and the Junior World Championships.
In the second part of his career, he also gained success in the NHL, where he doubled the Stanley Cup in the Detroit Dress.
Since 2001 he has been a member of the ice hockey star.
Hyundai surrenders to trade unions. All overtime is cancelled
The management of the Hyundai Nosovice automotive factory agreed with the union to cancel all overtime.
Due to frequent overtime, the trade union announced its strike readiness on Monday.
This was confirmed by the spokesman of the Hyundai automotive factory, Petr Vanek.
The management, however, wants to agree with the trade unionists on a Saturday story this week.
We must not give up our production plan, which is a principle, therefore, on Saturday, December 19, voluntary overtime was proposed for the reason that two layers of work would be worked, Vanek said.
The website Sedmicka.cz wrote that the company offered a bonus of CZK 400 to the employees who would work for the Saturday layer.
Employees will also receive the following for the Saturday night of November 28th.
According to Vanek, the company has decided to change the mode of motivation of the employees for the proposed overtime.
Either they can pay the overtime surcharge or they can take a substitute holiday on December 28 and thus extend the Christmas holidays, Vanek said.
In addition, all Saturday staff will be paid the ticket and lunch.
Given that the overtime was the most pressing and burning point with regard to the demands and complaints of the unions that had stopped production last week, the management decided yesterday afternoon with immediate effect on the cancellation of all overtime for the month of December.
The employees of the automotive factory had been forced to work almost two more hours each day after the eight-hour shift until last week.
With the signing of the agreement, the willingness to strike on the part of the trade unions will be revoked.
Further negotiations between the management of the automotive factory and the trade unions are expected to take place on Friday afternoon.
The union leader, Petr Kuchar, said on Wednesday that if they can agree on fulfilling the demands and sign a joint document, they will be ready to lift the strike readiness.
The situation at the automotive factory peaked last week on Wednesday when about 400 employees spontaneously striked because of constant overtime.
They also protested against poor payment terms and alleged schikan.
The management argued that the employees must make the overtime to meet the automotive delivery requirements.
The unions also demanded in their Monday strike readiness statement that employees who had stopped production on Wednesday would not be subject to any sanctions.
In the area of overtime, the trade unions demand that overtime work be reduced to a minimum.
In addition, they are calling for the payment of 5,000 kroner this year.
Hyundai’s Nosovice automotive factory now employs 2,000 people.
Serial production started in the company in November last year.
By September, around 80,000 vehicles were manufactured here, with a current production capacity of 200,000 vehicles per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that also works on ‘stealed’ HIV viruses
The team of Czech and German scientists is testing new compounds to block the spread of HIV viruses in the organism.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also works on viruses that are already resistant to drugs.
This fact prevails against the disadvantage that the compound on common virus variants does not work as strongly as one of the already existing drugs.
The disease of AIDS cannot be cured yet.
The patient can, however, prolong the lifespan of the drug and prevent the proliferation of HIV viruses in the body.
However, your intake is accompanied by a whole range of side effects.
Incomplete suppression of viral proliferation also results in the development of so-called resistant viruses, against which no medicines are more effective.
The work of the experts from three institutes of the Academy of Sciences CR, from the VSCHT (Chemical and Technological College) Prague and from the University of Heidelberg opens the way to cope with virus resistance.
They have shown that the substances referred to as metallocarbons act on the protein responsible for the proliferation of the HIV virus.
The metallocarbons are compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block the viral reproduction in a different way than all the drugs used today, so they can overcome the resistance problem.
In their work, the scientists arrive at new ‘enhanced’ compounds prepared based on the knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their binding to the viral protein.
The metallocarbons have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multiple cages consisting of bore, hydrogen and carbon atoms and are coupled by a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
Domestic and persistent viruses
HIV protease is a protein of the HIV virus that is essential for the virus's life cycle.
Without the HIV virus division caused by HIV protease, no mature infectious virus particles would be produced.
When we turn off HIV protease, we also turn off the proliferation of the virus in the patient’s body, the scientists explain in a press release published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences CR.
In the paper published in the journal Journal of Medical Chemistry, the scientists describe a whole series of compounds in which two pairs of cages (see table) are coupled by a short organic chain, which is then systematically further altered.
A little weaker, but more reliable
The effect of this series of substances against HIV protease was tested in the reagent glass, also against their resistant (resistant) variants obtained from HIV-infected patients.
The effect of metallocarborons on the common enzyme variant is not as strong as on clinically used medicines, but it does not lose its effect on the resistant variants against which the medicines used are often ineffective.
The unique mechanism of action, as well as its additional properties, such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of further chemical formations, makes the metallocarbons interesting compounds for further research aimed at the development of effective drugs against HIV.
Struggle over budget. ODS started on Fischer, who defends himself
The chairman of the ODS, Mirek Topolanek, described the approved budget for next year as "great" and the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should in his opinion consider its further existence.
The statement of the ODS referred to the Prime Minister as "strong statements".
There is supposed to be time for analysis.
The deputy chairman of the ODS, Petr Necas, said that the Cabinet concept with the support of the CSSD, ODS and the Green Party obviously no longer works.
According to Necas, the Prime Minister has to decide whether he intends to rely on the minority in Parliament when it comes to the fight against the rising deficit, or whether he wants to stay in office with the help of the parliamentary left.
The approach of the SDGs and the Social Democrats to the issue of public deficits is diametrically different, Necas pointed out.
Parliament adopted the budget for 2010 on Wednesday, but with left party amendments of more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>12 billion.
Parliament has increased the money for civil servants, for the maintenance of social benefits and for direct payments to farmers.
The government has opposed the proposals of the Social Democracy to increase the budget deficit in secret.
The Czech Republic is expected to deal with a residue of 163 billion kroner.
The ODS has left the Chamber before the vote, so it has obeyed the government's wish, because the amended budget is also only a less bad variant of the budget provisorium.
Disappointment and Senselessness
The finance minister, Eduard Janota, spoke of his disappointment and a sense of senselessness, but Prime Minister Jan Fischer said the government was still assessing the current situation.
Necas is convinced that if Janota had seriously threatened with his resignation in the case, the amendments would be accepted, the situation would look different.
According to Czech television, Janota has registered with the Premier for Monday after the government's deal.
He has indicated that he is considering his further stay in office.
The reason for this is his disappointment with the budget oversight.
The extent to which Fischer is speaking for the further struggle with the budget deficit, according to Necas, the Social Democracy (CSSD) nominees who had implemented the budget changes have nothing to do with the government.
The Prime Minister should also make it clear that he will resign if Parliament continues to adopt deficit-increasing laws, such as those relating to sick and retirement allowances or service bills.
Topolanek: Ministers nominated by ODS were not wrong
This is the case of Prime Minister Fischer and the entire government.
The ministers nominated by the ODS have made no mistakes, Topolanek said in a text message from the United States.
It has mentioned that in some ministries there are people in deputy positions who confess to TOP 09, which voted against the budget.
Necas stressed that if Fischer decides to give up the struggle against the deficit level of public finances, "it is perfectly logical and correct that he relies on the left-wing majority that is currently in parliament".
Then he cannot expect the support and tolerance of the bourgeois democrats.
I have not thought about it, and if it is up-to-date, then I will deal with it, Martin Bartak, the Minister of Defence appointed by the Citizen Democrats, told reporters in Parliament.
This afternoon, Prime Minister Fischer flew to Brussels for the European Council.
The ODS resigned at the request of the Prime Minister
At the same time, Necas stressed that the ODS would probably vote against the amended budget in Parliament on Wednesday if the Prime Minister explicitly asked the MEPs to allow the budget to be adopted.
We are not orphans, we are not small children, so he responded to the question of whether the ODS was not pushed back in the political negotiations on the budget by the absence of the party chairman in Parliament and in the Czech Republic.
I didn’t realize my voice was missing.
“Already when I gave up my mandate, I knew that in the coming months it would be primarily about the Bolshevikization of the Parliament and the destruction of everything positive,” Topolanek himself said.
According to the new schedule of the CD (Czech Railway), fewer trains will travel for approximately the same ticket price.
The Czech Railways will stop or restrict some less loaded high-speed and local trains from 13 December, while other connections will be reinforced.
The total volume of traffic will be reduced by 2% from the date of entry into force of the new roadmap compared to today.
Most fares incl. basic and customer fares are not changed.
Several connections to the capital, for example, are given to the residents of the Ostrava area, the railway employs trains of the type Pendolino for this route.
The express train will no longer travel to Bratislava (Pressburg).
Less rapid trains are also operated on the Prague - Pisek - Budweis route, in principle the direct connections from Prague to Letohrad are reduced.
The largest reduction is planned by the railway in the district of Hradec Kralove (Königsgraz), a total of eight percent, but Prague and its surroundings can look forward to an increase.
Two night trains are also cancelled on the Prague - Tabor - Budweis route and on a few days a week, the operation of some high-speed trains on the Prague - Pisek - Budweis route will be reduced.
One of the biggest changes is the introduction of the new direct transport route from Milovice to Prague, currently the inhabitants of Milovice in Lysa nad Labem have to move.
It is the fifteenth route of the suburban transport system Esko, whose opening is possible thanks to the electrification of the railway from Lysa nad Labem to Milovice.
The long-distance routes to the capital will end at the destination station Prague - Hauptbahnhof.
The CD introduces more SC Pendolino connections between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Sumperk/Jesenik will run within two hours.
Passengers will no longer be able to travel to Bratislava with the Pendolino from 13 December.
This year's Regional Railway Bill: An increase of 200 million
The high-speed trains are ordered and paid by the Ministry of Transport, in total the railway will receive four billion kroner in the next year to compensate for the so-called liquidity loss, just as this year. The local trains provide the districts with three, and they pay the total in the year.
This year, the regional trains are more expensive than 200 million Czech kroner.
For both local and high-speed trains, the railway has re-contracted a ten-year contract, so far the contract has only been contracted for one year.
The railroad is praising the system, perhaps that’s why it hasn’t resorted to price increases with the vast majority of tickets.
Changes are made only for one-day network tickets CD Net and for cheap internet tickets eLiska.
For passengers without the customer card, the CD Net price will be increased from 450 SEK to 600 SEK.
The price of eLiska will then depend on the plug driven, so far it was uniform for the journey between any district cities and cost 160 kroner.
Filipino militia arrests more than 50 people who have been released.
Militantes kidnapped 75 people in the south of the Philippines today, including some primary students and their teachers.
This was reported by AFP, which initially only informed about 65 kidnapped.
All 17 detained children were released after eight hours, including one teacher.
The kidnapping occurred in the province of Agusan del Sur.
Approximately 19 militiamen allegedly used the hostages as a living shield in fleeing the police.
The local negotiators are now endeavouring to release the remaining hostages.
According to the AFP, the militants belong to the New People's Army (NPA), which is the armed faction of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to AP, police were chasing the kidnappers for the violence that demanded retaliation between the two local family clans.
South of the Philippines, in the province of Maguindanao, was enforced over the recent massacre that killed 57 people.
Thirty journalists were among the victims of the November 23 massacre in connection with the election to the governor’s office.
On suspicion of participation in the massacre, the governor of this southern Philippine province and his father, Andal Ampatuan, were arrested, the patriarch of the influential Ampatuan clan.
On the island of Mindanao, Muslim separatists are also active.
But on Tuesday, they resumed peace talks with the Philippine government.
The history of South Africa affects everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Nelson Mandela
In the coming days, the new Hollywood film Clint Eastwoods will be in the American cinemas "Invictus: The Unbeaten", which covers part of the life story of the former President of the Republic of South Africa, Nelson Mandela.
The role of the world-famous fighter against apartheid has been won by Morgan Freeman, who was allegedly elected by Mandela himself a few years ago.
The role of the legendary South African rugby champion, Francois Pienaar, has been won by Matt Damon.
The film’s kind of cinema also makes the reactions of critics and the public sound.
Nelson Mandela
His full name is Nelson Rolihlaha Mandela, born on 18 July 1918 in Mvez, South Africa.
In 1988 he received the Sachar Prize, and in 1993, together with the Klerk, the Nobel Peace Prize.
He was elected President of the Republic of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
High expectations are set in the film because it comes to the cinemas at a time when in South Africa, on the one hand, the preparations for the World Cup are culminating, but at the same time the media is telling the world with alarming news about the rising racial hatred and the discrimination of the inhabitants of the neighbourhood.
According to the AP news agency, the reactions to the new film in South Africa are positive for the first time, despite numerous reservations against the occupancy of the lead roles with American Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman is proud of the new film in his own words.
I have dreamed of this role for many years and have prepared well for it.
I also met Nelson Mandela on several occasions in person so that I can receive his energy, as it is said, in an interview after the film’s premiere in Los Angeles.
I think it’s good to be able to explore Mandelas’ personality and his message with this film.
This is a story of South Africa, but it affects every person, he added.
In the dress of the rugby national team
The film is based on the book template by British writer John Carlin, freely translated “In the Role of the Enemy”: Nelson Mandela and the game that unites the people portrays the South African human rights defender within his first presidential term.
During the film, Morgan Freeman strives to bring together two races, and from year to day, each other’s delimited populations, and, like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he also plays in the South African National Rugby Address, which South Africa won at the time.
For entering the lawn in the dress, which is almost like a sacred act in South Africa, Mandela harvested large ovations fourteen years ago, mostly from the white audience, thus gaining the recognition of the white population.
The rugby championship may bring people back together into a single people, led rugby player Chester Williams, who was the only "black" in the national team in 1995.
Whether the tense situation in South Africa is improving, that will only be shown.
However, the white South Africans are skeptical, as, for example, in a recent interview for LN, the rugby fan, Christopher Dawson, who fled the country to the UK.
The championship will start on June 11, 2010.
Transformers burn for several 10 million kroner in the Louny area
The fire broke out in the morning at the Ceps company transformer in the switching plant near the municipality of Vyskov in the Louny area.
According to the Usti nad Labem district fire department spokesman Lukas Marvan, six units were seized during the fire.
Originally, the fire department wanted to burn out the transformers, but later it changed the view and now the fire is erased with a mixture of water - foam and special solvents.
The cause was a technical defect, a transformer internal shortcut.
No one was injured, the havarie did not endanger, according to the spokeswoman, Pavla Mandatova, the security operation of the line system.
The damage has been estimated at several 10 million kroner, more accurately the damage will only be quantified after the fire.
According to Mandatova, the destroyed transformer must be replaced by a new one.
For over 10 years nothing similar has happened to the company Ceps, errors of this kind are rare, she added.
The power supply was not interrupted, according to CEZ spokeswoman for North Bohemia Sona Holingerova, the fire at the Trafo Station did not affect the functionality of households, authorities and companies.
A.G. Ceps operates in the Czech Republic as the sole operator of the wiring system, power lines of 400 kV and 220 kV.
It maintains, renovates and develops 39 switching systems with 67 transformers that transfer the electrical energy to the distribution system and line with a length of 4339 kilometers.
Jancura filed a criminal case for defamation against three heads of the CSSD.
The owner of the Student Agency, Radim Jancura, today filed a criminal case for defamation against three social democratic leaders.
Against Michal Hasek from the district of Südmärchen, Radko Martinek from the district of Pardubice and the head of the district of Olomouc, Martin Tesarik.
Jancura said this in a twenty-minute Inteview in the radio journal.
The lawsuit relates to the company’s efforts to operate regional rail traffic in some districts.
In the end, however, all regions have signed long-term contracts with the Czech Railways.
All three managers attack us and say that we are taking out the roses, while we have only submitted the offer about the scope as it was agreed with them.
They claim that we are more expensive than the Czech Railways because we would know the prices of the Czech Railways that were completed last week.
There is nothing left for us but to defend ourselves.
Due to this humiliation of the student agency, Jancura told the radiojournal.
At the same time, he pointed out that he has evidence from all districts that they have taken their steps in accordance with European law.
That is why we are preparing a charge for the European Commission.
Hasek considers the collection of criminal charges for the continuation of Jancura’s media show, which serves as a free advertisement for his company and for his own person.
Of course, I am willing to defend my good name as well as the good reputation of my district, and I also call on other leaders to do so.
I assume that it will also become clear in this case that it is Jancura who manipulates the public in the case of regional rail traffic and uses false and false arguments, Hasek said.
Jancura reported last week that it had invested several million kroner in advertising, indicating the district’s disadvantaged move.
He told the radiojournal that he was interrupting the campaign after Christmas and that he wanted to continue the campaign after the New Year.
He said he will run the anti-corruption campaign as such.
The campaign was launched by Jancura after the districts agreed to operate regional railways with the Czech Railways, and no tenders were issued for the contract amounting to 150 billion SEK.
According to Vancura, such conduct is unlawful and contrary to the requirements of the European Court of Justice.
Due to the criticism of train traffic in the districts, he was also threatened, according to Jancura, by a member of the CSSD.
The only threat was if we didn’t give up that we could lose the bus licenses as well.
"He pretended to be a member of the CSSD, I know who he is, I don't say his name," Jancura told the Radio Journal today.
Vaccination against pneumococcus free and voluntary
Implantation against pneumococcal infections will change the habit from January.
She is supposed to be the first to be free and voluntary for families.
But votes are already reported that compulsory vaccination would be more effective.
The preparations for the introduction of free pneumococcal vaccination culminate.
The Institute of Medicine already sets the maximum prices of vaccines that the health insurances have to pay.
The experts are also clear about the vaccination procedure.
New Vaccination
Vaccines free for August children
From January, children can be vaccinated free of charge against pneumococci, which were born on 2 August last year and later.
The condition is that they have not yet received a vaccine dose.
Those who have already started the vaccination in the past year or earlier must also pay for further recurrent vaccinations themselves.
The first dose should be given between the 3rd and 5th month of life of the child.
Already last year, a quarter of families vaccinated their children against pneumococci.
The parents paid 1,600 kroner and more for a dose.
Four doses are required for vaccination of the youngest children.
Overall, experts estimate that health insurance costs 300,000 to 450,000 kroner per year for the vaccine doses.
However, they save on the treatment that children would need without vaccination.
So far, the state has spent about 500,000 per year on all children’s surface vaccinations.
The mandatory vaccination was introduced with the so-called Janota package.
Pneumococcals cause middle ear inflammation, but also severe infections including brain skin inflammation and blood poisoning.
Pneumococcal infections cause the death of up to 28 children under 10 years of age in hospitals every year.
Outside of the Czech Republic, the mandatory vaccination of children against pneumococci was introduced in about 40 countries.
Will the vaccination be mandatory?
At the same time, it is said that this vaccination could be mandatory in the future.
Starting in January, it will be paid by the insurance companies and will be voluntary.
For example, the head of the civil society association Nahlas, Rudolf Kalovsky, said that the vaccination would be better.
His association has been promoting pneumococcal vaccination in the long term.
The professionals at the international conference at which our association participated were not very satisfied that we had voluntary vaccination.
That's not quite ideal.
On the other hand, we are happy that we have succeeded in implementing at least that.
“I think that’s the way we have to go now,” Kalovsky said.
The Ministry of Health, however, does not want to change the vaccination procedure against pneumococci.
At this moment we are not considering it at all, said his spokesman Vlastimil Sesen.
Voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages, the doctors claim.
Hana Cabrnochova, the chairman of the specialist association of practical pediatricians, admits that a voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages.
“In a situation where the vaccine is so expensive, we understand the political decision that this vaccination was initiated as a voluntary one,” Cabrnochova says.
Experts expect more than 80 percent of parents to vaccinate their infants against pneumococci next year.
Vaccination against pneumococci is also groundbreaking in that it is paid as the first surface vaccination by health insurance and not by the state.
The insurances should spend the money for prevention, so they save for further treatment, Cabrnochova says.
The doctors have to buy the vaccines themselves.
However, there is a concern of practical pediatricians regarding the purchase of vaccines.
After the original plan, the vaccines should be purchased by the insurance companies and the doctors will then receive them in the same way as other vaccines issued to them by the state.
However, some MEPs feared that the insurance companies could "take the money out of the health insurance."
That is why doctors will have to buy the vaccines themselves and wait until insurance pays them.
According to estimates, the individual practical doctors will have to invest 40,000 kroner per month, which is a significant sum.
This is not going to be easy, says Cabrnochova.
U.S. artist's son involved in "museum theft"
The son of famous American fantasy artist Frank Frazetta was accused of attempting to steal <0x24>20 million worth of paintings from his father's museum.
According to the Pennsylvania police, Alfonso Frank Frazetta was caught in his vehicle with trailers while inviting 90 paintings.
It is said that Frank Frazetta junior and another man had used an excavator to enter the museum in the Pocono Mountains.
The 81-year-old Frank Frazetta Senior is famous for his portrayal of figures such as Conan the Barbarian and Tarzan.
As reported by the Associated Press, the artist was staying in Florida at the time of the incident.
AP quoted an unnamed police officer who said Frank Frazetta Junior could have been motivated by a family hatred.
The agency reported, according to a police official statement, Frazetta Junior claimed that he was instructed by his father "that he should invade the museum with all the means to bring all the paintings into a camp".
The agency notified that Frank Frazetta Senior is arguing that he has given any permission.
Labour Defends State and Tax Increases
The ministers have defended the tax increases and spending cuts announced in the preliminary report against the criticism of the opposition, the economy and the trade unions.
The Conservatives said Alistair Darling would have "distorted" an opportunity to show that he took it seriously with the reduction of the deficit by pushing the decisions until after the election.
The Treasury Chancellor also accused him of targeting low- and middle-income workers.
Its main proposals include a 0.5 per cent increase in social security and a 1 per cent cap of public pay cuts for 2011.
Social Security Insurers
The unions, on the other hand, have protested that low-wage recipients will be punished for a recession that they have not caused and warn of upcoming "problems".
The increase in social security – to about <0xC2><0xA3>3 billion a year – has upset the private sector, saying this is a job tax, although the focus should be on the economic boom.
The increase, which is limited to those who earn more than <0xC2><0xA3>20,000 a year, will affect approximately 10 million workers.
SPECIAL POINTS OF THE TRANSFORMATION
Increase in social security by another 0.5% as of April 2011
This year, the economy shrinks by more than expected 4.75%
New 50% tax on banking bonuses
1 percent increase in corporate tax for small businesses rejected
Steering wheels for electric vehicles and wind turbines
Increase in government pensions by 2.5%
According to Treasury estimates, someone with an annual income of <0xC2><0xA3>30,000 will be poorer by <0xC2><0xA3>90 per year and someone with <0xC2><0xA3>40,000 per year will be poorer by <0xC2><0xA3>190, while a person with <0xC2><0xA3>10,000 annual income will be richer by <0xC2><0xA3>110.
The ministers said their goal of addressing the deficit by 2013 meant "difficult decisions", but they also said that 60% of the additional tax burden would fall to the top 5% of earners.
Finance Minister Stephen Timms argues that the outlined tax increases and spending cuts compared to the necessary measures would be "a drop on the hot stone".
"These are big figures. They will bring us the deficit relief and this is absolutely necessary over the next four years," he told the BBC.
Timms said he was confident that the economy would return to growth by the end of the year.
The Labour Party’s forecasts of future economic growth – affecting the extent of new debt and the speed of deficit recovery – were questioned after the Treasury Chancellor was forced to revise previous figures.
He said in his opinion that the economy is likely to shrink by 4.75% this year – far more than the 3.5% decline predicted in April – while debt by <0xC2><0xA3>3 billion would be higher than previously estimated.
"Forgotten opportunity"
The Conservatives, who want to launch a new advertising campaign on Thursday to warn of Labour’s “debt crisis,” said the planned debt of 789 billion pounds over the next six years would be unsustainable.
They added that the ministers have failed to present a credible plan on how to pay back this and push themselves “cynically” before difficult decisions until after the election – which must take place no later than June 2010.
"They didn't say anything of importance about what they're going to do," Shadow Finance Minister Philip Hammond said. "They had their chance to do this, and they let it go."
"The important announcements will only be made after the election, whoever wins them."
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labour insists that schools, hospitals, and police will be protected from future cuts, unlike in the proposals of the Conservatives, which see the deficit dropping coming faster and more likely.
But the Liberal Democrats said the money earned by the tax increases and spending cuts will be used to cover spending for the next year, not to reduce the deficit, and therefore argue that the plans are "built on sand".
BBC political editor Nick Robinson said that some at the time of the announcements – such as the above inflation adjustment for some disability pensions in April – would expose the Treasury Chancellor to the charge of voting, as the money could simply be recovered next year.
Labour insists on providing the extra aid when people need it most and that the situation will be re-examined in September 2010.
"Hohler State"
Although the ministers have not announced state details beyond 2011, economists say that pressure on public spending will only come to bear in the medium term.
The recognized Institute for Tax Research said the figures of the Treasury Chancellor would mean strong cuts in many areas, possibly in the future also in the areas of transport, higher education, science and defense.
"It only shifts the pain to later," said his manager, Robert Chote.
“The important announcements will only be made after the election, whoever wins them,” added Roger Bootle, business advisor at the business audit firm Deloitte.
"This was just the hollow pre-state report. The markets recognize it."
FBI Investigates 'Detention of U.S. Citizens in Pakistan'
The FBI is investigating the arrest of five reported U.S. citizens on suspicion of extremist connections in Pakistan.
The men were arrested in an assault on a house in Sarghoda, eastern Pandshab province, the U.S. Embassy in Pakistan told the BBC.
The FBI said it was investigating whether these were the same men who were reported missing last month in the U.S. state of Virginia.
The U.S. State Department said they were also looking for information about the men.
Three of them are supposed to be of Pakistani descent, one of Egyptian origin and the other has a Yemeni background.
“If they are American citizens, of course, we are very interested in the allegations that are being filed against them and under what circumstances they will be detained,” said spokesman Ian Kelly.
FBI spokeswoman Katherine Schweit said the authorities were informed about the arrests and were in contact with the families of the missing students.
“We are working with the Pakistani authorities to find out their identities and the purpose of their stay there if they are the missing students,” she said.
The Pakistani embassy in Washington said the men were arrested in a house belonging to the uncle of one of the students.
He said the local police had already taken an interest in the house and that no charges have yet been filed against the arrested men.
The Reuters news agency reported that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton refused to comment on the arrests, but said the U.S. “must work more closely with Afghanistan and Pakistan to eradicate the infrastructure of terrorism that continues to recruit and train people.”
The five students were reported missing by their families in Northern Virginia at the end of November.
Amnesty condemns "misconduct" in Iran
According to a report by the human rights organization Amnesty International, human rights in Iran are still as bad as in the past 20 years.
The report details " patterns of abuse" by the regime, both before and after the contested presidential elections in June.
One man quoted in the report stated that he was beaten and burned with cigarettes, and another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran has rejected previous criticism of its human rights balance.
Officials said such criticism was politically motivated.
After the contested election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, thousands of people were arrested and dozens killed in Iran, leading to the biggest street protests since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Dozens received jail sentences and prosecutors said at least five people were sentenced to death.
BBC Tehran correspondent Jon Leyne, who is now in London, said at the beginning of the protests the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, acknowledged some of the abuse allegations and ordered the closure of the Kahrizak Penalty Facility.
But since then, there has been no tolerance from the authorities for criticism, our correspondent said.
"False Confession"
Amnesty International cited the report of 26-year-old computer science student Ebrahim Mehtari, who said he was charged with "working with Facebook networks" and protesting against the election results.
"They hit me in the face more often," he was quoted as saying.
"I was burned with cigarettes under my eyes, in the neck, on my head ... they threatened me with death and they humiliated me".
After five days, he signed a false confession and was, still bleeding and half-conscious, released on the street, Amnesty said.
Presidential candidate Mehdi Karroubi said that some protesters who had been arrested after the election were tortured to death in August and others raped.
The Iranian authorities denied the rape allegations, but admitted that abuses had taken place.
Amnesty also referred to the case of a former detainee who said he had been detained at a prison in Kahrizak for more than eight weeks with 75 others.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian Parliament and the judicial authorities had set up a committee to investigate the unrest after the election and the government’s reactions to it, but so Amnesty, the mandate and power of these bodies had been unclear and the results that were not won by the parliamentary committees.
The group said at least 90 people had been arrested in the last three weeks to prevent further demonstrations.
In the city park was set up skihang
More than 100 tons of artificial snow were used to turn a landmark in Bristol into a competition track.
The ski slope of this park event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders who fought for money prizes.
At the top of the slope in Brandon Hill Park there was a short jump at the beginning of a 100-metre slope.
Student John Hickman, who studied medicine in the fourth year, said there was a beautiful view from the summit of the hang, but it was also quite intimidating.
It is a great view with all the lights of the city shining below.
He added: "There are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the country here - some real talent."
Awards were awarded for the best artworks performed on the slope – or tricks.
After the event on Thursday night, the snow will be left to melt.

Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when Swiss voters have voted for a construction ban on minarets and concerns about the alleged Islamization of Europe are widespread, John Bowen, an American academic, has written a well-founded and well-thought-out report on whether Muslims can be integrated into one of the most well-declared and secularized Europes.
Some readers will read this new book out of admiration for the author's last work: "Why the French don't like headscarves" (2006), an elegant and well-argumented study of a question that has also been debated over the past decade and half.
Bowen’s new book offers a more comprehensive and bold spectrum.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and the media say about Islam in France, but what is really happening in the area.
He has spent months in mosques, schools and institutes that now offer the 5 to 6 million Muslims in France, as Bowen calls "Islamic Free Spaces".
He is a good listener, he brings back debates between teachers and students about the issues that worry them most.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or a town hall (or both)?
Should young Muslims be taught about the evolution and rights of homosexuals?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim man?
Is it permissible for a Muslim to use an interest-oriented banking system to get a mortgage?
It is these seemingly profane matters, he claims, that make up everyday life, quite contrary to the political dramas that the media occupy.
The author recognizes a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, none of them with a known name, possibly with the exception of Tarik Ramadan, an Arab-Muslim scholar and academic born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open the debate about how it is possible, on the one hand, to be a good Muslim and, on the other hand, to be a good citizen in a modern secular society.
You don’t have all the arguments on your side.
The Conservatives are suspicious of the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists interviewed by Bowen are mostly at odds with their Salafi counterparts – defenders of the purist Sunni Islam associated with Saudi Arabia – who today show a small but influential presence among Europe’s Muslims.
Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible.
But an agreement requires giving and taking on both sides.
He questiones the extent to which French political decision-makers (and the intellectual elite, who is so passionately guarding the separation of church and state) really feel committed to pluralism.
He suggests that Muslims may experience harsher treatment than Catholics, Protestants, and Jews, who in turn had to make their historic compromise with secular republicanism.
He recognizes a "strengthening of value screws" rather than a growing pragmatism.
After reading this book, one is inclined to say "yes, but not yet".
The most comforting view of the world
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than any other environmental region on Earth.
The ice that characterizes it melts at alarming speed and takes life with it that can’t survive anywhere else.
Oil, gas, shipping and fishing interests have entered the recently open waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now also authors in their waters.
Richard Ellis, an author and illustrator, in "On Thin Ice" (Original title: "On Thin Ice") draws a natural history of the icon of the North, the ice bear.
Immigrated into the complicated history and politics of whale hunting, he describes the long tradition of Arctic explorers who have proven themselves when hunting ice bears.
Admiral Nelson’s encounter with an ice bear as a brave 14-year-old sailor who fought only with the pistol of his mosque is certainly a legend, but others are true.
Young bears, who were caught swimming behind the bodies of their recently killed mothers, were taken to zoos and circus.
A circus performance at the beginning of the 20th century showed 75 ice bears at a performance.
Even today, zoo plants still typically hold one-millionth of the habitat of a wildlife antler. The climate is rarely suitable: Singapore’s ice bear was green from the algae that grows in the hollow hair of its fur.

Ellis refers to the reports of other authors and historians and often goes back to the threat that hunters pose to the species' survival.
Although banned in Norway, the United States and Russia, breeding continues in Greenland and Canada, where hunters in helicopters and engine slides use powerful Inuit storm guns to carry their prey on the route.
Ironically, in the waters of the north of these two hunting nations, the ice will last the longest.
In his new book "After the Ice" (original title "After the Ice"), Alun Anderson, a former publisher of the science magazine "New Scientist", offers a clear and disturbing description of the science of the Arctic and a comprehensive insight into how the future could develop.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospheric scientists nor oceanographers can adequately explain the speed of change.
This is not due to a lack of explanations.
The pioneering journeys of Fridtjof Nansen at the end of the 19th and early 20th centuries for the first time marked the confounding of the package ice.
During the Cold War, submarines overlook the shifting grate during submarines.
A useful addition are satellite measurements and the large-scale delivery of measurement probes on icebergs, but still much is achieved by fearless people camping outside in the cold.
Anderson takes a look at the peculiar, tiny world of the influx system within the Arctic ice, formed by salt water reservoirs that are compressed together during freezing.
But, from the bear on the ice to the microscopic little wonders in the ice, everyone is threatened with this once the summer ice passes, which is calculated between 2013 and 2050.
“In a few months...we could be that.”
Marines were among the 6,000 who landed in Arlington Kränze
De'Angelo Robinson travelled seven hours by bus to lay a single crown on the grave of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other Marines who made the trip from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, North Carolina to the National Cemetery in Arlington to decorate tombs, the day was a tribute to the men and women in whose footsteps they walked.
“In a few months, wherever we are brought back from, we could be that,” Robinson said of the fallen soldiers.
If we were, I'd like someone to do the same for me, so I'm trying to show my respect.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who had gathered on Saturday morning to lay cranes on the graves of veterans in several sections of the Arlington cemetery.
Morrill Worcester, owner of the Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, founded this tradition in 1992 when he and some others decided to decorate several hundred tombs at the Arlington cemetery.
It is now an 18-year-old tradition and Morrill and his wife Karen, who undertake this journey every year, stop in different cities along the way to hold events dedicated to the military and the victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a non-profit organization, Wreaths Across America, which extended the event to other states.
This year, volunteers placed more than 16,000 crabs on the graves at Arlington Cemetery, in areas of the Pentagon, on the graves at Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, in the Battery Park in New York, and at the United Airlines Flight 93 Memorial in Shankslvville, Penn.
For the second time, the Walmart Foundation donated more than <0x24>150,000 to buy and transport the crustaceans.
Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster, said she undertook the trip to Arlington in memory of her husband, a deceased professional soldier.
Although her husband is not buried in Arlington, Hunt said, this is her way of giving back to the victims.
She said that’s a small contribution to how we civilians can support our soldiers.
It’s like visiting a family graveyard.
Packed in layers of warm clothing, the volunteers wandered across the extensive lawns and hills of the cemetery.
The volunteers had older graves from the First and Second World Wars and the Vietnam War as their target, as these are not visited as often as the newer graves, according to the organizers.
The mood was cheerful, children were playing and couples were holding hands while carrying the fresh pepper branches to the grey-turning tombstones.
Each round crown was dark green with a small red loop attached to the top.
Section 60, which is nearby and where mostly veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried, remained almost silent.
The United Service Organizations donated 1,000 crustaceans to decorate this section, but the darkest mood of the current wars filled this area.
Some were crying out loud, others were praying, and family and friends held each other in the ice air.
Some read the names carved in stone, while others pointed to small black-and-white postcards that had been inserted into the wet mud for those whose tombstones had not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many mothers who poured bitter tears in front of her son’s grave.
She drove 8 hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the graveyard of naval infantry officer David Shane Spicer, who fell in battle in July.
No one should ever forget why we are free ..., my son has paid for it, she said.
"If I've been away for a long time, I want someone to remember him."
U.S. government contractor arrested by Cuban authorities
The Cuban government has arrested a U.S. government contractor who sold mobile phones and notebook computers in the country, a foreign ministry spokesman said on Saturday.
The contractor, who has not yet been identified, is working for Development Alternatives Inc. based in Bethesda.
The company is working on projects for customers such as USAID, the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular officials of the U.S. Interest Representative in Havana are trying to gain access to the detainee who was arrested on December 5.
The special allegations have not yet been released, although under Cuban law a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor can be arrested for almost anything, under the charge of "danger".
All so-called counter-revolutionary activities, including mild protests and critical writing, pose a risk of arrest.
Anti-government graffiti and statements are considered a serious crime.
Cuba has a growing blogger community led by popular reporter Yoani Sánchez, which often describes how she and her husband are being persecuted and attacked by government officials.
Sánchez has repeatedly requested permission to leave the country to receive prizes, but this has always been rejected.
The arrest of an American contractor is likely to increase tensions between the communist government of the Castro brother in Cuba and the Obama administration, which had sought a “slow” approach to improving relations with the island.
The news of the arrest was first reported Friday night by the New York Times.
The new U.S. policy emphasizes that the United States will provide a counterpart if the Cuban government takes concrete steps in this direction, such as freeing political prisoners and creating more room for opposition.
Mobile phones and notebooks are legal in Cuba, although they are new and sought after products in a country where an average government employee earns <0x24>15 a month.
The Cuban government has only since this year allowed ordinary citizens to buy a mobile phone, they are actually used to send text messages, as a 15-minute phone call would cost a daily salary.
Internet use is extremely limited on the island.
It is accessible in expensive hotels and there for foreign visitors and at some government offices, such as universities.
Cubans who want to log in often have to report their names to the government.
Too many websites are restricted to access.
In Cuba, the arrest of an American is rare.
Most of the few U.S. citizens who are in prison in Cuba are sitting behind bars for crimes such as drug smuggling, said Gloria Berbena, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Interest Representative in Havana.
Berbena said she could not provide further information on the arrest.
Arrest and detention are clearly wrong.
An activity that would be legalized in any other free society - the delivery of free mobile phones - is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, head of the American section of the group "Human Rights Watch", which recently coined a harsh report on freedom in Cuba, the banner of the Cuban, the title of the "New Kuba Castaus,"
Vivanco said the defendants would be arrested, convicted and imprisoned very often within a day.
He said any solution would probably be political and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, just at the time when both countries are moving towards more dialogue.
Pakistani government officials unveil plan to send men to Afghanistan
Pakistani authorities on Saturday uncovered a leading head of a conspiracy aimed at sending five men from northern Virginia to Afghanistan to kill U.S. soldiers, and said they hoped this case could help radicalize an expanded network of terrorists to decipher the Internet.
Investigators said they were looking for an opaque insurgent, known as Saifullah, who had invited the men to Pakistan after he had identified them because one of them had posted comments agreeing on terrorist attacks on the YouTube video site.
Upon their arrival in Pakistan, Saifullah became the leader of these men and tried to help them reach the remote area in Pakistan’s tribal belt, home to Al Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a spokesman for Pakistan’s intelligence service, who was informed about the case, said on Saturday that Saifullah could not convince the al-Qaeda leaders that the men were not part of a CIA conspiracy to undermine the terrorist network.
As a result, they were detained for days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far away from the inhospitable mountains in the northwest, which have become a refuge for terrorists.
They were seen as part of a concealed operation.
That’s why they were rejected, the government official said, who wanted to remain anonymous because of the sensitivity of the matter.
The government official said the men were in no way discouraged and continued to try to get the right recommendations to get access to the al-Qaeda camps when they were arrested by the Pakistani enforcement authorities.
The case of the five men - who are still in Pakistan and are being interrogated by the FBI - underscores the crucial role of the recruiters in identifying future terrorists and possibly more importantly, in deciding who is trustworthy.
Since the attacks of September 11, 2001, the U.S. Intelligence Service has made it a matter of utmost urgency to house human assets within Al Qaeda.
The supporters of the organization act as leaders who do not let those whose commitment to the Holy War is not serious enough and who could be spies.
American volunteer recruits are undergoing a special examination by A Qaeda, analysts said.
However, due to their potential access to U.S. targets and their propaganda value, they are also considered extremely attractive to the group.
Evan Kohlmann, the top analyst at the US-based NEFA Foundation, said terrorist groups have also become much more cautious about who they allow access to in recent years, as U.S. intelligence has become experts in their recruitment methods.
When you try to enclose someone in these groups, what better way could you go than to follow the recruitment model that so many have already followed?” said Kohlmann.
The model is now much more based on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of protesters call for climate action in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of protesters marched through the streets here on Saturday and demanded that the merchants at the city’s Bella Congress Centre take bolder action on climate protection.
Protesters said 100,000 people had joined the event, while police estimates were more than 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, although a handful of masked activists ignited small explosives near some government buildings in downtown.
On one day, when little happened during the UN-sponsored climate negotiations, thousands of activists migrated through the city with transparents, on which was written in English "There is no Planet B" and one in Spanish, which declared "The Earth says "enough".
Some stars joined the protest, for example the Danish model, photographer Helena Christensen, who said that traveling to Peru, her mother’s home country, makes her aware of the heartbreaking problems the country has to deal with due to the already noticeable impacts of climate change.
That’s part of why I decided to take part in the big demonstration – to deliver the word and appeal to the world leaders to bring about a fair, ambitious and binding agreement,” she said.
It’s not an easy task, but it needs to be done now and there’s no way around it anymore.
Police stopped the protesters from getting too close to the Bella Center and said they had arrested 19 people, mainly because they were either masked or carrying a knife.
According to Danish law, these actions are prohibited in demonstrations.
According to a spectator who did not want to be named, as he is involved in the climate talks, masked protesters in black-clothed fired several explosives near the Copenhagen main channel, with several ministries nearby.
They threw them near the building, he said, adding that they began as light-tracks, but then were followed by "a few big explosions".
Inside the congress center, people gathered in front of TV screens to follow the demonstration all afternoon.
But the protest has apparently not reached the awareness of the main officials, such as Su Wie, China’s chief climate dealer.
When asked if he thought the demonstration had a constructive effect on international considerations, he replied in English: “That’s something I wasn’t even aware of.”
He then went on to Mandarin and said, "Because the venue is big, I can't hear what's going on outside."
He noted that it depends on the individual’s perspective whether the demonstration would hurt or help.
It shows the focus of the general public and various sectors on the topic of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, “you can also say that they interfere with the negotiations or the freedom of other people.”
Test data show persistent breeding air
The testimonials on mathematics performance were welcome good news for the public schools in Washington D.C. last week.
Although Washington District is still far behind the nation’s top-performing schools, evidence shows that fourth and eighth graders have made faster progress over the past two years than cities including Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
However, what is included in the latest figures of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) is the persistent performance gap between African-American and white students, both locally and nationally.
The average score of white fourth graders from Washington D.C. rose in the last two years from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), but their African-American peers rose by only three points from 209 to 212.
In reality, the performance air increased from 53 to 58 points between 2007 and 2009.
The progress of the African American eighth graders remained basically the same, falling by a statistically negligible point from 245 to 244.
The average score of white students was not included in the test data as the sample scope was not large enough.
The picture over a six-year period is also not more encouraging.
The gap that separated white and black quarterbacks in 2003, when the first NAEP was recorded in this district, was 60 scale points (262 to 202).
And although the number of points the children of both groups have achieved has increased over this time period, the difference has barely decreased by now 58 points.
Some of the district’s education advocates last week expressed concern that the results, celebrated by school chancellor Michelle A. Rhee and democratic mayor Adrian M. Fenty, are mostly white students, who have already become powerful children.
This suggests that we have raised the overall rating by treating those at the top of the scale, which is problematic and difficult, said Jeff Smith, a board member of D.C. Voice, a nonprofit group advocating for education equality in Washington D.C..
“I’m not jumping up and down for a span of two or three points,” said Democratic Washington City Council member Kwame R. Brown, who has a daughter in fourth grade at Eaton High School.
Brown, a frequent critic of Rhee’s management style, said the message of the test scores is that the city’s middle schools urgently need attention.
Of course, you always want to see the positive signs, I respect that.
But what scares me is that we don’t spend the time and energy we should spend on our high school.
Rhee said the district must continue to find better ways to meet the needs of the poor students.
This autumn, for example, some teachers will be trained to use a new curriculum, the Wilson Reading System, aimed at students in the upper classes of primary and secondary school, who did not master the basic skills of reading the same way at the beginning of their school careers, and who are significantly behind their classmates.
Daily mathematics, a curriculum leading from kindergarten to sixth grade games and life-saving experiences, was brought to Washington under former school inspector Clifford Janey, and this curriculum will report some of the NAEP progress reported last week.
“I think we need to continue to work to make the best measures to benefit students who are below the grade level,” Rhee said.
Others say that the NAEP results highlight the question of whether Rhee can continue to improve the overall performance of the system while continuing to provide the additional money and resources for the poor schools that are necessary to overcome the gap.
This is a serious dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, professor of education at the University of California in Berkeley, who is investigating the results of the city exam.
The conventional remedy is to focus its resources and management reforms on schools located in the poorest areas of Washington, D.C..
The aim could cause political repercussions that work against this important agenda item.
The weakness is, of course, as with other urban school inspectors, that it tries to keep the white and black middle class.
Our focus is to ensure that we build a system of great schools.
We need to strengthen our schools in the neighborhoods so that all families, regardless of where they live, can be sure that their children can receive excellent public education.
Janey, who is now a school inspector in Newark, said in an interview this week that one of the most important elements to shut down the performance air is to extend the traditional public school year, currently 180 days in Washington, to compete with the charter schools.
It is necessary to increase the school year to approximately 200 days to have the power to change, said Janey, who came to an agreement with his teacher union last year over 185 days a year, which he sees as "a milestone" on the way to a larger increase in the next contract.
Higher education for more people than prospects
The bus reaches Gettysburg College with a loud pipe.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, rises out and flashes for a moment in view of the white pillars, the brick facades and the emerald green lawn.
Graciela’s parents hardly graduated from high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela, who was bailed out in Silver Spring and now lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a college campus.
Her attitude and that of the group’s other eighth-graders who explored Gettysburg, where the lesson costs <0x24>38,690 a year, was that of a respectable visitor rather than that of an enthusiastic future student.
"Yes, I'll be here soon!" cried Graciela, who would like to study medicine when the guide announced that they had now entered the building for the natural sciences.
"Wow, really?" she said thoughtfully when she was told the school's low professor-to-student ratio.
The college in Pennsylvania was the 7th that the children visited on their three-day tour and now they have fully absorbed the intended message: the question is not whether to go to college.
The question is where.
On the one hand, there is growing concern about the large number of children of Hispanic immigrants born in the U.S. who do not finish high school or become pregnant as a teenager, on the other hand, there are also hundreds of thousands who receive the college education needed to get into middle school.
In fact, one in five of these “second generation” Hispanic Americans graduates from college – which is a remarkable achievement, as many of their immigrant parents, mostly from Mexico or Central America, came to the United States without graduating from high school.
Their success stories are important, researchers say, because they show the way forward for a generation that will play a huge role in the country’s workforce.
Those who study powerful children say that they often have a natural affinity for the school and an intrinsic drive to success.
Many of them also have parents who set high goals for their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
But counseling programs also play a major role in helping Graciela and millions of children like her get to college, especially if these efforts persist for a long time.
If you look at low-income children whose parents do not have the experience and skills to help them find their way through the system, then a single measure at some point will not solve the problem either, said Patricia Gándara, a researcher at the University of California in Davis who studied Hispano-American students.
We need to think about providing a supportive network for these children, from preschool to high school.
The federal program that had funded Gracielas College tour is a useful example.
It’s known as GEAR UP—a one-stop switch—and provides more than <0x24>300 million a year for local school systems to start college preparatory programs that start when low-income students are in high school and continue until they finish high school.
According to the U.S. Department of Education, the program has helped more than 10 million students since 1999, of which more than 60% have gone to college.
Iraq's Ministry of Petroleum signs contracts with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns over violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has been able to get larger oil companies to rebuild its damaged infrastructure at two auctions closed on Saturday.
The 10 agreements of the Iraqi Ministry of Petroleum with foreign oil companies suggest that China, Russia and European oil companies are ready to play an important role in the renewal of Iraqi oil industry, which has been stalled for decades by war and economic sanctions.
U.S. companies were only able to book shares in two of the 10 sold fields for themselves.
Seven American companies had paid to participate in the second auction, which began on Friday.
The only company that has made an offer has pulled the shorter ones.
Two American companies were able to enter into contracts for fields sold in June.
The thin-seeded representatives of American oil multis at the opening of the Iraqi oil industry surprised the analysts.
Iraq has finally opened its doors after six years of war, and instead of US companies, Asians and Europeans are paving the way, said Ruba Husari, the publisher of the Iraq Oil Forum, an online intelligence service.
There will be no further offers in Iraq for a long time.
Security concerns, still underlined by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday and the political instability by the US military’s withdrawal, are likely to have kept U.S. oil companies from becoming more involved in Iraq, the world’s third-largest crude reserve.
U.S. firms were disadvantaged in some cases because competitors, especially Chinese and other state-controlled energy companies, have significantly lower wage costs and take risks because they do not have to account for shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only U.S. companies that could enter into contracts with the Ministry.
Major U.S. companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, who have maintained close ties with the Iraqi Ministry of Petroleum and have been on the side of technical advice in recent years, have come out empty.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main actors in two of the contracts agreed this weekend.
The state-run China National Petroleum Corporation has offered for more contracts than any other company and was able to go home with large packages of contracts for two larger fields.
Assam Jihad, a spokesman for the Ministry of Petroleum, said China is on its way to becoming one of the world’s largest economies and a technology power.
We are confident that the Chinese company will be able to measure itself with its partners and will fulfill its commitments to Iraq.
Pre-selected companies issued bids, which were then compared to the fee per barrel of oil, which the ministry was willing to pay in order to increase the emissions of each field beyond the current level.
Top Al Qaeda Planners Apparently Killed in Pakistan
In an apparent U.S. missile attack along the Pakistani border with Afghanistan, a top Al Qaeda deployment planner was killed this week, U.S. counter-terrorism officials said on Friday.
This would be, if it were to be confirmed, the second deadly attack on a high-ranking terrorist organization this autumn.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arabs who, according to U.S. sources and Pakistani officials in the region, were killed by a number of rockets that hit their vehicle near the city of Miran Shah in North Waziristan province on Tuesday.
Local authorities reported that the missiles were fired from a drone type used by the CIA in Pakistan’s illegal tribal belt.
They were driving in a white vehicle towards the Afghan border when the car was hit, a Pakistani civil intelligence official from Miran Shah said on the phone.
Locals suspected of being among the militants ran to the spot and quickly took everything left of the “completely destroyed bodies.”
Local authorities were unable to confirm the identity of the victims, but two U.S. counter-terrorism officials provided indefinite evidence that Somalia was among the dead.
Somalia has been described as the leading military planner of Al Qaeda, which led operations of terrorist groups outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
He was involved in conspiracies around the world, noted a senior official who wanted to remain anonymous, and referred to the delicate character of American airstrikes on Pakistani soil.
Taking its central role as a given also included planning attacks against the United States and Europe.
He adopted strategic instructions from the top leaders of Al Qaeda and implemented them in operational plans for possible terrorist attacks.
The second U.S. official said Somali had risen rapidly in the al-Qaeda hierarchy and maintained the best connections with other extremist groups in the region.
He may not be known to some Americans, the second official said, but this does not reduce the danger he posed to us and our allies.
If his death were confirmed, Somalia would be the second leading Al Qaeda or Taliban leader killed since September when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant faction in the tribal area and three other top activists.
The pace of CIA drone attacks has declined from an average of six operations per month to two since the summer, according to a summary of the Long War Journal, a website maintained by a non-profit organization.
The decline may be based on improved tactics of terrorist groups taking steps to reduce their vulnerability while brutally killing suspected informants, the site reported.
U.N. Ambassador to Kabul to Resign
The UN’s top envoy to Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he would step down from office in March, ending a stormy term of office that was sparked by allegations of widespread corruption in the UN-backed presidential election.
Eide’s departure took place when the Obama administration decided to send another 30,000 U.S. troops to Afghanistan.
The UN envoy said he supports the increase in troops, but he also expressed concerns that the U.S. military withdrawal schedule, which is due to begin in 18 months, could prompt other NATO governments to withdraw their troops.
We need to accelerate the build-up of Afghan security forces and send the right signal to the Afghans that they can trust the international community, Eide said in a phone interview from Kabul.
Commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international civilians to help with the political transformation of Afghanistan.
The increase in troops on the military side must correspond to an increase on the civilian side, he said.
Eide said he would not take down his office, but only fulfill an agreement reached with his family in March 2008 to stay in Kabul for only two years.
He said he wanted the notification to the UN.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon is now redirecting, so he has time to provide a replacement.
What I’ve said is that he better starts looking for a successor, said Eide.
When I came here, there was a two-month vacuum between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
According to UN representatives, Ban has started to search for a replacement.
The UN representatives say he considered the Swedish-Italian-stringed Staffan di Mistura, who recently led the UN mission in Baghdad and the French Jean-Marie Guéhenno, who had previously led UN peace operations.
Eide’s position in Afghanistan was put to the test after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, accused him in September of favoring President Hamid Karzai in the country’s presidential election and hiding evidence of massive election fraud.
Eide has rejected all accusations, but he also said that the accusations of Galbraith — who was fired — “have undoubtedly damaged the mission because there was already a large amount of skepticism about international interference in the election.”
Eide said he recommended the appointment of a leading civilian representative to coordinate the assistance measures of the US-led forces in Afghanistan.
He also urged the UN leadership to allow its successor to hire more staff from the United States and other Western countries donating for the Afghan mission, saying that this would strengthen their confidence in the right use of their money.
Eide expressed his disappointment at the limitations of his forces in Afghanistan, saying that the circumstantial UN recruitment arrangements have undermined his ability to bring in capable people.
The UN rules are designed in such a way that since May, he said, I have been able to hire only one person.
This is catastrophic and must not go on like this.
US Defence Secretary Gates: Iran Needs to Expect Additional Sanctions
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said on Friday that the world powers will soon impose "significant additional sanctions" on Iran because it has not participated in talks about its nuclear plans.
During a seven-day journey through war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, Gates spoke to a group of about 300 U.S. soldiers in northern Iraq, playing off the prospect of a military action against the Islamic Republic of Iran.
There are no good options in Iran, he said in response to a soldier’s question about the likelihood of such a development.
“One of the things that I have in mind is if we have learned something from Iraq in the last six years that is unpredictable for war.”
The Obama administration is considering a package of sanctions aimed at Iran’s military and political elite, but Gates has announced that some sanctions could also affect the average Syrian.
He said a "package of positive and negative incentives" is needed "to convince the Iranian government that it is actually less protected with nuclear weapons" because "their people will suffer enormously" from the sanctions.
In a statement by White House spokesman Robert Gibbs on Friday, the U.S. government warned top European politicians that Iran must expect "credible" consequences if it does not meet the demands of the UN Security Council, the UN Security Council, and the International Atomic Council.
Iran continues to claim that the knowledge of nuclear technology should only be gained for peaceful purposes.
At talks in Geneva on 1 October, Iran said it would resume talks on restricting its nuclear program and abandon a substantial part of its stockpile of enriched uranium in exchange for urgently needed nuclear fuel for its medical research reactor.
The U.S. government has pushed for this kind of agreement to build trust between the two parties and gain time for negotiations.
But Iran seems to have left negotiations on the interim agreements since then -- in part, experts say, because the Iranian leadership disagrees about whether they should commit to the United States.
The fact that Iran has simply left the international community standing in relation to some proposals that it had already agreed to in early October, has frankly said that the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, was assembled in a way that they said in conjunction with important additional sanctions for Iran.
President Obama has set December 31 as a deadline for Iran to respond to these proposals before pursuing other options, including those that Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called “extreme sanctions.”
In a statement issued in New York, the Iranian representation at the United Nations condemned what it called Thursday "unfounded and unfounded allegations" of some members of the Security Council about Iran's nuclear activities, saying they were willing to negotiate talks with the United States, agree to a long-term solution, and hold other states.
Gates, who was due to return to Washington on Friday, met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki in the morning before flying to the oil-rich Kurdish region of Iraq to meet with soldiers in Kirkuk and with Kurdish officials in Irbil.
The tensions between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq remain high, particularly in terms of borders, property rights and the distribution of public income.
Gates urged both sides to reduce conflict potential to prevent delays in U.S. plans to lower U.S. troops from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also tried to dispel Kurdish concerns about the upcoming withdrawal of troops. U.S. representatives quoted Gates as quoted by Masud Barzani, president of the Kurdish regional government, saying: "We will maintain your security, your prosperity and your autonomy within a united Iraq.
We will not leave you.”
Change of course in aging China
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters that gave them lectures that "Mother Earth is too tired to entertain other children" and "A baby more means a grave more".
These lessons have taught them so well that, as government officials in Shanghai, who suddenly began to change the course this summer due to the low birth rate and the aging population, and encouraged young couples to have more than one child, their answer was "immediate and definitive: no case".
We have already invested all our time and energy in a child.
There is nothing left for a second child, said Wang, 31, a staff manager with an 8-month-old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of one-child politics in China, which has produced two generations of notoriously fat, displaced single children, lovingly called "little emperors", is drawing a population crisis in the country.
The average birth rate fell to 1.8 children per couple compared to 6 at the time this policy entered into force, according to the UN.
The Department for Population Issues is set to increase explosively from 16.7 per cent of the population by 2050, far above the global average of about 20 per cent, while the number of populations aged 60 and over is expected to increase from 16.7 per cent by 2050.
The imbalance is stronger in rich coastal cities with educated populations, such as Shanghai.
Last year, 60-year-olds and older accounted for almost 22 percent of Shanghai’s reported residents, while the birth rate was below one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, head of the Shanghai City Population and Family Planning Commission, said that couples need to have babies of childbearing age to “help reduce the proportion of the aging population and alleviate the workforce shortage of the future.”
Shanghai will soon be "as old -- but not as rich -- as the industrialized countries, such as Japan and Sweden," she said.
A step-by-step relaxation
In the country’s constitution of 1978, China’s one-child policy is likely to be the most controversial provision ever introduced by the ruling Communist Party.
Married couples who violate this policy have to face huge fines -- up to triple their annual salary in some regions -- and discrimination in their workplaces.
Chinese state representatives attributed it to this policy that the critical use of the country’s natural resources could be avoided, whereas human rights representatives condemned abuses in enforcing the policy.
In rural areas, some officials forced pregnant women who had already had a child to abort.
Many couples also had sex-selective abortions, resulting in an unnaturally high ratio of men to women.
In recent years, government representatives for the population have gradually weakened their stance on one-child policy.
In 2004, they allowed more exceptions to the rule—including urban residents, members of ethnic minorities and cases where both husband and wife had single children—and in 2007, the tone of many harsh slogans was mitigated.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute of Population Research at the University of Beijing, said government officials have recently even discussed more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children with a partner being a single child.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to promote more births.
Posters that taught families to have only one child were replaced almost overnight by guidelines that describe in detail who is in question for a second child and how to apply for approval.
The municipality has sent urban employees and volunteers for family planning to visit couples at home and move information sheets under the doors.
She also asked for psychological and financial advice for those who have more than one child.
The reaction was not exactly encouraging, family planning representatives said.
Disappointing Reaction
Although officials from a rural small town in the outskirts of Shanghai said an increase in the number of couples who want a second child after the start of the campaign did not report any change in urban districts.
For example, the municipality of Huinan, with a population of 115,000, only four to five applications are still submitted per month.
Disappointed Shanghai officials say the number of births in the city expected for 2010 will still be around 165,000 despite the campaign -- slightly higher than 2009, but lower than 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee of the Shanghai municipality of Caolu, said financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people don’t want to have children anymore.
They want to give their first best, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said they would like to have two children and this was legally allowed.
But they, like many Chinese, have only a small amount of government health and life insurance.
Without a social network, they say, this decision would be irresponsible.
People in the West misjudge one-child policy as a human rights issue, said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is pregnant in the seventh month with her first child.
Yes, they rob us of the opportunity to have more than one child.
But the problem is not just about politics.
The problem is money.
Other couples indicate psychological reasons for their hesitation.
Wang, the staff manager, said she only wants a child because she was also a single child. “We were the centerpiece of the family and used to take care of us all.
We’re not used to taking care of others and we don’t really want to.”
Chen Zijian, a 42-year-old who belongs to a translation company, said it unmistakably.
For middle-aged parents with a double career that lowers birth rates, he said it’s about being successful and you have to be selfish about it.
The age group of today’s 20- to 39-year-olds grew up to see their parents struggle during the early days of the Chinese capitalism experiment and they don’t want a life for themselves, he said.
Even a single child, he said, puts huge demands on the time of the parents.
A mother must give up her social life for at least two years.
Then there's the space question -- "You have to renovate your apartment" -- and the life plan -- "If the child is 9 months old, you must already have a CV prepared for the best preschools."
Most of his friends are willing to do this once, Chen said, but not twice.
“Our generation is the first to reach a higher standard of living,” he said.
We do not want to make too many victims.
UN Group Draws Emissions Reduction Plan
The UN-sponsored climate conference, which has so far been marked by wild poses and reciprocal accusations, re-emphasized the publication of a document on Friday, which records an ambitious reduction in greenhouse gas emissions for the next 40 years, with the most industrialized nations in the near future.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement on the regulation of greenhouse gases, has shown both the remaining obstacles and the way forward.
But he was seen as an important step forward in a negotiation that is coming to an end, as more than 100 top politicians from all over the world will arrive in Copenhagen next week.
The text, formulated by a UN working group specially created for it, is silent about the amount of money that rich countries should give to poor countries so that they can master global warming in the short and long term.
It also offers a range of options for key issues, including how industrial and large emerging countries can limit their carbon emissions and how high the upper limit of global temperature rise should be, which would be brought by policy makers.
The process will be given great flexibility, said John Coequyt, a senior representative of the Sierra Club in Washington.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who has drafted the six-page document, has summarized a 180-page negotiating text to focus on what the UN’s leading climate protection representative, Yvo de Boer, has called “the big whole.”
It shows the basics of a possible agreement where industrial nations would jointly reduce their emissions by 25 to 45 percent by 2020, compared to the 1990 thresholds, while larger developing countries would reduce their emissions by 15 to 30 percent over the same period.
Together, countries could reduce emissions by 50 to 95 percent by 2050.
The European Community has also boosted the talks on Friday by providing <0x24>3.6 billion a year over the next three years to support poorer countries in adapting to the impacts of climate change - from overhauling and overhauling.
Friday, however, brought the same verbal fireworks that had been set for the talks last week.
U.S. climate commissioner Todd Stern has rejected formulations demanding binding reductions in greenhouse gas emissions for industrialized countries, compared to voluntary reductions for larger emerging countries, if they are not financed by industrial nations.
This train announced that the Obama administration is driving a harder line with China than representatives of the Bush administration not even two years ago.
The United States will not sign an agreement without major evolving countries getting up and taking action, Starr, who also complained that the text is not going far enough, said to ensure that the reductions could also be confirmed by outsiders.
Stern gave his opinion an hour after the statement by Chinese Foreign Minister He Yafei, who said that the leading American climate dealer was either lacking "reasonable" or it was "highly irresponsible" of him that he would not say at the beginning of the week that he would help China, the global banks that the United States finances.
By the fact that the future economic direction of the major world powers is at stake, break-up lines have emerged both within the industrial nations and between the industrialized nations and the emerging countries.
The current struggle also concerns the rescue of individual economies, as well as the rescue of the planet, with China and the United States commanding themselves because of their respective commitments, while poorer countries claiming that the two dozen most influential countries would have to ignore the non-knowledge.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said it’s not surprising that the big powers are struggling to figure out who should bear the costs of slowing the greenhouse gas emissions, as even the countries concerned have moved on to be more aggressive in their efforts to attract the greenhouse gas to the countries that are very high.
This is clearly a game that will develop a new economic dominance, says Ulate, who is also a regional climate change advisor to Conservation International in Mexico and Central America.
Some of the countries most exposed to the impacts of climate change indicated that they would continue to fight for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although the leading participants say the talks will lead to a political agreement at best.
The 43-member Small Island Alliance presented a 24-page draft treaty on Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who heads the international climate negotiations for the European Commission, said the offensive of the small island states "exerts political pressure on the entire political process," partly because they are now united and actions from the emerging countries, such as China and India.
The talks gained a new urgency as delegates focused on the fact that most open issues had to be clarified before the government leaders arrived to reach an agreement.
High-ranking representatives, such as Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and Chinese Deputy Minister, are taking off their planes and rushing through the hallways of the Bella Center to closed doors and press conferences to unlock claims to be negotiated over the next week.
The purity of the assembly -- 13,000 people go in and out every day in the Congress Center, guitar-playing activists organise nightly shows where they make fun of the countries they believe they are betraying and selling, and contract drafts are provided hand-to-hand instead of producing an e-mail.
The intensity is just starting to build: Almost all important ministers are here now and from Wednesday there will be 60 government leaders in Copenhagen.
We’re coming to the Oberliga,” said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, vice president of global policy at Conservation International.
The heavy weights are coming.
Britain's first 225 km/h fast train redefines Monday's feeling
Monday morning at 5 p.m. 13, a pipeline will penetrate the darkness to announce a train ride that represents a revolution in traffic in the UK.
The country’s first high-speed shuttle train will reach 225 km/h on its flash drive from Ashfort, Kent, to London St. Pancras and travel 93 km/h in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Minister of Transport, will then take Dame Kelly Holmes on board the first Javelin passenger service from London.
He hopes that the new UK service will eventually connect faster, reliable trains to an international rail network and will connect the major bustling areas of the Midlands, the North and Scotland to London.
The neglected province could become livelihoods of pedestrians, working hours would be radically reduced, and the shift from airplane and car to rail would reduce national carbon emissions and traffic jams.
In theory, the three major parties believe in this vision.
But the many billions of British pounds required for the construction of a new national rail network, the inevitable planning battle and fears of environmental damage could still slow down the British high-speed railroads.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company founded in January that is set to submit a feasibility study to the government, Lord Adonis will submit the report on December 30, according to the Times.
In this way, it receives a detailed route map of the next planned stage of the high-speed rail network.
The new railway line, which will connect London with the West Midlands, will pass through a five-metre playground in urban areas and places where the environmental impacts are disputed.
In the open ground, the plan will show the concept within a distance of 25 meters from the final track.
HS2 also aims to create three options for a larger, northward-leading high-speed rail network.
Lord Adonis will respond to this in the spring.
The preferred proposed option is a Y-shaped path guide in which a single high-speed path would lead to the West Midlands.
The route would split in or near Birmingham and one branch would lead west of the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and another direction northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line would lead to Scotland.
"It seems to be the best-functioning option," said one railway insider.
Once completed, the journey time between London and Edinburgh would be reduced to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first subroute, which would not be opened before 2025, would allow travellers to take back the London-Birmingham route in 49 minutes, compared to today, a little over an hour.
The designs gave trains the ability to drive at a speed of 400 km/h, making the British rail network the fastest in Europe.
The first route was designed to allow trains of 400 metres long with a maximum capacity of 1,100 people to ride on it.
Up to 18 trains per hour could be operated on the London-Birmingham route.
This, in turn, would mean that there would be a terminal in London where 20,000 passengers could be completed per hour.
Given the spatial constraints in the capital, it is expected that an existing railway station will be expanded to accommodate the high-speed network.
Railway experts say that only St. Pancras International or Euston have this potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not this plan should be continued in his opinion, but the lengthy public consultation and planning measures mean that a final decision will be made only after the parliamentary elections.
But even if it puts the wheels in motion, the rail network needs to be built in sections.
Trains would first have to switch from the high-speed rail lines to existing rail lines in the north of Birmingham, which would continue to take more than three hours between London and Scotland.
This is considered to be a decisive turning point in order to ensure a shift from the aircraft to the railroad, a direction for the rail revolution.
Taxpayers come up for mortgage for <0xC2><0xA3>75,000 orangery from a Conservative
Alan Duncan, the leading lower house member of the Conservatives, has billed the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year for the cost of an orangery he built in his home in his constituency.
The party prison spokesman, who was degraded by David Cameron for complaining that lower house members had to live "of lean rations", raised his mortgage by <0xC2><0xA3>75,000 to build an oak-wood factory at his second home in Rutland.
He was allowed to charge the taxpayer the additional interest income, an amount of hundreds of pounds per month.
The House of Representatives approved the requests at the time, and they were not questioned by Sir Thomas Legg, who is conducting a review of the expenses of the House of Representatives. Last night, Duncan said that the requests could not have been "not yet cleaner or more understandable".
Duncan, one of the richest members of the lower house, owns a two-storey house in a village in his constituency of Rutland and Melton.
Nearby houses have reached a purchase price of almost one million pounds (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.1 million).
The ground floor includes kitchen, living room and dining room, but the Fees Office, a checkpoint for the lower house, has agreed that Duncan needs more space.
Last year he planted a winter garden, which is called "orangery" in the plans.
Neighbors described it as a "glasshouse for entertainment".
Duncan was also not asked by the Committee on Standards and Privileges during a recent review of his previous mortgage contracts to take a position on the increase in cash intake.
The Committee freed him last month following an examination of its expenditure from the breach of the rules.
In 2004, Duncan transferred the security for a mortgage over <0xC2><0xA3>271,406 (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>300,000) from his London house to his constituency, which he had bought in 1991, a year before his election as a member of parliament.
Documents published this week show that Duncan received approximately <0xC2><0xA3>1,400 (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1,500) per month as a mortgage interest refund by March last year.
In April, his claims rose to more than 1,800 pounds (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2,000) per month.
The interest rate of Duncan’s RBS mortgage has not changed during this period, suggesting that the total increase was <0xC2><0xA3>75,000 (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>85,000).
The normal stepless RBS mortgage rate dropped from 7.94 percent in December 2007 to 4 percent in March this year, where it still stands.
The latest documents published by the lower house show that Duncan continued to claim his right to 1,250 pounds (1,400 euros) per month this May.
Duncan lost his position as opposition leader of the House of Commons in September after an undercover reporter filmed him as he said after the spending scandal that MPs would live "of lean rations".
"Essentially, when you work for the state, you have to live from lean rations and be treated like S******e."
He said, "I have spent my money for my garden and claiming a disappearing small part, measured by what belongs.
And I could have demanded the whole damn sum, but I don’t.”
The MP, a millionaire from his earlier career as an oil wholesaler, was attacked for the first time in May for his expenses when it became clear that he had claimed thousands of pounds for his garden before clarifying with the Fees Office that this could be considered “as an exaggerated demand.”
An activist has dug a pound-shaped hole in Duncan’s lawn after it became known that he had claimed 4,000 pounds (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>4,500) over three years.
When asked about the increased mortgage last night, Duncan said: "This was approved by both the Fees Office and subsequently by Legg for the increase in value."
He added: "There is no debate about avoiding and passing through, or a bending of the rules or the like.
Everything is fully transparent and moves strictly within the rules, is approved and everything.
It couldn’t be cleaner and clearer.”
Come all your faithful to admire Brighton's beach hut advent calendar
Beach huts in Brighton have found a new life content as an interactive Advent calendar for the winter months.
"Beyond", an alternative church group that encourages spiritual discoveries through creativity, has invited 24 owners to decorate their huts for each December day with Christmas songs as a theme.
The event started on 1 December and visitors were allowed to watch the latest cottage every day from 17:30 to 18:30 with free wine and traditional Mince Pies, cakes filled with dried fruits.
The Christmas songs selected so far are "I saw three ships", "O come, o come, Emmanuel" and "The first No<0xC3><0xAB>l", where the hut decoration is the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a TV marketing assistant from Hove, is a volunteer clergyman of the Diocese of Chichester and head of Beyond.
He said: “We want to make religion more important to people in a post-Christian society.
Why do we as a church expect people to come to a strange old building? I think the church should go to people and organize exciting celebrations.
The idea of the beach hut advent calendar began as a conversation with some friends at dinner.
Brighton is such a fantastic creative and vibrant place and we are trying to express this through our spirituality."
Strong mobilization in Copenhagen and in the world for the climate.
Tens of thousands of people around the world and in Copenhagen on Saturday demonstrated to call for an ambitious and compelling agreement on the fight against global warming, where the police carried out several hundred arrests.
At least thirty thousand people, according to the police, a hundred thousand according to the organizers, are marching in the cold of the Danish capital, on the verge of the United Nations climate conference, which is expected to lead to a conclusion that could come into force by Friday, 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, the president of the Danish climate conference, the increasing mobilization of the world for climate is contributing to what is illustrated by these demonstrations that the "political price" of a failure in Copenhagen would be very high.
The incidents in the Danish capital took place shortly after the train took place when a group of 300 protesters, all dressed in black, broke a window with plasterstones and hammers, a journalist of AFP noted.
Anti-unrest police officers immediately and without consideration intervened.
Police have announced that 600 to 700 people, according to their estimates, were arrested mainly members of the Blacks Blocs, these extremely violent splitting groups, which already became famous at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, in April.
The Coalition Climate Justice Action (CJA), one of the organizers of the demonstration, has captured the conditions under which hundreds of militant supporters had been "without distinction", sharply criticised, and has stressed that about a hundred of you "always held positions in the streets on Saturday night with hands-on-hand and hands-only" of the extremists.
The rather peaceful train went from Parliament to the Bella Center, where the negotiations took place.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the building without attempting to enter.
A stage was installed to welcome the intended speakers for an evening with candlelight, with the participation of former South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu.
Most of the protesters are buses and trains from major European cities, but many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, as well as some Africans were present.
Approximately 3,000 people, most of you with sky blue raincoats, made a first run in the morning in Copenhagen, as you are following the call of the friends of the earth to form "blue tides" for "climate justice".
Today we are going to the streets to demand compensation for ecological guilt in favour of the South, said Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino activist at the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
“We can’t go on and say to ourselves, we have time,” said Angelique Kidjo, a Benin singer.
There are rivers in Africa that dries out, where you can walk, like it has never been in the past.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, established in 1992 with the adoption of the UN agreement, the movement of globalization critics has approached environmental organizations.
MEP José Bové, a form of globalization critic, announced that he came to Copenhagen to link "climate justice and social justice": "Today there is no difference between the fight against climate warming and the fight for another world."
The Asia-Pacific area, where there are many islands that are particularly endangered by warming, has been the starting committee for the demonstrations.
Approximately 50,000 people have taken to the streets, according to the organizers in Australia.
In Manila, there were a few hundred people, mostly students who were marching in red and eating bandanas in which you praised the solar energy.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, but also in Canada, marches were held by a few hundred protesters to demand an energetic approach to climate change.
In France, the demonstrations organized by the network "350" have gathered several hundred people, namely in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
Some people have gathered in Geneva.
The separatist Abkhazia has elected its president, Georgia denouncing that this is a "strike".
Abkhazia elected its president on Saturday, a little more than a year after Moscow recognized this pro-Russian separatist Georgian territory as autonomous, denouncing Tbilisi's "strike".
Approximately 131,000 people were called upon to participate in the first election after the Russian-Georgian War of August 2008 for control of the South Ossetia region, another Georgian secessionist territory that was recognized by Russia.
The polling stations closed at 5 p.m. GMT.
Election turnout was approximately 58% a few hours before the local election closure, according to the Abkhazian Election Commission officials.
The first preliminary results should be announced on the night of Saturday to Sunday.
The five candidates, including the current president, Serguei Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of a reunion with Georgia that condemns the election.
These elections are a farce.
On the other hand, Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili regrets that Abkhazia is now under total Russian occupation, his spokeswoman, Manana Manjgaladze, said.
In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela have recognized the independence of this territory with 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world perceives it as part of Georgia, which is illegally occupied by Russia.
After separating itself from Georgia during the 1992-93 conflict, with several thousand people dead, Abkhazia would like to prove by means of this election that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a stage in our new life, a new era, as an independent state, has explained Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian who claims to have chosen for Mr. Bagapch.
She was one of the voters who went to vote in a polling station located in a school in the capital Soukhoumi, a beautiful white building with a few palm trees in front of the entrance.
The question of Russian dominance is the heart of this presidential election, in a region with beautiful landscapes on the Black Sea.
Big signs on which Bagapch is seen on the side of the Russian president and the head of government, Dmitry Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, are everywhere in this small area that has 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, which is located in the east of the country, the district chief, Beslan Archba, has prepared a warm welcome to the Russian representatives who have come to monitor the election.
We, the Abkhazian people, are grateful, he said at a small celebration, as a reminder of Moscow's support, especially with regard to the decision to recognize Abkhazia's independence.
I hope your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations, replied Alexei Ostrovski, a member of the Russian parliament and raised a glass of vodka.
The opposition, represented by the former vice-president and two Russian businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, has criticised the agreements reached with Moscow last year, such as the one in Abkhazia Russia over the control of the railroad for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Banba, claims to support neither the current government nor the opposition.
A majority of 50% plus a vote is required to win the election.
If none of the candidates reach this threshold, a second round of elections must be organised within two weeks.
Climate: Worldwide demos, incidents in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people around the world protested on Saturday to call for an ambitious and binding treaty from the Copenhagen climate conference, where the police, at any time ready, arrested about 700 people on the edge of an important demonstration.
Thirty thousand people, according to the police, a hundred thousand according to the organizers, have demonstrated in the afternoon cold in the Danish capital, which by 18 December will receive delegates from 193 countries who are looking for an agreement to enter into force on 1 January 2013.
From Parliament, the peaceful train marched towards the Bella Center, where the negotiations took place.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the center and did not attempt to invade.
A stage was built to welcome the speakers for an evening with candlelight, with the participation of former South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu.
A few moments after the train had passed, a group of protesters, who were dressed in black and armed with bricks and hammers, began to strike discs, an AFP reporter noted.
Anti-unrest policemen have immediately circled you and have intervened without consideration by throwing some of them to the ground.
Police have announced that 600 to 700 people have been arrested and have clarified that they are mainly members of the Blacks Blocs, these extremely violent splitting groups that have already become famous at the NATO summit in Strasbourg in eastern France in April.
In the evening, during the incidents, which according to police, about twenty people were provisionally arrested, a police officer was injured by a patch of stone on his chin, and four vehicles burned near an occupied house.
"We have the extreme groups in our hands," said police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen, as the helicopters of the law enforcement forces circled in the air.
Most of the protesters who arrived by train or by their own vehicle from German major cities, from London, Amsterdam or from Milan were Europeans.
However, there were also many Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, and Africans.
Almost 3,000 people, mostly in a sky blue raincoat, formed in Copenhagen in the morning after the "Friends of the Earth" called for a first group to represent the "blue sea" for "climate justice".
“Today we are taking the road to demand that the ecological debts be repaid to the people of the South,” said Lidy Nacpil of the Jubilee South Coalition of the Philippines in Copenhagen.
“We can’t say to each other anymore: we still have time,” says Benin singer Angélique Kidjo.
“In Africa, there are rivers that run, there are watercourses that you can walk through, which was never the case before.”
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, which was launched in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the anti-globalization movement has approached environmental organizations.
French MP and globalisation critic José Bové told AFP that he had come to Copenhagen to "bind climate justice and social justice." "There is no difference today between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world."
Oxfam has mobilized several figures, such as Danish model Helena Christensen or former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson, who are addressing the masses.
The Asia-Pacific area, which has many islands that are particularly vulnerable to global warming, has given rise to the demonstrations.
In Australia, according to the organizers, about 50,000 people took to the streets.
In Manila, a few hundred people, mostly students, dressed in red with bandanas, before the city administration of the Philippine capital for solar advertising.
In Hong Kong and Jakarta, hundreds of protesters gathered in an action against climate change.
During the demonstrations organized by the "Network of the 350", several hundred people gathered in France, particularly in Paris, Marseille in the south, Lille in the north, Bordeaux in the west and Lyon in the east.
Several people gathered in Geneva.
According to Chatel, the subjects of geography and history emerged strongly from the school reform of the Lycées.
National Education Minister Luc Chatel explained in an interview published in the Sunday newspaper "Journal du dimanche" that the subjects of geography and history emerged strongly from the school reform of the Lycées, even if they are not taught in the terminal (12th school year).
"The students of the Première (11th year) now have the same program every four weeks," confirms Mr. Chatel.
For the minister, "this seemingness must be overcome", for he believes that "the scientific profile is no longer a scientific profile", but rather a concentration of "the best student".
"The economic-social and literary profile (ES and L) must not become a sub-profile of the scientific one," he continued, stressing, "I have not yet heard of many historians and intellectuals who have heard about the lack of historical-geographical education in the terminal on technical lyceum."
On Saturday, an IFOP survey published in Humanity found that nearly seven out of ten French people (69%) criticized the state project of abolishing compulsory education in history and geography in Terminal S (12th school year with a scientific profile), as well as some of the links, links and intellectuals of these rights.
The Minister replied, however, that there was no question as to the limitation of the philosophy of the Terminal S program.
Luc Chatel also defended the education reform for teachers, while 16 organizations (students and unions) had called for Tuesday to protest the project, which they believe is the victim of the educational training of future teachers.
In Master 2 (M2), the Minister stated that they would undergo a professional qualification examination at the beginning of the year and at the end of the year an admission examination in which their teaching skills will be tested.
In addition, they conduct internships during the year in M2 and then teach the students a year before as a teacher in the internship.
He continued, “If you add all the internships offered before the performance exam, you will reach even more hours you have spent before the students, that is, more than 300 hours.”
Finally, the minister stated that he wants to offer "the individual right to education" - a "thing that does not exist in public education."
He confirmed that he wants to abolish the school card "by 2012".
15 minutes for the climate at the "Ecole Normale Supérieure"
Fifteen minutes to talk about the commitment at the Copenhagen Summit: this is the challenge that Jean Jouzel, Vice-President of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, has faced tomorrow at the Ecole Normale Supérieure in rue d'Ulm in Paris.
As one AFP journalist noted, the Nobel Peace Prize winner Jean Jouzel opened the first of the "Ernest" conferences, at which experts turn to the public for fifteen minutes each with filmed contributions.
One wants to do something that will reach people and make them feel like they want to learn more, said Edouard Hannezo, 22, and one of the organizers of the day, at the edge of the conference. The name of this event goes back to the name that the students gave the fish in the basin of the basin.
"From the experts, twenty participants were selected, even according to their charisma," he said.
"Climate warming can be talked about for hours, but the core targets can also be set in a few minutes," Jean Jouzel told AFP, who spoke freely before about 50 people only with the help of foils.
"This is part of our role as a scientist," he stressed, hoping that listeners will learn from it that "the Copenhagen Conference is based on an absolutely serious scientific dossier."
The videos filmed by these conferences will be available online on the school page from December 15.
The next "Ernest" day is scheduled for February and will be held every two months thereafter.
Delayed payment : angry prison guards, actions planned
On Friday, the unions of law enforcement officials called for a general action day to reach that the premiums and overtime, which were postponed for budget reasons until January, be transferred before the Christmas holidays.
The 2nd Union of Penitentiary Officers (FO-Penitentiaire) called on employees who have no service to demonstrate in front of the Penitentiary on Tuesday and block them in order to alert them to the “theft of what belongs to them”.
The 3rd CGT Penitentiary called for "to unite into a strong mobilization in the various prisons" on which the non-payment of the overtime incurred in October, night strikes as well as the sun and holiday strikes will be added in December.
The first syndicate of criminal enforcement officials, the Autonomous Federal Criminal Union (UFAP/UNSA), called for "general mobilizations (...) to show dissatisfaction and anger."
The management of the Penal Enforcement Agency and the Ministry of Justice stated that the overtime was significantly increased in 2009 and not all were provided for in the budget, but they guarantee that the remaining claims will be paid in January.
As the Ministry of Justice said in the evening, Michèle Alliot-Marie sent a letter to the unions of law enforcement officials guaranteeing that the payment will be made next month.
"I know very well about the efforts of the staff to keep our enforcement system functioning and modernize," the Justice Minister said in the letter.
"I have instructed the management of the enforcement agency to take immediate action to ensure that a situation created by a lack of assessment of the coming overtime does not repeat itself in the future," Alliot-Marie added.
The December salary therefore falls low, except for the management staff who enjoys high service and target rewards, explains the UFAP/UNSA, for which the "budget constraints" must be maintained.
“This is an absolute scandal,” the interregional trade union FO in Marseille is outraged and announces that it will boycott “all meetings and calls” until new instructions are given.
"The staff does not go to work on Sundays and holidays, if the hours from October to December are still unpaid. The same applies to their overtime hours," the FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne also threatens.
“At a time when more and more tasks are being charged to us without more staff being hired, the attempt to enrich the staff’s funds is more than inappropriate,” said the CGT union of Bordeaux.
According to the trade unions, the situation is not the same in all regions; some are less affected than others.
In any case, however, it is wrong, notes the Secretary-General of the UFAP, Jean-François Forget.
Obama believes that Christmas is always giving away better gifts than he gets himself.
U.S. President Barack Obama, who is going to spend Christmas with his family in the White House for the first time, told TV spokeswoman Oprah Winfrey that he is always giving better gifts than he gets himself.
During a special broadcast broadcast on Sunday evening via the ABC channel, the president and his wife Michelle gave insights into how they will spend the holidays in their new illustrious home.
Even Bo, the small four-legged companion of the family, will be with the party.
"Santa Claus also loves Bo," confirms Michelle Obama, adding that of course the dog is also given a gift.
Michelle Obama strongly rejected her husband’s claims about the quality of the gifts. “I made you beautiful gifts last year,” she denies the president.
"So please," he whispered, pointing to the pearl chain of the First Lady, "and who gave you this one?"
While this one-hour broadcast in an unenforced atmosphere with the well-known television host, who had so vehemently supported Barack Obama during his election campaign, the president and his wife also spoke about gifts they loved most as a child.
Barack Obama recalled a ten-legged bicycle and a basketball that his father, who he seldom saw, brought him from Kenya for Christmas.
“I remember when my father visited us at Christmas and brought me a basketball,” he said.
“It was not until much later in my life that I realized that I had this ball from him.”
The first lady, for her part, remembered her doll house.
"I didn't know how to arrange the furniture in a house at all, so I put them all on the wall instead of grouping them around the fireplace, but I loved this little dollhouse," said Michelle Obama.
Johnny Hallyday Reopens, RTL Confirms He Has Been Moved to Artificial Coma
Johnny Hallyday was once again operated on in Los Angeles for significant "damaging" after surgery in France, according to the people around him, the situation being "under control", although RTL confirmed that the singer was moved into artificial coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rock musician was once again operated on Wednesday to Thursday at the Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles after American doctors "damage caused by an operation of a tape disc incident", which he claimed on November 26 in Paris that he had made an opera that had made this product in Paris.
However, the singer’s production company wanted to clarify that the situation was “under control” and announced that a new medical opinion would be available in 48 hours at the latest.
However, according to RTL, the partner during the singer's last tour, Johnny Hallyday was put into an artificial coma to avoid "pain and complications".
However, it was only after 48 hours that we had a little more certainty about the patient’s condition than he opened his eyes, RTL added.
At the request of AFP, there was no confirmation or comment by the production company.
RTL also confirms that "from certain sources" that after its first operation in Paris "no drainage" was placed.
The rocker was operated on at the international clinic of Parc Monceau due to a tape disc incident.
The surgery, planned over several days, was performed by neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known doctor who had already treated many stars.
This was not available for comments on RTL on Thursday night.
Following surgery by Johnny Hallyday, the singer was admitted to Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles on Monday due to a follow-up infection after the operation.
The singer Eddy Mitchell, who is very close to Johnny Hallyday, felt at RTL on Thursday that his friend was going through a "deep valley", but he assured that "no worries" about the rock musician as he is "a good fighter".
"He had called me before he left for Los Angeles, and I told him that it would be foolish to get on a plane for twelve hours after such an operation," said Eddy Mitchell.
On Wednesday evening, the singer's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, confirmed that Johnny Hallyday "reacts well to antibiotics" and that "the infection is inhibited".
Mr. Camus also explained that he had spoken to Laeticia, the singer's wife, and he had not felt any particular concern.
Still, concern for the singer’s health had grown ever since he spent nine days in a hospital in July after crashing on his yacht.
Two months later, it was to the general amazement that Johnny Hallyday had a "small bowel cancer OP", followed by a slight infection.
At the end of September, the singer recorded his long "Tour 66" as a farewell tour.
Since then, however, every health problem has been widely commented on, and fans and journalists have not forgotten that the singer on stage had difficulty moving.
It was not until mid-November that the people around him had to dementia a new hospitalization.
Euro-2009/Short track: First place for Bousquet over his favorite distance
Frenchman Frédérick Bousquet, three-time medalist at the 2009 Swimming World Championships, won an international title on Thursday over his favorite distance, 50m freestyle, at the Euro-2009 runway in Istanbul.
On the first day of this competition, the last time polyurethane suits were allowed, there were only three world records, while a real record flood was expected.
A record was improved by the Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto over 4 x 200 m and the other two by Russia at 4 x 50m men’s.
Damn for Bousquet, who wanted to hit the world record at the 50m freestyle, whose record he holds in the big pool (20.94).
At one of the two royal distances in swimming, 50m freestyle, the 28-year-old Frenchman claimed himself in 20.53 sec, in a final with ten swimmers at the start (usually eight) - an international premiere.
Bousquet forced Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but he failed to break the world record (20.30) as planned.
"You can believe in ever greater and in the present case I have said, if the world record is within my reach, I will try it."
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers started swimming in polyurethane suits, which are banned from January 1, 2010.
With 238 world records since February 2008, these combinations end their epic in Istanbul, which began in 1999 in the same competition for the first time.
This time, the use of the combination has not paid off for the German Paul Biedermann, twice world champion in the pool this summer in Rome and the world record, in the end.
The young swimmer did not manage to improve his best time over 400m freestyle (3:32.77), yet he passed with the second best time in his career (3:34.55), ahead of Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and Danish Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
“I didn’t give everything this time.
I knew I couldn’t reach a world record today, but I defended my title and did my job.”
"Lobintsev will be a serious opponent in the future," Biedermann said.
U.S. grave plate at Zola estimated at <0x24>1.5 million
A Roman graveyard, which appeared calculated by French writer Emile Zola, was estimated on Thursday at <0x24>1.5 million above its value, according to art dealer Sotheby's.
This plate is two meters long and 63 cm high. It dates from the 3rd century BC and has always been valued at <0x24>150,000 to <0x24>250,000.
The marble, on which "four scenes of the Dionysus are depicted in a sophisticated architectural decor, surrounded by satires and bacchus figures, is a rare piece. There are only four or five of them in the world," said Florent Heintz, Vice President for the Advancement of the Romans and the Egyptian Antiquity.
It has been sold among hundreds of pieces.
"Sales are still running, but this part is certainly what buyers have offered most so far," Sotheby's spokesman Dan Abernethy told AFP.
The discovery of this marble part by Emile Zola goes a long way back.
The record was in Rome for almost 300 years in the famous collection of the Borghese family at home, after which she appeared piece by piece with the French actress Cécile Sorel, who found use in her bathroom of her Parisian hotel, and with Paul Reynaud, Minister of the French Republic, came to Marguerite III.
The next 50 years are in the dark.
While browsing the database of the Louvre, Florent Heintz discovered that this record was part of a "heritage of Emile Zola", which was opened in 1903, a year after the death of the author of the "Thérèse Raquin" and the "Rougon-Macquart" fresco.
Zelaya's exit attempt from Honduras in the direction of Mexico has been frustrated
On Thursday, Mexico had declared the conditions for the transfer of the overthrown Honduran President Manuel Zelaya to domestic soil as no longer agreed upon after the coup regime rejected the move as unacceptable.
After a phone conversation with President Zelaya that took place at night, at the moment, everything seems to indicate that there is disagreement regarding the possibilities of carrying out this transfer, said Mexican Foreign Minister Patricia Espinosa.
According to the Immigration Authority, the airliner, which arrived in Salvador on Wednesday for the purpose of transferring Zelaya, has returned to its starting point.
The Putsch government wanted to require Zelaya to "remember" and ask him for political asylum abroad.
The overthrown president, however, rejected this, as he wished to return to Mexico as the most welcoming, incumbent head of state.
The Putin regime "has suffered a renewed failure by trying to move me to give up at my expense (...), they wanted me to resign," Zelaya told Radio Globo on Thursday, in which he has been holding up since the beginning of the political crisis, meltate to the medium-sized country of America.
I can stay here well and I like to stay here for ten years, here I have my guitar, added the downtrodden president, who had fled to the Brazilian embassy of Tegucigalpa two and a half months ago, under the attacks of some chords.
The Mexican embassy has presented us with a request for guidance, but unfortunately we cannot accept it as it does not include an asylum request, Oscar Raul Matute, Interior Minister of the Putsch government, told Honduran radio HRN on Wednesday.
I am not seeking asylum in any country at all, had answered Manuel Zelaya in an interview with the Telesur channel, whose headquarters are in Caracas.
A possible departure from Honduras, he had underlined, would only be undertaken as the president of the Honduran people.
The rumors of Zelaya’s departure had mobilized followers of the overthrown president on Wednesday, who had joined the Brazilian embassy and gathered around it, whereupon the military there had reinforced its efforts.
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticized the government’s position.
This, according to his assessment, reveals the marginal character of this government in the face of international standards.
Zelaya, who had approached the socialist Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, was overthrown on the day of the public consultation he organised to prepare for his re-election on June 28, against the advice of the Supreme Court, the Army and Congress.
From his exile in Costa Rica, he returned surprisingly on September 21 and had fled to the Brazilian embassy.
If he leaves them, he will be arrested for high treason, which he is accused by the judiciary, according to the Putsch government.
Putsch President Roberto Micheletti managed to hold a presidential election on November 29 to replace M. Zelaya.
In the course of the contested election, Porfirio Lobo was recognized by the United States, but was rejected by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil.
Three days later, the Congress had massively voted against Zelaya’s return to office until the end of his mandate on January 27.
Wall Street on the rise, the U.S. trade balance fuels optimism
The New York Stock Exchange closed with a high on Thursday, the figures on the U.S. trade balance show a rebound in the stocks of the United States and its partners: the Dow Jones added 0.67%, the Nasdaq added 0.33%.
According to the numbers at the closing of the stock market, the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased from 68.78 points to 10,405.83 points, while Nasdaq, dominated by technology, rose from 7.13 points to 2,190.06 points.
The expanded Standard & Poor <0xCC><0x81>s 500 index was recorded at 0.58 percent (6.40 points) to 1,102.35 points.
There is good news from different sectors of the economy, Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial said.
However, this remains anecdotal under the premise that the market focuses only on "half full glasses", she said.
According to Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners, investors are primarily focused on the figures in the U.S. trade balance, “which has an improvement in activity in the fourth quarter.”
The U.S. trade deficit fell 7.6% to <0x24>32.9 billion in October compared to September.
Analysts, on the contrary, expected a deficit increase.
Both imports and exports have increased.
The big news is the increase in the overall volume of trade, especially in goods exports, which reflects the economic growth of the main trading partners of the United States, commented Christopher Cornell of Business Research Economy.com.
In contrast, the unemployment rate in the United States has risen in the past week against all expectations and has now reached the level of 474,000 applications.
However, the average for new job seekers has fallen "at the bottom of the year" over the past four weeks, said Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market has fallen.
The profitability of 10-year government bonds increased to 3,482 % from 3,432 % on Tuesday night, the profitability of 30-year bonds to 4,492 % from 4,408 % on the previous night.
Cuba: Hundreds of powerful partisans suck 'Ladies in White'
Hundreds of Cuban-powered partisans slapped the wives of political prisoners who met in Havana for the purpose of World Human Rights Day on Thursday, as well as another statement that temporarily detained a good dozen dissidents.
Forty "Ladies in Weiss", wives or upcoming political prisoners, were kicked out on an open street by government supporters under Raul Castro, just as they were marching into the center of the capital to demand the release of political prisoners.
Down with the Yankees!, "Soldiers!", "the street belongs to the revolutionaries!", "Fidel and Raul live!" the powerful partisans chanted against the dissidents with a raised Faust.
The latter were escorted by civilian agents who appeared to "ensure their protection".
A similar demonstration against the "Ladies in White" took place in Havana on the eve of the night, where there were no injuries or arrests.
In the Havana district of Vedado, on the other hand, a dozen dissidents were temporarily detained by civilian police, a reporter of AFP confirmed.
According to this reporter, the police force the dissidents exploited by the government’s partisans to enter civilian vehicles by force.
Temporary detention of dissidents in such circumstances is usually limited to only a few hours.
As candidates for the Sakharov Prizes awarded by the European Parliament in 2005, the "Ladies in Weiss" have organised an unauthorized march for the purpose of the "Pray for the release of all political prisoners", the number of which according to the dissident list has about 200 persons, starting from 20 years of age, Laura Pollan declared a Hectorzstrane in 20 years.
Maceda belongs to the group of 75 Cuban dissidents detained in March 2003, 53 of whom have been behind bars.
The Cuban authorities see the regime’s opponents as “soldiers” or “agents” in the service of the declared enemy, the United States.
A rare in itself is that Cuban television reported on Thursday’s demonstration events between militant pro-government fighters and “counter-revolutionaries”.
Cuba, led by a unitary party, the Communist Party, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of violating rights and freedoms, in particular freedom of expression.
Madman Kills Eighty-Year-Old With Knife and Leaves 5 Injured in Clichy-la-Garenne
A two-knife-armed madman killed an eighty-year-old in Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine) and wounded five other people at the main business time on Friday afternoon.
According to the survey, the 28-year-old assailant had injured the eighty-year-old from an unexplained cause in or in front of a pharmacy on Boulevard Jean-Jaures with two knives and this, according to police reports, in the presence of witnesses.
The old man, born in 1929, suffers the consequences of his injuries at the hospital, according to an official of the Alliance Police Syndicate.
In or in front of the same pharmacy he had a couple with a pregnant woman.
The man, about in the triangles, intervened and was injured.
The first two victims were taken to the hospital, where the eighty-year-old died.
The other wounded floats in life-threatening danger, as he was reportedly affected by vital organs, according to police sources.
The pregnant woman has become ill as a result of the events and is said to have been hospitalized in a "shocking state", according to a police officer.
The armed man, who, according to police, appeared to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs, is said to have developed immediately on the street, the same Boulevard Jean Jaures.
He had injured two other passengers, apparently by chance: a thirty-one-year-old and a forty-year-old, the latter of the two.
The script remained in the dark in the evening.
He had been armed with two carnage knives, which he wore crossed behind his back, said locally Arnaud Pressé, a manager of the Alliance of the Hauts-de-Seine area.
Several passers-by, including young people, were said to have tried to band the insane, according to AFP’s testimony reports.
I saw a guy in the triangles with a green vest.
Three young men tried to enter.
They couldn't because the guy was well-built, Alberto reported, a waiter at a nearby bar.
A horde has fallen over him, he added, including a city policeman who broke his wrist.
Still on Boulevard Jean-Jaures, at the height of house number 61, two city policemen, including their superior, have tried to arrest the armed man and were injured with knives, according to police reports.
The event took place in one of the main battlefields of Clichy-la-Garenne, where a number of shops are located.
Passengers have come to me to inform me that there is an injured person outside.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old person lying on the floor, I put her in a first-aid position and noticed a clapping wound in the abdominal area, said Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist, AFP.
Five minutes later, a second, about thirty-year-old person, was injured by cuts.
In the end, state police officers arrested the man who did not carry his ID.
The State Prosecutor’s Office of Nanterre has commissioned the District Reference of the Criminal Police Department of Hauts-de Seine (SDPJ 92) with the case disclosure.
The madman was hospitalized on Thursday night.
In view of his condition, he has not yet been tried in court.
A police station does not rule out being delivered to a neural hospital.
According to another police source, it meant six police officers to arrest him at the police station in Clichy, where he had been taken.
He was "in a state of overwhelmingness" as "all the mentally confused of this kind, in which the forces are liberated during the tathering process".
U.S.: Polanski’s Lawyer Calls for Stopping Criminal Prosecution Again
The lawyer of the French-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski on Thursday in Los Angeles (California, western United States) has repeatedly demanded the prosecution of his client, who is currently in his home in Switzerland, for more than 30 years before a seat trial.
Chad Hummel, a lawyer for the director of the "Pianist", has reported a serious case at the time of negotiation in 1977 before three judges of the Appeal Court in California's second district.
I demand on the grounds of punishment, Mr. Hummel said, before adding that the behavior of Judge Laurence Rittenband, who was in charge at the time of the trial, "has left his back cold."
According to him, the now deceased judge had a trial band, before he fell his judgement, debated with a prosecutor, who should have told him that Roman Polanski deserved a nursing home -- which is a serious misconduct.
This discussion was launched in the documentary "Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired", specifically by the prosecutor David Wells.
Mr. Wells had finally declared at the end of September that the authors of the documentary "believed".
Should the Court refuse to stop the criminal proceedings, Mr Hummel requests that a process be conducted that would enable him to present the evidence for his argument.
The prosecution, in turn, has repeated the evidence already explained in first instance, i.e. that a discussion on the cancellation of the facts put to the charge of the defendant cannot be seriously considered, as long as Roman Polanski does not appear before the court.
The 76-year-old filmmaker fled the United States in 1978, before announcing the sentence for "illegal sexual intercourse" with a 13-year-old.
Since then, he has not travelled to the United States.
Los Angeles County deputy prosecutor Phyllis Asayama had stated that Roman Polanski "must be there to attend the trial".
Would you like to spread the message in this matter, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other defendants, that the escape is a way out?” asked Mrs. Asayma.
In her opinion, "the filmmaker asks the court for a favor and thus disregards his authority".
One of the three judges — who now have 90 days to announce their decision — even pointed out that "there are other options for escape".
Hummel was not the only one who had requested the cessation of prosecution against Roman Polanski.
The lawyer of Samantha Geimer, the victim, once again demanded the cancellation of the criminal proceedings.
She recalled that her client would no longer tolerate being harassed by every revival of the Polanski affair, adding: “Nobody in this room can say that this procedure was fair.
Twenty-three years is enough.”
Roman Polanski was arrested in Switzerland on September 26 on the basis of an American arrest warrant.
After spending two months behind bars, he was sentenced to house arrest in his chalet in Gstaad in anticipation of a possible extradition.
Wall Street is slowed down by the rise of the dollar and closes without a price.
The New York Stock Exchange closed on Friday without a price, in a market that went down and down between better indicators than expected in the U.S. and a dollar rise: the Dow Jones won 0.63% and Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
Based on the final figures available at closing, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has increased by 65.67 points to 10,471.50 points, while the technology-dominated Nasdaq has yielded 0.55 points to 2190.31 points.
The expanded Standard & Poor's 500 index increased by 0.37 % (4.06 points) to 1,106.41 points.
"Honestly, the market is pretty quiet," said Mace Blicksilver of Marblehead Asset Management.
"It remains tightly limited, the trading volume has become very low and I think this will remain the same until the end of the year."
The trend was supported by the publication of better economic indicators than anticipated, which "contributed to improving market vision for the solidity of the economic recovery," the analysts of Charles Schwab summarized.
In the U.S., retail sales increased by 1.3% in November, two months in a row and far more than expected.
Furthermore, U.S. consumer confidence improved significantly in December to 73.4 against 67.4 in the previous month, according to the University of Michigan’s Index Preview.
However, the indices have been slowed down by a new rise in the dollar, which has reached the highest position against the euro in two months, pushing “the sectors vulnerable to the economic situation downwards,” said Owen Fitzpatrick, Deutsche Bank.
As a result, the technological values have lost some ground.
The bond market has declined.
The yield of the Treasury bond over 10 years increased by 3,540 % on Wednesday evening from 3,482 % and that of the bond over 30 years to 4,497 % from 4,492 % on the previous day.
Re-election of Miss World in South Africa
After a month’s tour of South Africa, the 112 candidates for the title of Miss World on Saturday will cross the last hurdle to realize their dream: to be elected the most beautiful woman in the world and to watch it before a billion viewers.
During this large beauty fair, which will be held for the second time in a row in the vicinity of Johannesburg, five of them have already earned their ticket to the semi-finals.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta from Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo from Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma from Canada were shortlisted as Miss Sportive or Miss Topmodel during their African stay.
This was a true squirrel of pleasures.
Visiting beautiful cities such as Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Hoorn was simply exceptional.
I’ve seen a lot of things and done a lot of experiences!” said Miss Sierra Leone with enthusiasm.
This competition will be held for the ninth time in South Africa and will be broadcast live on Saturday, from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, starting at 5 p.m.
I couldn't imagine a beautiful country to hand over my crown.
This experience was simply fascinating.
I am happy to have made this experience twice, underlined Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of the South African summer.
For the young Russian, her second stay in South Africa was marked by numerous exchanges of experiences with candidates and the rediscovery of "amazing landscapes".
After a month of Galas, trials, meetings with the press and Safari, the Miss now focuses on the competition.
The Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to step into the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, who was elected in 2000 and will also be present in this election, as well as succeed Aishwarya Rai, who was elected in 1994 and became both Bollywood stars.
Of course, it is every woman’s dream to be crowned the most beautiful woman in the world, but it’s not just about appearance.
“We are ambassadors of our country and I want to come home with the crown,” said Miss India with a wide smile.
According to the organizers, this 59th edition will be highlighted with music and dance.
The candidates parade in traditional costumes and not to forget, in the bathing suit.
The show is presented by a television presenter, the Chinese Angela Chow, by the former beauty queen of South Africa, Michelle McLean, and by a director of the Miss World Committee, Steve Douglas.
“South Africa has shown that it knows how to welcome the world with a barely overwhelming kindness and pride,” said Julia Morley, president of Miss World.
The candidates, like last year, made a safari visiting the famous township in Soweto, but this time by bike and local cuisine.
However, the meeting with South African President Jacob Zuma, who gave them the hand, was quite extraordinary.
Not uncommon for a head of state, said Miss Sierra Leone.
However, her most beautiful memory remains undoubtedly the launch in Cape Town (southwest) for the football world championship in June 2010, a kind of country to advertise a little more for this event.
I'm wrong with people I'd probably never get closer to.
I will certainly return to the 2010 World Cup, promised Miss Italy enthusiastically, Alice Taticchi.
The news about Johnny Hallyday is “very positive” according to his son David
The news about Johnny Hallyday is “very positive,” his son David said on Friday when he arrived at Los Angeles Airport, where he visited his father, who has been in the hospital for several days.
The news is very positive.
He is very strong, everything is going very well, David Hallyday told the press when he got off the plane shortly after 13:00 local time (21:00 MEZ) from Paris.
The singer’s son, who made a relaxed impression, assured him that he would “fastest” go to Cedars-Sinaï Hospital, where Johnny Hallyday was delivered on Monday due to a bacterial sequelae infection following an operation in a disc incident on November 26 in Paris.
"This night in Los Angeles, the singer was put into an artificial coma to alleviate his severe pain and perform his treatment," the press service said.
Johnny Hallyday was transplanted into an artificial coma by the doctors of Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles, where he was delivered on Monday following a bacterium follow-up infection following a tape disc surgery on November 26 in Paris.
The singer had to undergo surgery again on the night of Wednesday to Thursday, due to the illness caused by the last surgery.
His wife Laeticia attended a school event in the French high school in Los Angeles on Friday morning, where her daughter Jade is going to school, a photographer from AFP said.
The head of the Department of Orthopaedic and Traumatological Surgery at the Hospital Pitié-Salpêtrière, Yves Catoné, announced that he would visit the singer at the hospital in Los Angeles on Monday.
The producer has severely injured neurosurgeon Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, who operated on the singer on November 26 at the Clinique Internationale du Parc Monceau in Paris.
We were told that he had committed the purest massacre.
The Los Angeles surgeons said they were completely disarmed, Mr. Camus said.
“I’ve heard that you might be able to initiate a trial,” he said.
Jean-Claude Camus is of the opinion that Johnny Hallyday is "too fast and this has traveled to Los Angeles with the permission of the Parisian surgeon."
I called this doctor personally, who assured me that he considered this trip to be completely unproblematic, which surprised me very much, as I myself already had two tape disc surgery behind me, he added.
Recently, he announced at RTL that the singer had apparently left the hospital after the operation "without drainage, without everything".
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is very well known in the artistic environment.
He had operated on actress Marie Trintignant, a few days before her death in Vilnius, in a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine, where he practiced at the time.
In 2007, he had also operated on actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to absorb a hematoma after a brain hemorrhage.
However, he is also a doctor with a dubious reputation, who has already been convicted several times for unsuccessful operations and not to forget, for tax evasion and fraud.
Me Olivier Metzner, lawyer for the House of Doctors, called him "a man without scruples" who has "regular responsibility" before the House Board and is "everything other than recommended".
After a few days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux gave a statement on Friday about his lawyer, Me David Koubbi.
He explained that the intervention would have been "perfect" and the postoperative investigations would have been "normal".
The operation "did not cause bleeding and therefore does not require drainage," he added.
In any case, the tour of the singer, whose health problems have been going on since late summer, seems to be in question.
It is quite clear that it is a little too short for a continuation of the tour on January 8 (in Amiens), Mr. Camus said.
The party alliance UDF (Union pour la démocratie française) becomes energetic and calls on the Nouveau Centre party to stop using its seal
The party alliance, which is supervised by François Bayrou's MoDem Party, on Friday, on the side of the President of the Nouveau Centre, Hervé Morin, has not reacted strongly to this document in response to an attempt to take over of the seal, which was once founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing's party.
Hervé Morin publicly announces his intention to take over this UDF seal, as he believes that François Bayrou would not be worthy of defending this political legacy after he gave his left hand.
The defense minister, whose party partner is the UMP, by the way, wanted to confirm this strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the NC.
To reaffirm his efforts, he had received the support of Member Hervé de Charette (formerly UMP, now NC), who claimed ownership of the UDF brand, since he was the first to apply for this brand at the "Institut national de la propriété industrielle" in 2004.
However, the office of the UDF party alliance supervised by François Bayrous’ friends broke the silence and made it clear that they did not give up and placed the minister and deputy under threat of prosecution a period of time, giving them the right of Mark over this seal and not giving them any more respect.
You have made numerous statements in recent days that you would propose to your political movement to take over the UDF seal <0x2B><0x2B>, the Alliance of Parties wrote in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 office members, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez’s Art Center, the Jean-Dem Party.
You probably also thought you would have the right to print the name of this movement <0x2B>Nouveau centre<0x2B>, the slogan <0x2B> of today’s UDF <0x2B>, on their political material as well as on the home page of your website.
As you know, you do not have any right to use this seal, the UDF office declared and urges the party NC to "immediately remove the mention of the name UDF from all materials and from (their) website".
In addition, Hervé de Charette was required "to transfer the trademark's ownership rights to its legal entitlements".
If you refuse to do so, we will file a lawsuit against you in order to respect the law and to defend the legitimate rights of the UDF members, the signatories warned.
In their letter, they emphasize that "UDF" has been a full-fledged political movement since 1978, and recall that Morin and his friends have "taken the choice" to leave this 2007 to establish a competing movement, as others had already done in 2002 to form the "UMP" party.
According to the signatories, the New Centre Party has no right to use the UDF seal (Union pour la démocratie française).
They also recall that the last Congress of the UDF in 2007 approved the three-year membership of the MoDem Party and the establishment of a business unit to defend "the material and moral interests" of the movement founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As far as Hervé de Charette is concerned, the office continues, "at the time he applied for the brand name, he was no longer a member of the UDF" but of the UMP for three years.
He profits in a scandalous and fraudulent way from the lack of the acronym UDF to do so for himself.
Furthermore, remember that this recklessness is the best way to turn into a crime, and ironize the strategy of the NC: "It seems more useful to us in politics as well as in life to make a name for ourselves, rather than trying to make a name for ourselves".
Case Liliane Bettencourt: François-Marie Banier sentenced for exploiting weakness
The court of Nanterre on Friday decided to judge the artist François-Marie Banier to determine whether he, as the daughter of billionaire Liliane Bettencourt, has exploited a weak moment of the eighty-year-old to take a part in her treachery.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his star photos, will have to face trial on April 15 and 16, 2010 for exploiting weakness, a crime punishable by a maximum of three years’ imprisonment and a fine of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>375,000.
This decision means that in fact there will be a process in this affair worthy of the saga of one of the richest families in France, in which mother and daughter fatten and at the same time have the tails of the cosmetic period L'Oréal in their hands.
However, the 15th Criminal Chamber ordered a medical examination of the 87-year-old Liliane Bettencourt, which is conducted jointly by three doctors.
The heir and principal shareholder of L'Oréal has so far refused to undergo such an investigation, especially not under the conditions presented by the Prosecutor's Office of Nanterre during the investigations.
The doctors appointed on Friday will present a report before March 10, 2010, in which you will clearly state whether and at what time Liliane Bettencourt may have been in a state of weakness.
I think she will undergo these investigations.
I will speak to her, Mrs Bettencourt's lawyer, Me Georges Kiejman, said after the hearing.
As for the lawyer of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, Me Olivier Metzner, he is very satisfied with the court’s decision.
This is an excellent news (...). The opinion will prove that he (Banier) manipulated this old lady, which you have to protect, he affirmed.
For two years, Liliane Bettencourt’s only daughter has filed a criminal lawsuit against François-Marie Banier, a photographer and all-round artist, accusing him of exploiting her mother’s weakness for years in order to make donations of a total of one billion euros or to make a bankruptcy.
For her part, Liliane Bettencourt has always refused to be manipulated by the photographer she sees as a long-time friend.
Although the court had to examine the admissibility of the lawsuit filed by Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers, the plaintiffs of the lawyers on Friday led to a large family scandal.
Liliane Bettencourt’s lawyer has written three letters sent by her client to her notary (1999, 2003, and 2005) in which she wrote that she mistrusted the husband of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers.
According to her lawyer, Liliane Bettencourt added: "You could please explain to my daughter that I have written to Banier for fifteen years, once or twice a day.
I've never been able to talk to Françoise since she got married."
The State Prosecutor’s Office of Nanterre once again considers that the applicant did not have the right to respond in this way, mainly because a district judge has rejected her request in recent days to initiate a judicial defence proceedings against her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "is fully legal, not under protection and has no foreword.
No one has the right to act in their place,” Marie-Christine Daubigny, the prosecutor’s office, said.
The court has now decided to issue a judgment after the trial on the admissibility of Ms Bettencourt-Meyers has taken place.
Manager Revolution or the End of Strategic Early Education?
If nothing changes in the leadership of the great French companies, our struggle for the development of economic intelligence has been for nothing.
For more than a decade, the attitude of the management of large companies in relation to its employees, the position of the companies vis-à-vis the consumers before the marketing revolution said: It is for the staff to join "values" determines the best as it was previously on the consumer products from the technicians to who at the stand.
By putting the customer at the center of the companies, the marketing revolution has given the strategies of conquering the markets in place ... although the authoritarian temptation products separately impose factors of customer preferences again and again regularly!
Demobilization of employees can lead to a deadly demoralization.
The suicides at France Telecom, PSA or Renault are just the tip of a much larger phenomenon that particularly affects employees.
This demobilization has a negative impact on the development of all the intellectual functions of the company, especially those of R&D and, more importantly, those of economic intelligence.
In fact, the IE (Intelligence Economique <0x3D> Economic Intelligence) demands "proactive action and a forward-looking approach from all parties involved"; it demands from employees a commitment that is totally contrary to the instructions of authoritarian management.
That is why we call for a business revolution that would consist in putting employees equally at the center of the company’s concerns next to the customers.
The Very Conditional Benefits of Internal Opinion Surveys
Will the internal opinion polls, as the questionnaire submitted by Orange to its payees, spark this revolution in terms of management practice?
I'm not afraid, unfortunately.
“First of all, because I was able to find that, in the face of a new situation, after many circumstances, it finally comes to do first of all what it has always done.
Also because authoritarianism – one of the pathologies of power – increases in proportion to the significance of its own failure.
And finally, because most leaders have a very simplified understanding of human behavior.
Outstanding from the major engineering schools, their interpretation of psychology is mechanistic.
They take over the old behavioral theory, recently reactivated by American "neurology" and unknowingly widespread by research institutes and by the media.
Thus, and by suggesting that it is possible to activate the "lever" (sic) to engage employees, a recent Le Figaro.fr survey by Ipsos strengthens the leaders in an attitude towards a mechanical control system that is unsuitable for today's world.
Identify and measure the mobilization factors
Instead, a business revolution necessary for the smooth functioning of modern enterprises requires the assumption of a definitive view of human behavior.
It consists in integrating a fundamental protocol into any management consideration or practice: for the payees, the commitment to the company is only possible if it clearly appears as a means to realize part of its dreams, ambitions and projects.
Currently, only the studies from multifunctional analysis adopt this concept of employee motivation.
These studies have shown that they assess their company based on a predetermined Doxa, which allows them to assess through their perceived image of the company what it offers them to achieve their life goals.
Thanks to the identification and measurement of these mobilization factors, the company’s executives can control, predict and predict their “social performance” and re-place their Human Resource Management in the right place.
This creates a fertile soil that is beneficial for the coherent development of robust and efficient economic intelligence.
Oslo’s Speech: “The Fair War” Brings Obama Praise From the Right
U.S. rights welcomed Barack Obama’s speech in Oslo on Friday and were pleased that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize had defended the concept of “just war” against the enemies of the United States.
The Conservatives, who had mocked Obama’s award on October 9, applauded the president’s speech, following the example of former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin in the 2008 election.
I liked what he said, Palin explained the right-wing face of the Republican Party in the newspaper USA Today, adding that she had herself spoken the topic of a “sometimes necessary” war in her memoirs published.
Of course, war is the last thing I think the Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
We have to stop the terrorists down there, she says.
Obama, who has inherited two wars from his predecessor George W. Bush, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, has been trying to justify the use of violence in Oslo on Thursday; a way to explain his decision from nine days ago to 30,000 additional troops to Afghanistan.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, represented the opinion that the president had done "very good work" in Oslo.
I found that the speech was really very good, congratulated the former President of the House of Representatives, who particularly recognized the reference to "the existence of evil in the world" in Obama's words.
In some parts, I have felt this speech to be historical, Ginrich, who was interviewed in the radio broadcast "The Takeaway".
The former deputy, considered by some as a possible candidate for the Republican nomination for the 2012 presidential election, said he was pleased to see a “president of the Left” who reminded the members of the Nobel Committee that they “would not be free if they did not exist” and a prize for peace.
For Michael Gerson, former writer of George W. Bush and now editor of the Washington Post, Obama has held "a very American speech".
In addition to representing himself as a “cosmopolitan,” he “always does it,” he “speaked like an American president” when he pointed out that the Europeans “live like a security bubble they didn’t create themselves and don’t do much to protect them,” Gerson said.
Among the few, unconvinced rights, former UN ambassador John Bolton, a Bush-era falcon, described the speech on the National Review Online website as "dull, high-end and uninspired".
To the President’s left, Democratic representative Dennis Kucinich is concerned about how Barack Obama defends the withdrawal of the armed forces.
If one packs the war under the cover of the judiciary, the massacre of the innocents can easily be justified, he warns.
However, the media of the moderate left remains on the side of the president.
The Los Angeles Times, still of the opinion that the Nobel Prize was awarded to Obama early, called the speech itself a "monumental work" for a speaker like him, known for his talent.
The talk in Oslo “offers a run-off plan to control international decisions against conflict, poverty and repression,” the California daily said.
The New York Times believes that Obama "proclaimed the necessary discourse" and describes his speech as "dark and exemplary at the same time."
Long-distance driver: Three marathons for an agreement that secures supplies for Christmas
After a three-week negotiation marathon, the unions of the road union and the TLF - the only employers' organization that remained until the end - reached an agreement on Friday night that put an end to the strike order and the threatening heavy supply pass for Christmas.
At the signing session on Friday night, the Secretary of State for Transport, Dominique Bussereau, "welcomed" the agreement, which was initiated on Wednesday morning after several weeks of negotiations.
After a second night of negotiations, the negotiators split up early Friday morning in hopes of signing the deal early in the morning.
And this despite the fact that the three employers’ associations (FNTR, Unostra and OTRE) had left the meeting.
However, it took more than six hours from the beginning of the meeting at 11:00 to the conclusion of the agreement and it was not until 18:00 that the agreement was signed.
The conflict "had caused a lot of damage to the company" and "it was to be feared that it would affect holidays at the end of the year," said Bussereau.
The agreement provides for a wage increase of 4% for the lowest wages (local and regional road transport) and 2.9% for the highest groups of wages (international transport).
The hourly rate for workers with the lowest salaries increases from <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>8.72 to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>9.06.
"It's not much, but we'll start small," said Patrice Clos (FO).
The activists are now being told not to block the supply centers anymore.
“However, there will probably always be some counter-attacks that are not satisfied with the agreement,” he added.
TLF chairman Philippe Grillot spoke of a "good agreement", although "it was difficult to accept these wage increases in the face of international competition".
According to him, the increase is <0xE2><0x82><0xAC> 170 per month for the lowest and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC> 100 to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC> 120 for the high wage groups.
"This agreement is based on common sense and respect towards employees," said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) spoke of "a historic agreement".
Richard Jaubert (CGT) commented on "an acceptable compromise".
The agreement also provides for an increase of 3 % in travel costs and the maintenance of the total road transport statute in the first half of 2010, which will in particular enable the 13th monthly salary and the modernisation of the collective agreements to be addressed.
M. Bussereau recalled that "the reduction of taxes for employers of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million" was the subject of an amendment by the government to the Bill of Amended Finances for 2009, which was adopted by the National Assembly on the night of Thursday to Friday.
The government calls for an "identical" vote from the Senate.
The signature of the TLF allows the agreement to be applied first to the companies affiliated to this organisation and then to be applied to the whole profession in the event of an extension by the Minister of Labour.
This will be the case "in the shortest time", said the bus company.
The opposition of employers’ associations can only delay the procedure.
The association FNTR denounced a "fraudable trade" because the 100 million euros "were already promised to the sector to offset some of the carbon tax".
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to negotiate as quickly as possible, but not on the basis of a joint analysis, but in order not to expel the whole essence on the upcoming Christmas days, the Unostra lamented.
For the association Otre, the agreement threatens "to stifle a large grave for small and medium-sized enterprises in the industry in the next 12 months".
Line RER A: Disruptions this weekend, trade unions dissatisfied with RATP proposals
The disturbances on the RER A line, the largest high-speed network in France for the large area of Paris and <0xC3><0x8E>le-de-France, continued over the weekend, while a meeting on Friday, the 2nd day of strike between the trade unions and the management of the RATP (independent Paris personnel transport management) continued.
On this important shopping weekend before Christmas, there were no trains between 10:00 and 20:00.On the central route (between La Défense and Nation), only one of two trains and only one of four trains was ready for use outside the central route.
The connection to the SNCF trains was interrupted in Nanterre Prefecture, forcing the passengers to relocate.
The Galeries Lafayette shopping chain, which counts 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that "RATP is trying to connect the big stores in traffic technology".
The line RER A passes through the Parisian ballroom from west to east.
The RATP section connects the towns of Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre as well as Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, about one of two trains was scheduled for the main traffic time, and almost none during the poor traffic time.
As already on Thursday, there was no crowding on the railroads, as the inhabitants of <0xC3><0x8E>le-de-France had adjusted to the situation.
So early in the morning, the train station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was far less crossed than otherwise, mainly due to the lack of high school students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, an engineer (29), explained that he would have been "up an extra hour and a half earlier to get to work on time".
The SNCF, which had planned to take care of the passengers by staff and law enforcement, pointed out that there were no gaps at the Saint-Lazare railway station.
The trains operated by the SNCF on the line RER A or towards Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or drove via the Saint-Lazare railway station to ensure the connection to the metro.
On Saturday and Sunday, major meetings of the strikers were held again, during which the results were reviewed, which the associations had classified as "courageous" after meeting with the leadership on Friday afternoon.
The RER Managing Director proposed the specific development of a protocol for the RER A line with regard to all relevant aspects, working hours, careers, etc.
But this is not what drivers want, according to Thierry Garon (South), they demand a long-debted wage increase.
The CGT was outraged that the RATP itself puts its salary proposals in brackets and stressed that the leadership is "not able to solve a problem while it was also possible for the long-distance drivers and the SNCF."
The RATP clarified that a reunion was scheduled for Monday to be held to “examine the working conditions in full.”
This also shows the associations that the company "ignoring the weekend drivers".
In the morning about 150 drivers visited the establishment of a committee in Paris.
Once again, it was the leadership’s top who, to date, refused any discussion during the strike, and a meeting followed a calming of the situation.
On Tuesday, the conflict threatened to expand to the RER B line after a preliminary announcement by Unsa and Independents.
The associations demand a salary allowance of 120 (Unsa) to 150 euros, of which 30 euros are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud, Indépendants). In addition, they complain of the deterioration of working conditions on this route, on which millions of travellers are travelling daily.
Drivers of the RER line, who have years of professional experience, receive a gross salary of 2,200 to 2,700 euros as well as a pay allowance of 600 to 650 euros for layer services as well as sun and holidays.
Turkish Constitutional Court dissolves pro-Kurdish party. Decision with serious consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court on Friday announced the dissolution of the country’s pro-Kurdish main party; a decision that immediately followed angry demonstrations in the Kurdish community in the southeast of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision threatens to greatly complicate the work of the government, which is trying to reach out to the Kurdish community in order to put an end to the conflict that has been going on for 25 years.
The "Party for a Democratic Society" (DTP) was disbanded as it had become "a place for activities detrimental to the independence of the state and its indivisible unity", said President of the Constitutional Court Hasim Kiliç four days after the ruling against the press.
According to Kiliç, the decision would have been unanimously taken by 11 judges, with a majority of seven votes required to enforce the resolution. He also pointed out that 37 of the party’s leaders, including the chairman of the chairman, Ahmet Turk, and the parliamentarian Tuluk, were elected by the president of the party.
Furthermore, the judge announced the abolition of parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Turks and Tugluk, as well as the confiscation of the party’s goods.
The DTP now has 21 seats in Parliament (out of 550).
The leaders of the party expressed their opinion that parliamentarians would rather leave parliament than speak as impartial parliamentarians.
The decision was followed by a procedure initiated in 2007 by the Turkish federal court's prosecutor Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya, who accused the DTP of following the "instructions" of the Workers' Party of Kurdistan (PKK), which is seen by Ankara and many other countries as a terrorist organization.
Numerous observers believe that the DTP is the legal political window of the PKK rebels.
The party ensures that it has "no connection" to the PKK, but refuses to call it a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate.
The Constitutional Court’s ruling is working between the government, which is striving to counter the Kurdish community and propose a series of measures to strengthen the rights of Kurds in order to defeat the support of the PKK by the Kurds and end the conflict.
The leaders of the DTP confirm that a resolution could lead to a resurgence of tensions in Southeast Anatolia, where numerous demonstrations against the conditions of detention of PKK chief Abdullah <0xC3><0x96>calan led to clashes with the police in recent weeks.
Since the court’s announcement, thousands of protesters have gathered in front of the premises of the DTP in the millionth city of Diyarbakir in the southeast, which is predominantly populated by Kurds.
The police deployed tear gas grenades and water launchers as the protesters began to throw Molotow cocktails and stones.
Hundreds of people also protested in Istanbul.
According to the ruling, Turkey assumed that the court's decision "will deepen the despair".
"Turkey cannot clarify this (Kurdish, anm. d. editorial) question by means of a party ban," he told the press.
The government, consisting of a party that emerged from the Islamist movement, also regretted the decision.
"We are in principle opposed to the closure of the parties.
This does not solve the problems,” says Energy Minister Taner Yildiz.
“This decision is a torpedoing of the democratic opening which has been promoted by the government,” said Ahmet Island, a political market observer.
"Obviously one can rely on a reaction of the PKK," he added.
On Thursday, the PKK reported an attack that killed seven soldiers in northern Turkey three days earlier, one of the most brutal attacks in recent months.
The snowstorm may come
A really crispy winter, that’s what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
Not because he wants to harass citizens, says the FES winter service manager.
But so that his employees can try and master the entire vehicle technology.
According to meteorologists, this could be the first time this has happened.
More than 330 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to take care of snow and ice.
In this case, the FES proceeds according to a precise plan.
As soon as it snows in Frankfurt and the temperatures are below zero degrees, 20 so-called A-streets will be driven by large-street vehicles, Brauburger explains.
This includes, for example, main traffic and transit roads such as the Neuen Weg and the Hanauer Landstraße.
But also firefighting, <0xC3><0x96>PNV routes, pedestrian zones and trails with traps, such as the Atzelbergstraße.
The FES service starts at 3 a.m.
The approximately 1040 kilometres should be dispersed in a maximum of three hours with wet salt, which is better adhered to.
That is why the FES starts at three o'clock at night, "so that the routes are free until professional traffic starts".
It will be difficult when it snows at 7.30 a.m.
Then we have a problem, says the winter service manager, "because then no one is ready to make room for the stray vehicles".
Only after that, if it does not snow further, are supply and unlocking roads, including Rat-Beil-Straße, on the line.
The last priority is side and side roads.
There will be complaints, white Brauburger.
At five o’clock in the morning, the FES’ pedestrians are on their way, danger points and transitions are prioritized.
For all bike paths the FES can usually not take care of.
There is a special service in Frankfurt that keeps an eye on the bridges mainly from 22:00 to 4.30 p.m., says Brauburger.
Since there is a rapid smoothness on this, as soon as the temperature falls below two degrees, the scatter is moving.
If necessary, it will also be called by the police.
The cradle of the dinosaurs
Tawa hallae looked like many other meat-eating dinosaurs: The two-metre-long and 1.50-metre-long animal ran on two strong back legs, had an elongated skull with sharp, curved teeth, short arms with silk claws and a long tail.
If the species had lived a few million years later, it would have been nothing special.
But Tawa hallae was one of the first dinosaurs with these body features, reports Sterling Nesbitt of the University of Texas in Austin and colleagues in Thursday's journal Science.
The animal lived about 215 million years ago in present-day New Mexico, which was then located in a dry zone of the supercontinent Pangaea on the equator.
Tawa opens a new window to the early evolution of dinosaurs, Nesbitt says.
It shows us a lot about the kinship relationships, the spread and the characteristics of the early dinosaurs.
In 2006, Nesbitt and other palaeontologists began excavating the Ghost Ranch in northern New Mexico.
We have sometimes found a dozen dinosaur bones in one day, which is unprecedented for trias deposits, team member Randall Irmis of the Utah Museum of Natural History reports.
Some of the bones quickly identified the researchers as a new species.
During the excavation, they collected the remains of a total of five individuals.
Fund confirms theories about Dino early history
The name "Tawa" comes from the sun god of the Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt, it is an exceptional finding: "Dinosaur fossils from the trias are extremely rare, usually only single fragments are found."
Other dinosaur experts do not necessarily share the enthusiasm.
This finding is not particularly spectacular, but it confirms some theories about the early history of dinosaurs, says Martin Sander of the University of Bonn.
According to the current theory, dinosaurs first appeared about 230 million years ago.
However, many of the oldest fossils are incomplete, which is why the assignment of these Ur dinos is mostly controversial.
For example, the experts debate when the eggs split into their three main developmental lines: the meat-eating theropods, which later included the tyrannosaurus rex, the velociraptor and also the birds, which were known as the "long-tailed" freurissaurus, and the four-legged orchiotides, the saurophans, and their verophans.
According to the analysis of Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa hallae is an original theropod.
It has an interesting combination of primitive and progressive properties, says Nesbitt.
At the skull of Tawa hallae, for example, the researchers found clues to airbags, as well as the descendants of the theropods, the birds.
Thanks to the airbags, the respiration of birds is more efficient than that of mammals.
At Tawa hallae, the bones of the spine were also apparently partially filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive theropod with airbags, says Randall Irmis.
Since the related line of the giant sauropods later also possessed airbags and lightweight bones, it is likely that the common ancestor of the two groups had already brought about this useful innovation.
At least three migration waves to North America
Because the most primitive dinosaurs known to date lived in South America, researchers conclude that the eggs first appeared there.
Accordingly, the three development lines separated early and spread from South America across all parts of the earth, which at that time still formed a single landmass as a supercontinent of Pangaea.
The team, along with Tawa hallae, found the remains of two other, not particularly closely related theropods.
The three cannot be descended from a common, immigrant ancestor, the researchers argue.
We believe there were at least three migration waves to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, a co-author of the science study.
Of course, there are contradictions as well.
An even older species, Silesaurus, which belongs to a sister group of dinosaurs, lived in today’s Poland, says Bonner palaeontologist Martin Sander.
In his opinion, a distorted picture could result, because in South America simply a particularly large number of primitive dinosaur fossils have been preserved, while on other continents hardly anything can be found.
How the dinosaurs managed to evolve from a relatively rare sideline of the reptilian strain to the dominant landworms of the Middle Ages is still enigmatic.
During the Trias, the dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other reptiles, for example with the ancestors of today’s crocodiles and fly saurys, and with numerous other ostriches.
By the end of the Trias, the dinosaurs spread all over the world and developed many new species, while the kinship at the border from the Trias to the Jura died out.
Success story didn't last forever
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
There could have been a mass death that the dinosaurs accidentally survived, but the other reptiles did not.
Or the dinosaurs were better adapted so they could beat the competition out of the field.
But the success story didn’t last forever.
150 million years later, a meteorite invasion of a group of animals bloomed, which had also evolved in the Triassic, and has since been enduring a shadow creature: the mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the signatories are international.
Professors from the University of Toronto stand on it, the University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna or from Berkeley in California.
There are lecturers from Naples, from Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
The police clearance of the occupied casino at Frankfurt Goethe University is hitting waves worldwide.
278 professors and teachers from Goethe University, as well as from universities throughout Germany, Europe and North and South America, are solidarizing with the protesting students on the Westend campus.
In a statement written in German and English, they "disapproved" of the police intervention caused by the Bureau.
University President Werner Müller-Estler had cleared the building occupied by students and lecturers in the educational strike last week because walls and artworks had been lubricated.
Five students were injured in the incident.
The damages, the signatories judge, did not justify "the violent dissolution of self-organized teaching events of students and teachers by a police command".
Cleaning constitutes an "unacceptable interference" in the freedom of research and teaching.
The exclusive focus on vandalism serves "the delegitimization and criminalization of the protest" and departs from the contents.
The Bureau has withdrawn from the necessary discourse.
The professors demand the immediate cessation of criminal prosecution.
The majority of the occupiers did not support the damage, it says.
Protest legitimized
The youth of the Verdi trade union and the German trade union union are also solidarizing with the students.
The protest is a legitimate expression of growing concern for its own future, says Verdi country youth secretary Alexander Klein.
Hessen’s Science Minister Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU) defended the unpresident’s and the police’s actions.
We are grateful to the President.
Destruction and occupation are totally unacceptable means, she said in a current hour on Thursday in the Wiesbaden Landtag.
We have an understanding of the protest, but no understanding of vandalism, according to CDU MP Peter Beuth.
The opposition factions SPD, Green and Left saw this differently.
The CDU is taking painted walls as a pretext to criminalize the protest, said Janine Wissler (Linke).
Instead of dealing with the students’ arguments and demands, you have cleaned up.
The Left has filed an application calling on the Minister of the Interior to report on the police deployment.
New Silicon Valley
For many years it was considered a secret city, inaccessible to western visitors.
Selenograd, one of ten districts of Moscow’s capital, was a strictly guarded site for secret weapons research in the Soviet Union.
Today, the municipality with its 216,000 inhabitants, 37 kilometers from the center of Moscow, is considered to be the "Russian Silicon Valley".
Important research and production sites for micro and nanoelectronics are located here.
Since September 2008, representatives of Selenograd had contacts with the Riedberg Science Centre in Frankfurt - with the Union Institutes and the companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There were several mutual visits and on Wednesday, Selenograd and Riedberg signed a "protocol for closer cooperation" in Frankfurt.
The Moscow vice mayor Yuri Rosljak and the prefect Anatoly Smirnov of Selenograd led the Russian delegation, for Frankfurt signed planning degenerator Edwin Schwarz.
In 2010, representatives of the FIZ and small and medium-sized enterprises of the scientific focus will travel to Selenograd for a seminar.
Scientific Interchanges
It is a continuous scientific exchange.
But it is also about economic relations.
Companies of the FIZ will be allowed to step on the growing Russian market.
Conversely, Russian science firms want to collect orders in Germany.
Selenograd is the seat of major Russian research institutes and companies.
This includes, for example, the Moscow Institute of Electronics Engineering, the large companies Sitronics and Rossijskaja Elektronika.
The municipality was founded in 1958 as the so-called "Socialist Plan City" for arms research.
Selenograd (literally translated "Green City") was named after the wooded hilly landscape in which the research facilities are embedded.
Stuttgart Bremsklotz
The dimension of Stuttgart 21 cannot be set high enough.
For the supporters of the project, it is simply "the new heart of Europe".
Right. S21 is much more than deepening a railway station, more than a monstrous construction project that will plunge the city of Baden-Württemberg’s capital into a healthy construction site chaos for a decade.
Stuttgart 21 was born out of the spirit of the 1980s.
Main railway stations with rails ending in the middle of the city were then regarded as 19th-century traffic fossils, which acted like brake pads of modern rail transport, as it once took a huge amount of time to retract locomotives from the rear to the front.
Get in, hold it short, keep going - that's what it's supposed to be.
And that’s why the main stations should disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a transit station, which is located about halfway between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava - hence the slogan of "the heart of Europe".
S21 is now actually being tackled, although the visions of the 80s have long been no longer compatible with reality.
Even highly ambitious planners have realized that in the Hessian and Bavarian cities it is almost inexpensive to implement the deepening.
Main railway stations, however, also have no entry and exit problems, since there are modern turntables with motor vehicles and steering wheels on both ends.
Still: Stuttgart 21 next to the ICE new construction route to Ulm is now being started.
Local and local politicians have implemented it.
The railway also carries the risks of the largest individual infrastructure project of the Republic of the taxpayers and not of the state corporations.
In urban terms, the project can still be justified in some ways.
A new urban space is being created, which - you believe the computer-generated graphics of the planners - will be equipped with a lot of greenery.
S21 is harmful to the rail transport system.
The transit station and the route extension are designed for passenger traffic, to which - typically in the 1980s - enormous growth was attributed.
At the time, there was no competition for low-cost airliners.
However, modern transport policy must first be about strengthening freight traffic, as rail transport is significantly more environmentally friendly than it is by truck on the road.
However, the new construction route is not suitable for freight trains due to heavy rises.
Even more serious is the fact that S21 indirectly tangents many other railway projects as well.
A total of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>6 billion is to be banned in Swabian.
That's the official number.
Experts consider 10 to 15 billion realistic.
It is clear that in the next decade, the money will be missing at other nodes and endpoints on the network.
A total of sixty major projects are on the list of the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the expansion of the 180-kilometer stretch through the Rhine Valley.
Since 1987 it has been built on the trail in the time-uptempo.
It would be urgent to press the tube right here.
But the S21 will act as a brake pad.
The Rhine Valley route becomes the bottleneck for international freight transport: in the heart of Europe.
The government is reviewing the verdict on the airport
The state government has left open in the Wiesbaden Landtag whether it will go against the ruling of the Hessian Administrative Court (VGH) on the night flight ban.
The CDU/FDP coalition has hired experts to legally review the more than 400-page VGH ruling, Economy Minister Dieter Posch (FDP) said.
The VGH in Kassel had on that day in writing reasoned that the country had to re-regulate the night flight ban in the event of the planned construction of the Northwest Landbahn at Frankfurt Airport.
Admission of 17 flights between 23 and 5 p.m., as envisaged by the state government, is not to be agreed with the protection of the population from nocturnal flight noise provided by law.
The coalition must decide by January 4 if it will go against the verdict.
The opposition criticized this postponement and urged the government’s representatives to give up a review at the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
SPD faction chief Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel called on the CDU and the FDP to return to their promises made before the election to a night flight ban, otherwise to be rated as a "wrongful word".
It's damn hard to keep his word, Greens chief Tarek Al-Wazir said in reference to the FDP election slogan "We keep the word".
Minister Posch rejected the accusation of Schäfer-Gümbel, that the state government was trying to get to their night flights with "treasure and trickery".
A thorough legal examination takes your time.
The coalition does not want to operate on the basis of a "quick first impression".
We need a more legal decision, Stefan Müller (FDP) said.
As they represent the opposition, his faction’s statements on the night flight ban have never been.
U.S. banks pay back aid
Crisis-stricken U.S. big banks are stripping off their state fences.
The Bank of America on Wednesday repaid a total of <0x24>45 billion (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>30 billion) in aid from the Tarp Bank Rescue Fund.
Citigroup also plans, according to a report by US broadcaster CNBC, to reimburse state aid.
The institutions want to get rid of the restrictions that have come with the acceptance of the money – such as the limitation on the payment of manager bonuses and the removal of high fees.
The Bank of America had been concerned about <0x24>19 billion in fresh cash from investors over hiring loans.
She took the remainder of the sum from her own cashier, which was well filled, among other things, by sales of shares.
Bank chief Kenneth Lewis thanked the U.S. taxpayer on Wednesday evening: The money injection has helped over a very difficult time.
The house had risen to the height of the financial crisis with the acquisition of investment bank Merrill Lynch.
Citigroup also wants to make money on the capital market in order to free itself from its liabilities to the state.
Already on Thursday, the U.S. bank could announce a roughly <0x24>20 billion increase in its capital, CNBC reported, calling for circles.
A Citigroup spokesperson did not want to speak.
In June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had already paid back their aid.
Quick choices
Then everything went quicker than thought.
Almost two weeks after the ZDF Board of Directors forced the current editor-in-chief Nikolaus Brenner out of office, the broadcaster can present a successor.
Last night, the committee wanted to vote on the staff.
Favorite was Peter Frey, head of the ZDF-Hauptstadtstudio in Berlin.
However, there was no confirmation from the broadcaster for this - officially in order not to advance the procedure.
However, it should also have played a role not to further harm ZDF-Intendent Markus Schacher, should this proposal also not be passed by the Board of Directors.
Frey, Schacher’s candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 members of the committee.
The outcome of the vote was not yet determined at the end of the drafting.
Two weeks ago, Schacher had failed in the board of directors with his proposal to extend the contract with Nikolaus Brenner for another five years.
Only seven members voted for Brenner, seven voted against him, but Brenner's election was a herb defeat for the sharks, one expected.
Because the majority of the Union in the board of directors had already signaled weeks before the election that Brenner would not confirm in office.
Organized was the resistance against the editor-in-chief of Hessian Prime Minister Roland Koch.
With the argument that among Brenner, the ZDF’s news broadcasts had lost to turn-on quotas, he refused another term of office of the highly regarded editor-in-chief.
Until shortly before the election, there were therefore protests in which the political influence on the ZDF was stifled.
Lastly, 35 state lawmakers intervened in the debate, who considered Koch’s approach as unconstitutional.
It didn't benefit from anything.
To the person
Peter Frey was born on 4 August 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogy and romance.
He then worked at the Southwest Radio and the Frankfurt Rundschau.
In 1983, Frey moved to the ZDF, initially to the "aujourd'hui-journal".
Subsequent stations: 1988 to 1990 personal speaker of the editor-in-chief; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; to 1998 head and moderator of the "morning magazine"; to 2001 head of the ZDF foreign policy; since then head of the ZDF capital studio.
The Greens announced a constitutional lawsuit following the election of Brenners, who was still elected as the journalist of the year by the industry magazine Medium magazine on Wednesday.
Koch’s counterpart in the board of directors, Rhineland-Pfalz Prime Minister Kurt Beck, said last week that countries should change the ZDF state treaty so that the candidate’s staff proposals cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
However, a withdrawal of party politicians from the supervisory bodies of the ZDF also ruled out Beck.
Brender's supposed successor Peter Frey had recommended himself to the board with a clever chess move - criticizing the board for it immediately after the Brender election.
Thanks to this evidence of journalistic independence, he was able to nominate both the head of the editor-in-chief without losing his face and to elect the board of directors without being suspected of raising a party member to office.
In party arithmetic, Frey is in any case attributed to the left-wing liberals.
Study is dismantled
Shared success for students: After a year of education strike, the Ministers of Culture of the countries finally headed in: at a meeting of Ministers of Culture and Rectors of Higher Education, both sides agreed to improve the study conditions for Bachelor and Master.
In the future, students should be able to manage their studies as well.
In particular, they agreed to reduce the test loads: in principle, each study module is intended to be completed with only one test.
In addition, the workload of students is to be checked and "a realistic and decisive level" is to be ensured.
Politics and universities also want to simplify the recognition of exams between universities within and outside Germany.
The countries undertook to make common structural requirements for bachelor’s and master’s degree programs more flexible.
There should also be no derogation from national regulations.
Less exams
Since the beginning of the student protests in June, ministers of cult and university rectors have been holding the winged word of better studyability in their mouths.
This is the first time it has been filled with concrete content.
The so-called accreditation board decided to partially drastically reduce the number of exams: "Each module usually closes with only one exam," says a 30-page paper to partially re-regulate admission of courses.
With the "significant reduction in the burden of examination," the chairman of the accreditation council, Reinhold Grimm, said, "a failure development that significantly impaired the study feasibility would be offered."
In addition, the "studyability" is expected to be "the decisive criterion" in designing in the future.
Modules such as content should be "strengthened to verify" whether "unnecessary inputs of students in the choice of
Events would be avoided.
The students would have "the right to receive playrooms, to enable and promote their own initiative".
The rules are intended to apply for the admission of new courses, but also for the review of existing courses of study.
These must be "reaccredited" every five years – which means that it will take until 2015 until all courses are reviewed.
There are 10 national accreditation agencies responsible for this, which are subject to the accreditation board set up by the countries.
In October, the Ministers of Culture urged the countries to "emphasize" their influence on the agencies so that the filling is not too large and the testing regime is not too strict.
Universities and vocational schools have already agreed with the national ministries on appropriate measures in individual federal states.
As the only country so far, Rhineland-Palatinate has allocated additional funds for the further development of the Bologna process.
From the money, the universities are primarily designed to establish tutoring programs and strengthen study counselling, as well as exam and foreign offices.
Countries and universities want to spend <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>10 million on this.
In early 2010, the government wants to introduce a novel of the Higher Education Act to Parliament.
After that, only one test is required for the completion of a study model.
The curriculum is designed to be more flexible, in addition to ensuring the recognition of certificates of performance at other universities and facilitating access to the Master.
By the end of next year, all courses in the country will be checked for their study feasibility.
On Thursday, the government and the opposition had again disputed the study conditions in the country.
In addition to praise, however, there was criticism of the decisions.
The Federal Board of the Juso Higher Education Groups demanded that the design of the education policy should no longer be "closed doors" of ministers and higher education directors in the future.
At the latest, after the educational strikes, students should now also "speak a word" as affected.
The future academics were supported by Margret Wintermantel, President of the Conference of Higher Education Rectors (HRK): “We need the experience of the students,” she said at a meeting with the Ministers of Culture with whom the HRK advises on a joint reform paper.
The Union of Education and Science (GEW) did not go far enough: it demands a legal claim that allows every graduate with a bachelor’s degree to access a further master’s degree.
On the other hand, the countries must ensure that there are sufficient Master’s degrees with the best possible study conditions available for today’s generation of undergraduate students tomorrow, according to GEW board member Andreas Keller.
Countries need to hire significantly more teachers.
However, the Ministers of Culture did not comment on free access to the Master.
More than a footnote to Herta Müller
Entering Germany and exiting it is almost no control..." is the starting line of a poem by the lyricist Werner Söllner, in which he thematicizes the arrival experience of a dissident who won freedom but at the same time lost his language space.
Werner Söllner, born in 1951 in the Romanian Banat, first worked as a German and English teacher in Bucharest and later as a lecturer in a children’s book publishing house, before moving to Frankfurt in 1982.
Söllner has been awarded various Literature Awards, in 1993 he held the legendary Frankfurt poetry lectures at Goethe University, and since 2002 he has been the head of the Hessian Literature Forum at the Mouson Tower in Frankfurt.
He provided considerable extra-literacy during a meeting in Munich last Tuesday, which focused on "German literature in Romania in the mirror and mirror of its security acts".
Visibly insecure and embarrassed, Söllner gave a statement in which he agreed to his cooperation as IM for the Romanian secret service Securitate, among others, Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer.
Together with some of the attendees, Söllner had received the German Language Prize in 1989.
The recruitment attempts would have started badly, first in 1971.
I'm, Söllner concluded, "so someone who hasn't defended himself against security intimidation attempts enough."
The lyricist Werner Söllner is IM Walter.
Almost at the same time as the Nobel Peace Prize for Herta Müller and their unprecedented literary confrontation with the mechanisms of dictatorial rule, the literature scene, and in particular the community of German authors from Romania, is shaken by a case that shakes the grounds and the overwhelming power of a political system.
Werner Söllner is, as far as we know, not only a perpetrator, but also a victim.
In his security records, IM Walter played a role, according to Söllner’s confession by literary scientist Michael Markel, referring to the positive influence of IM Walter for him.
He has "exhausted" him in all difficult points for him at the time, says Markel.
It is a moral necessity for him to make this remark.
Söllner’s statement was unexpected in the form and in front of this audience, but not surprisingly, the confession of a former dissident and his cooperation with the Romanian intelligence service.
Germany had been a cozy reserve for security spiders, Herta Müller had already written in July at the time after reading her own 914-page document.
The people involved, it may be suspected, are speculated and in some cases may have known which clarity was hidden behind the nicknames Sorin, Voicu and even Walter.
Unlike in the case of the very procedural inspection of the Stasi files in this country, the handling of the backlogs of security surveillance is still very widespread.
Systematic enlightenment has been pushed back and hampered in recent years.
One of the Birthler National Council for the Revision of Security Acts (CNSAS) was established in 1999, but the issuance of the documents has been rather sluggish ever since.
It is only since 2005 that there is a law that regulates the administration of the files.
That the influence of former security members in Romania is still very large, according to the announcement of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller, an interview in which a former security chief from Temesvar declined to comment on the winner.
She has a psychosis, after all, she was only interviewed once.
The infamy of power meant to be able to express itself in the form of freedom of expression.
Certainly, in the case of Söllner, as so often in connection with hidden guilt, inevitable questions arise.
The special reaction of the listeners to Söllner’s confession makes it hope that the continuation of this chapter will be determined by the urge of knowledge rather than by guilt and shame.
For the Genesis of Herta Müller’s work, which received the Nobel Prize yesterday, it is more than a footnote.
Saturation Attachment of the Champions League
It seemed as if there was just an adrenaline-dressed outdoor waiter from a very nice Christmas party, on which a sports item manufacturer Goodies had distributed, when the new VfB coach Christian Gross accompanied an orange plastic bag of the equipment.
The man with the distinctive smoothness allowed himself to drive because of the city still alien to him.
Otherwise he would have been able to drive himself – alcohol wasn’t in the game, and the 55-year-old drunk was just as little.
It was a pleasant evening, but tomorrow the work will go on.
Or just go right away.
In the words of the Swiss pledged three days earlier: "We have reached the eighth final", namely in the Champions League thanks to the 3:1 victory against Unirea Urziceni from Romania, "but we must not be blinded by the success: it will be a fierce fight against the defeat."
The "much more important task" is coming on Sunday.
Then it is necessary to repeat the performance of the Kings in the daily league in Mainz.
And the weakness completely revealed again after the rapid three gates by Marica (5th), Täsch (8th) and Pogrebnyak (11th).
Auslosung
The Champions League Eighth Final (16/17. <0x2B> 23/24 February/ 9/10. <0x2B> 16/17. March) will be unveiled in Nyon on December 18.
So the joy of the fulminant state of the Babbel successor remained.
Not only in the case of the alleged savior, who had given the uninsured Stuttgart professional confidence, willingness to work and joy to play in a short time.
I approached the players and told them to think about their strengths, and I stopped them to be braver, explained Soulklempner Gross, the recipe for success that sounded so simple, but hadn’t had any more effect under therapist Babbel.
He has uncovered some magic, Babbel supporter Jens Lehmann admits, "when a new impulse comes in football, sometimes things happen that you would not have thought possible."
And Sami Khedira, who, after a week of injury breaks due to his dynamism, advanced to the best player on the pitch, tried to describe the detected "phenomena" with the verbal "fresh wind" and the way the new supervisor works: "He is a man who understands and understands Disziplit.
That’s what we need in the current situation.”
Under Babbel it was obviously lacking.
VfB Stuttgart is not over the mountain yet, sports director Horst Heldt warns
The VfB Stuttgart, however, needs constancy above all.
Like Gross, players and managers were also careful not to overestimate the victory against a weakened and completely overrated defense of the Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow before four days later in Leverkusen at 0:4 the evil awakening gave Khedira to think about.
And sports manager Horst Heldt warned that while one season goal has been reached, the other is farther away.
We're not over the mountain yet.
The fact that Heldt was not happy on his 40th birthday even after his first home victory in three months after celebrating was due to the events of the weekend, which were freshly revived in the form of a television interview broadcast just before the game began by goalkeeper Jens Lehmann.
There are decisions that others make and not the Jens, contested the harsh criticism of Lehmann.
He had shown leadership weakness to the board and decided to change the coach at the pressure of puberty fans.
Even though his day off was cancelled after the games, Lehmann valued it as a sign of lack of sovereignty and disapproval.
Lehmann's statements were "characterized by pure egoism", recalled the hero and announced consequences for the final man.
You will no longer be friends for life, the two forty-year-olds.
After all, however, they agreed with everyone else that without the preliminary work by the replaced coaching team, the playful and combatively strong idea would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants had "a large share of the success," said the hero and Lehmann unisono - and also the man with the plastic bag agreed.
World Heavyweight Championships
Warm duel in Bern: Ever again challenger Kevin Johnson World Champion Vitali Klitschko with words and gestures.
However, after twelve tough rounds, the Ukrainian defended his heavyweight title according to the WBC version.
The judgement of the pointers was unanimous.
Hamburg - Vitali Klitschko remains Boxing World Heavyweight Champion.
The 38-year-old WBC-based champion defeated American Kevin Johnson unanimously on Saturday night in Berne after points (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
For Klitschko it was the third successful title defense after his comeback in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainian was twice world champion of the WBO and WBC associations.
Unfortunately, it didn’t work out with the K.O. everyone expected.
Klitschko expanded his balance to 39 wins in 41 professional matches, twice having to be beaten due to injuries.
Challenger Johnson had to accept the first defeat in the 24th fight.
Before about 17,000 spectators in the Bernese Arena, the 2.02-metre Klitschko wanted to dictate the fight mainly with his left-handed leadership.
The eleven-inch smaller Johnson, who had announced the end of the Klitschko era before the duel, however, repeatedly withdrew from the world champion's blows, so that Klitschko could not bring his dangerous rights to the target decisively.
Overall, the passive Johnson did too little for a challenger and only tried to get through the rounds.
Although he provoked Klitschko with words and gestures, his blows rarely hit the world champion.
After all, he is only the second boxer to Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who went over the full distance of twelve rounds with Klitschko.
The challenger had provided some vertebrae before the fight in the Swiss capital.
He insulted Klitschko as a "horrible zombie" who "can't do anything right".
While weighing, the champion was then provoked on Friday to push Johnson's sunglasses out of his nose "to see his eyes."
Fourth victory after Klitschkos Comeback
Klitschko also remained victorious in his fourth match after his return on October 11, 2008.
After nearly four years of detention, he had beaten the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and recovered his "his" WBC belt, which he had previously had to give up without a fight.
This year, he played for Juan Carlos Gomez from Cuba and Chris Arreola from the United States in September.
I only got one hit in this fight and I'm physically very well in shape, Klitschko had justified the quick return to the ring.
But his dream remains to unite all four important titles in the family.
Brother Vladimir is the World Champion of the WBO and IBF Associations.
The WBA belt, however, was worn by Britishman David Haye after he was able to dethrone the 2.13-metre Nikolai Walujew in November.
Haye had previously canceled a battle scheduled for September against Vitali Klitschko.
It is alleged that the promotional company is already planning to fight Klitschko at London’s Wembley Stadium.
Fall Kunduz
Frontal attack from the opposition: Green faction chief Jürgen Trittin has called Defense Minister Guttenberg a liar over false information on the Kunduz affair.
The SPD and the Left demand clarification from the Chancellor.
Hamburg/Berlin - According to recent findings about Kunduz's air attack, the opposition's defence minister Karl-Theodor to Guttenberg (CSU) has deliberately been deceiving.
The minister said the September deadly bombing on two tanker trains was "significantly untrue", Greens faction chief Jürgen Trittin said on Saturday in the ARD news broadcast "Tagesschau".
It’s called a lie: he lied.
The killing order was issued in violation of the rules of the International Defence Force for Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the substance of the report that NATO had read to Mr. Guttenberg, Trittin said.
On Friday, it became known that the attack was not only about destroying the kidnapped truck, but also about targeting two Taliban leaders.
According to a NATO inquiry report, as many as 142 people were killed or wounded in the U.S. airstrike demanded by German Kunduz commander Colonel Klein.
Greens, the SPD and the Left called on Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) on Saturday to express themselves immediately before the Bundestag and also to clarify what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Merkel needs to clarify whether a strategy of targeted killing is part of the government’s Afghanistan policy – and whether Chancellor, the Bundeswehr and the intelligence service have approved this new strategy, Jürgen Trittin and Green colleague Renate Künast demanded.
Government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm strongly rejected the criticism.
The Chancellor’s office has not influenced concrete interventions by the Federal Army in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, there were also doubts about the Ministry’s presentation of the reasons behind the dismissal of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert.
According to the SPIEGEL information, the two Guttenbergs have correctly and completely informed about the background of the tank cluster attack.
Officially, they said they had denied the existence of NATO reports and kept the minister from sensitive details.
However, the two senior officials believed that they had even referred the Ministry of Defence to several reports, including a two-sided document by Commanding Colonel Klein and a field hunter report.
Wichert has now asked in a letter to clarify the facts, reports the "Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung".
He has not received an answer so far, it is said.
The ministry did not comment on the allegations on Saturday and pointed out that this would be clarified by the Federal Parliament’s inquiry committee, which wants to form itself on Wednesday.
Dream worlds
Some people see images and hear voices that others do not see or hear.
It’s not just mentally ill and drug-smoking that the boundaries between imagination and reality are blurred.
As long as it happens in sleep, everything is fine.
When we lie in our dark rooms with our eyes closed, we are allowed to devote ourselves unhindered to the wildest imaginations and imaginations.
However, those who experience traumatic conditions in the waxing, see and hear things that others do not see or hear, are usually considered crazy or drug addicted in the modern Western world, at least as special.
However, such images and voices do not only arise in psychiatric patients or in drug trafficking.
Guilt has our imagination: The same neuronal processes that allow us to design houses, paint pictures or write novels sometimes make the boundaries between dream, madness and reality blur.
Traumatically altered states of mindfulness can occur in a variety of forms, in the best case we call them visions, in the worst case madness.
Although triggers and effects may differ, the visions of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiences of the New Age prophet Carlos Castaneda, shamanic abduction states, psychoses and hallucinations can be attributed to similar processes.
Hallucinations or insanity occur when the balance of the brain's neuronal messengers - especially dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and acetylcholine - is detachable and the interaction of various parts of the brain is disrupted.
Complex hallucinations and crazy thoughts occur very often during schizophrenic psychosis.
Gravity no longer has power over him.
The connection of madness and dream has been occupied by philosophers and physicians since ancient times.
Aristotle described hallucinations as a form of the dream in the awake state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, found in 1861 a "great resemblance of irresponsibility to dream states", for Sigmund Freud.
It's autumn 2001 when Henning T. turns into a comic book character.
His body is two-dimensional and quiet.
The gravity no longer has power over him, he floats on the ceiling of the room.
He feels a step.
Behind him, winged devilish figures with bloodthirsty, distorted freckles, tooth-flashing.
They chase him, walk him with heavy, flaming boots, throw him against the walls, he feels the pain throughout the body.
Noisy, malicious voices roar from walls and radio.
He can no longer bear the voices that insult and insult him.
Henning T. pulls two cables out of the stereo system, nods them to a hose and fastens them to a hook on the ceiling.
He climbs onto a speaker and lays his sling around his neck.
Jump.
The sling is loose.
This is supposed to be a lesson for you, the voices scream in drumming choir, "Go to the clinic and let yourself be healed!"
Today Henning T. is 40 years old, he has experienced six acute psychoses, the last one is 2 years back, the first almost 20 years.
It was triggered by LSD.
His diagnosis is schizophrenic-paranoid psychosis, in addition, he is manic-depressant, he takes medications, against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness, he has been married for three years.
In psychosis, I have experienced the worst fear and deepest despair, he says.
The tricks are a cruel reality
About one percent of the population suffers from schizophrenia at least once in their lives, and in psychiatric clinics it is treated as the second most common disease after depression.
In an acute schizophrenic psychosis, people can no longer distinguish between indoors and outdoors, they find themselves in an overexcited state that can lead to hallucinations, size, relationship, or persecution.
It is particularly common to hear voices - voices that command, comment or dialogue.
Also, optical hallucinations are not uncommon.
The affected person can no longer separate important from insignificant, the brain can no longer filter disturbing signals, the consciousness is flooded with impressions.
Like the dream, psychosis opens the door to a flood of ideas and fantasies that originate in deeper layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is subjective, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, Senior Physician of the Clinic for General Psychiatry at the Heidelberg University Clinic.
The schizophrenia is at the center of the event, everything has a meaning directed to it.
At the same time, he enters a passive role, he becomes, like in a dream, overwhelmed by the events and cannot actively shape them.
Therefore, schizophrenia often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
A reality comparison is usually not possible for them, the truffle images are cruel reality, awakening is excluded.
Having experienced an hallucination once in life
Unlike in the dream, Fuchs says, "but the sensory and spatial structure of reality perceived in psychosis remains in principle."
The crazy thoughts and hallucinations are in reality, the alienation of the experience takes place in the real context.
Why exactly our brain beats caprioles, researchers still pose puzzles.
“Exceptions can lead any person to lose their relationship with reality for a short time,” says Fuchs.
But not everyone will develop a psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but twin studies have shown that genes are not the determining factors alone.
Researchers assume that those affected have minimal brain damage.
We suspect that neuronal maturation of the brain is disrupted at an early stage of development, due to a viral disease of the mother during pregnancy, for example, explains Fuchs.
But it remains a mystery as to how the neuronal system disorder occurs, which at first does not even manifest itself over many years.
Environmental influences also play a role - stress or traumatic experiences can be triggers for a psychosis if the disposition is present.
Also hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychoses as they interfere with the transmitter system.
When our brain is running hot
The crazy thing is, psychologists suffer from their hallucinations and swallow expensive drugs to get rid of them, others spend money for drugs to get them, says Lübeck psychology professor Erich Kasten.
Whether wet images are felt to be pleasant or unpleasant is often just a question of the point of view.
Kasten has been collecting reports of hallucinations and phenomena for ten years, and last year he evaluated his findings in the book "The Unreal World in Our Heads".
Although hallucinations are among the typical accompanying phenomena of psychoses, but also of surprisingly many other diseases.
In addition to mental disorders such as borderline or depression, these often include diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer’s disease and skull trauma.
Surprisingly, under certain conditions, the brain itself hallucinates healthy people.
Hallucinations, such as boxes, consist of memory content that is usually retained.
They occur when brain areas where sensory perceptions are processed are overactive or too little inhibited; when our brain is running hot or even when stimulation is lacking.
Drugs can trigger this condition just as much as brain damage or psychosis.
But it’s also stimulus, stress, love sadness or other mental states of emergency.
In recent studies, up to a third of respondents reported having experienced hallucinations at least once in their lives.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. is 16 years old, she lives in a small town in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and attends high school there.
A very normal girl, actually.
If it weren't for the pictures and voices.
During the break, it can happen that a sluggish boy with long, dark hair responds to it.
When it answers him, the students look at it surprised – no one else sees or hears this boy.
They think the shy girl is a busy daydreamer, but Sarah K. doesn’t dream, she knows that.
She is awake, she hears and sees this boy, just as she hears and sees the girl in the bank next to herself.
She can even feel his presence, at least for moments.
A pleasant feeling is that she likes the boy.
Am I crazy? she sometimes asks.
But she knows that this boy and the other trick pictures are not real and disappear again.
At night, the phenomena are most frightening.
Often the trunk images are also a burden.
When she sits in the classroom, she can sometimes not follow the subject because the teacher is presenting a new fellow in her eyes and ears while explaining mathematical equations to everyone else on the table.
At night, the phenomena are usually scary.
When she is waiting in her dark room for sleep, which comes too rarely and too late, she can often not distinguish whether she is awake or already dreaming, whether the pictures she sees, the fractures or the girl with the bleeding cuts on her arms and legs, standing in front of her open or closed eyes.
Leave me alone, she cries out to the figures.
Parents and friends don’t tell her anything that would make her crazy.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is 20 years old today.
She graduated from college last year and lives with her boyfriend.
A year ago, the hallucinations stopped.
Since she made contact with the psychologist Kasten on the Internet, she knows exactly that she is not crazy.
Wahn is also a work of art from despair
If someone is socially isolated or suffering from irritability, they are most likely to have hallucinations after a while, says Kasten.
I guess the brain is then under-occupied and takes care of its own entertainment.
Sarah K., a single child, as a little girl, was afraid of other children, often playing alone.
Her hallucinations began when she learned at the age of 13 that the man she calls Daddy, since she can think, is not her reading father.
Since visual and acoustic hallucinations are active in the same areas of the brain, which also process real impressions and sounds, it is difficult for those affected, such as Sarah K., to differentiate between witch images and reality.
Hallucinations are also images that create the brain, which is why they look so real.”
Even night-dream images value boxes as a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people are not fundamentally different from those of acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenia, mentally healthy people are able to recognize their trunk images as unrealistic.
Kasten therefore advises his patients to appreciate hallucinations as a special ability.
The state of boundary between dream and hallucination
Unfortunately, in our highly conscious world, the imaginary experience is mostly pathologized, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, Professor in Heidelberg and Head Doctor of the Clinic for Psychiatry and Psychotherapy of the Florence Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
Psychosis is a serious, painful disease, but it also carries positive, creative – madness is also a work of art out of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard has explored the so-called oneiroid form of experience, a special form of traumatically altered vigilance consciousness.
Oneiroids are highly complex, detailed quasi-dreams, which the experiencer considers real and which he cannot distinguish from the waking state in the aftermath.
The one-iroid state of consciousness occurs in trauma- or disease-related extreme situations, for example in polyradiculitis patients who experience motor paralysis with full consciousness.
When a person is threatened with self-loss and world loss, for example by persistent, complete inability to move, he replaces the life-threatening real situation with his own imaginary world, which is disconnected from reality, says Schmidt-Degenhard.
A kind of state of boundary between dream and hallucination.
Since it is not possible to deal with a situation in reality, a world change takes place, but the real situation is presented in the imagination.
An intensive form of sense foundation and sense perception in an intolerable situation, which enables us humans to not undergo in nothing the loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in the memory
The Zurich art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen also describes his Oneiroid experiences in his book "Change of Hearts" as an action to save the soul.
He is 49 years old when his consciousness after a heart valve surgery and subsequent heart transplants travel for days, while his body is sentenced to immobility at the intensive care station.
Claussen immerses himself in a self-made world, visiting foreign times and places: he experiences himself as a bedridden, old man, aboard a train sanatorium, a robot watches over his health.
He lived in the early Middle Ages among the nobles, who manufactured smog from blood.
Trapped by a Greek on a motorcycle in his home country, he surfs with his hospital bed in the snow of the Alps and meets a Korean mafia.
It goes completely on in the imagined event, everything is real, even later in the memory.
These inner journeys are fundamentally different for Clausen from any dream.
Dream is another condition, he describes his experience.
On the contrary, the memories of mental travel are clear to me even after years and in additional details.
Clearer and more intense than really experienced.
The intensity of this experience explodes the horizon of our other worldly experiences, says psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Ultimately, oneiroids, psychoses, hallucinations and drug smoke show how fragile our inner images of external reality are also in the wake.
Any change in the state of consciousness, the psychologist summarizes, "can lead to a distortion of what we call reality."
An experience that can also be enriching.
The snowstorm may come
Burda
Children are expected to take over the publishing house at 27 years of age
The new editor-in-chief Kallen is an intermediate solution: in the long run, Hubert Burda wants to give his company into the hands of his two children, he told the SPIEGEL.
In the future, the holding is expected to belong to 100 percent of the family.
Hamburg - Publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the long term in the hands of his children.
Both children inherited at the age of 27 and are determined to join the company, the 69-year-old told SPIEGEL.
We have carefully arranged the details for this.
The question of whether they are active in the company is only then.
The question is whether they are able to do so.
It is not possible to appoint 7500 employees if their children are not sufficiently qualified.
This brings the kids to life and the company to life as well.
Burda announced on Thursday that he would resign from the chair of the board from January, and appointed Paul-Bernhard Kallen as his successor.
The 52-year-old Kallen has been a board member at Burda since 1999.
At first, he was responsible for technology.
The Treasury area later became responsible for the company’s assets, and after the expulsion of Jürgen Todenhöfer also became responsible for direct marketing, abroad, printing and finance.
For the first time, there is no family member at the top of the publishing house.
Burda's children are 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, who would be 42 years old today, died a few years ago.
The designation of Kallen also serves to "bridge 10, 15 years", says Burda.
The holding should also belong to 100 percent of the family in the future, Burda said.
With regard to the cases of Schickedanz and Schaeffler, Burda expressed that family businesses are also not safe before the collapse: "This always concerned families who were infected with a capital addiction, who had completely speculated and thought they could rise to a very big player.
My strategy was never that.
He had "no world power dreams," Burda said.
I don’t see myself as the political speaker of this country, as it was Springer, and I don’t want to play in the World League with ‘Time’, these stores have become too big.
The perfect beauty.
Everything you wish for in terms of beauty and well-being is at your disposal now.
At least that’s what El Corte Inglés has done, which recently opened a store with an area of more than 1000 m2 in the shopping center in Callao (Madrid), where everything is about body care.
In the spa area, located on the eighth floor, you will find other reputable companies such as Hedonai, which provide a laser detachment; Spaxión, with rooms for relaxation and beauty treatments; the hairdressers Luis & Tachi, Marina d'Or with a fitness studio or L'Occir.
But there is also a food department that stands out through its tea house with more than 130 different types of tea.
Enjoy a relaxing massage together with your partner while having a fantastic view of the capital, or rent the relaxation area for two hours to get your own "beauty party" with eight friends on the legs and after that you can just take a few massages in the hot tub or with some massages, massages, and a clamping of the campagne.
The total area is 250 m2, which is divided into 12 rooms for the latest face and body treatments as well as for hydrotherapy.
For example, for cavitation in the fight against cellulite or with vibrating surfaces.
The gym also has this type of equipment, in addition there are virtual trainers who take care of the training units of the customers and thereby provide them with a completely personal training.
You start a training unit by entering a personal password on a touchscreen that is opposite the devices.
After that, various videos will show you how to perform your workouts properly.
The head of the gym ensures that 15 minutes (including warm-up and stretching) are completely enough to train the body muscles.
And then, after you have exercised your body, you’ll want to take a look at the hair salon, Luis & Tachi has a room where treatments for restoring the shine, shine and health of your hair are offered in a personalized way.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to be the key words for this wellness area in the middle of the city, which is always open from 10.00 a.m. to 22.00 p.m. 365 days a year.
The most diverse decolletés
Christmas is getting closer and it is again a good opportunity to copy the look of the stars and bring their wedding dresses to our wardrobe.
The shape of the decolleté, which is very important for highlighting the silhouette, is one of the points to be considered in this regard.
Here are some suggestions.
The singer Fergie has chosen an exaggerated and very complicated decollete, of which one can only abrade.
Endesa and Barcelona by electric car
The electricity company Endesa, together with the city of Barcelona, has created the "LIVE-Büro".
This is a project to develop and promote the electric car in the Catalan capital.
The "LIVE Office" (Logistics for the introduction of the electric car) will define and coordinate the roadmap for the introduction of the electric car in the city and make agreements on mobility by managing, coordinating, subsidizing, etc.
On the other hand, the MOVELE project is being developed to promote the electric car and is intended to summarize the opinions and measures of the areas involved.
This is an attempt to drive the means of transport of the future.
3 "electric cities"
However, Barcelona is not the only city that will be involved in the introduction of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville are also participating in this project.
These are the three cities selected by the government in the MOVELE project to accelerate the introduction of the electric car.
The electricity company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Government of Catalonia (la Generalitat).
This framework agreement aims to promote the activities of research and technological development in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These activities are, among other things, those activities that are related to energy and in particular to their performance.
However, it is not the only initiative that Endesa is taking part in in promoting the electric car.
The company is involved in standardisation groups across Europe and maintains a range of additional projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees “a horizon of tranquility” for the automotive sector
The Prime Minister, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, prophesied of the Spanish automotive industry, which is the country's largest exporter, "a horizon of tranquility".
In presenting the 2009 Economic Report by the Prime Minister, Zapatero recalled once again the steps taken by the Government to support the automotive sector over the course of the government year.
“Without the plan for the competitiveness of the automotive industry, we would today have a panorama of neglect and the closure of some of our main production plants,” the Prime Minister said.
"Thanks to this plan and the willingness of automakers to produce in Spain in the future in a very competitive industry, we can see a quiet horizon for the future of this industry, which is our largest export industry," he added.
He also recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, part of the overall Plan for the Automotive Industry (PIA), provided <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>800 million for projects from 19 vehicle manufacturers and 137 suppliers, which in turn provided investments of more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3 billion.
The Head of Government stated that these investments are intended both for the development of new models and for the modernization of existing products and processes.
Zapatero also stressed the Government's efforts to boost demand, in reference to Plan 2000E, which is applied in cooperation with the Autonomous Communities and automotive manufacturers.
According to the head of government, this plan allows to reduce emissions of new vehicles sold on the Spanish market by an average of 6%, which in turn led to a "strong increase" in approvals, which increased "by 40 percent" in November.

Mazda3 i-Stop: Eco-friendly sportiness
Mazda wants to prove that sport is perfectly compatible with environmental protection.
For this reason, Mazda recently introduced the Mazda3 automatic stop and start system of the engine, named i-Stop, a device that is currently only available for the 2.0 petrol engine with 150 hp.
This second generation of the Mazda 3 stands out through its good scores in the overall picture.
The finishing process, the design of the vehicle, the comfort, its strapping behavior, the mechanics, the i-stop system...
All these aspects are "very good" in the new Mazda3.
Starting with the front seats, you can see that the front seats offer excellent ergonomics and good hold.
The game of the steering wheel is excellent.
Looking further at the unit consisting of the instrument panel and the armor board, it can be seen that Mazda, with a variety of buttons and switches in the striking colors of red and blue, is on the same line as the Japanese trend towards a futuristic interior design.
This style reminds us in part of the style of the Honda Civic.
That is why it can be said that both the Mazda 3 and the Civic, both Japanese models, stand out from the sobriety of German cars, especially from the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to outnumber.
The passenger space of these two Japanese compact cars offers more than ever the appropriate comfort, so that four adults can drive in the most comfortable way.
All this comes with a large and clearly shaped trunk.
The stop and start system is currently only available for the 2-liter petrol engine with 150 hp and a 6-speed switch.
This engine is a real pleasure. It stands out by its subtlety, by its quiet noise, its performance and by its low consumption.
And all those who drive not many kilometers a year should consider this i-stop with gasoline engine because of its great gear-shift comfort and low fuel consumption, even if Mazda is the most sold diesel models.
With regard to the equipment, the so-called Sportive model selected for the trial ride is a special feature, since it has a significantly larger number of elements from the series equipment.
In particular, the series equipment highlights the RVM, which eliminates the dead angle, but also the controls for traction and stability, the speed control, the audio-sensitive mirror, the light-sensitive insides, the Bluetooth, the on-board computer, the on-board computer, the on-board computer, the on-board computer, the on-board computer, the on-board computer, the on-board computer, with a large screen,
In addition, this version also includes, as if it were not yet sufficiently equipped, the Premium package, which includes the following for an additional 1,500 euros: in addition to other elements especially the legible Bixenon headlights and the BOSE sound system with CD charger.
Facilitation
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compact cars of its class.
It is particularly outstanding in terms of the materials used, due to its driving behaviour and the variety of equipment.
In addition, those who do not travel many kilometers a year can also buy the i-stop version, which is only available with a 2.0 petrol engine with 150 hp.
The only negative on this model is its slightly high price, which is between 21,770 euros for the model Luxury and 23,270 euros for the tested model Sportive.
However, in contrast to this high price, the Mazda3 offers us the highest driving pass every day.
A premiere with a lot of glamour
L. A. rolls out the red carpet of sensuality for Penélope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
At the premiere of "Nine", the stars, dressed in models that look as elegant as they are sexy, radiated more than ever.
Our "Pe", as elegant as ever, opted for a dark "Lady" dress.
The Promises of FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, a device with which you can only read your emails, without a way to see certain attachments or browse the Internet.
It enjoyed its five minutes of fame when it chose Time magazine as one of the products of the year.
Seeing it on the street is rather unlikely, but the idea in itself is still especially of interest to young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek costs very little and has a very cheap flat rate, for example, only half the price of an iPhone flat rate.
After seeing the success of the company, it has launched two new devices: one designed for Twitter only, the other with a lifetime free data service, completely unlike the Peek, where you have to pay a six-fold higher price.
Fonpeek, presented yesterday at the Le Web event, is the European version of this invention and thus its third version.
It has the same boundaries as its American counterpart, but has prepared a surprise.
The monthly maintenance price for the phone, approximately <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>12 per month, includes roaming for all of Europe.
Those traveling around the world with a smartphone already know what it means to have to give up all the data in order to be able to read their emails once you have crossed the border or when you are desperately looking for a café with WIFI (or a connection with phone).
The idea of roaming with Flatrate is incredibly seductive and should have been possible for a long time.
It is true that some phone providers already offer special contracts and prices for overseas stays, but according to my experience, you already need a doctoral degree in physics and a good glasses to be able to read all the printed.
The repeated criticism by the European Commission of affordable roaming fares across Europe has almost always been ignored.
Outside of your own country, you are always afraid to read your emails and that’s right.
The fact that a small device such as FonPeek (although it is always amazing that it has the name Fon, although it does not have Wi-Fi/Wi-Fi) can offer this type of tariffs means that phone providers need to slowly but safely rethink and start thinking about different ways they can take into consideration how to use data.
Kindle is another good example of this, its prices include downloading books and other requests on the Internet.
Without velcro and without hooks.
This is an internet-enabled device and you only pay for it once, namely when you buy, and not month by month.
And that’s exactly what I expect from FonPeek one day, a life-long internet shopping opportunity as it already offers Peek in the US.
Not because I want to buy it.
I'm reading my emails on the phone, thank you.
But I expect this because I think it would be a more suitable model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
The Fetish Color of Michelle
Yellow is undoubtedly the favorite color of the American First Lady.
Already when Barack Obama took office as President of the United States, she appeared in a dress and a coat of this color and has chosen the same color again to accompany him in his undoubtedly the second most important moment in his life: the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama wore very similar models on both occasions: except that it was almost the same color - a glossy green grey -, the clothes consisted of three parts - dress, jacket and coat of the same fabric, and she wore something largely embroidered or a necklace.
It goes even to the point that at first glance it seemed that the First Lady of the United States wanted to follow the example of the Princess of Asturias and had decided to wear the same dress on more than one occasion.
However, the two dresses are very different in the type of fabric from which they are made.
At the inauguration she wore a dress made of top and a patterned satin in Oslo.
The accessories were also different: for the first time, green shoes with semi-hollow hems and for the second time a velvet model, but golden colors.
The hairstyle was also different every time: the hair was stitched up on this occasion as a hair ring, at the previous time she wore the hair open.
75% of working mothers have problems at work because of their motherhood
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially among younger women who want to have children.
This is the result of the study "Fertility and Career of Women in Spain" carried out by CSIC in collaboration with the Institute for Women.
The survey of 9,737 women between the ages of 15 and 75 shows no doubt: 75% of employed women see their career opportunities in the labour market limited because of their motherhood.
The study reveals that there are big differences in the decision to start a family and the number of children, depending on whether women work or not, and if so, what kind of profession they exercise.
Those of them who do not perform any other activity outside the house, only work half-day, or do not have a fixed employment contract, are more likely to become mothers and have more children.
On the other hand, women with a fixed job, especially in the public sector, displace the establishment of a family and motherhood and therefore have fewer children.
"Women in the age group between 35 and 49 with a fixed-term employment receive their first child on average only 3.7 years after retiring, a figure that rises to 4.1 years for women with a fixed employment who have needed longer to achieve this and who have retired their first child much later.
In addition, the type of work also has a major impact on maternity, although less than the calendar in terms of the ability to conceive,” explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that must be taken into account in the age of women in marriage and the first child.
According to the survey, the higher the age at the time of marriage and the first child, the higher the level of education.
This difference could also be observed in women of the same age.
For example, women in the group between the ages of 35 and 49, depending on whether they have only a primary school or a higher education, were on average 25.1 or 32.1 mothers for the first time each.
In addition, there is another difference between women, depending on their level of education.
While the women with the main graduation get married before their first graduation and have their first child, the women with a middle or high school graduation make it very different and seek a graduation and then marry and then get their first child, Delgado notes.
Diane Kruger is also worth it.
L'Oréal Paris recently added a new name to its far-reaching list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
From next year, the German actress will be the image of various products of the brand and will also say the well-known advert "Because you are worth it".
The main actress from "Joyeux No<0xC3><0xAB>l", one of the most elegant actresses at the international level, will become another famous hanging sign, as before her Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penélope Cruz.
Before her, the last to join this exclusive club were the actresses Evangeline Lilly ("Lost") and Freida Pinto ("Slumdog Millonaire").
Among the men, the cosmetics company also has only exceptional ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey ("Grey's Anatomy") and Matthew Fox (Evangelline's acting colleague in "Lost").
The awarding of the British fashion industry
The British have an important role to play in the fashion world.
Their highest representatives – fashion designers and models, both yesterday and today – met at the annual awards ceremony held in London at the Royal Court of Justice.
On this occasion, they all appeared.
The former model Jerry Hall and her daughter Georgia May Jagger, who was chosen as the best model of the year.
The Poker Game by Manuel Vicent
Manuel Vicent presents in "Poker of the Ace" (Alfaguara, paintings by Fernando Vicente) the thirty X-rays of writers who have accompanied him in his literary life (and, in some cases, also in real life).
In doing so, he does not use a predictable and frightening genre (short biography, life and work), but seeks an affirmation of the bright heartpiece of the Creator.
The journey is exciting and Vicent does not save from horror or illumination.
In addition to the fact that this book is a delicious read pleasure, it is also a moving call to read and read again and again.
Here are some excerpts from the book.
On Albert Camus: "When I read his pages, I found out that the Mediterranean is not a sea, but rather a spiritual, almost sensual impulse, just as I always felt it, without having found words for it: the joy as opposed to the unhealthy destiny of God, the morality without the discipline."
About Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, an allegorical Christian, he wrote about what he had in the blood, not in his mind, between powerlessness and ignorance, with an overwhelming poetic humor, without any sense, like the knifekling that almost killed him."
About Graham Greene: "Our husband was drawn by this woman, with a passion that lasted thirteen years, to her bans, in whose flesh the emotions of adultery were united with the pleasures of repentance, a spiritual privilege that came into being in the midst of the struggle of heaven.
About James Joyce: "The Odyssey" was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the 8000 summits in the world literature, one must climb on the north wall, on the wall, where the best climbers try again and again."
About William Faulkner: "It was a funny cause.
He sometimes said of himself that he was the inheritance of a property owner of the county, and again he said that he was the son of a black man and a crocodile.
Both dreams witnessed a certain magnitude."
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: This writer recorded the insane cry, which was outlined from a bridge from that personality from Munich, so that his echo stopped until the night of the twentieth century in his literary manner. He did this in a literary manner before a whirlwind, on a journey of his own.
About Dorothy Parker: "One day she kneeled down and prayed, "My God, I beg you to do everything in your power so that I finally stop writing like a woman."
About Joseph Conrad: "On his grave these verses are engraved by Spencer: ''the sleep after effort,/ after the harbor's storm,/ the tranquility after war,/ after a satiated life one finds pleasure in death."
About Virginia Wolf: "She always had her depressions in her luggage.
The husband took it with complete normality when she told him that Edward VII had spying on them between the Azaleas or singing the birds in Greek.
There is no other known case where the man was so patient and fell in love with a neurotic whose literary talent was far greater than her madness.
About Pío Baroja: "What did Martín-Santos do other than try to invade Joyce in Baroja?
What was Benet going to do if he did not bring Baroja to the weapons of Faulkner?
What did Cela do, then, except to destroy the glory of that man, so that he could put himself on this podium?"
Feige Aggression
My 70-year-old mother went for a walk through our neighborhood in the village of Fuenlabrada last week, when suddenly a group of young people between the ages of 15 and 18 walked next to her and our dog, our dog is a mixing dog that we got out of the zoo and we slapped him two times and then just slapped him out of it, six pounds and a heist.
We cannot put our equipment into words, as it is incomprehensible for us, because there is a fun to be in a cheap aggression against a small and helpless animal, which of course was carried out on the line.
In addition to this, the drowning attack that a woman who went for a comfortable walk got when she wanted to confront these people because of the incident, she was even afraid for her own life, because if such a madman attacks a dog, he may be as crazed as he is with a woman, himself, a gentleman, a child.
The incident occurred in a normally quiet neighborhood at five o’clock in the afternoon on a very ordinary Tuesday.
The dog has been crawling all day.
Of course, we have returned an ad in a nearby police station, but we still have great doubts as to whether this will bring anything and to prevent any prejudices from the beginning, we just want to clarify that the cowardly criminals were Spanish.
Our disarmament of the incident caused us to report this incident.
We cannot understand what must happen in the minds of these young people, that they find a cheap attack on a helpless animal funny, on an animal that gives us love, companionship and friendship.
We do not know where good education and respect for animals and people have remained.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of the helmet
The tyre manufacturer Michelin, in collaboration with the Spanish Road Safety Foundation (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to promote the use of helmets, especially among younger motorcyclists, as both companies announced today.
This initiative aims to draw attention to the importance of helmet use, as this is ultimately the only protective element that can prevent head injuries or even death in the event of a motorcycle crash.
Michelin pointed out that this campaign is part of its commitment to road safety, which "encompasses far more than the design and manufacture of products that become safer and safer every day" and further affirmed that it will also come with other actions, educational and informative, approaching this goal of every day.
This new campaign to promote helmet use on motorcycles, which runs under the slogan 'To be or not to be', will distribute posters to over 500 motorcycle workshops in a first phase to achieve the best possible spread.
In conclusion, Michelin stressed that traffic safety is "a constant concern" of the company, and precisely because as a manufacturer of tyres for two-wheeled vehicles, it is always committed to seeing that one of its main goals must be the development of ever safer products.
Sales of small trucks are rising again.
After almost two years, the car market for small cars finally begins to see some light at the end of the dark tunnel.
The 9,425 vehicles authorised in Spain in November represent an increase of 12.6 per cent compared to 2008, and, more importantly, they are thus the first ever increase after 22 consecutive months with a steady decline, according to the pre-fabricated car association Anfac.
However, these good figures are currently only to be enjoyed with great caution, as the reference data used for comparison are from November 2008, which was a particularly bad marketing year with a 60% decrease compared to the previous year.
However, it must be borne in mind that, apart from the increase in the last month, the total approvals of these 11 months are still 40% below the sales figures of the previous financial year.
A total of 95,853 vehicles have been sold since January, but this number includes all the vehicles that make up the small car market: descendants of passenger cars, pick-ups, small cars, small trucks and lighter trucks.
Furthermore, the same storm clouds in the sky are still the ones that attract the most demand, because even if some of the vehicles are bought from private individuals, the bulk of sales go to small and medium-sized companies, which in almost 100% of cases make the purchase with third-party financing.
These constraints, which are the result of the monetary constraints imposed by credit institutions, have to be taken into account even more factors, such as the increase in the unemployment rate or the persistence of the bad economic situation.
In this panorama and unlike passenger cars, financial support for the purchase of a vehicle of the Plan 2000E has helped little.
However, this plan is not only intended for private individuals, but also self-employed and small businesses have the right to buy a small carriage car with a CO2 emissions of up to 3.5 tonnes, which may not exceed 160 grams per kilometre driven, but the low sales figures speak for themselves.
Just yesterday, Ganvam had once again reminded that it is absolutely necessary on the part of the state to pay special attention to these small trucks and, of course, also to industrial vehicles (trucks and buses).
The Auto Dealer Association predicts for 2010 a year similar to that just passed, for which it expects a 19% drop in sales (for passenger cars and off-road cars).
Support for braking maneuvers in critical situations is now mandatory
As with the ABS anti-block brake system at the time and as with the ESP stability control, the emergency braking aid systems must become mandatory equipment in European cars.
In fact, they are already mandatory for all newly authorised passenger cars and lightweight small carriers, for the remaining vehicles a deadline for carriage has been set until the end of February 2011.
The adoption by the European Union aims to improve the protection of pedestrians, but these braking systems can also help to prevent many accidents due to their way of working.
The task of the emergency braking assistant is to exert more pressure on the brakes in the case of a critical brake maneuver, which the system detects on the brake pedal by the brake force performed by the driver.
However, this system does not exert this pressure until the end.
According to an inquiry commissioned by the Bosch component manufacturer for the vehicles, one third of the drivers involved in an accident did not even step on the brake pedal before the collision, and half of them had not braked fully.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The brake aid, on the other hand, intervenes with maximum force into the brake system, thereby reducing the braking time and thus also the braking distance that a car sets back during the braking process.
According to an EU study, up to 1,100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians could be prevented each year if all cars were equipped with this type of emergency braking assistant.
There would be even fewer accidents - one in four accidents could be prevented with personal injury - as soon as the so-called intelligent emergency braking systems become popular.
Then the vehicle is equipped with a system that detects obstacles (via a radar or a camera) and warns the driver, while already exerting a slight pressure on the brakes.
If the driver then reacts, the system will help him increase the pressure on the brake pedal if needed.
If the driver does not respond to the warning and even if the collision is inevitable, the braking assistant exerts the maximum pressure on the brakes in order to keep the damage as low as possible.
General Motors postpones plan for Opel to January
While the staff at the Opel plant in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) have been informed by Nick Reilly, the new chairman of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva will begin in the first week of April, likely to be planned on April 8, according to Javier Ortega, which is more likely to be the time of the United States.
Nick Reilly, the new chairman of GM Europe, wants to make sure that the affected party agrees with every single point of the plan in advance.
And for this reason, it may be that the final document, which will be presented first to the workers and then to the governments of the countries in which there are works, will be moved to the beginning of 2010.
In contrast, GM is assured that in the coming days, a decision will be made regarding the sale of Saab.
It is no wonder that the Swedish government has increased pressure on the American automaker to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to being in touch with some potential new buyers.
One of these buyers could be Geely, who would also like to buy Volvo, but the option of the Dutch manufacturer of the Skyper sports car, which has a back cover from the Russian group Converg, is gaining more and more popularity.
If no one of these buyers comes to an agreement, GM could sell some assets to the Chinese BAIC.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year, if it has not been sold by then, will continue to be maintained.
At the wheel of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
For the development of its latest and very expensive jewelry, the engineers used the Boxster S as the basis and really managed to make it 80 kilos lighter, which means that it now only weighs 1,275 kilos.
In order to create such a thing, they were the first to abandon the automatic folding roof, which was replaced by a tent canopy with manual drive, so that alone one has saved 21 kilos; thanks to the aluminium doors used in this model, such as the GT3, another 15 have been "disappeared" through sport; with the crawling of the GT3, another 15 have been "disappeared" by the crawrawraps, with the 13 again with the staining of the lime, with the lime.
Then, the abandonment of the audio system CDR-30 again had reduced by six kilos and the exchange of the door handles by handles made of fabric reached the missing kilo.
Although it is also available with the double clutch gearbox PDK, the trial was conducted with a vehicle with 6-speed manual gearboxes, mainly on California’s smaller country roads, on mountain tracks that were really very curved.
In the case of his driving behaviour, he can only be given the note perfectly.
However, the reduction of his weight did not result in him being no longer as safe on the strap.
Rather, it is the opposite of the case: for a long time we have not tried such a small and lightweight model, but it also gives a feeling of great safety in the curves, even at high speeds.
He is a small athlete, able to warm his muscles at a low pace in the time required until we give him the command to scrape, brake, recover, and then again to get everything out of his engine...
He does everything he is told. The car does everything we suggest with our hands on the steering wheel, thanks to its steering, which is as communicative as it is precise.
And he does it with the precision of a surgeon.
A motor sound for all tastes
The sound of his V6 boxer with 320 hp (10 more than the Boxster S) has succeeded and you can even increase it with the 'sport' option as well as with a system that can change the engine noise, which was first used by the Panamera.
The ability to accelerate is unimaginably brutal, whether from standing out or re-accelerating.
The springs are strong, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt on the roads we drove with the Boxster Spyder was already quite damaged, but the car mastered the holes well.
The electronic assistants had almost nothing to do on the entire route; and that, although we found ice in some of these curves in the morning gray and roll split in the morning.
To sum up, it’s an ultralight car, a car with which you have an indescribable driving pass, as it’s probably more rare, and there’s much more to it than just a small improvement of the Boxster Ss.
The car will be launched in February 2010 and will cost EUR 70.831.
"Bag Girl"
The singer, a bus friend of Karl Lagerfeld, is the face of Coco Cocoon cosmetics and an occasional star at the fashion shows of 'maison', she presents her evil face with the same sharpness as her Chanel pockets.
Much more than "Bad Girl" or "It Girl", she's a "Bag Girl".
The Baskonia gives itself a victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral, despite the many outstanding players in Dusko Ivanovic's team, celebrated an excellent triumph with 82-91 on his visit to the complicated football field of the Maccabi Electra and thus reaches the first place in his group (the best in his triple, after the great performance a was the appearance of the Tele Mirvito).
The Vitoria team was able to replace the significant losses of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with a large dose of deployment and teamwork, even if they waited until the bitter end for their victory.
The great hits from the perimeter with 16 triples rated contributed significantly to their final victory.
The game began with the leadership of the Blues, who from the beginning sat at the top of the display board.
Since the first four baskets of the team from Vitoria had already come out of the perimeter, it could already be assumed that they had come to the playground with well-heated wrists.
It was English and Teletovic who were mainly responsible for the 18-20 at the end of the first quarter.
The second quarter was barely different, except that the <0xC3><0x81>lava team opted for an inside game of Barac and for the game of Eliyahu, which was received on his return to the team with pips and applause, which is his home to expand his advantage further to the break (34-43).
Teletovic already began to stand out as the best of his team with 13 points, even though the "minus six" rating of splitters already prefers to suggest that this would not be the best evening of the Brazilian.
Nevertheless, despite the clear advantage in the break, the Makkah bears had not decided for a long time and once again the Victorians wanted to remind them that not everyone wins on their field, and thanks to the repeatedly attacking "hand of Elijah" they came back into the game.
Eidson and Pnini contributed decisively to the "yellows" turning the rudder (50-49).
More Disadvantages
The team of Ivanovic, wounded, but all but dead, had to prepare a couple of matches with confidence to get back air, and suddenly one of them came with the pistol of Mirza Teletovic, who was knocked down by three almost consecutive shots7) and with the support of Angeze, again with the support of English and Rifuer.
The Alaveses were bluffed in the last quarter and English and San Emeterio (60-75) already announced that they would not allow anyone to take back the victory they had honestly earned in the first thirty minutes.
Nonetheless, Pnini and Eidson resigned, the best of their team, and tried to give their team power again by three points off the line (70-77).
Nevertheless, and although splitter was dropped due to fouls, Ivanovic’s team did not give up, defended well, and although the Israelis were still in the last minute (80–85), the game had already won and Tel Aviv lost for the first time this season.
Injuries prevented Unicaja from being offered to the forehead
Unicaja lost loudly in Greece against Olympiacos and had to resign the lead in Euroliga Group B against him, and that was in a game marked by the failures of the players of Unicajas (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), especially in the internal game, which marked the victory of the Greeks.
The Malaga team was neither afraid of the mood in the Hall of Peace and Friendship nor of the enemy team, which is perhaps one of the strongest in Europe and has a lot of money.
Thanks to the first quarter game, the Andalusians were allowed to dream. An aggressive defense and three consecutive triples, two of which by Omar Cook and one by Guillem Rubio, blended the hosts with 12-18 in the 9th minute.
Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of the Unicaja event, even though the local team with an indoor game between Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis managed to show the display in the 13th minute 22-20 in their favors, the minute in which it was shown to befi was at the moment, due to an action between the Williams and the Americans beween to the sleigh.
The Greek team began to finally get warm and its superiority on both sides, while the expulsion of Englishman Joel Freeland due to an injury and the three self-caused mistakes of Carlos Jiménez left clear marks on Unicaja.
Among their indoor players and Lithuanian pre-gamer Linas Kleizas, with his triple, they increased their lead in the 19th minute to 44-32.
A chase was impossible.
The third quarter of the game was marked by many attacks against the Olympiacos team, which, despite its 19 losses, was overwhelming and even managed to compensate the difference of the game played in Málaga with 66-48 in the 27th minute, which in turn sparked the leadership within the group.
Unicaja tried to get rid of the many failures and the expulsion of the injured Scottish Robert Archibald during the game.
Despite the many disadvantages for the Unicaja, in the 31st minute thanks to the spring leadership and the triple of Cook and the use of Lewis came back some hope on 66-57.
However, it was actually impossible, as the Olympiacos, as soon as he attacked and showed his superiority with centimeters within the Korb kingdom, was not to be slowed down.
Croatian captain Nikola Vujcic managed in the 37th minute to raise the basket difference to 81-62 and Unicaja had to give up and resign the lead at Olympiacos.
How much should you earn because of your profile on Facebook?
Facebook users can now get the salary that they should earn on account of their profile thanks to the new application Trovit, the search engine with the most ads of real estate, job offers and cars in Spain.
The "How Much Should You Earn?" tool calculates the salaries of users based on more than 140,000 job offers available at Trovit in Spain. Users can enter a form on Facebook in which they can enter their profession, professional experience, age and the city in which they work.
Already a week after the application was first available, the search engine found that the Spanish worker on average “feels badly paid,” said the Trovit product manager, Albert Ribera, in a press release.
The Spaniards are the poorest paid according to the data Trovit has through its search engines in the UK and France.
A British programmer receives an annual gross salary of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>45,226 and a Frenchman receives <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>31,059, as opposed to the <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>24,000 a Spanish earner earns.
As a result, a truck driver has a net annual salary of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>34,247 in England, <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>25,751 in France and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>16,420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the worst-paid work in Spain is that of a waiter with 11,592 euros net annually; followed by the work of a seller with 14,725 euros and of a worker with 15,667 euros.
The most sought after jobs on the Internet in the last three months are those of a driver, half-day jobs and social workers.
Brazil calls Zelaya a date to leave
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for the stay of Manuel Zelaya in his embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The President deposed must leave the diplomatic mission no later than 27 January 2010 when his mandate officially expires.
Francisco Catunda, the trade delegate of the Brazilian embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed to TV Globo that “Mel” said he must have left the embassy where he had found asylum since September 21.
"He is aware that he has to leave on January 27, as his mandate expires on this day and he has to look for a new accommodation."
The broadcaster also quoted the former president, who confirmed his intention to leave the message before the deadline: “My position is to leave as soon as possible, logically with the back cover of the Brazilian government,” Zelaya said on the phone.
After the November 29 elections (where Porfirio Lobo emerged victorious), Zelaya assured that he would remain in the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, he tried to get refuge in Brazil this week.
However, this failed in Zelaya’s refusal to recognize the status of an asylum-seeker politician, which the de facto government under the chairmanship of Roberto Micheletti wanted to impose on him.
Thank you so much!
After the most attractive days since last spring, when the inflation of the assets was the prevailing mood on the markets, the uncertainty has returned to the markets, which is by no means surprising, as this is their natural state of affairs, in an environment in which the brokers are made of a nature and decision-making state.
The approach used to stabilise the markets was to compensate the debt with the direct purchase of assets and indirectly to allow the liquidity to be free of interest on interest moving around zero, so that banks could buy assets for settlement.
The central banks have already confirmed that the direct purchases of assets have almost ended and, without questioning their heterodoxical liquidity policy, they have begun to throw some sand into the gear, as the ECB had already done with its annual deterioration next week.
That is why investors doubt the ability of the global economy to sustain economic recovery without these heterodox takeovers, and we are witnessing a reversal in reducing risk premiums.
Stock exchange volatility and corporate bond differences are rising again, even though they are still far from the paranormal amounts they reached at the beginning of the year.
The states were forced to state private risks and the government debts were rising again.
We now rely on quality again and the US, Japan and Germany are the preferred place of refuge for investors, which in turn leads to an increase in the differences between the eurozone countries with regard to Germany.
Spain was barely affected by this instability episode so far, but then came Standard & Poor's and threatened with a new revision down regarding Spain's rating.
On the other hand, there should have been no harm to a certain uncertainty in order to silence the defenders of moral risk, who had once again attempted to raise awareness among the leaders of world economic policy of what they had caused, as they had a day of self-destruction, as they had a day of the destructive effects which they had caused to the destruction of the work they had done.
Nonetheless, what happened in Dubai suggests a tribal war between the Emirates to restore power in the Emirates, and developments in Greece were predicted earlier.
A government that silences the state debt, elections, and a new government that draws the same strain.
Prodi did it in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It makes no sense that Ecofin will save Hungary at the beginning of the year from the failure to fulfil its foreign payments and thus agree to a euro member state not to comply with its obligations.
On the other hand, it is logical that Ecofin has forced the Greek government to be transparent and that its citizens should be obliged to take extraordinarily small measures in order to maintain the stability of government funds.
Yes, we are, as expected, ahead of an episode of normalization of risk premiums, after some deferrals of too high amounts, that would now be within the expected limits.
In the case of Spain, there is no need to worry as long as the differences in government debt increase at the same rate as the European corporate bonds.
However, if the European disparities were to decrease and the Spaniards were to continue to increase, this would be a special Spanish risk.
Standard & Poor's is a farce. While the above-mentioned indicators force a large part of the market research institutes to prioritize their scenarios for recovery and to adjust their scenario for 2011 upwards, including the OECD and the European Commission, we do not believe in any of the OECD's and European Commission's efforts to re-establish a 's'.
Again, it seems that it is an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish shares, although at the moment "precaution when driving" is provided.
Connected Branches
The chairman of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to appear before the Parliament’s subcommittee yesterday, where, in these days, the strategy on Spain’s energy supply is being debated over the next two decades.
After his appearance, followed by the chairman of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Galán gave the press some points about what he had submitted to the subcommittee behind closed doors.
According to the chairman of Iberdrola, Spain will have to invest <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>50 billion by 2020 and another <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>60 billion by 2030, provided that the current nuclear power plants remain in operation.
If this were not the case, the required investments would not amount to 60 billion but to 95 billion.
However, Iberdrola believes that it should no longer be invested in increasing energy production capacity, but in distribution networks and international alliances.
From 2020, the question will change and the performance should be increased.
His proposal focuses on both gas and coal plants with facilities for capturing carbon dioxide and, of course, on renewable energies.
In this case, it is assumed that 18,000 MW more will be needed, under the precondition naturally by other "support energy".
Galán, who believes that the bill for a sustainable economy, which has just been passed by the government, is in line with what his company has demanded, in no way wanted to say anything against this law, such as creating incentives for national coal consumption, which was the exact opposite of all the policy.
In his opinion, "the long-term focus is clearly on this direction, despite some "individual" assumptions, as she referred to the chairman of Iberdrola.
Whatever it is, Galán believes that investment decisions should be made right now, even if they are long-term, as it will take some time and a stable remuneration framework must be created to take on them.
Ferrovial gets the "handling" of Aer Lingus at ten airports
Ferrovial’s subsidiary for services at airports on the ground, Swissport, is the preferred partner of the Irish airline Aer Lingus for the luggage service at ten European airports where they are represented.
Paris, London, Frankfurt and Brussels are some of the most important.
The agreement, for which figures have not yet been announced, is set for five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Government of Castile-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed a protocol for cooperation to create an innovation centre for intelligent infrastructure.
The Alliance plans investments of 20 million by 2012, of which 50% will come from Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the Centre will be to investigate energy efficiency on highways and airports.
Acciona competes with High Depth and Bouygues for its first motorway construction in Australia
Acciona is fighting for the approval of its first motorway in Australia, a market where they are already represented as energy and water companies.
The construction in question is a tunnel that will cost <0x24>1.7 billion (approximately <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.047 billion).
The French company Bouygues and the German deep are its competitors.
A 5-kilometre tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the east coast, has become the best opportunity for Acciona to establish itself in the country as a construction company and motorway operator.
The municipality wants to complete the construction at the end of 2014.
After the Administration for Public-Private Cooperation (PPP is the English abbreviation) decided to advance the project according to a business plan developed by Ernst & Young, the Administration already owns a final list of candidates for construction and construction management.
In anticipation of the offers presented in May, the estimated investments amounted to 1.7 billion Australian dollars (1,047 billion euros), with three consortia, mainly European construction companies, competing in the last phase.
The group called Transcity is led by Acciona, the only Spanish company, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first company is one of the largest construction companies in Australia, while the second, headquartered in Italy, is one of the best specialists for underground construction.
The Northern Direct consortium, formed by the British company Laing O'Rourke, the Australian Transfield responsible for infrastructure and the French Bouygues consortium, is against the Acciona team.
The third and final consortium, which is in the narrower choice, is called LBRJV, formed from the capital of the Australian Leighton (a subsidiary of the German construction company Hochtief, which in turn belongs to ACS), which has also owned the indigenous Raulderstone (owned by the German company Bauzel, the <0xC3><0x96>uzierz-Gruppe and the German Bauer-Bil).
The Australian Infrastructure Market promises huge construction and privatizations, but has a hurdle to overcome, as you can only gain access through the purchase of a local construction company.
A strategy followed by the companies referred to as "high-deep" or "bilfinger", in addition to Asian references, and that the Spanish builders still have to pursue.
Even ACS has gained access to this market only through its participation of 30% in high depth, the owner of the Leighton mentioned.
Millions of active
Acciona is of the utmost importance to this geographical area for the industry, in which it is already well known for its activity as an energy supplier and in the de-salting industry.
Among other assets, it already has its largest wind farm (192 MW) in Victoria and leads the group of companies commissioned to build and manage the Adelaide desalting plant with a budget of 700 million.
His intention is now to consolidate in these two areas and use these synergies to gain access to the construction and infrastructure branches.
The underground highway, which is sponsored by the Brisbane City Infrastructure Office and Northern Link (Nordzubringer), has the purpose of connecting the western highway in Toowong with the outskirts road in Kelvin Grove(see map) on a length of 5 kilometres.
The timetable issued by the municipality foresees the award for summer 2010 and the start of construction work in December next year.
Even if this track is to be opened for traffic in the last months of 2014, it is assumed that construction works will continue until 2016.
The tunnel was designed in 2005.
It has two tracks in each direction, an electronic metering system and a complex ventilation system.
The government of Queensland contributes <0x24>500 million (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>308 million) in funding.
For high depth, Brisbane is already a big deal.
Australia, which signed a contract with the government in the amount of 154 million, has repeatedly issued significant orders to Hochtief.
The subsidiary ACS will improve the infrastructure of the domestic broadband network with fiber-optic cables through its domestic subsidiary Leighton.
This improvement will create a fast internet access for 400,000 people and the German company will be employed for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has received the construction project of the 27-story King George Tower in the Australian city of Brisbane, which has not yet begun and has received <0x24>129 million.
Also in the UK, in Manchester, it competes with Laing O'Rourke for the construction and administration of two schools for 25 years.
Initial investments amount to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>75 million.
FCC receives contract for a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
Through its subsidiary Alpine, FCC has invested <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>64.5 million in the construction of a 2.1-kilometre tunnel for a motorway in Slovenia.
The company received this contract only a few days after it received the grant for the construction work to expand the Bosruck Tunnel (Austria) above 130 million.
In this way, Alpine reinforces its experience in tunnel construction.
The start of construction work is planned for the beginning of 2010 and its implementation will take over 32 months.
Mrs. Rushmore gets advertising status from Renfe
Renfe has allocated the advertising and marketing services of the agency Mrs. Rushmore for the next two years in the amount of about three million euros a year, the railway company said.
In this contract there is also the possibility of two extensions of 12 months each. Mrs. Rushmore was selected among 16 agencies that were present at this competition written by Renfe, of which 4 came to the final round, including TBWA, which was only for the last three years.
From now on, Mrs. Rushmore will be responsible for the design and production of the campaigns.
A fine of more than 63 million for France Télécom for disrupting competition.
France Télécom has imposed a fine of more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>63 million for anti-competitive behaviour in the country’s Caribbean.
According to the Authority, the telephone provider has restricted competition for fixed networks and mobile phones by signing exclusive contracts, pricing plans and loyalty programs for consumers on the edge of regulation.
Together with this sanction, the former French monopoly and still state-owned company has accumulated more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>560 million in fines since 1994 for disability of its competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday has even been increased, since the Authority, which is in charge of competition, believes that France Télécom has committed similar offences in the past and has therefore become retroactive again.
Application trade
On the other hand, the subsidiary of the French company has followed the example of other telephone providers and has opened an application store page for the purpose of increasing revenues from non-telephone connections on the Internet.
In principle, this Orange application website is active in France and the United Kingdom.
You have to wait until 2010 until these sites are available in other countries, such as Spain.
The game in the Champions League has brought Madrid and Barça 476.4 million since the start.
Since its inception in 1992, the Champions League has become a source of income for the football club.
So much so that Real Madrid and Barcelona have since taken 476.4 million, giving them the third and fifth place of the football clubs that have made the most money in the league.
The leader of this list is Manchester United.
The leader of this list is Manchester United.
Winning the UEFA Champions League brings not only fame, it is also one of the main sources of income of the major clubs.
According to UEFA, the league has allocated up to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>5,362.5 million to the 105 teams (12 of them Spanish) that have participated in this event since its founding in the 1992/93 season.
Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona have benefited from this distribution.
The Weiwei Club is in third place in Europe, which earned the most money through its participation, and the only one to have won the trophy three times in addition to AC Milan.
The current Catalan champion and last winner of the former 1992 European Cup occupies the fifth place.
Manchester United and Bayern Munich lead the list, two teams that also make the most money by participating in the previous Champions League.
And that, even though they lost to Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only in third place among the countries that have been able to borrow money through the Champions, although it has more titles than all others (five, unlike four bee Italy, three in England and two in Germany).
Distribution
This obvious opposition is explained by the complicated allocation procedure that UEFA is applying.
In this financial year, the organization, chaired by Michel Platini, expects revenue of 1,090 million from the Champions League.
From this money, UEFA expects <0x24>413.1 million for fixed payments: each of the 20 football clubs that participated in the qualifying round (including Atlético de Madrid) received <0x24>2.1 million.
In addition, those who fought for participation received 3.8 million due to their blob presence, in addition to the <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>550,000 for each game they contested.
There is also a bonus for winning (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>800,000) and for an undecided (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>400,000 per team). The clubs that came to the eighth final receive three million each; the four who came to the quarterfinals, 3.3 million.
The last four will receive <0x24>4 million each.
The winner earns 9 million, as opposed to the second, which receives 5.2 million.
For example, a football club receives at least 7.1 million and a maximum of 31.2 million in fixed income.
Barça earned <0x24>2.5 million with his victory in the European Supercup in August.
However, there are also variable payments, for which 337.8 million are planned.
This money is allocated in proportion to the value of each individual television market.
The Spaniard is one of the first and has 4 allocated seats.
Last year’s champion receives 40% of the money allocated, 30% of the second, 20% of the third place and 10% for the fourth place.
The other part will be distributed depending on the number of games they will play at this year’s edition.
Nueva Rumasa offers 61 million for 29.9% stake in Sos
The Nueva Rumasa Group yesterday made it clear details about the purchase offer of shares, with which it wants to acquire a ceiling of between 25 and 29.9% of Sos’ capital.
A percentage that does not force them, due to the number of shares, to make a public tender (opa).
In concrete terms, Nueva Rumasa offers <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1,5025 per share, which is paid out on ten years and with an interest rate of 1% per year due to this shift.
Sos shares closed with 1.85 euros yesterday, which is why Nueva Rumasa rated the company 18% below the market value.
According to Nuevovan Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the actual valuation of Sos.
The offer is linked to the appointment of eight of the 15 advisers.
The Jerez Group gives shareholders a 15-day deadline to notify their interest in the sale of their shares.
CNMV assured that it had not been informed about this offer, although the company Ruiz Mateos confirmed that it had contacted the Authority.
At a closure, the deposit would amount to 611.7 million, while the value of Sos is 254.27 million.
Meanwhile, Sos continues to restructure his management.
In an attempt to stay on the edge of possible purchase offers and the court crosses of his former managers, the brothers Jesús and Jaime Salazar announced the appointment of María Luisa Jorda as head of the internal audit.
A decision by which she becomes the first woman to hold a high position at the food company.
This is a newly created post, which is directly under the chairman of the group.
This is all other than polemics-free, because the company is involved in a court battle over the suspicion of diverting more than 230 million Sos from other Salazar family companies.
It cannot be ruled out that Sos will move further capital over the next few months.
With regard to Salazar’s loan, former advisers Ildefonso Ortega and <0xC3><0x81>ngel Fernández Noriega (representatives of the CCM and Unicaja) came before the National Assembly yesterday and confirmed that they had approved the transfer of 212 million without knowing their destination.
CNMV approves the public exclusion tender submitted by the investment company Mer by Paternina
The National Stock Exchange Commission (CNMV) approved the public exclusion tender submitted by the investment company Mer for Federico Paternina on 9 October.
The Supervisory Authority stated that it approved this call after it had been proven that the conditions were compliant with the law-enforcement laws and therefore the content of the Biblical declaration submitted, following the amendments of 2 December, can be considered "adequate".
CNMV has also announced that this offer aims at acquiring 550.008 shares of Federico Paternina at the price of 7.65 euros per share, which in turn is 8.95% of the company’s capital, consisting of 6.142,786 euros in eligible shares on the Madrid and Bilbao exchanges.
In addition, it was also announced that 5,592,778 million shares have been fixed, which cannot be transferred in any way until the end of the tender, and the price of which was fixed by Federico Paternina in accordance with the law in force.
New Vehicle Inspection Programs
In these days of storms and accidents, not only the KFZ workshops deserve
Every day, thousands of vehicles involved in an accident are dragged to the workshops, where a reviewer has to assess the damage incurred and the cost of repair.
Not a single accident is the same and calculating the cost of the parts and working hours can be a long and complicated task.
The calculation of the repair costs of between 20,000 and 30,000 euros per hand, including parts and hours of work, can take up to two or three hours.
On the other hand, with the support of the latest computer tools, it is a matter of minutes.
That’s why almost 100% of reviewers use this type of system.
The service and application providers for accident assessment and repair collect the information they receive from the manufacturers in order to process them thereafter and offer them to their customers in the form of a useful program.
In Spain, Audatex, part of the American Solera Group, is the market leader; 80% of all reviews are created with its products.
The other two companies competing with the tool market for reviewing and reporting are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data provided by the manufacturers is anything but simple.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, Sales Manager of Audatex, 63 manufacturers and importers are working together, each of whom makes the information available in a different format.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed is increasing to the point that in the last five years more versions, variants and motorizations have come to the market than in the total fifteen years before.
As soon as a new car arrives on the market, the work begins for the companies.
It is a difficult task, because each individual of the thousands of vehicles must be cataloged and its price entered.
In addition, each model creates an "intelligent" graphic image, on which you can "click" different parts of the vehicle.
If it is a much-sold model, the work can be completed in one week if the procedure goes ahead quickly.
If it is a less conventional car, it can take up to three or four months. At present Audatex has complete information for 99.2% of cars sold in Spain.
Among the more exclusive models, for example, they have information about the Porsche models, but not about Ferrari or Lamborghini.
In terms of the vehicle fleet on the roads, it is more than 99%.
For the purpose of carrying out the documentation work and the production of databases, Audadex has eight centers worldwide (Spain, France, Germany, the USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan) and each of them has specialised in specific brands.
The National Headquarters is located in Alcobendas (Madrid).
More than a hundred technicians (usually mechanics) work there simultaneously with three computer screens.
Audatex invests <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>90 million annually in the development of these databases.
Every month, they record 2.5 million data and their customers receive updates every second day.
The development of this huge flow of information enables companies to use it in different ways and thereby offer different products.
The most common use is the use for repairs and repairs, but depending on the country there are also tools for managing waste parts or for calculating the fault or residual value of a car.
The only company that knows about the value of used cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not offer this offer in Spain but in the United States.
When reviewing the products Audatex offers, you can easily get an overview of the kind of support it provides to the industry experts.
This company offers ten different tools, the star of AudaPlus products, a standard solution for assessing accidents for reviewers.
It includes vehicles, motorcycles as well as light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it includes the estimated repair times or the lacquer prices of the manufacturer.
This tool is paid depending on the purpose of use, i.e. for each review.
The most expensive is for customers who rarely use it, a maximum of ten times a month, namely 5.75 euros per month.
On the other hand, every insurance company that makes thousands of reviews negotiates the price with Audatex.
With other products, such as AudaVIN, it is possible to fully identify a vehicle and the equipment with which it ran from the assembly belt, only by means of the chassis number.
AudaGlass deals with the vehicle discs, and AudaSubastas is an online service open to the specialist market, which allows you to provide for vehicles that have been declared as total damage.
Your statistical service is very useful in identifying trends, conducting geodemographic analysis, or for obtaining information about the deviations by brand and model.
For example, you can examine how many models of a particular car brand had to enter the workshop due to pans or how many of them were involved in a serious accident over a given period of time.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of computer tools.
It distributes, among other things, Gt Estimate, which is also intended for reviewers and provides the same kind of digital images, access to shares or prices and official working hours of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa Group, founded in 1971 as a provider of services and solutions for the investigation of damages, pans and maintenance of vehicles.
The GT Guide for Reviews is a reference product on the market.
They work with 24,000 users in workshops, 3,100 reviewers and 53 insurance companies.
Its turnover has increased by 20% annually over the last three years and in 2008 its turnover was EUR 10.8 million.
At the beginning of last year, they also started to go on the international market with the opening of an office in Paris.
Audatex was founded in Germany in 1966 and established in Spain in 1979.
According to sources of the company, 62% of its business is in Europe and the rest of the world, and the remaining 38% in North and South America. They work together with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 workshops, 3,000 of them in Spain.
Total worldwide sales of the Solera Group (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) amounts to <0x24>557 million, 3.35 more than in 2008.
In this country, the company has a revenue of 19.1 million euros, 7.2% more than in the previous year.
In 2005, the Solera Group was valued at <0x24>1 billion and today its shares are traded at <0x24>2.4 billion.
Since 2007, they have been on the New York Stock Exchange and are part of the Standard & Poor's index.
Increase of accident cars on the Internet
Last October, the Solera Autoonline Group purchased an online platform for the sale of accident vehicles and motorcycles.
This purchase meant a payment of EUR 59.5 million for 85% of the company’s capital, which could increase to the remaining 15% in the following year.
The purpose of this purchase was to offer its customers more services and increase value, with the opportunity to gain access to a huge international market.
This inspection and purchase service is exclusively aimed at industry professionals, such as insurance companies, auditors, car rental companies, workshops, landfills and car dealers who need to register before their activities.
Established in Germany in 1996, this platform manages more than 650,000 operations across Europe, 500,000 of which are in Germany alone.
Their main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
Today, the website has more than 1,500 registered sellers and 4,000 reviewers.
3,000 ads are managed every day and 100 new ads are added to the Spanish market every day.
Under Spanish law, a vehicle whose driver’s seat number has been cancelled may no longer drive on the roads, but certain non-damaged parts may be used as spare parts.
On the other hand, cars with historical value may be re-authorised, even if they have been cancelled after difficult authorities.
The cost plan of the workshop in four steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, Audadex ensures that the user receives a cost quote in just four steps: identification of the vehicle, searching for the spare part, creating and creating a cost quote.
The easy handling of these systems is a fundamental condition, especially to convince older professionals, who are usually more or less against the use of these new computer techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, 666 of which are passenger cars, 109 off-road cars, 137 motorcycles, 78 small cars and 44 trucks.
Of course, a computer with internet connection is needed for use.
After the model to be repaired has been identified using the chassis number, a graph of the respective model appears and the required spare part is selected.
The user can include variables, such as the price for the working hours, surcharges or discounts, and then he can print the cost estimate and pass it on to his customers.
However, AudaTaller is not a review tool like AudaPlus, but rather a reference catalog.
The main difference between the two systems is that the workshop-oriented does not include estimated working hours.
The cost of using this tool is 350 euros per year, an amount that the customer can pay without further delay.
The company Audatex is currently working to offer these images in three-dimensional format.
This is an innovation that auto mechanics have been waiting for for a long time, because you can choose a door with it, for example, and then turn the picture completely to look at the inside.
