Welsh's AM (Member of the Assembly) is concerned about 'images like mepet'
Among some members of the Assembly is the suggestion that the title of their post should be changed to MWP (Member of Wales).
The reason for this is that the Welsh Parliament has been planned to change the name of the Assembly.
All the AMs involved in the scope of politics are concerned that this could be their joke.
A Labor AM said that "it should not be added to Twp and Pwp" his group was concerned about this.
For readers living outside of Wales: In Welsh, twp means stupid and pwp means dirt.
"""The whole group was not happy"""" and he has suggested other options."
A Welsh political party said that his group was "independent" about the name change, but noted that the MWP could be merged with orally small changes in words.
In this context, the pronunciation of the letter w in Welsh is exactly the same as the pronunciation of the letter u in Yorkshire English.
With regard to the name change, the Assembly Commission, which is currently preparing a legal settlement, said: "What the members of the Assembly are called upon to say, the final decision of any whistleblower in this regard will certainly be a case for the members themselves."
Under the Welsh Government Act 2017, the Welsh Assembly has the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission was informed of the results of the public consultation on the proposals in which the Assembly had received sufficient support for the Welsh Parliament by changing its name.
In the case of the title of the AM post, the Commission supported the Welsh MPs or the WMP, but received the most support in public consultation the MWP option.
Apparently, AM is suggesting a number of other options, but it's getting quite a hard time getting a common consent for the deputy officer, Allen Jones, they hope to submit a legal deal for the change within a few weeks.
Other changes in the manner of work in the assembly, including the format of the rules and committee system for the ineligible AM, will be included in the drafting of the law for the amendments.
When discussing the construction of the law, AM will receive the final vote on the question of what they should be summoned to say.
Macedonians are going to vote to change the country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday whether to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia" or not.
A popular vote was called for to resolve a decades-old dispute with neighboring Greece, a province of which is also called Macedonia.
Athens has already insisted that its northern neighboring country's name refers to its province and has repeatedly objected to its membership talks in the EU and NATO.
A rival Macedonian president on the name change of the referendum said he would overlook the vote.
However, Prime Minister Zoran Zeew and supporters of the poll have argued that the name change is only for joining the EU and NATO.
Churches in Harlem are declining St. Martin's clocks are declining
"For the things that relate to history I have spoken to the elders, I have told them that at first there were bars and churches on every corner,"" Adams said."
"Today, it's all over."
He said there is a shortage of time.
"""Today people's society is becoming in a different way,"" he said."
"The bars are no longer like the neighborhood's living room where people go every day."
For the churches, they are concerned that the spending of the money that is being sold from the property will not last for more days, as expected by the leaders, "and soon this money will be gone or later they were the leaders who would come to the exact same place, from where he came from."
He further added that it is possible that churches have been converted into proprietary apartment buildings in which people of various sorts live, which will not help keep the remaining places of worship safe.
He said, "The number of people in these buildings will increase, and there will be a time when these churches will be completely shut down, because most of them are not likely to come, and most of them are not likely.
A decade after St. Martin's, in 1870, the Black Metropolis-Metropolitan community of Harlem was created by the Gore people of both churches.
The native blondes of the Methodistic Religious Society passed away in the 1930s.
These buildings were occupied by the Ashwaites of religious society who worshipped in the surrounding places of worship.
That pastor at St. Martin, John Howard Johnson, took possession of a white religious society that led to the removal of retailers on 125th Street. It was the main place for shopping in Harlem, where the place was kept and the main place for shopping.
The building was badly damaged due to a fire in 1939, but it was started to play here for hours after Father Johnson's followers planned to rebuild it.
Father Johnson's son and Saint Martin's successor, David Johnson, said the work of proudly playing hours was "opening the doors of luck to the poor."
The expert who played an hour in July described it as something like this: it is "a cultural heritage" and "an invaluable historical instrument".
Tiffany NG, an expert at the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first time in the world to be played by Asian musician Dionysius A. Lind, who played a very big hour at the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merrieweder said that no other person was placed in his place in St. Martin.
Whatever has happened in St. Martin in the past few months has become a complex story of craftsmen and contractors, some of which have been appointed by the common leaders of the church and the rest by the provinces associated with religion.
Westry (where the goods of worship are stored) was given the right to parishes made up of common leaders - in July, the province was concerned that the province would not "demand to fulfill the vows and vows" for the Westry, even if the Westry province was not the only one.
Some pastors of the area complained of lack of clarity on the part of the province.
A 13-year-old shark has been injured while scuba diving to catch a cake.
Officials say on Saturday a shark attacked a 13-year-old teenager and wounded him, at the time he was holding a cake plunging into California on the opening day of the Lobster season.
The attack took place between the beaches of Ansinitas at 7 a.m.
Chad Hammel of San Diego's KSWB-TV said on Saturday morning that he was diving with friends for about half an hour, at the same time he heard a boy screaming for help. He heard a loud voice for help, and then he watered him with a group.
Hammel told him that first he felt like the boy had voiced the enthusiasm to catch the cake, but then he felt that he was screaming, 'I'm cutting something!
I'm cutting something!"
Hammel said that when he saw the boy, he found that the boy's entire chest had been broken.
Hammel said, "I heard the voice of all that they should come out of the water: there is a shark in the water!"
A teenage boy was admitted to Reddy Childron Hospital in San Diego, where his condition is being said to be serious.
The species of the attacking shark has not been identified.
Lifeguard Captain Larry Gills said in a conversation with the media that a shark was discovered in the area a few weeks ago, but it was found that it is not a dangerous species of shark.
Giles further noted that the victim's top spot was seriously injured.
For the purposes of investigation and security, the authorities have blocked access between the Ponto Beach of Casblad and the Swamis Beach of Asinitas for 48 hours.
Giles said there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to go to the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's beauty products will include department store-style boots, superdrugs and Debenhams by appointing expert assistants.
Despite the continued decline in the sales of fashion goods and household goods, it is going to join the UK beauty market with a good amount of 2.8 billion pounds, which is going to grow in these huge quantities of tobacco and explore beauty products in 11 stores across the country.
The investment being made in Beauty is being made in the supermarket, which aims to find its place in the market after bringing TV, microwave and household goods.
Sainsbury's said that it will double its products for the first time by bringing up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing products from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more opportunities with branded products available in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket is also restarting its boutique makeup products, so that most products are vegan-friendly - this will increase the demand for small-sized shoppers to some extent.
In addition, Parfum Retailer Fragrances Shop will also examine the specialty at two stores at Sainsbury's, the first of which was opened last week in Croydon, South London and the second opened in Celi Oak, Birmingham at the end of this year.
Online shopping and local convenience stores, i.e. the supermarket, are undergoing more and more efforts to increase the visit of people in shifts that are declining the amount of food they sell each day.
Sainsbury's chief executive, Mike Coupe, said that people like department stores on the outlets will come faster because the supermarket chain has more services and non-foods. Discounters Aldiand Lidl from Kidl
Sainsbury's is putting outlets of Argos in hundreds of stores and has opened several stores since two years ago since it took over both channels, which shows that the sale of shopping goods has been promoted and has made the deal more profitable.
The supermarket had failed in its last attempt to re-market the beauty and pharmaceutical products.
Sainsbury's had been doing business together with Boots in the early 2000s, but it had to end this joint venture due to the way it splits into revenues from pharmacy stores in its supermarket.
Three years ago, Sainsbury's sold 281 stores of the pharmacy business to Lloyds Pharmaceutical Chain owner Celecio for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million, after which a new strategy emerged.
It said that Lloyds will play an important role in the plan in four stores along with La Roche-Posay and Vichy as well as many of the best luxury skincare brands.
Paul Mills-Hix, Commercial Director of Sainsbury's, said: "We have changed the shape-color of our beauty products so that we can increase the environment for our customers.
In particular, we have also added trained colleagues who will help us in providing advice.
We’ve built our brand range according to everyone’s needs and attractive environment and in convenient places, which means we’ve reached an attractive destination for beauty products that challenge the old way of shopping.”
Peter Jones reveals "Narazhi" after splitting Holi Willi from 11 million pounds deal
With Marks & Spencer and ITV focusing on their new contract when TV presenter Holly Biluby brokered the <0xC2><0xA3>11m deal for the lifestyle brand business of Dragons Den, Peter Jones, and Jonna Jonna's "Jonna's "
Bilubi doesn't have time for its own homewear and accessories brand Truly at all.
A comparison of the two was made with the Goop brand of Gweneth Paltro.
This 37-year-old morninging speaker announced his separation on Instagram.
Holly Biluby separated himself from his enchanting lifestyle brand business at the last moment with Dragons Den star Peter Jones - so he could fully focus on his new best contract with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources have found that when the Golden Girl of TV came to Kentucky on Tuesday, Kentucky found out that Kentucky's new deal, which cost him <0x24>1.5 million, was to be accepted by Kentucky during a stressful meeting at Jones' headquarters in Buckinghamshire, Kentucky.
The business was being compared with the Goop brand of Gweneth Paltro and was considering doubling it from the estimated 11 million pounds given by Willby.
The 37-year-old Willow announced on Instagram that he was really divorcing, after which Jones left the UK to go to his holiday home.
A source said: "Holly's priorities were truly top ever.
It was being considered its long-term future, making it a brand that would go a long way in the next few decades.
His decision shocked every person involved in this business.
What happened on Tuesday, no one could be sure about this, it was too close to starting.
The warehouse in Marlo Headquarters is filled with goods that need to be sold."
Experts believe that the UK’s richest star is likely to lose the form millions of dollars by differentiating it from this morning’s president because it has also invested a lot in clothing and homeware, including cushions and candles.
This can also result in a long-term friendship.
Bilubi's three children and husband Dan Baldwin have been close enough to Jones and his wife Stara Cape for the past ten years.
True started with the Cape in 2016 and was joined by the 52-year-old Jones Chairman in March.
Baldwin's share of couples and Jones is 40 per cent of those who spend their holidays on the TV production farm.
Bilubi has now become M&S's brand ambassador and will be placed in place of Agent McCartlin to host ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
"""We wouldn't want to talk about their business,"" a close source told Jones last night."
"Serious talk, and then we agreed."
He jokingly said that the media would continue to comment on them, some would consider it "a different job from the presidential post" and would become much more positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much of his life?
Trump said his performance in the "News Anchor" Voice.
"""I didn't give up on anyone."
Kim's interest in the second meeting after his first meeting in Singapore in June, he said, was a major step taken by Trump in the first meeting to make North Korea nuclear-free.
However, free nuclear talks have been suspended.
After more than three months of the summit in Singapore in June, North Korea's top diplomat Ree Yong Ho told leaders around the world at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that "North North Korea's initial dismissal" was not a pre-war.
Instead, he said, the U.S. has continued to put pressure to maintain the sanctions.
Trump's rally speech saw his very optimistic outlook.
"We are committed to building good relations with North Korea,"" he said."
"We were going to fight with North Korea.
In which millions of people are killed.
Now our relationship has become very good."
He said his attempts to improve relations with Kim have brought positive results - including completing the rocket test, helping to free the hostages, and bringing back the remaining U.S. troops to their homes.
At the same time, in discussing relations with Kim, he defended his abnormal approach.
Directly pointing to the crowd in front of him, Trump said, "It's very easy to stay in the presidency, but 10,000 people out of the country are trying to join this area, we will have about 200 people to stop them."
An island has been hit by earthquakes and earthquakes in Indonesia, hundreds of people have died.
After the earthquake in Lombok, foreign non-governmental organizations were told for the incident that they did not need them.
Despite the outrage of more than 10 per cent of Lombok's population, no national disaster has been declared, as well as a condition to provide international aid.
"Unfortunately, in some circumstances, they were clearly showing that they were not asking for international help, so it has become a bit more challenging,"" said Sumbu."
Still, Sev the Childron visited Palu with a team, but so far it has not been determined whether the employees of another country can come here to help.
The spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, Mr. Sutopo, said that Indonesian officials were assessing the status of Palu, they were watching whether or not international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the aid effort.
In view of the repeated occurrence of such situations in Indonesia, it seems that the country is not being prepared at all for the outbreak of nature.
However, they have been built shelters for people suffering from sunnam, but they are not like shelters taking place on other beaches.
There has been a decrease in the cyrane of warning for anomaly in Palu, no matter how suspicious the warning is, it is likely to increase life losses.
Whether it’s the best time to go back and forth, going between the many islands of Indonesia is a challenge.
Dealing with merchants and goods from natural disasters is always complicated.
The earthquake victims are being taken to a hospital in Lombok for treatment that is far enough away from Palu and takes at least three days to get here from a new disaster site.
President Joko Vidodo has raised the issue of Indonesia's very poor infrastructure for his election campaign and he has spent enough money to improve roads and railways.
But, Mr. Joko's administration has diminished due to a lack of funds as next year's elections will be re-elected.
Mr. Joko is also under pressure from communist tensions in Indonesia, where Muslim-majority members have made religious ideology more conservative.
More than 1,000 people were killed and more than 10,000 people were homeless because Christians and Muslims were fighting each other on the streets, using snipers, arrows, and arrows and other dangerous weapons.

The statue of Cromwell, built in front of Parliament, has recently become the most famous monument, being re-listed in ‘History’
Its expulsion would be ideal for the destruction of many of England's entire cultural and religious arts, such as its Taliban, created by his hardcore Purinton followers.
But, the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's suggestion as "stupid" and "trying to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "The ongoing debate on the removal of the statues was full of fear that the statue of Oliver Cromwell would be painted outside the Palace of Westminster.
No order was given for the symbol of the English Civil War, nor did Cromwell make it.
It may be wrong that Cromwell had renounced the works of his predecessor Thomas in the last century.
According to Sir William Hemo Thorocroft, the best representation of Cromwell is evidence of the 19th century ideas and part of the history of a sculpture that many still consider to be admirable.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sande Telegraph: "Many people respect Cromwell, perhaps that's why most people still today know him as a defender of parliament against external pressures in the case of imperialism at the end of the 19th century.
However, they are considered to be absolutely accurate representatives, which have historically been the subject of debate.
It is therefore obvious that the development of our nation has been taking place since the conflict in the mid-17th century, and the sculpture of Cromwell has remained a personal identification in which a side of that division appears.
"""Their achievements as Lord Protector are commendable and memorable."
A deadly pig attacked a Chinese farmer and killed a farmer.
According to local media reports, a pig attacked a farmer in a market in south-western China, killing the farmer.
The South China Morning Post said on Sunday that only as a person's identification was discovered his nickname "Yuan", serious injuries were found on his body, in the market of Ljupansui in Jaipur province.
On May 30, 2005, a pig-breeding farmer was preparing to vaccinate pigs in pig farms in Xinjiang, China.
He allegedly came on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs in the market with his wife, who lives near the Yunnan province.
The next morning, his brother-in-law died and it was found that a pork door was opened in the vicinity.
He said that a large male pig was seen in a pig’s beak with blood on his mouth.
According to the report, a forensic investigation confirmed that a pig weighing 550 pounds attacked the farmer and killed him.
According to the Guiyang Ewing News, his nicknamed "Wu" Kazan said, "My Kazan's legs were blood-stained and completely wounded."
Security camera footage showed that Yuan had come to the market on Thursday morning at 4.40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was recovered about an hour later.
The pig that attacked the person was not Yuan or his kazon.
A market manager told Ewing News that the pig was kept shut down so that it could not attack a person, although the police collected evidence on the spot of the incident.
The people of Yuan's family and market officials are allegedly negotiating compensation for his death.
However, rare cases of attacks on people by pigs have also been recorded earlier.
In 2016, a pig in Massachusetts had attacked a woman and her husband on their farm that seriously injured the person.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig had attacked a Welsh farmer, at the time he was on his tractor, he attacked the farmer until his wife frightened the animal.
In 2012, a farmer from Oregon attacked his pigs and killed him and made his own food, a farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are generally not aggressive, but they can be "dangerous" when they get the taste of blood.
"They're just playing.
They cut off their teeth and search a lot ... they don’t have to hurt you.
You just have to give them enough respect," he said.

Since, on Monday, Rosa as a tropical hurricane, the market is in the form of a volcanic hurricane, and it reaches the California peninsula in the vicinity of Nashika Oshika, which is close to the Ishikawa Peninsula.
There will be 10-inch rainfall in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
After that, in the coming days, the moisture coming from the rain will bring heavy rains to the south-west along with the tropical moisture.
Locally, there will be a possibility of hazardous flooding, debris spills and landslides in the desert due to 1 to 4 inches of rain.
The rainfall rate will be 2 to 3 inches in some places due to excessive tropical humidity, especially in some areas of southern Nawadha and Arizona.
The south-western part, especially in most areas of Arizona, is likely to have 2 to 4 inches of rain.
Tropical rainfall can cause a lot of flooding with poor conditions due to the nature of the rainfall.
Taking into account the risk of tropical rainfall, it will be advisable to stay out of low-level deserts.
Due to heavy rains, ghats can become hazardous rivers, and as the cloud is needed, rapid winds will flow and dust will float in local areas.
There will be a lot of rainfall locally in some parts of the southern California coast due to the coming storm.
A total of more than half an inch is likely to rain, which can cause some amount of dirt and become a slippery condition on the roads.

Temperatures can change rapidly throughout the U.S. in October as the weather in the Arctic cools at this time, but keeps warm enough in tropical areas.
Occasionally there are strange changes in temperature due to this low distance.
The strange changes in temperatures in the central U.S. on Sunday are a good example of this.
There is a temperature difference of about 20 degrees between Cannes City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the next few days, due to the heat that will occur, the weather will become hot and the heat will increase.
In most parts of the central and eastern U.S., the weather is expected to warm from October, which can be widespread in some areas of the northeast from the southern fields to the 80s.
New York City's temperature could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees above average temperature.
According to our long-term climate forecast, we are getting a hint that there are enough chances of staying above average U.S. temperatures in the first six months of October.
More than 20 million people have heard of Bret Cavenaugh
More than 20 million people on Thursday witnessed the trial of Bret Kavanaugh and the woman who accused Bret Kavanaugh of sexual harassment allegedly committed in the 1980s, the woman's name is Cristine B.
Meanwhile, political turmoil was also seen, broadcasters on Friday's last-minute tweet: An Agitation Engineer stopped the regular program of the Arizona Army. The case was filed by Jeff Flake of the FBI after being arrested for a week.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was absolutely certain that Kawanugh at a high school party had tried to drank him naughty things and take off his clothes.
Kavanaugh, defending himself, said he is absolutely certain that this did not happen at all.
It is estimated that more than 20.4 million people saw this report by Nielsen on Friday.
The company was computing average audiences on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Statistics for PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network as well as other channels showing it were not immediately present.
In addition, Nielsen usually has some difficulty in computing those who see in offices.
From this point of view, it is equal to the number of spectators of a playoff football game or academy award.
The Fox News Channel, which the host considerably supported Cavanaugh's appointment, was ahead of all the channels, with an average of 5.69 million viewers present during the whole day's hearing, Neilson said.
The number of spectators on ABC was 3.26 million and it was second.
There were 3.1 million on CBS, 2.94 million on NBC, 2.89 million on MSNBC and 2.52 million on CNN, Neilson said.
There was a lot of interest in the audience.
Fleck was a central figure in the drama that took place on Friday.
A statement was issued on behalf of the office of the Liberal Republican after a term of office saying that they would raise their voices on behalf of Cavanugh, who were coming to the cameras of CNN and CBS on Friday morning, to attend the hearing of the protesting judicial committee at the time.
When they were being said no words, at the time they were standing their eyes bent for a few minutes, it was seen live on CNN.
One woman said, "Come on, I'm standing in front of you too."
"Do you think they're telling the country the right thing?
They were told, "Have you been brought into power to make many women powerless?"
A statement from his office was issued before the closure of the elevator and said that they would be able to keep their entire speech in the hearing of the committee.
When the Judiciary Committee was advancing Kawanugh's nomination for the vote for the entire Senate, the cable and Broadcast Channel were still showing all things live after several hours.
But, Fleck said they would do so with full understanding that the FBI will look at the charges against individuals appointed next week, which are being called for by a minority Democrat.
Fleck talked about this with his friend, Democratic Sen. Chris Coons.
After discussing with Couns and several senators, Fleck made his decision.
Fleck liked the power very much, because it was clearly showing that the Republican would not get the vote by giving Kawanugh a manzure without the investigation.
President Trump has handed over the FBI's probe for allegations against Kavanaugh.
The British Prime Minister has accused critics of being 'politicizing' the Brexit in May.
In an interview with the Sunday Times Newspaper, Prime Minister Theresa May told critics that they would stop playing with Britain's future by making "politics a game" in the European Union and put their full focus on the national interest.
On September 29, 2018, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Theresa, could join the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK.
On the first page of the newspaper, right next to his interview, his interview with former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson was printed in which Boris Johnson had a so-called "checker plan" and a so-called "checkers" like "Keeper" and "Keeper-Keeper" because of his upside-down attack.

Police clashes with separatists from Catalonia on the occasion of Independence Vote Aviation
Six people from Barcelona were detained following a clash of freedom-supporting protesters with the police on Saturday, and thousands of protesters took part in the first anniversary of the celebration of the independence in Catalonia.
A group of Nakabposh supporters of separatists threw eggs and powder paint on the raiding police, causing the street to blacken, usually causing trouble to the coming-and-goers.
The police used their paddles to cope with the clash and also later intervened.
Liberty-backed groups chanted "no forgetting, no apologies" for several hours while union protesters chanted "Spain remained immortal."
According to a report by the local press, 14 people who were injured as a result of the demonstration were treated.
According to Madrid, the October 1 referendum, which is believed to be illegal, has been increasing tensions in independent-thinking areas for a year, but the separatist-thinking people of Catalonia were celebrating it.
Voters for freedom chose a very good way, though few people were strongly opposed to voting against secession.
When police were trying to prevent people from moving forward at the polling stations in the area between the clashes, Catalonia officials said, about 1,000 people were injured last year.
Groups in support of independence had been there for the entire night on Friday to help the National Police to stop the demonstration.
The demonstration was pushed forward, but he had to be forced to make a different decision.
The 68-year-old electrician Narcisse Terminus, with his wife, had come to take part in a separatist protest, he said he was not seeing any chance of independence from Catalonia.
"It was our best year last year.
"I had seen my parents vote for joy, but it looks like we're trapped now," he said.
Even with a small victory in the regional elections held in December last year, Catalonia’s independence supporters have struggled to maintain an influence with many of their famous leaders this year, whether it be in order to expose themselves in a controversy or to organise and free voting.
42-year-old mechanic Joan Puig, who recorded the opposition on his phone for police assistance, said the conflict between politicians on both sides had been halted.
"""It's become very stressful,"" he said."
On Saturday, Orol Junquers, one of nine Catalonia's leaders who have been in pre-treat prison since late last year, announced that they will fight in next year's European Parliament elections.

Menga defeated Livingston by 1-0 against the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal secured Livingston's victory
According to the Ibrox club manager, the fast-growing Livingston shocked the Rangers, leaving Steven Garard to take responsibility for his second loss in 18 matches.
Dolly Menga's strike made the difference that Gary Holt's side motion with the Hybrid in the second part of the match equalized.
Garard's side has been one step away from winning this season's premiership and will face the leaders Hertz next Sunday, who are behind eight points.
Earlier, on Thursday, the Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna in the Europa League.
Meanwhile, Kevin Miller has consistently won in the six-game division by bringing head coach Holt in place last month.
Livingston has been missed by the visitor to show his game
The team of Holt should have gone on ahead of scoring long enough, as well as, because of their excellent game, the Rangers had a variety of problems.
Scott Robinson broke the record, but left behind an attempt to score, then Alan Lithgo could only remain direct after slipping his best efforts so that the goal in the header of Craig Lightet could be completed.
The hosts had the chance to play against the Rangers, they knew they could put the visitor in difficulty on set grinds.
And because of this, he scored an important goal.
Rangers got a free-kick and Livingstone opened, Declan Gallegher and Robinson worked to set up Menga, who hit a touch and scored from the center of the box.
At that stage, the Rangers had strengthened their position, but the Home Defence failed and the goalkeeper Kelly remained far behind,
This pattern was also running in the second half, though Alfredo Morales insisted on being a save on Kelly.
Scott Pittman's shot was blocked by Rangers goalkeeper Alan McGregar and Lithgo took full control of the game by flicking from the other Livingston.
The crosses in the Livingston Box were continuously coming and continuing to be rounded, while two penalties were claimed after the challenge of the lighthouse, one of which included bringing Glenn Middleton and the other on the handball.
Analysis of Livingston's "Extraordinary Goal"
BBC Scotsman Alaska Lammont joins Tony McCarroni Arena
Livingston's outstanding performance and results.
For any person, they were the best, they have continued to increase expectations on this growing transition.
The way he plays and personality has changed surprisingly since his return from the top flight, but the most credit goes to the way he has re-arranged the team since his arrival.
He had a lot of the best players.
Captain Hulket was the best player, he served in a great way, while Menga put Connor Goldson and Warl behind him.
However, there was a lack of learning in Rangers.
The kind of great performance he has performed several times under Jerard, they were less than their standard.
Their final ball was short of - they had only been able to cut to their home side open once - and it was like some wake-up call for the Rangers, who kept themselves in the mid-table.

Due to Hurricane Rosa, there is a risk of rapid flooding in Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City (dry areas can benefit)
Hurricane Rosa has remained at risk in tropical areas after colliding with the Arizona, but it's very likely that it's the same one that made this hurricane in the coming week. The very remaining capacity of the hurricane is the Dashert Southwest effect.
The National Weaver Service had already announced on Monday and Tuesday that the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City as well as the southern and western parts of Arizona are in the south and east of Nevada, south-eastern California.
With the rain on Monday evening, it is expected that the entire phoenix will be cleared directly from Rosa on Tuesday.
The National Weaver Service, located in Phoenix, tweeted, "Since 1950, ten tropical cyclones within 200 miles of Phoenix have maintained the state of tropical hurricane or depression!
Catarina (1967) was within 40 miles of the Hurricane Azede range.
Recently, the National Hurricane Center model has predicted that there may be 2 to 4 inches of rain in Arizona's Mongolian Rim, as well as 6 inches of rain.
The Central Rockies and the Great Basin, as well as other areas of the Desert Southwest, are likely to rain up to 1 to 2 inches, as well as, it is likely to have up to 4 inches.
Outside areas at risk of rapid flooding, the rainfall of Rosa can be proven as there is drought in this area.
However, flooding has remained a very serious concern, but the drought situation in the southwest has now remained, which is likely to benefit greatly from rainfall.
According to the U.S. Drout Monitor, only 40 percent of the area in Arizona is very dry, it is the second highest-ranked drought," the weather.com report said.
First, Hurricane Rosa Mexico's market will pass through the California Peninsula.
The maximum air velocity of Hurricane Rosa on Sunday morning was 85 miles per hour, at the time it was 385 miles south of Uzbekistan, Mexico, and it is now heading north at a speed of 12 miles per hour.
The storm is currently in the cold waters of the Pacific region, which is causing its power to decline.
Thus, it is hoped that the force of the tropical storm could create an earthquake in Mexico at noon or evening on Monday.
In some areas of Mexico, heavy rains are likely to increase the risk of flooding.
According to a report by Weather.com, "It is expected that the market from North-West Sonora in California could rain up to 3 to 6 inches, as well as, it is expected to be 10 inches."
Rosa will then become a tropical hurricane on Tuesday morning before reaching the Arizona border to the north, after which it will head south to the Arizona and southern Utah on Tuesday night.
"The most dangerous market from Rosa or its remaining parts is California, northwestern Sonora, and the U.S. Desert Southwest where heavy rains are likely,"" Hurricane Center said."
It is estimated that these rains are at risk of mass flooding and debris in the deserts and may cause earthquakes in the mountainous areas.

The earthquake occurred after a 7.5-intensity earthquake.
Sutopo Purvoo Nugroho, spokesman for the Indonesian disaster minimization agency BNPB in Jakarta, said, "Yesterday when the threat of suicide occurred, the people present in the meantime were engaged in their activities and were not in the situation of immediate exit."
"Sunami was not only the cause of the deaths of people, but it also dragged on the ground, wrapping cars, logs and houses," Nugroho said. "Before the attack on the beach, the sunami was about 800 km/h (497 miles/h)
He said some people climbed the trees and defended themselves in order to avoid the flood.
16,700 people were evacuated from 24 centers in Palu.
Photos posted from the plane by the Disaster Agency have shown that many buildings and shops have been destroyed, bridges have been turned and collapsed and a mosque has also been surrounded by water.

It's very scary.
Aid groups began to seriously bring goods for disaster relief, some complaining that foreign aid personnel with specialised expertise are being banned from coming to Palu.
According to Indonesian rules, money, goods, and staff can only be taken from abroad if the disaster zone is declared as a national disaster zone.
But, it hasn't been done yet.
A spokeswoman for the Red Cross in Indonesia, Aaliyah Aaryani, said, "This disaster is still at the provincial level."
"After being said by the government that it's okay, it's a national disaster, then we can only involve international aid personnel in the rescue work but it hasn't happened yet."
Even after the second night of the earthquake and sunnami on Friday, people in Palu who had not been able to identify friends and family members were expected to find their loved ones miraculously somewhere as they would after natural disasters.

Mexico's AMLO has sworn not to use the military against unmilitary civilians
Mexican President-Candidate Andres Manuel Lopez Obredor, on completing the country's 50th anniversary for deadly retaliation against students, has vowed that the military force will never be used for unmilitary citizens.
Lopez Obredor on Saturday pledged that "military force will never be used to put pressure on the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, soldiers shot at a peaceful movement in Plaza, killing more than 300 people, at a time when the left-wing student movement was spreading throughout Latin America.

The U.S. has to double the fund given to A.I.
Kei-Fu Li, a low-priced investor and AI businessman for Google, Microsoft and Apple, said that as China is becoming more active in Artificial Intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount of research spending in this area.
After a number of work by the U.S. government, the AI has commented on this, he also said that there is a lack of a general formal AI strategy in the U.S.
In the meantime, last year, China launched a plan: it aims to reach number 1 in AI innovation by 2030.
"""The AI research will have a great start from doubling the budget, looking differently at all other countries, so the U.S. is far behind this case, and we are trying for AI's next success."
In an interview with CNBC this week, Lee said, "By doubling the fund, the likelihood of AI's next major achievement in the U.S. could be doubled."
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houston Miflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, they are one of the best AI companies in China.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that left the most-ranked American othelo player behind, and later he joined Microsoft Research in the post of executive and Google's China branch.
Lee further outlined the technical skills of the previous U.S. government, which included the challenges of the Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency's robots and said who would be the next government to find the next far-sighted
"""Researchers in the U.S. often face enough difficulties to get government aid,"" Lee said."
"It's not China removing academic leaders, it's a corporation,"" Lee said."
In recent years, Facebook, Google, and other tech companies have appointed seniors from the university to work on AI.
Lee said the U.S. could get help in its AI efforts by changing the immigration policy.
"""I believe that permission to obtain a PhD in AI through a green card should be obtained on its own,"" he said."
In July 2017, the State Council of China issued its next-generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan.
"The National National Science Foundation of China has given financial grants to the people of the Academic Institute in the same way that the National Science Foundation and other government organizations don't give financial grants to the researchers of the U.S., but to the students in China," Li said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defence opened a joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which aims to include partners of industry and scholars, and the White House secreted the Artificial Intelligence Key.
In addition, this month, the DARPA launched an initiative on behalf of AI Next which spoke of an investment of <0x24>2 billion.
For NSF, this investment is now more than <0x24>100 million per year in AI research.
In the meantime, a law was created in the U.S. that the demand to create a National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence would be ignored for months.
Macedonians voted to change the country's name or not
On Sunday, the Macedonians voted to change the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia" or not, it is a work that will resolve the decades-old dispute with Greece. This was the result of which the Greek nation has been battling for decades.
Greece also has a province called Macedonia, it says that its northern neighbor's name is on its territory from which two names have become for the same claim and it is already included in NATO and the European Union.
Both governments made a deal in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents opposed it and said that changing Macedonia's name would weaken the ethnic identity of the majority of people living in Slovakia.
President George Ivanov said that he will not cast a vote in the polls and eliminate the campaign, he has raised doubts that the minimum 50 per cent of the votes required for this vote will be valid.
The question on the ballot will be written: "Do you approve of the agreement with Greece to join NATO and the EU?"
Prime Minister Zoran Zev, along with supporters of the name change, said it was necessary for Macedonia to become a member of bodies such as the EU and NATO, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"Today I have come to vote for the future of the country, this is for young people in Macedonia, from which they will be able to live independently in the roof-shaped life of the EU," said Olivera Georgievska, 79, living in Skopje.
However, it is not legally being stressed for it, the majority of MPs say they will work according to the results of the vote to make it decisive.
A two-thirds majority is required to change the name of the parliament.
The State Election Commission said that no irregularities had been reported until 1 p.m.
However, when the previous parliamentary election was held in 2016, the vote was only 16 per cent compared to 34 per cent, with 66 per cent of registered voters voting.
Gozo Tanevsky, a 62-year-old elector who lives in Skopje, said: "I had come to vote for my children, our place is in Europe."
The Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zev, and his wife Zorica and son Dushko went to vote in Macedonia to change the country's name, so that on September 30, 2018 the country's name will go to Stromica, Macedonia, NATO and the European Union.
54-year-old Wladimir Kavardarkov, who was sitting in front of Skopje, was preparing a short-stage and people who were opposed to the vote were sitting in front of their tents.
"We need NATO and EU membership, but we want to join it by raising our heads, not through an agreement,"" Kavdarkov said."
"Our country is poor, but we also have our own pride.
"If they don't want to give us membership on behalf of Macedonia, it's okay, we can become part of Euro-Asia integration by joining other countries like China and Russia."
Prime Minister Zev has said that Macedonia will receive very important investments to join NATO, the unemployment rate here is more than 20 per cent.
"""In my opinion, more than 80 per cent of our citizens agree to join the EU and NATO,"" Zhev said after his vote."
The result of the "yes" will be "confirmation of our future."
A poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research found that 30 per cent of the required voters will participate in the polls.
A second poll conducted by Macedonian Telma TV on Sunday revealed that 57 per cent of people are planning to vote.
Of these, 70 per cent of people agree to vote in yes.
More than 50 per cent of votes are needed to be successful in voting.
If the vote fails, the western government's policy that will take place in May last year would be the first serious blow.

In addition, they are trying to weaponize power by using other essential means, which you know is pointless and pointless.
To get power and control, they don't care who's sad, who's capable of it, they just want power and control to get them here, but we won't let it happen."
He said the campaign of the Democrat is "to put up resistance and barriers."
"In addition, you can see what has happened in the last four days, the rage of the Democrats you've seen and also seen how meaningful and evil they are."
He referred to the name of Democratic Sen. Diane Feinstein, whose appreciation was strongly appreciated by the audience, referring to the Senate Judiciary Committee.
"Remember his answer?"
Have you leaked the document?
What?
"No, I'm waiting for that thing - whose body language was really bad - such a bad body language I saw for the first time."
Work is no longer a broad church.
For those who say the words of their own mind, it is not worth paying attention to them.
When the activists who promoted my local party voted for me to choose, it was a big surprise to me.
After all, I am the newest among those Labour MPs whose importance has remained quite low - we can't say everything in our minds.
My MP also came here with my colleague, Jon Ryan, because he also raised a voice for socialism.
In my case, Sensor Motion condemned me for disagreement with Jeremy Corbin.
Responsibility on the importance of an economic policy, on national security, on the same issues as travelling in Europe, on which Jeremy disagreed with senior leaders.
"""We want all things to be included in the meeting and these to be beneficial"""" for the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday."
During my eight years as a local laber MP, I mostly saw here that the Friday night GC meeting was exactly the same.
Sadly, there is no consensus in many meetings today and whether it is promised that the politics of "dealous and depraved people" is really forgotten, even here.
It is clear that if the views are different in the Labour Party, they are not accepted and are decided for every consideration whether it is eligible for the party's leadership or not.
Soon after becoming the leader of Jeremy, I started here, for whom my colleagues had already thought that they had political opinions like me, they expected me to turn away from my things and work on those positions that I could never agree with.
Whenever I raise a voice for the public - and it really doesn't matter what I say - I get to see bad words on social media, it's a sharp remark on it, the politics of the center is not condemned and I'm told that I can take it
Besides, it's not just my experience.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues because my comments are related to politics.
I know about the way those businessmen work and I’m dedicated to those associates who always face sex or racial abuse, but don’t back away from raising voices.
There are many disappointing aspects in today’s political era, one of which is how to normalize levels of abuse.
Last week, Jeremy Corbin claimed that the Labour Party needs to promote a culture of intolerance.
The reality is that now we have not stayed in the Broad Church and every proposal of "unbelief" or change in the party's selection roulette has become very little.
Over the past two years, many people have advised me and urged me to remain silent, not to speak anymore, and then I will be considered "right."
But I wasn’t in politics for that.
32 years ago, when I was involved with work as a school student, I was forced to oppose the Tachar government, I was told to completely abandon my school’s extensive classroom, even if I wanted to give them better public services than I ever wanted to.
I have never concealed any of my policies, including the politics in the last election.
There is no person in Nottingham East who has any doubts about my policy position and any area of disagreement about my current leadership.
I would like to say to all those who promoted the proposal on Friday that when the country is moving towards a Brexit that is damaging our homes, businesses and public services, I do not understand how to show my time and effort to show my honesty for the Labour party.
But, in fact, I have a message that is not for Nottingham Momentum, it’s for my supporters, whether they’re laberian or not: I’m proud that I’m serving you and I can’t promise you that I’m going to take any kind of risk or politics in my work.

Iron 38 - 17 Melrose: Arriving at the top of the offensive iron
The two late attempts may have had some impact on the final result, but there is no doubt that the Iron Tenant's premiership was worthy of victory in this best entertaining match.
Now they're just top in the table of 10 uninjured sides.
In the end, his defense was the best, as much opportunity as he could find him, which was why he pushed the domestic team forward and gave coach Peter Murchi a chance to be happy.
"We've completely checked our game and we're still offended, so it makes me happy,"" he said."
Robin Christie of Melrose said: "This credit goes to the iron, who has spent as much of their opportunity as possible."
In the 14th minute of Grant Anderson's attempt, Frisier Klimo faced the Iron, but the Verriers gave Scottish player Rory Hughes a yellow card for the game, which Kool Prakaya Praghaya Koss gave the Melrose a chance to score and Bajan Jay.
With the help of the Penalty just before the half-time, Climo increased the iron, he scored and then tried to unilaterally beat the match from 17-5 for the iron during the break.
But Melrose was better in the second half and Baggot turned Patrick Anderson's effort into a goal, reducing Levee's five points.
Subsequently, Ruridhih Nott suffered a serious injury due to which the game had to be stopped for quite a while, he had to be extended, then after the start of the game, Ir stepped forward through Stafford McDonald's attempt to change what he had done.
At the time, IR team captain Blair McFerson was given a yellow card, and after that, due to too much pressure at the end of the game, the Melrose gave Extra Man Bruce Colvin an attempt that failed to beat him.
However, the host team remained behind and when Struen Hutchinson was given a yellow card due to face-off of the ball's climax from the Penalty Line-Out, McFarson pushed the iron forward.
After collecting David Armstrong's box kick by Kelly Rowe and sending Flanker Gregor Henry away for home side's fifth attempt, Climo turned it into a round, as they could when the game restarted.
The star of the game is still looking for a new career in the restaurant industry
The game's star Ford Kiran is still looking for a way to go to the hospitality industry, some time ago it was discovered that he was selected as the director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old Jack has joined the famous BBC show Jarvis, in which he works as a writer and co-starring comedian partner Greg Hemphill.
Both have revealed that the upcoming ninth series will be their last series in the world of the show, and it seems that what Ernest has to do after Craiglang they are planning it.
Based on the official record list, they are the directors of Adriftmoren Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, yet a Scottish Sun source found an indication that Kearnin wanted to join a "old restaurant trade" located in Glasgo.
'Our Right to the Sea': Land-Detained Bolivia hopes that the Court will reopen the way for the Pacific
The military-navyk are largely patrolling in the Newal Headquarters of La Paz.
The blue-ocean flag is being lifted on government buildings.
The naval base spread from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon has a saying: "We have a right to the sea.
It is our duty to get it back."
The coastal region of Bolivia, which lost to Chile in the terrible conflict for land in the 19th century, is still desperate to get its land - they want to re-launch their address in the Pacific once again.
He now hopes that decades earlier they will be able to regain their Bolivian land, as it is awaiting judgment from the judge of the International Court on October 1, after five years of deliberation.
"Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calajila said, ""There's enough excitement in Bolivia now, there's a sense of unity and peace here, and there's going to be a positive result in the hopes of the people here."
Many Bolivians will see the ICJ's big decision on the big screen across the country, hoping that the judgement from the Hague court will be in favour of Bolivia - which has been in talks for decades - through the talks to Chile
Bolivia's greatest president, Ivo Morales, who is facing a controversial confrontation in next year's re-election, has also expressed positivity in Monday's roulette.
"""We are very close to getting the Pacific back,"" he said last August."
But, some analysts believe that the court's decision will not be in the interest of Bolivia - and if the decision also comes in its interest, there will be enough conditions.
The UN body in the Netherlands does not have the right to reward the Chilean province, and it has decided that the possible outcomes of the talks will not be determined.
"Chilean court expert Paz Zaret said the ICJ's decision will come six months after the final negotiations, which indicates the hearing that the case was not "complicated."
In addition, unlike Bolivia's conditions, for the past four years it has seemed that it could return to its old state.
"The issue of access to the sea has been blocked by the current government of Bolivia,"" Jarrett said."
He suggested that the controversial statement of Morales has put an end to Chile's remaining reconciliation.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk on some terms, but it will be very difficult to talk this time after the decision is taken.
Since 1962, the ambassadors of the two countries have not lived in each other's countries.
Former Bolivian President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltz has denied that the court's decision was an abnormally rapid one.
He said on Monday there would be "a great opportunity for Bolivia to open the way for new relations with Chile" and it would be "a chance to end 139-year-old disagreements for mutual benefit."
Cialis has rejected the fact that Morales - who is still one of Latin America's most famous presidents - was doing politics on the maritime issue.
"Bolivia will never retreat for its right of access to the Pacific,"" he said."
"The decision is an opportunity to go about what we needed to do in the past."
North Korea has said the nuclear inspection will not be stopped until it is trusted to the United States
North Korea's foreign minister, Ree Yong Ho, has said that his nation will not destroy its nuclear bomb until it trusts Washington.
Ree gave a speech at the General Assembly of the United Nations on Saturday.
He told the United States that he would fulfill the pledges made during the summit between the leaders of the other country in Singapore.
He commented that U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems to be about to restart nuclear power after more than three months of promises made in North Korea's Kim Jong-un Singapore.
Ree said this is a "pipe dream" that would be seen as a North loss by sanctions and U.S. opposition to the declaration of an end to the Korean war.
Washington is cautious of the consent of the ongoing major disarmament campaign without the announcement of Pyongyang.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump both want to have another summit.
But, it’s completely suspicious that Pyongyang is serious about ending the inspection of the nuclear bomb because they don’t want to jeopardize the country’s security.
Kim-Trump is planning to go to Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second summit, which will be on both sides.
A lot of new design headwear for your nearest high street appeared at the Paris fashion show.
If you need to increase your hat collection or completely save your head from the sunlight, you don’t have to wait any longer.
Valentino and Thomas Brown both designers have created a series of the best headwear for their SS19 collection on the runway that appeared in the famous Paris fashion week of special style.
The best Benefimand Hats are made to avoid this year's heat and these designers have sent their beautiful creations to showcase in the show.
The best hat made by Valentino was large enough, it was decorated with the wide brim that was hung from four sides on the head of the model.
The second large-sided accessory included watermelon hats, wizard hats and pineapple hats made in beige design - but they are not designed to save your head from the cold.
Thomas Brown also showed specially-designed masks - and they can only be used in time for Halloween.
Looking at many colour-beginning masks, people were surprised and saw things like Hannibal Lecter more than the haunted kitchen.
All kinds of accessories for scuba diving were seen in one creation including snowballs and glasses, while in the other creations were seen the design with a melting ice cream corner.
In addition, if you've seen too much fashion - you're naive.
Style-seeking enthusiasts expect this best collection to be able to reach the great stores around you soon.
The very large-sized Hat La Bomba will come with a designed heel, from the two-foot wide-breamed Stroh Hat Rihanna to Emily Ratazkovsky.
A cult label was placed behind the best-selling hat that looked pretty beautiful, shown with the second Creation Catwalk posted on social media - showing the model wearing a swimsuit on a straw beach bag.
The Burnt Orange Rafia Bag was trimmed with Rafia Fringing and wore a white leather handle, it was the best attraction of the la Rivera SS19 collection in Paris fashion week.
Fashion celebrity Luck Armitage told EMail: "I hope that big hats and bags will be coming soon for the upcoming summer season - because the designers are so impressed with it that it's hard to get to the bottom of the bag stores.
John Edwards: It is necessary to have language skills for citizens of countries outside of the United States
Scottish private schools keep track of the best education record, and since 2018 it has continued to deliver the best exam results, making it a success in sports, arts, music and other community endeavors.
More than 30,000 students across Scotland are affiliated with the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), led by which these schools are trying to provide the best service to their students and parents.
The goal of private schools is to prepare their students for better and higher education, their chosen careers and their substitutes are benefiting the citizens of foreign countries.
As an education sector, which can build and implement the school curriculum, we are seeing that modern languages in schools continue to be chosen as an alternative to the popular and desired subject.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If you speak to someone in a language that understands him, you become the best for him.”
If you talk to him in the same language, his heart is very good."
When we want to build a relationship and trust the people of other countries, we think we can trust the English more.
In the recent results of this year's exams, we can see that languages with the most passing rates in private schools are at the top of the league table.
68 per cent of them are students who have received the highest grade A in foreign languages.
The data collected by 74 members of SCIS schools can be seen: 72 per cent of students received the highest grade A in Mandarin, while 72 per cent of students received the highest grade A in German, 69 per cent were students of French.
This shows that private schools in Scotland are collaborating in foreign languages, giving children and young people the necessary skills that they will need in the future.
Languages are now incorporating as an alternative subject the courses of private schools and other subjects such as STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics).
A 2014 survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills found that employers struggled enough to recruit employees in vacant positions, 17 per cent of the candidates were those with a lack of language skills.
Therefore, it is becoming imperative for young people to have more language skills to prepare for their future careers.
These skills are essential for working anywhere in the world, due to the increased potential employment opportunities that language requires.
Whatever the reason for choosing any option for a career, if people have learned a second language, they will need to benefit from such skills in the future.
If you are able to speak directly to foreign people, then being a multilingual person will lead you to the competition yourself.
In 2013, more than 4,000 adults in the UK participated in the YouGov survey, according to which 75 percent of people could not speak enough in a foreign language and only French was the subject that 15 percent of people could speak and reached a double-digit percentage.
That is why today it is important for children to invest in language teaching.
Having a knowledge of many languages, especially the languages of developing economies, children will be able to have a better chance of finding the right jobs.
Languages taught in each school in Scotland will be different in different ways.
There are also many schools that will focus on more classical modern languages, while other schools will teach languages whose approach is towards 2020 and which are considered the most important for the UK, for example, Ninja or Mandarin.
No matter why your child is interested in learning any language, they will always be able to choose that language in private schools and they will also meet the teaching staff who are experts in the field.
Scottish private schools are dedicated to providing an educational environment that will prepare children for the future and give them the skills necessary for success, allowing them to move forward in the future.
For the global business environment, the fact that learning languages in the country is very important for the future cannot be ignored, so it should be given a better place in education.
In fact, modern languages should really be accepted as "international communication skills" .
The choice of this choice, diversity and excellence will continue to be given to young people in Scotland by private schools.
We have to do it right.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.

Next week, Trump has set up five and rallyes that include Tennessee and Mississippi as well as other friendly venues.

When will Trump's rally be held in West Virginia tonight and how will you be able to watch it online?
The time for Trump's rally in Welding, West Virginia is set for tonight on Saturday, September 29, 2018 at 7 p.m. ET.
You can watch Trump's rally in West Virginia online via live streaming on YouTube.
U.S. Supreme Court candidate Bret Kavanaugh could deliver a speech at this week's hearing, while the Senate voted for a week during FIT investigation over allegations of sexual assault on Kavanaugh.
But, the main goal of the rally is to help the Republicans face the elections that will be held in November.
According to Reuters, so during the campaign, President Trump said, "The target of these five rallyes next week is to protect and increase the Republican effort to protect and defend the majority of their detained in the Senate and the House of Representatives."
According to Reuters, the spokesman who has been removed from Trump's campaign, he said, "Congress control has become so important for his agenda that the president will visit only those states where our campaign will be very seasoned.
According to the West Virginia Metro News, "Determined in the Wesbanco Arena of Wheeling, the attention of supporters of Ohio and Pennsylvania from tonight's rally can be brought to the Pittsburgh media."

Rider Cup 2018: Team USA showed a willingness to compete so that expectations of staying at the top in Sunday singles can be maintained
After three one-sided sessions, the fourth session on Saturday afternoon will give a glimpse of what is going to happen in this rider's cup.
The passage of time cycle is a completely new concept for players, but when a player goes forward and which player to trust, it cannot be guessed in competitions like these.
So, what are they going to say about this moment?
"""They had a six-point hike that now has four left, so I think we need to increase our speed a little,"" said Jordan Speth, who was the day's spokesman.
Obviously, Europe got a benefit and went ahead of the game by 12 points to four points.
According to Spiteth, the Americans think they have little or no chance left and there is a lot to encourage, not only in the form of Spiteth, but also in the form of Justin Thomas, who got to play together all day and both of them with their own hands.
From spython tea to green, it’s deadly for everyone and even the best in the game.
As they progressed to their game, people cheerfully played strong balls, when they and Thomas went down two more points after two, making an important punch to complete four all-square.
Just because of his put, his team came in 15th position with the same screen, a sort that tells you that you don't believe the American team out of it.
"""You really just have to play great and keep in mind that winning is yours."
That's what they say all the players who have gone out of the game.
18 holes to make a mark.
The only two players with more points than Spyath and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Flittwood, who are making a new history in the riders' cup.
With different styles from Europe, but better pairs scored four points in four and are ahead of each other.
"""Mollywood"" was the only couple who did not shoot any Bogi, but they stayed away from Bogi until Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and Friday morning before nine o'clock.
On Sunday, the way he ran and got that run was found in this powerful crowd and in this powerful crowd as if he were a beating player, and there is no player who could have turned the European team's possible win into a defeat before it would have seemed like the Fleetwood or Molinary were the only ones who could lose.
It is good that the two are on different holes in different ways.
However, the dignity of Europeans is being done quite a bit earlier.
Bobba Watson and Web Simpson made it a little easier for Forball hero Sergio García in the morning, at the time their pair was made with Alex Noreen.
In front of the nine dogs, Spaniard and Swede scored a bogie and two doubles, never before they had even gotten there.
However, there was no one on Sunday who would help you get to your hole.
Foreball and foreplay were very good at looking because the interactions between the peering were quite good, he advised that they do not need to take advice and they are very familiar with the way they change the strategy.
As a team, Europe played very well and took a significant lead in the last day, but this quarter-season also showed that the team has the ability to compete in a manner that is suspicious, especially in the state side.
On the last day of the rider's cup, Europe rose by 10-6
Europe will benefit in a good way on the last day of the Riders Cup following a 10-6 lead in the United States and a quarter-final match against the United States on Saturday.
The best couple Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari took the lead on the Tiger Woods struggling with two wins so they can take their match far beyond the four points of the golf national.
Two years ago, Thomas Beaujoir's European Side Morning Foreball defeated the Hezbollah to retaliate for his loss of the trophy, leading him to a 3-1 lead in the series.
The U.S. showed a lot of resistance in the quarter-finals by scoring two wins, but they could not escape losing.
Jim Furick's side needs eight points in Sunday's 12 singles matches to keep winning the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European to win four points consecutively, while he and Molinari had started from "Mollywood" after the Sensational Weekend, the second pair to win their first four races in the Riders Cup history.
After losing the Woods and Patrick Reads in the foreball, he again defeated the best players Woods and American Reiki Bryson Dashambu by 5 and 4 points, giving him a better performance than before.
Woods, who went ahead in two matches on Saturday, has shown his best performance, but now they have faced 19 losses in their 29 matches of Foreball and Forests and their seven matches of roosts.
In the rest of the morninging foreball, Justin Rose returns to the foreground with his partner Henry Stanson and defeats one-third of the world's top three players Dustin Johnson and Brooks Copeka by 2-1.
However, in the south-west of Paris, there was no break in Europe on the day of the Brizzy.
The three-time winner, Jordan Spith and Justin Thomas, set a benchmark for the Americans by earning two points on Saturday.
He scored a splendid 2-1 win over Spain's John Rahm and Ian Polter in Foreball and sent Pauls and Rory McLaroy back in the starting two holes by 4-3.
This has only happened twice in the history of the rider's cup when a team came back from a single-match match by getting four points, though the needed side of Furyk attracted everyone's attention in the trophy.
However, the counter-attack that will take place on Sunday after staying second-best for two days will be as different from their old game.
North Korea said there is no way to say "disarmament" would be just one side that can't be trusted
North Korea's foreign minister said on Saturday that the United Nations had continued sanctions that depended on its distrust in the United States and showed no way to stop inspecting the nuclear bomb on its own.
Ree Yong-ho said at the World Body's Annual General Assembly that North Korea had tried several ways last year that were linked to "essential means of reconciliation," such as, to stop nuclear bombing and missile testing, nuclear bombing, and nuclear bombing.
"However, we have not found an answer to this from the United States,"" he said."
"There will be no trust for our national security without relying on the U.S. in any way, and in such circumstances there will be no way that we will begin unilateral disarmament."
While Ree reiterated that the complaints made by North Korea in view of the disarmament are about Washington's "step" approach, under which it would not be necessary to gradually take advantage of North Korea, even if it could be a step-by-step one, this matter is entirely from his statement.
At the first summit held in Singapore on June 12 between the U.S. President and the North Korean leader, Ree Jong made reference to Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump's joint statements in which he said that "Keeping up the Korean Peninsula" was a "Keeping up" at the time.
North Korea is demanding to formally end the Korean war in 1950-53, but the United States says that Pyongyang should first abandon its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also objected to the call to lift strict international sanctions on North Korea.
"The U.S. has first insisted on disarmament and increased the level of pressure on the sanctions so that it could achieve its purpose strongly, and, at the same time, it has also objected to the "declaration of an end to the war."
"Blocking can bend us, such a perception is a pipe dream of those who are ignoring us.
But the problem is that our confidence is becoming less and less from the constant restriction."
Ree did not discuss the plan for the second summit between Kim and Trump, he said that the U.S. leader had highlighted the beauty of the United Nations last week.
Instead, the minister discussed at three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon J-in over the past five months and further stated, "If the disarmament problem is not the issue of disarmament, the party would be in South Korea and not in the U.S., then the Korean side would be
Yet, Ree's speech was very different from last year's speech, when he said about the U.N. National Assembly that "M. Evill was the President of the United States with the North Korean rocket after Trump, calling it "Rakete Man" on the Sudden mission.
In the United Nations this year, Trump, who threatened last year to "completely destroy" North Korea, praised Kim's courage to be lifted for disarmament but said there is still much work to be done and the sanctions will remain in place until North Korea ceases.
On Wednesday, Trump said that he had no time limit for it, "If it takes even two years, three years or five years - it doesn't matter."
China and Russia are debating whether Pyongyang should be rewarded for the steps taken by the UN Security Council.
However, on Thursday, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council: "The Security Council bans should remain in force until we realize that we are completely, completely, without failure."
The Security Council has extended the ban on North Korea in 2006 to deposit funds for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile program with full agreement.
Pompeo met with Ree at the UN General Assembly and said he would return to Pyongyang for a second summit next month.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his previous visit has not been a good one.
He returned from Pyongyang in July and said that work had progressed, with North Korea condemning him for "gangster-like demands" within just a few hours.
North Korea has decided to destroy the missile site at its lunar meeting this month and if the United States adopts "consistent measures", it will also destroy the nuclear site.
He said Kim had promised him a "decent measure," he was urging security guarantees that Trump would take a resolution in Singapore and he went on to build a normal relationship with Washington.
Harvard's students are taking courses for a sufficiently relaxed job
The University of Harvard has launched a new course this year that is for all undergraduates who are struggling to study through 'all-nighters' with caffeine-fueled. More-than-the-moderates are competing with the growing Macho culture.
The world's number one teacher who teaches students at a university often has no choice when it comes to things that are quite common as to what to do to relax.
Charles Caseysler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brighman and Wimness Hospital, has created a course for which he believes it is the first of its kind in the U.S.
After talking about the impact of less sleep during teaching, they came up with the idea of starting this course.
He told The Telegraph, "I got a girl at the end of the year and she said, 'Why do I always say that I have to go to class next year?'
She said no one told her about the importance of sleep - which I was shocked."
This year, students will come to this course for the first time to discover how important good sleep habits in study-writing and athletic performance are, in addition to improving their overall health.
Paul Barrera, Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Executive Director of Health Services of the University, said that students do not sleep enough every week for which the University began the course.
A series of interactive tasks have been included in the course that runs for hours.
In one section, there will be a picture of a dorm room, where students will click on coffee cups, curtains, tutors and books to tell you what will affect caffeine and light and will also be told about the day, as well as to tell about the lack of sleep, such as athletic performance.
In the second section, participants will be told that a lack of adequate sleep can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
The interactive iconic map of the campus will be shown, then the participants will be encouraged to think about their daily routines.
"""We know that this will not immediately change the behavior of the students,"" Professor Zesler said."
"But, we believe that they should have information about this - just as smoking has information about the impact on health,"" he said."
"There is still a culture to experience the pride of 'waiting up all night reading', the growing pressure on modern technology and students means they need less sleep which has become a growing problem," he said.
Whether you sleep well enough or not, ensuring that students are like ‘the lost weapon’, that they can cope with stress, fatigue, and anxiety, he said. It also saves them from the effects of sleep deprivation, which is also the likelihood of weight loss, which saves them from sleep deprivation.
19-year-old Remond So, from California, who studied chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Jessler build a course that he completed last year's class in Harvard.
He said that because of the course, they became aware and were inspired for the Campus-Wide course.
In the future, they expect that it will be considered necessary to complete this course for all postgraduate students before joining the Competitive Institute.
Pro Jessler suggested that students should consider setting an alarm before going to bed, as well as, they should also decide when to wake up, and they should be aware of the detrimental effects of the 'blue light', which can be exited from electronic screens and LED lights.
Livingston's Rangers 1-0: Menga scored against Garard
Due to Dolly Menga's strike, the Rangers faced trouble in another match, being responsible for Livingston's 1-0 win put on the wrong side of Steven Garard.
The Ebro side was looking for their first win after a 4-1 win in the match played in St. Johnston in February, but Gary Holt's team pushed Jarkiard to the second loss in 18 games, so that Landbrock could be the manager of Jarkiard.
Before the half-time, Menga went on strike for seven minutes and then the Rangers' line-up shorts didn't even get a chance to match the game once.
However, the Rangers have now fallen to sixth place in the rankings, Livingston has reached third place and is behind only the Hybrid due to the goal difference.
In addition, since the injury to the head of Linesman Calm Spans has been treated after clearly being thrown on the other end of the object, the game can be even more troublesome for the Rangers.
Due to the eight changes made to Garard's side, the previous air was given the opportunity to go to the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt was included in the same Levi 11 who took a point from the Hearts last week and the way he drilled the opposing team in a good way was bothered at every turn.
The Rangers could have won the match, but Livingston played better than they did.
When Menga first sent Scott Pittman to go to the goal of Allan McGregor, he should have given him only two minutes of time, but the midfielder spared the great opportunity he had found.
Kegan Jacobs, who was in the deep when he free-kicked, went to Captain Craig Lightet, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgo, who was on the back post, could only extend the staff.
The Rangers then gained control, but they were more confident in their game in the final third than they were in expectations.
Definitely Alfredo Morales experienced that he should have imposed a penalty on the quarter-over-mark because he and Steven Lolas had collided with each other, but the referee Steven Thompson had denied the Colombian appeal.
The Rangers saved two shots on the Target in the first half, but Ibro's former goalkeeper Leiam Kelly faced difficulties from Lasana Colibaly's header and Tv OV Azarya's strike.
However, Liv could have gone against the Open Run of the game in the 34th minute, but no one can deny that they are entitled to this graph alone.
Even after that, the best player in the Rangers Deep couldn't beat Jack.
When Deacon Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, Scott Arfield did not show any interest in it, Scott Robinson had calmed the manga to pick up for a simple finish.
When Garard swaped Collebel for Ryan Kent and switched to show immediate effect while slotting by the wing in Morales, he had taken a break at the time, but Kelly blocked his line by running well.
But, Livingstone showed the visitor the same game as the kind of game they could really enjoy, he swapped the long ball with Lithgo and Lightcat after the long ball.
Holt's side in the final stage could have increased his tip, but McGregor prevented James from stud-up well before widening from the corner by Lithgov.
The Rangers summoned existing Glenn Middleton as an option, he made another Let Claim for the Penalty because they were confused with the Jacobs, but Thomasson did not let them succeed again.
Almanac: The Inventor of the Georgia Counter
Now a page of our "Sandy Morning" wing: 136 years ago today, September 30, 1882 and later... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
For the method of detecting and measuring radiodermite, Geiger invented a device that was later known as the Geiger Counter.
Geyser Counter Science is a major base of science, it has become the main base of pop culture, as well, in 1950 a film on it was made "Bells of Coronado", in which scientists Roy Rogers and Del Evans first acted:
Man: "What does he do for the world?"
Rogers: "This is a geyser counter used to detect radioactive minerals such as uranium.
"After turning on these earphones, you can definitely hear the impact of the atoms hidden due to radioactivity in the minerals."
Ivans: "Come on, it's definitely poping right now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, at the time he was 63 years old.
But, because of his invention, his name is still alive.
Cancer's new immune system can 'see' bad cells from new vaccine
Cancer’s new immune system can ‘seen’ bad cells and eliminate them
The vaccine instructs the immune system to identify bad cells during treatment.
This method can remove and replace the immune cells of a patient in the laboratory.
After that, the common protein for many cancers can be 'see' and then it can be replanted by removing it
In a trial for vaccines, prospective results are being seen in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman was given this vaccine, which saw her malignant cells present in the immune system, then it was seen that her dementia cancer, which has been present for more than 18 months, has been eradicated.
This method can remove a patient's immune cells in the laboratory and replace them, so that they can "see" the common protein found in many cancers called HER2, and then re-extract the cells.
"Our findings show that the vaccine is very promising," said Jay Barzowski, a professor at the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland.
Pro Barzofsky said that due to HER2, "there is the development of a variety of cancers", which include breast, dementia, lung and colorectal cancers.
Patients' immune cells are beneficial in the treatment of a kind of leukemia to "instruct" them to remove and detect cancerous cells.
After his SNL presence, Kanye West on the MAGA Hat condemned Trump's old controversial speech.
It didn't go well
After Kanye West's best performance, in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said that he would be his government in 2020, he condemned the studio during Saturday night live.
Following the performance of his third song of the night called Ghost Town, in which he wore the Mac America Great Cap, he condemned the Democrat and reaffirmed his support for Trump.
"So, I talk to goofy people many times and they say, 'What's the reason for you to like Trump, they're racialists?'"
"However, if I was concerned about racism, I would have left the United States quite a long time ago."
SNL started the show with Matt Damon's sketch, in which the Hollywood star made a joke about the case of Bret Kavanaugh, it's already known that the Senate Judicial Committee is already playing the sex kinetics on them by Christine Blake Ford.
However, nothing has been shown, the footage of West's condemnation had been uploaded on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It was not clear whether Rock was trying to fly West's laughter with posting due to the post.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he was threatened to go to the backstage with his headwear.
"They threatened me with a backstage.
"""Don't go there wearing that hat,"" he said."
They've threatened me!
In addition, he also said that I have been trapped in the wrong place," according to the Washington Examiner.
West said, "Do you want to see the wrong place?" As well, he said, "They'll make plays for my Superman Cape, because that means you can't tell me what to do with me. Do you have a desire to move on with the world?
"Love it."
In his comments, he cited the audience at least twice and felt embarrassed by the artists of SNL, a person in a separate report told the publication: "The whole studio was completely silent."
The singer was called West due to the delay in Ariana Grande's arrival, a few days ago the death of former Boyfire rapper Mac Miller of Ariana Grande.
The West surprised many viewers by performing on the song I Love It, she was dressed like a Perryar Bottle.
West met again with TPUSA's lead Candas Turner, who tweeted: "Thank you for raising your voice for one of the bravest people: for the people."
But, the host of the tock show, Karen Hunter, tweeted that West Bus is just there "what she said and what is absolutely amazing."
"But, I didn't choose someone who would benefit (by buying my own music or clothes or by supporting my 'art') who in my opinion is promoting the wrong idea for my community or misrepresenting my community.
He is free.
That's why we exist," he said.
Prior to the show, Rapper tweeted that he had changed his name, as well, saying that they were just "officially going to be known as Kanye West."
They weren't the first artists to change their name, but Diddy and Puffy had also done so before whose old names were Puff Diddy and P Diddy, respectively.
With him, rapper, snoop dog's old name was snoop lion and the late famous prince of music had also changed his name to a symbol and after that the artist was already known as the prince.

Game of Thrones star Kit Herrington raises questions about toxic mass culture
Kit Hrington is known for his sword-smithing role as John Snow in HBO's Violent Midvalle Fantasy Series Game of Thrones.
But, the 31-year-old actor has asked about the role of Macho Hero, he said that seeing such roles on the screen many young boys are often inspired by them and they feel it is necessary to do such hard work to gain respect.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit explained that he is feeling "something wrong" and asked how to end the problem of <0x23>MeToo <0x23>MeToo <0x23>Toxic Massachusetts.
Recently, Kit married his co-star of Game of Thrones, 31-year-old Rose Leslie, who believes he feels 'a lot of strength' in talking about the problem.
"""In private, I think it's pretty firm that right now - are we doing something wrong about Massachusetts?""
“Do we teach men that when they grow up, they will have to face the problems that appear on the screen?”
Kit thinks that television may be partly responsible for the Toxic Massachusetts, he thanked a lot of the male prime minister for it.
He continued, "What is happening and what is being taught?"
Anything that is taught on TV and on the street, young boys think they have to do something certain to be a man?
In my opinion, it has indeed become one of the great questions of our time - how can we make a change in it?
'Cause it's obvious that there's something wrong with the ideas of young men.'
In an interview, he also believed that when the Game of Thrones series comes back at the end of next summer, they will not take part in any of its prequels or silhouettes, as well, he also said that they are the 'shorts and battlefields' riders.

HIV/AIDS: According to the report, there has been a 14% increase in new cases in China
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of people suffering from HIV and AIDS in the country.
Health officials have said that more than 820,000 people across the country are suffering from the disease.
Only in the second quarter of 2018, about 40,000 new cases were reported.
In view of the recent changes, most of the new cases are being referred to as sex.
Traditionally, HIV is spreading rapidly in some parts of China due to infected blood infections.
At a conference in Yunnan province, China's health officials said the number of people suffering from HIV through the virus had been nearly zero.
However, the number of people suffering from HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 each year.
HIV infection from the sex by the LGBT community in China is a serious problem.
In 1997, homosexuality was promoted in China, but it is reported that the LGBT community has enough discrimination against people.
Studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women due to the conservative importance of the country.
Due to many infections of the disease, there is insufficient security regarding sex in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has tried to solve this problem, for which everyone has been promised that they will be given access to HIV medicine.
Maxine Waters denied that his employees had leaked the data of the GOP Senator, he called it a "dangerous lie" and "a way to conspire"
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters lamented the allegations made on Saturday, saying one of his employees had posted three personal information of the Republican U.S. Senator on Lomaker's Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that the investigation of the claims was being conducted by the Pandit and the website of the "ultra-right wing".
Watters tweeted, "Lies, lies and a lot of disgust."
The information allegedly included the addresses and phone numbers of Utah's home of South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham and Utah Senator Mike Lee and Orin Hack.
The information was viewed online on Thursday, which was posted by an unknown person, as the Senate panel was in the process of hearing charges of sexual abuse against the person appointed to the Supreme Court, Bret Kavanaugh.
The three senators were questioning Kavanaugh about the leak of some information.
According to Hill, a conservative site such as Gateway Pundit and RedState identified the IP address trick that identifies the source of the person posting, it was reported that the source was connected to the office of Waters and that an employee of Waters was the owner of the account.
"This allegation is completely unfounded, erroneous and absolutely false,"" Waters said."
"No employee - whose identity, personal information and security is being put at risk due to these false and false allegations - was in any way responsible for the leakage of this information.
"This accusation is unfounded, completely wrong and absolutely false."
Watters soon posted online for clearing criticism, including the former press secretary of the White House, which was also included.
Fletcher wrote, "This is the reason for the rejection of anger."
"It is known that his character is not the kind that a member of the Congress should be.
When someone is charged, they should not come in anger and do so.
They should not be rebels.
They should not ask questions about the person who has accused.
They should be calm and be patient."
It seemed that compared to the response of Fletcher Waters, the judge was condemning Kavanaugh's Democrats, critics on Kavanaugh had accused him of being very angry during the hearing on Thursday.
Republican candidate Umar Nawaro, who was to lose the Waters in the Midterm Election, also tweeted his opinion.
He tweeted, "If it's true, it's a very big thing."
In his statement, Waters said that his office had warned the appropriate officials and entities applying the rules for these claims of fraud.
"We will make sure that the offenders will be told about or not, and that they will be legally held liable for all the acts they do that are too bad and dangerous for any and all of my employees,"" he said."
Johnny English Strikes Again Review - Rowan Atkinson's spy action was not considered too reluctant
From a British point of view, the importance of Brexit in any new film is still traditionally seen and it appears to have been applied to this review of Johnny English's action-comedy sponge franchise. It was renamed Renny in 2011 and Reborn in 2003 with John English in Johnny English.
Will we self-examine the question of what kind of shit we certainly believe to be talking about the new export opportunity of the nation?
Johnny English has a license with a pop-up approach and a rubber face at any rate, so that base-footed things can be rebuilt - which is much more famous than any other thing by his name. He's too famous for those areas.
They are certainly the Daft Secret Agent who has managed to show Mr. Bean's Dash Clouso a little too much in spite of his bizarre dungeon in Smoothy Glamour and was a dollop for the Chapel of the Cheerleaders who made the Olympic Opening in London 2012.
They are essentially passengers and are the international man of mystery Atkinson whose role in Barclaycard TV ads was forgotten except for the chaos of Wack's chaos.
In this new JE outing, we get to see only one or two good shots.
I liked Johnny English quite enough to go in a mid-life suit worn by a helicopter and show me wrapping the rotor blade on my helmet.
Physical comedy on the screen is a kind of gift to Atkinson, but the laughter came very low and the strange kind seemed half-perfect, especially on 007 and Mission Impossible. The film brands are "best" with Pachor as part of the comedy itself.
Laughter comes as if the comedy isn't for adults but for children, and Johnny English's bizarre misunderstandings aren't at all tolerant to me, and Bean's I spent too much time in Atkinson's sitcom film.
The important thing that has always been relevant right now is that there is a serious crisis in the UK.
The UK's most secret network of spies has been hacked by a cyber-hacker, who has identified all of Britain's active agents on this network that could affect the work of the agent - it's a sad event for Kevin Alden.
This is the last aid to the magnificent and rather disturbing Prime Minister, they are already dealing with a number of political and unpopularity problems: this quasi-terresa-me-caracterist can't play well with Emma Thompson, but he's working hard on this script.
His intelligence advisers told him that every working spy would have to bring him to a person who has retired.
This meant that Johnny English would have to fight for himself, who is now a schoolmaster at a posh institute, but what should be a undercover operative like on this record. It's like to work on a single piece of work in a jazz-and-story, along with some good jokes.
The Englishman has been sent back to Emergency Whitehall for briefing, and Ben Miller's recurring role has been combined with his old-fashioned pained side boss.
Now that Bof has been married, he is engaged in trying to become a submarine commander, his role is Jolly-hockey-sticks in which WikiPeperdin has not been able to accumulate.
Hence, Batman and Robin encounter some very big mistakes in his secret service when they face Olga Crulenko's beautiful comedy Fatala Ofelia Bulletov.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister comes to terms with the krysmatic technical billionaire who claims that he has a solution to Britain’s computer crises: sinners Jason Volta played the role of Jack Lacey.
The English and Bog Festivals begin their own odyssey of high-jinks: they set fire to a French restaurant while working as a waiter; they smuggle through the costly boat of the Volta; and the English are completely chaotic when they smuggle through a smuggler's smuggler's smuggler's smuggler's smuggler; and the English are completely chaotic.
The film has certainly been drawn everywhere for that last sequence, but yet it’s fine and entertaining, there’s plenty of fun things for the kids throughout the film.
It's a fine middle class.
Besides, as I saw in the other Johnny English films, in this film I did not understand whether Rowan Atkinson should be given a role in the British film industry or not that is really due to his talent?
Laber has denied that he is planning to work just four days a week for the British people, but the money will meet on the basis of five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering becoming a racist plan, in which UK residents will have to work just four days a week - but the money will meet on the basis of five days.
The party allegedly wants the owner of the company to give the workers part of the savings due to the Artificial Intelligence (AI) revolution, so that they can get an extra day off.
This will give the employee a three-day leave a week - but still they will be able to get the same pay.
Sources say that such an idea will remain 'old' with the party's economic agenda and it is a plan to benefit the workers of the country.
The Trade Union Congress is being promoted to shift four days a week so that workers can benefit from the changing economy.
A senior Labour Party employee from The Sunday Times said: "The policy review is likely to be announced before the end of the year.
'This will not happen overnight, but it is expected to take a four-day working week, which is the party's perspective of rebalancing the economy in favour of the general industrial strategy of the party as well as workers.'
During the 2017 General Election Campaign, the Labour Party will not be the first party to support such an idea as the Green Party, promising a four-day working week.
However, this desire is not fully supported by the Labour Party at the moment.
"""The four-day work week is not a party policy and is not being considered by the party,"" a Labour Party spokesperson said."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonald used last week's Labour Conference to present his approach to the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonald's said that he was confident that the utility firms would regain power from the 'incompetent directors' and 'munafakhors'.
Shado Chancellor's plans also mean that existing shareholders in water companies can't get back their full share because the Labour government can 'cut' on the basis of alleged wrongdoing.
He also confirmed plans to create inclusive ownership funds to include employees on the company's boards and deliver 10 per cent equity of private sector firms to employees, which can get an annual dividend of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy tells "60 Minutes" whether the FBI's check on the cabin could change his mind
The FBI investigation of the charges against Judge Brett Cavana delayed his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least a week in the final vote, and it raises the question of whether the Bureau's findings brought back his support to a Republican senator.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday, "60 Minutes" reporter Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if there is a possibility that the FBI would find something to inspire them to change their minds.
"Canada came up with a clearer view of South Carolina than its colleagues.
"I think so," said Kane.
"I said that when I went to the hearing, I spoke with Judge Kavanaugh.
After that, when the charge came before me, I called them, asking, "Did you do that?"
They were sure, firm, and clear."
However, Graham's vote, seemed to be the stone's lace.
"I was thinking about Bret Cavana and I needed explosive charges for it," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Bret denies it in a persistent way," Graham said, referring to Christine Blakey Ford.
"And whatever they called him, he could not verify it.
This is 36 years old.
I don't see any new changes."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it reduced poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizens Festival, an annual music program that will feature a number of highly influential stars, and is just as influential as its mission; to end the poverty of the world.
Now in its seventh year, at the Global Citizens Festival, not only will artists like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes come to enjoy themselves in the Great Loon of Central Park. Tens of thousands of people will do more work, but will be extremely wealthy by 2030.
Starting in 2012, the Global Citizens Festival, the International Bird Support Group, is an extension of the Global Power Project, which is actively fighting against it. Ending poverty by increasing the number of people fighting it.
To get a free ticket for the program (unless you're ready to pay for the VIP ticket), to help people who go to the concert to get rid of poverty. To create awareness of their goal, to become a volunteer, to become a world leader, or to help others to create awareness of their goal of poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been in the last 12 years to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people through a free music program the right way to invite people to action, or is it just another case of so-called "clicitivism" - the fact that people are being criticized for doing so on the online petition?
Since 2011, Global Citizens has said that by advancing efforts for various targets, it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters.
It says these actions have helped world leaders announce commitments and policies of more than <0x24>37 billion set to impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements resulting from its actions, of which at least <0x24>10 billion is already being distributed or fund-raising.
The group estimates that the Safe Fund has so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include, The Power of Nutrition, a U.K.-based investor and employers' involvement, who is expected to earn more than 4,700 tweets from global citizens" to end malnutrition in the county after earning them more than <0x24>35.
During a live concert in London in April 2018, the ambassador of Power of Nutrition, Tracy Ulman, told the crowd, "British government, donors, national governments, and with the help of global citizens like you, we can make the most of the food."
The group also said that after calling on the U.K. to improve nutrition for mothers and children, after more than 5,000 actions, the government announced funding for a project called Power of Nutrition and women with nutritional disabilities.
A Frequently Asked Question on Your Website Answers: "Why Do You Think We Can Erase Extreme Poverty?"
Global Citizens responded: "It will be a long and difficult way - sometimes the burden we will fall and fail.
But, just like the great civil rights and anti-discrimination movements in front of us, we will succeed, because we are more powerful together.
Janet Jackson, The Weekend, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, Janel Monae are one of the few performers to perform at this year's show in New York, hosted by Debra-Lee Fernes and Hue Jackman.
The U.S. could use navy for "strike" to create barriers to Russian energy exports - Interior Secretary
In Washington's wake, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke revealed that Washington could "support" the U.S. Navy "if necessary" to stop Russian energy in the U.S. markets, including the Middle East.
Zinke alleged that Russia's work in Syria - especially where it operates at the invitation of the legitimate government - is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
He allegedly said, "I think the reason for their presence in the Middle East is that they want to smuggle energy, as they have done in the southern regions of Europe, in Eastern Europe.
And, according to the officer, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"The United States has the ability with our navy to ensure that the naval routes remain open, and, if necessary, to dismantle, so that it can be ensured that their energy does not enter the market," he said.
Zinke was addressing the attendees of the program, a non-profit group, the Consumers Energy Alliance, who called themselves "the voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He said that comparing Washington's approach to dealing with Russia and Iran, they are effectively the same thing.
Referring to Russia as "a floating turkey" including a fossil fuel-dependent economy, he said, "In the case of Iran and Russia, there is an economic alternative, commodity, fuel benefit and replacement."
Statements are coming that the Trump administration, taking Russia's place, is on a mission to promote its exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe as the cheapest option for European consumers.
To that extent, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, have tried to persuade Germany to "inappropriately" pull out of the North Stream 2 pipeline project, according to Trump, who made "Berlin Musk"
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the <0x24>11 billion North Stream 2 pipeline, which is ready to double existing pipeline capacity from 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
Kremlin argues that Washington's widespread opposition to the project is motivated only for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
After meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said, "I believe that we share the idea that energy cannot be a means of pressure and provide the consumers" conditions.
The U.S. government has opposed Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's industry-leading organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the United States to stay away from the EU's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
The head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), Dieter Kemf, said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin, "When a large state is in a state, our energy is needed.
The Massachusetts senator said Elizabeth Warren will "think seriously" about joining the 2020 presidential race.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would "think seriously" about the presidential race after the midterm election.
During the town hall in Hollywood, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider taking part in the race.
According to The Hill, she said, "It is time for women to go to Washington and join our broken government and this includes being a woman in the top position."
"After November 6, I will seriously consider the fight for the presidential post."
While assessing President Donald Trump during the Town Hall, Warren said, "They are taking this county in the wrong direction.
"I'm deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing for our democracy in the end," he said.
Warren, Trump and his Supreme Court candidate, Bret Cavana, have been criticizing.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "Of course we need to check the FBI before the vote."
However, a survey released on Thursday showed that most of Warren's constituents don't think they should fight the 2020 election.
According to the University of Saffok Political Research Center/Boston Globe Pole, eight percent of Massachusetts' "possible" voters said the senator should not fight elections.
Thirty-three per cent supported the election in this way.
The poll showed more support in the case of election-fighting by former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 per cent in favor of potential participation in the election race and 48 per cent against it.
Other high-profile Democratic names chosen to potentially contest elections by 2020 include former Vice President Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said that they will formally vote until January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin mentions PTSD in Donald Trump's rally
26-year-old Track Pollin spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in the army in September.
He was arrested on Monday night in an incident of domestic violence.
In a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma, he told listeners, "My son is going through the cycle, he's feeling after he's back, he's coming back, he's going to be with us," and I'm proud of other families, who are PTSD.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said about his son and other retired soldiers, "They come back with a slight change, they come back harder, they go back to each other, thinking about it, and thinking about whether it's the honor that's with them."
According to a spokesman for the Vasila Police Department, Dan Bennett, she was arrested in Vasila, Alaska on Monday and accused of domestic violence against a woman and possession of weapons while being drunk.
18 states, D.C. support the challenge of new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the Colombian District are supporting a new U.S. policy that refuses to give shelter to victims of domestic violence or fleeing the gang.
NBC News reported that 18 states and district representatives filed a justice-friendly letter in Washington on Friday to support a refugee who challenged the policy.
The full name of the plaintiff has not been disclosed in the Grace vs Session case filed by the U.S. Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy.
He said his partner "and the sons of his violent gang" abused him, but U.S. officials rejected his request for asylum on July 20.
He was detained in Texas.
Government lawyers in support of Greece have described Al Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala as the countries that face the widespread problems of clashes and domestic violence, which are a large number of sources for U.S. refugees.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a 2014 ruling by the Immigrant Appeal Board that allowed unorganized immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
In a statement on Friday, Attorney General Carl Resin of the District of Columbia said that the new policy "ignores the state, federal and international law of the decades."
"The federal law expects that all asylum claims should be judged on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the claim, and such an impediment violates that principle," the justice-mother said.
Attorney further argued that the policy of denying the entry of immigrants is detrimental to the U.S. economy, saying that it is more likely for them to become entrepreneurs and to "provide necessary labour."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to give shelter to victims of domestic exploitation and mass violence in June.
"""People who leave their country of origin because of their race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group because of harassment or fear,"" Sessions said in a statement on 11 June."
Asylum has never been to alleviate all the problems - even all the serious problems - that people face every day around the world.
The number of deaths in the search for survivors has doubled due to the massive rescue effort in Palu
For the survivors, the situation was very serious.
"This sounds extremely stressful," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, comforting the child who suffered from a bukhara in the outskirts of Tahs-Nas-Palu city.
"Every minute brings an ambulance to the bodies.
"Clear water is rare."
Residents were seen returning to their decent homes, picking up watery goods, trying to save whatever was found.
Hundreds of people were injured in the 7.5 magnitude quake and the hospital drowned.
Some of the injured, including Dwayne Haris, who were facing broken back and shoulders, rested outside the Palu military hospital, where the patients were being treated outdoors due to continuous strong earthquakes.
His eyes were filled with tears when he felt the shocks of violent earthquakes in the room of his fifth-place hotel shared with his wife and daughter.
"We didn't have time to save ourselves.
"I think I was pushed into the ruins of the wall," Harris told the Associated Press, as well as informing that his family was in the city for the wedding.
"I heard my wife cry out for help, but then shut up.
I don't know what happened to him and my son.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. ambassador accuses China of "smuggling" through "propaganda"
A week after a four-page advertisement citing the mutual benefits of U.S.-Chinese trade in a Chinese daily newspaper, the U.S. embassy in Beijing said that the U.S. embassy used the U.S. press in Beijing.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday accused China of attempting to interfere in the November 6 congressional elections, the Iowa's most-selling newspaper, the most-selling in the world, and the most-selling newspaper in the world, the Das Minnesota Registry in China.
Trump's allegation that Beijing was trying to interfere in U.S. elections, U.S. officials told Reuters that there was a new stage in Washington's campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is common to advertise for foreign governments to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently in a growing trade war that has seen them roll out border tariffs on each other's imports.
Chinese and U.S. experts say China's first-ever trade war was designed to invade exporters in states such as China's reversible border-free Iowa, which had supported Trump's Republican Party.
Terry Branstead, the long-time U.S. ambassador to China and former Iowa governor, told China's chief exporter of agricultural goods that Beijing has hurt U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
Bransted wrote in the Das Moines Register on Sunday that China, "is now doubling that felony by running propaganda in our independent press."
"In its propaganda-spreading, by advertising paid on the Das Moines Register, the Chinese government is taking advantage of America's nourishing tradition of freedom of expression and independence of journalism," Branstead wrote.
"Given that the media is closed in the strong arm of the Chinese Communist Party, on the contrary, here on the street side of the newsstand in Beijing, you will find limited dissatisfied voices that can be heard by the people," said Chiang Mai and no proper reflection of those inconsistent opinions.
"One of China's most important newspapers refrained from apologizing for the proposal to publish their article," he said, although he did not name the newspaper.
Women voters are being displaced before the Republican midterm elections with Kavana's defeat, analysts warned
As the Supreme Court's top Republican sexual harassment allegations are supporting and defending Bret Cavana, analysts have warned that they will look forward to the upcoming mid-life elections, especially for women.
Its down-to-earth feelings are quite enormous, and most Republicans are already showing on record that they want to move forward with the vote.
Those things can't be brought back," said a professor of political science at the Maxwell School of the University of Syracuse, Grant Reigher, for an article published Saturday by The Hill.
He said he doubts that the last-minute pressure on the FBI for investigation by Senator Jeff Fleck (R-Arizona) will be enough to calm the angry voters.
According to a Washington D.C. newspaper, on Friday, a senior advisor and national spokeswoman for the Progressive Group MoveOn, Karen Jean-Pierre, said, "Women who can't forget what happened yesterday can't forget what happened in the future - neither the future nor the future."
On Friday morning, when Republicans controlling the Judiciary Committee wanted to move forward with the nomination of Kavanagh despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blacey Ford, the protesters who were demonstrating at the Senate's Dalant!
A non-political analyst, Stu Rohenberg, told the news site, "Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are being detracted from the chart."
“People say it’s already huge; it’s true.
But it could be more, especially among suburban female voters and 18- to 29-year-old young voters, who don't often vote when they don't like the president."
While describing the allegations of sexual harassment by Ford against the nominee of the Supreme Court, the public witness had already said that if the Republicans move forward with confirmation, there is a likelihood of opposition to it.
According to NBC News, former chairman of the Republican National Committee Michael Steel said, "This has become a confusing mess for the GOP."
"It's not just about putting the committee vote or the final vote or the cabin on the bench, it's also about the case of how the Republican has handled it and how he has treated them," said Nyal Dhaka, an institution that helped the Democrats in the election.
However, the Americans seem to be somewhat divided in this case as to who to trust in view of Ford and Cavana's testimony, which most came to take the side of Cavana.
A new survey by YouGov found that 41 percent of respondents believed in a certain or potentially ford’s testimony, while 35 percent said they believed in a certain or potentially cage.
In addition, 38 per cent said they felt that Kavana had probably or certainly lied during her testimony, while only 30 per cent said the same thing about Ford.
Following pressure from Fleck, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford and, at least, another prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Last week, Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Cavana had been battling him drunk at the age of 17.
Ramirez's allegations that the name of the Supreme Court exhibited his genealogies when they were joining a party while reading in Yel in 1980.
The inventor of the World Wide Web is planning to launch a new Internet in opposition to Google and Facebook.
The inventor of the World Wide Web, Tim Burns-Lee, has launched a startup that wants to collide with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt, the latest project of Technology Legend, is a company that builds Burners-Lee's open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people will be allowed to access what information they will be able to access.
In a special interview with the Fast Company, Berners-Lee said in a joke that the intention behind Inrupt is to achieve "world glory."
"We have to do it right now," he said about the startup.
"This is a historic moment."
The app uses the technology of Solid to allow people to create their own "personal online data store" or POD.
It may include contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in one browser and at the same time.
The unique thing about a personal online data store is that it completely depends on the user's type of information that can be accessed.
The company calls it "personal empowerment through data."
According to the company's CEO John Bruce, Inrupt's idea is to bring resources, processes and appropriate skills by the company so that Solid can be made available to everyone.
The company currently includes a securities platform purchased by Burners-Lee, Bruce, IBM, some on-staff developers contracted to work on the project, and a community of valetary coders.
This week, tech developers around the world can create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
"He and his team aren't talking to Facebook and Google about whether or not the whole change will start, where all of their business models will end up completely night-to-night," Berners-Lee said.
"""We're not asking permission from them."
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "mission is to provide commercial energy and ecological mechanisms to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, the Berners-Lee Net has been an influential voice in the neutrality debate.
Even at the time of the launch of Inrupt, the Berners-Lee World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute will remain the founder and director.
"I'm incredibly optimistic for this next era of the web," Berners-Lee said.
Bernard Won: WW1 Victoria Cross Clarity Celebrated
As a warrior during the First World War, the only Church of England priest to win the Victoria Cross was celebrated 100 years in his home town.
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Won won this award in the attack on 29 September 1918 in Belengalais and Lehigh Court.
However, they were killed by a sniper four days later and they never knew that they had won the highest British military honour.
A memorial stone was unveiled by his two ships at the parade held in Rashden, Northamptonshire on Saturday.
One of his portraits, Michael Won, said it was "splendidly symbolic" that the stage was being unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather's awards were won.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Won led his battalion in the Canal de Saint-Quentin "between a very dense trench, under heavy shelling and machine guns on the battlefield."
Later they climbed up to the firing line and with "big bravery," led the military-rank before taking on the field-gun alone and smashed three pieces.
Lieutenant Colonel Won on 4 October 1918 - just a month before the end of the war, was killed by a German sniper.
The 72-year-old Michael Won said his grandfather's name was "something I know can never be compared to, but that we have a nose on."
He and his brother, Dr. James Won, also malarian after the parade, led by the Brantwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Won said they are "very honored to play a role in the parade" and he said "the dignity of a real hero is being demonstrated by the support being given by many people."
MMA fans have been waking up all night to watch the Bellator 206, but instead they have found Peppa Pig
Imagine, you've been waking up to watch the full-night Belator 206, but the main show has been denied viewing.
San Jose's bill had 13 opponents, including six on the main card and a full-night live show on U.K. Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., as Gagard Musashi and Rory McDonald were preparing to face each other, the audience in the U.K. became appalled to turn to the Peppa Peg of the cover.
There was a lot of disappointment, especially after waking up early in the morning.
A fan on Twitter described switching to children's cartoons as "a kind of sick joke."
Asked about the broadcast, Dev Schwartz, senior vice president of Baltter, said, "According to government regulations, this content was not suitable for 6 a.m., so they had to switch to children's programming."
"Papa the Pig," yes.
Scott Cooker, chairman of the Baltter Company, said that they are going to work on their scheduling to include U.K. audiences in the future.
"I think when I think about the replay, I think we'll probably find a solution to it," Cocker said.
"But then there will be six o'clock on Sunday morning and we will not be able to work on it until Sunday, our time, Monday, their time.
But we are working on this.
Believe me, when this change occurred, there were a lot of texts being voiced and they weren't all favorable.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it was a technical bug.
But it wasn't, it was a government issue.
I can promise you that it won't happen next time.
We'll limit it to five times instead of six -- as we usually do -- and when we tried to make some extra deliveries for the fans, it just turned out to be a bit too much.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Disc: Tom Deli 'feels 'innocent' in the case of sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Deli says he was overwhelmed by everyone's sense of guilt because of his eroticism - but he was inspired to succeed.
24-year-old Deli said she didn't even realize until she got to high school that "everyone is not like me."
Speaking on the first Radio 4 Desert Island disk presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he talks about gay rights to give "hope" to others.
He also said that when he became a father, he was less concerned about winning the Olympics.
The regular presenter of the long-running show, Kursty Young has taken months off due to illness.
Appearing as a socially motivated person in Laverne's first show, Deli said she was feeling "less" in herself than everyone else because "loving boys and girls was not socially acceptable."
"Even today, those feelings of feeling less than others, and feeling different, are the real things that have given me the power and strength to be able to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he is also "special," he said, so that he doesn't disappoint everyone when he finally finds out about his sexuality.
The two-time bronze Olympic medalist has become a high-profile LGBT propagandist and has used his presence in this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to reduce homosexuality.
She said she spoke openly because she felt lucky to be able to live openly without any hassle and she wanted to give others "hope."
The three-time world champion said that a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "I was surprised when he fell in love."
Deli married Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than her, but said the age difference was never an issue.
"When you go through so many experiences at such a young age" - she went to her first Olympics at the age of 14 and died of cancer three years after her father - she said that at such a young age, we would have had such experiences.
In June, the couple became the parents of a son named Robert Ray Black-Deli, and Deli said that his "whole approach" had changed.
"If you asked me last year, it would all have to do with 'I need to win the gold medal'," he said.
"You know, there's a lot more to the Olympic gold medals.
"My Olympic gold medalist is Robbie."
His son's name is similar to his father Robert, who died in 2011 after being diagnosed with brain cancer at the age of 40.
"""His father didn't just accept that he was going to die and the last thing he wanted to know was whether he had tickets for London 2012 - because he wanted to sit in the front row."
He said, "I couldn't tell them that you won't be sitting in the front row, Dad."
He said, "When they couldn't breathe, I held their hand and held it until their breath stopped and they were dead, so I went and thought they weren't worthless."
The following year, Deli participated in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"I just knew that that's what I had dreamed of all my life - plunging in front of the crowd of indigenous people at the Olympics, there was no better feeling than that," he said.
It also inspired his first favorite song - Proud By Heather Smoll - which was being resonated with him during the preparations for the Olympics and which is still being heard by his cheerleaders.
The Dashert Island disc will be broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on 11:15 BST on Sunday.
Saturday's Ryder Cup out-of-form Michaelson
American Phil Michaelson will set a record on Sunday when he will play his 47th rider's cup match, but he will have to change his shape to protect it from becoming the unlucky milestone.
While playing for the 12th time in a two-year program for the record, Michaelson was put out of the game for Saturday's Foreballs and for the Forests.
Instead of becoming a centre of attraction, as she is often made for the United States, the top five-time winners stayed among those who celebrate their day and worked in the hopes of improving their way of playing.
Even at the extreme of his career, the 48-year-old player, who never directly drives, was not the ideal fit for the Golf National Course, where those who are not active for a long time receive a regular penalty for wrong shots.
And where the course is not so easy anyway, in Sunday's ninth match, Michaelson will face British Open Champion Francesco Molinari, who is Ruki Tommy Flittwood to win all four matches this week.
If the American player, who starts four points below in 12 singles matches, starts vigorously, then Michaelson's match can prove to be quite important.
Fury put his trust in his man, not that he could say anything else.
"He fully understood his role, my back slipped and surrounded me in his arms and said that they would be ready tomorrow," Furic said.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is the Hall of Famer and he has contributed a lot to these teams in the past and this week.
I probably didn't think he would play two games.
I imagined more, but it was the way it worked and the way we thought we had to move forward.
He wants to go out there like everyone else."
Michaelson will break Nick Faldo's record for the most played rider cup matches on Sunday.
This rider cup could mark the end of a career that has never touched the heights of his personal record.
Michaelson has scored 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, though Furic said his presence brings some inertia to the team.
"He's funny, he's funny, he's funny, he likes to fly people's jokes, and his presence in the team room is special," he explained.
"I think the young players, too, had a lot of fun going to them this week, which was fun to see.
He's giving a lot more than just playing."
Europe's captain, Thomas Burns, knows that the big rise could soon disappear.
Thomas Burn, the European captain, knows from his experience that a fairly large jump in the last day’s single in the rider’s cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable move.
Dan made his first appearance in the 1997 match in Valderama, where one side in the captaincy of Sev Ballesterios had scored a five-point lead over the Americans, but with a win of 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2, taking the lowest margin, just finishing.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a big lead in Valderama; we had our big lead in Brooklyn, where we were losing, and in Valderama, we just won," said the class later on Friday 5-3 and took the Golf National 10-6 to the top.
So history will show me and all the people in that team that it’s not over.
You will pay the full price tomorrow.
Go out there and do all the right things.
It won't end until you get points on the board.
We have a goal, and that is to try to win this trophy and that’s where to keep the focus.
"I've always said, I'm focusing on the 12 players who are in our side, but we're well aware that the world's greatest player is on the other side."
Boren further said how difficult his players performed at the golf course: "I will never be able to get ahead of myself in this.
Tomorrow is a different time.
Tomorrow's personal performance will come forward, and it's a different thing.
It's great to go there with the partner when everything goes well, but when you go out there in person, your ability as a golfer is fully tested.
This is the message that you need to reach the players to showcase your best tomorrow.
Now, you leave your partner behind and he has to go and he also has to give his best performance."
Unlike Borne, opposing Jim Furic would be pushing for a personal better performance for his players that he had done as a partner, with the exception of Jordan Speaker and Justin Thomas, who were three out of four.
"Before facing the loss due to the "miracle in Madina" by Europe, being part of the winning team in Brooklyn, Fury himself is on both ends of the reflection of those big last days."
"I remember every loss of him," he said in response to the question of how captain Ben Cranshaw handled his players on the last day in 1999.
"We have 12 important matches yesterday, but you would like to start as fast as you saw in Brooklyn, as you saw in Madina.
When this speed is one-sided, it puts a lot of pressure on the matches between them.
"We set our line-up up to our own account and included people like this, as we felt, you know, we're trying to do some more miracles tomorrow."
Thomas has been tasked with trying to lead the match with Rory McClaro in the top match, where Paul KC, Justin Rose, John Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Polter are the top half of the other European order.
"I had made a group of them in this order because I think it covers all of them," Borne said of his singles selections.
Germany's new warship has been postponed.
New German Navy warships should have been commissioned to replace the affected Cold War-era warships in 2014, but due to faulty systems and rapidly increasing costs, at least not until next year, local media said.
According to a military spokesman, the commissioning of the "Rhineland-Pfalz", which is the main ship of the completely new Baden-Württemberg-range warships, is now up to the first half of 2019.
The ship was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, but issues disturbing after delivery affected the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships were ordered back in 2007 by the Navy to be brought as a replacement for the time-affected Bremen-class warships.
It is understood that they will provide a range of powerful cannon, anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles as well as some stalth technologies such as low radar, infrared and acoustic section facilities.
Other important features include a long maintenance period - it is possible to deploy the latest warships for up to two years from indigenous ports.
However, the continuous delay means that the state-of-the-art warship - which will allow Germany to have the opportunity of a power project abroad - will be delayed until the period of entry into service, the Daily Zhen commented.
The rare F125 warship was a butchery last year, when the German Navy had officially refused to commission the ship and had returned the Blohm and the Vos Shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to the ship's manufacturer after the ship was delivered.
Very few people knew about the reasons for the return, but German media referred to several important "software and hardware flaws," which rendered the warship useless when deployed on the war mission.
Software shortcomings were particularly important as Baden-Württemberg-class ships would be operated by a crew of some 120 sailors - as only half of the crew of the old Brahmen-class warships.
In addition, it also emerged that the ship is dramatically more weighted which reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
The 7,000-tonne "Rhineland-Palatinate" is considered to be twice as heavy as the ships of the same category used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to faulty hardware, the value tag of the entire project - which also includes training of the crew - is becoming an issue.
It is said that it has reached <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.1 billion (<0x24>3.6bn) from the initial <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
In light of recent warnings, the problem of new warships that have become particularly important is beating the naval power of Germany.
Earlier this year, the head of the Defence Committee of the German Parliament, Peter Bartels, acknowledged that the Navy was actually "deployed capable ships are ending."
The officer said the issue has become serious over time, as the old ships were removed from use, but no replacement ships were made available.
None of the warships of Baden-Württemberg-Street were able to join the navy, he said.
The National Trust is listening to the secret life of sparklers
The new research that is being done in a estate in the Scottish Highlands aims to reveal how squirrels use the natural landscape in their hunting for food.
It is hoped that the findings will shed new light on the behavior of unique flying breastfeeders and help guide future conservation activities.
The study, conducted by scientists of the National Trust of Scotland, was followed by the Dobenton skulls with general and soprano pipestrells as well as long ears of brown and inverve gardens of West Ross.
Special recorders will be installed at the main sites around the property to track the activities of the squirrels throughout the season.
NHS employees and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
The expert sound analysis of all the recordings shows the frequency of the bat call and what species are doing with it.
Then a map and report of the natural-house will be prepared for the drawing on a detailed landscape-landscape of their behavior.
Rob Goder, NTS' nature conservation consultant, hopes to find out from the results which areas of the natural habitat are most important for squirrels and how they are used by each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of natural-residential management activities such as the construction of grasslands and how to maintain woodlands well for squirrels and other related species.
In Scotland and across the U.K., the population of Chamgadad has declined considerably in the last century.
They are endangered by construction and development activities, which affect the birds' havens and damage the natural-residential.
Wind turbines and lighting systems can also create risks, as some chemical treatments of flypaper and building materials, as well as attacks by pet cats, can also be hazardous.
The squirrels aren't really blind.
However, due to their hunting habits when it comes to catching the hunt, their ears are more useful than their eyes.
They use a sophisticated eco-location technology to point out flaws and obstacles in their flight path.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes Chamgaddar very seriously.
It has ten trained experts, who regularly survey, inspect the birds’ havens, and sometimes save them.
The organization has established Scotland's first and only dedicated bat reserve in Scotland's Damfries and Trive Estate in the Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's ten shark species.
Estate Manager David Thompson says that the estate is the best place for them.
"We have a great area for Shamgaddar here in Trive," he said.
"We have old buildings, many old trees and all good natural-houses.
But there's so much about Chimgaddar that's still unknown, so what we do here and in other properties will help us understand what things they need to do."
They underline the importance of checking the skull before maintenance within the property because it is possible that 400 males and infants could be destroyed by the destruction of the maternity hospital unknowingly, possibly by destroying the entire local population.
Shamgads are protected and it is illegal to kill them, harass them or disturb them or destroy their havens.
The Scottish Officer of Batt Conservation Trust, Elizabeth Ferrel, has encouraged the people to come forward to help.
"We still have a lot to know about our spiders and about our many species we still don't know how their population is growing,"" he said."
Ronaldo rejected allegations of rape while lawyers filed a lawsuit against the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo, citing claims of rape against him as "fake news" has said people want to "promote themselves" using his name.
His lawyer is prosecuting the German news magazine Der Spigel, who published the allegations.
In 2009, she was accused of raping an American woman named Katherine Meyerga in a hotel room in Las Vegas on Portugal and Juventus Forward.
Dere Spagel said in a report on Friday that she allegedly paid the woman <0x24>375,000 to remain silent about the incident.
Addressing his 142 million followers in Instagram live video after reporting claims, 33-year-old Ronaldo called the reports "fake news."
"No, no, no, no, no.
"What he said today, it's a farce news," the five-time Ballon d'Or winner said on camera.
"They want to preach to themselves by using my name.
This is normal.
They want to be popular with my name, but it's part of their work.
I'm a happy person and it's all right," the player said with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyer Der Spigel is preparing to prosecute those charges, according to Reuters, which he has called "suspicious dishonesty reporting in the field of privacy."
Attorney Christian Shertz said the player "will seek compensation for moral damages in accordance with the severity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident occurred in June 2009 at a sweet of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
According to the documents filed with the Clark County District Court of Nevada, after meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly returned to the player's room, where they allegedly raped him.
Mayorga claims that after the alleged incident, Ronaldo fell on his knees and told them that he was "99 percent" a "good person" whose "one percent" had disappointed.
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but there was mutual consent for it.
Mayorga also claims that she had gone to the police and had also taken pictures of her injuries in a hospital, but later agreed to an agreement outside the court because she felt "annoyed by the inhalation" and she was "publicly disrespectful" about it.
The 34-year-old says he is now trying to end this deal because his harassment has continued since the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and made a deal of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million with Italian DJ Juve this summer.
Brexit: The U.K. 'will always be sorry for the loss of producers'
Trade Secretary Greg Clarke said the U.K. "will be forever regretful" if he loses his degree as a world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit.
"Toyota U.K. had told the BBC that if Britain left the European Union, it would temporarily stop production at its factory in Bernstein near Derby," he said.
"We need a deal," said Mr. Clarke.
The Japanese carmaker said that the impact of the border delay in the situation of No-Del Brexit could have on jobs.
The Bernstone plant - which makes Toyota's Oris and Avenues - produced about 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"I believe that if the UK leaves the European Union at the end of March, we will stop production at our factory," said Marvin Cook, CEO of Toyota in Bernston.
Other U.K. car manufacturers have raised concerns about how cross-border trade will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, leaving the EU without consent.
For example, BMW says that it will shut down its mini plant for a month after Brexit in Oxford.
According to car manufacturers, the main concerns are related to the risk of supply chain in the situation of no-del Brexit.
Toyota's production line is run on a "just-in-time" basis, in which the U.K. and the European Union, both of the suppliers, come with med-to-order cars for every 37 minutes.
If the U.K. leaves the European Union without a deal on March 29, there could be a violation on the border, according to the industry, which could result in delays and shortages of supplies.
The company said it would be impossible to keep more than one day of inventory in its Derbyshare plant for Toyota, so production would be shut down.
Mr. Clarke said Theresa's checkers plan for future relations with the European Union "has been purely calibrated to avoid those checks at the border."
"We need a deal. We want the best deal that in my opinion can not only enjoy success at the moment, but what is also necessary to achieve this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's Tude program.
"Not only Toyota but other manufacturers have found evidence that we should be able to fully continue it which has been a highly successful set of supply chains," he said.
Toyota was unable to say for how long production will be shut down, but in the long run, warned that the plant would be less competitive at extra cost and eventually jobs would run out.
Peter Sauvallries, who has worked in Bernstein for 24 years and is the plant's co-founder of the Union Union, said that his members are extremely concerned: "Once these jobs go away in my experience, they will never return to bed.
A government spokesman said: "We have advanced an accurate and credible plan for our future relations with the European Union."
According to the White House, Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be delayed again.
The White House said on Sunday that Donald Trump's deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could hold a high-stakes meeting for "one more week later" as the Supreme Court's nominee is a candidate for Brett Cavan.
Rosenstein is supervising the work of Special Advocate Robert Mueller, who is investigating the potential obstruction of justice by the President between Russian election interference, Trump's assistant and Russia.
Trump's deputy Attorney General will be ousted or not, and which puts Moler's freedom in jeopardy, the news has warmed Washington's whistleblower market for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of wiring the conversation with Trump to record and removing the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denounced the report.
But last Monday they went to the White House among the news that they are going to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced on Thursday, which was then at the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he would "not like" removing Rosenstein but then delayed the hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee to avoid clashes at a meeting in which Cavana and the woman who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Bond, were accused
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI verification of claims against Cavana, delaying the full vote of the Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sara Sanders, was seen on Fox News on Sunday.
Asked about the Rosenstein meeting, he said: "The date has not been set for it, it may be this week, I can see that a look at all the other cases going on with the Supreme Court can be pushed another week ahead.
But we'll see and I'll always like to keep the press up-to-date."
Some journalists have claimed that Sanders has not been in the White House press talks since September 10.
The host, Chris Wallace, asked why.
Sanders said the lack of briefing was not due to an interest in the "evidence" of TV reporters, though he said, "I do not disagree with the fact that they are great."
He also suggested increasing direct contact between Trump and the press.
"""The President has more questioning sessions than any other President,"" he said, not referring to the evidence, ""We have seen those numbers."
"The briefing will still be," Sanders said, "but if the press gets the opportunity to ask questions directly from the President of the United States, it's better than talking to me."
"We've tried a lot to do that and you've seen us do it a lot in the last few weeks and when you can talk to the President of the United States, he's going to take the place of a press conference."
When leaving the White House or attending open sessions or at a press conference with gentlemen, Trump regularly answers questions at the press conference.
Single-press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the President demonstrated his unique presence in front of the journalists present and several times perhaps showing why.
Health Secretary NHS writes to European Union workers in Scotland about the fears of Brexit <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
The health secretary has written to the staff of the European Union working in Scotland's NHS with the wish to express the country's gratitude and remain after Brexit.
Jean-Freeman MSP sent a letter after less than six months of withdrawal from the EU from the UK.
The Scottish government is already committed to fulfilling the cost of detention status applications for citizens of the European Union who are already working in its gradual public services.
In her letter, Ms. Freeman wrote: "In the past, interactions between the U.K. and the European Union are continuing, moving towards the expected decisions this autumn.
But the U.K. government is also advancing its preparations for a potential no-deal scenario.
I know this will be a time of great uncertainty for you all.
That is why I now wanted to reiterate how important I am to their contribution, regardless of the nationality of each staff member.
The European Union, and its colleagues beyond, bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we really want you to stay here."
Emergency Surgery of Christian Ebercromby After Head Injury
Tennessee linebacker Christian Ebercromby, who faced a 31-27 loss from Vanderbilt Commodore on Saturday, said he had undergone an emergency surgery following a head injury.
The head coach of the state of Tennessee, Rod Read, told reporters that the injury had taken place just a short time before Hofftime.
"He came to the shore and just fell there," read.
The trainers and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before keeping him on the stretcher and taking him back for further evaluation.
An official from the state of Tennessee told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that he had been discharged from surgery at the Aberdrombbi Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris said that "there is no details on the type/limit of injury yet" and the Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury was taking place.
Ambercrombie, who is Redshirt Sophomore, is in his first season with the state of Tennessee after moving from Illinois.
He scored a total of five kicks on Saturday before leaving the game, making his season a total of 18 kicks.
High stamp duty will be taken from foreign buyers when buying property in the U.K.
When foreign buyers buy property in the U.K., they will be charged a high stamp duty, which will be used to help homeless people under new tory schemes.
This step will undermine the success of Corbin's campaign to attract young voters
Increased stamp duty will be imposed on those who are not paying tax in the U.K.
Treasury expects to help homeless people - will raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million in a year
High stamp duty rates are being prepared to be recovered when buying property from foreign buyers in the U.K. - the additional cash that will be used to help homeless people, will be announced today in Theresa.
With the promise of providing more affordable housing and targeting high earners, the move is being seen as an attempt to overturn the success of Jeremy Corbin's campaign, which attracts young voters.
The stamp duty increase in the U.K. will be applied to non-taxable individuals and firms, with the additional money that will promote the government's campaign to deal with those who sleep in controversial circumstances.
Excess - which is in addition to the current stamp duty, which includes purchases of two houses and rents started two years ago, may be a maximum of three per cent.
Treasury is expected to grow to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million in a year.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of newly-built London properties are purchased by non-U.K. residents, making it difficult for first-time buyers to keep their feet on the staircase of housing.
Many of the country's wealthy regions - especially in the capital - have become "the ghost city" as the number of such foreign buyers is greater, who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy came out a few weeks after it was called for a cut in stamp duty to help more young people build their first home by Boris Johnson.
He accused large-scale construction farms of plunging land but not using them to raise property prices, and urged the message to leave quotas on cheap homes to fix Britain's "residential fraud."
Mr. Corbin has announced an attractive series of proposed housing reforms, including the end of rental control and "non-fault" disputes.
They want to give more power to councils for the construction of new homes.
"Last year I said I would dedicate my premiere to restoring the British dream - that life should be better for every new generation," Mr. Mee said.
And that means we're going to fix our broken housing market.
The UK will always be open to those who want to stay here, work and build life.
However, it is not right that it is as easy for individuals not residing in the UK as it is for foreign-based companies to buy homes for hard-working British residents.
For many people, the dream of owning a house has become far away, and the desire to sleep in harsh conditions is extremely real."
Jack Ross: "My ultimate ambition is to manage Scotland"
According to Sanderland's boss Jack Ross, his "last ambition" is to become a Scotland manager at some stage.
The 42-year-old Scott is repeating the challenge of reviving the North-East club, which is currently third in the league forest, and which is three points away from the top.
They had left the Stadium of Lights this summer after guiding St. Mirren for the Scottish Premiership last year.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got the B cap and that's all I had," Ross told the BBC's Scottish sporting sound.
"But I grew up seeing Scotland in Hampton with my father from childhood, and it's always been something that draws me back.
This opportunity will come only when I succeed in the management of the club."
His predecessors as managers of Sanderland include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Alardis, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keen, Gus Poet and Paul De Canio.
Former ALA Athletic Boss says he didn't feel any anxiety following the names established in such a big club, which had previously rejected the initiative of Barnslee and Ipswich Town.
"At the moment, the prediction of success for me can be based on whether I can return this club to the Premier League."
Due to the structure and features of this club, it is undoubtedly in the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy job to get there, but I'll probably see myself as a success here if I can get the club there."
As Dumberton's assistant boss and spent 15 months in Harts' coaching staff, Ross's management career has only lasted three years.
He then helped Aloe recover from the third tier's disrespect, and replaced St. Mirren with the disrespect of the championship title winners in the next season.
And Ross says that they now feel more comfortable than the work done during their careers in Clyde, Heartlpool, Falkirk, St. Mirne and Hamilton Academics.
In the case of handling the post of Aloa, he said, "It was probably a real show."
"I really believed that the management was more suited to me than to play.
It sounds strange because I did the right job, earned the right amount of money, and enjoyed some of the right heights.
But it can be hard to play.
You need to get a lot of things on a weekly basis.
I'm still going through them in terms of work stress and pressure, but everything seems okay in terms of management.
I've always wanted to manage and now I'm doing it, it makes me feel the most comfortable in my entire adult life."

The correct time for a pint is Saturday evening at 5.30 p.m., found in the survey
The heat of the summer has promoted Britain's conflicting pubs, but it has put more pressure on restaurant chains.
The pub and bar group saw a 2.7 per cent increase in sales in July - but declines in restaurants were 4.8 per cent lower, statistics showed.
Peter Martin, Business Consultant CGA, who compiles the statistics, said: "Lagatar Sun and England's expected participation in the World Cup is July compared to July. It also means that the same pattern was followed in the last June by the 8th and 8th respectively.
Restaurants trade declined by 1.8 per cent in June and worsened in July.
Wine-selling pubs and bars performed the strongest performance with more preference than restaurants.
Food-operated pubs also had to be damaged in the sun, though not dramatically like restaurant managers.
It seems that people just wanted to go out to drink.
Drinks sales in all pubs and bars increased by 6.6 per cent for the month, as foods fell by three per cent.
Paul Newman, leisure and hospitality analyst RSM said: "These results have continued the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The impact of weather and major social or sporting events makes it the biggest factor for sales in the market outside the home.
It is no surprise that restaurant groups have continued to struggle, although a year-on-year drop in sales, especially due to ongoing cost pressure, will be painful.
"The long summer weather could not have been the time and bad weather of the food and materials operators and only the time will tell whether the more moderate temperature we have experienced in August will provide essential relief,"" he said."
Total sales in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, increased by 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting a slow pace in brand roll-out.
The Coffee Pitch Tracker collects and analyzes data from 47 operating groups performing industry sales monitoring for the UK pub, bar and restaurant sector with a combined business of <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion, and it is an established industry benchmark.
One in five children has a secret social media account that they hide from their parents.
Surveys show that one in five children - some of them under the age of 11 - have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers.
Increased number of "Fergi Insta" pages in the survey of 20,000 high school students
The news has increased the fear that sexual content is being posted.
Twenty percent of students said they have a "major" account to show to parents
One in five children - some of them under the age of 11 - are creating social media accounts that they live in secrecy from adults.
In a survey of 20,000 secondary school students, "Fergy Insta" accounts grew rapidly - a reference to the photo-sharing site Instagram.
The news has increased the fear that sexual content is being posted.
Twenty percent of students said they run a clear "major" account to show parents, while they also have a private account.
A mother who suddenly saw her 13-year-old daughter's secret site found that a teenage girl was urging others to "rape me."
The Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters" and Headmasters" Conference (HMC) found that two per cent of 11 to 18-year-olds had profiles, half of which held private accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: "It's a very disturbing thing that many teens are attracted to creating an online place where parents and teachers can't find them."
The Scottish Athletics Board will have "Voice for Athletes"
Elidd Doyle has been elected to the Scottish Athletics Board as a non-executive director at the annual General Meeting of the Governing Body.
Doyle is Scotland's most refined track and field athlete and chairman Ian Betty has taken this step to guide the game to take advantage of his extensive experience at international level over the past decade.
"Scottish, U.K. and the World Athletics Community have a lot of respect in the mind of Eledh and we are confident that bringing athletics on board in Scotland will bring them a lot of benefits,"" Betty said."
"I'm excited to work as the voice of the athletes and I hope I can really contribute and help to guide the game in Scotland,"" Doyle said."
In addition to his four Olympic gold medals, the Americans, who won 200m and 400m at the 1996 Games in Atlanta and are now regular BBC Pandits, were unable to run after a temporary ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago today I had a stroke.
I can't walk.
The doctors said the time will tell me whether or not I will be well and just how much I can be.
It was a terrible job, but to get completely healed, to walk again and learn to practice scalp today!
Thank you for the messages of encouragement!"
Compared to mothers' cows by breast pump advertising, there is a difference in the opinion of online people
A breast pump company shared an online opinion by an ad that compares mothers who are breastfeeding to cows' milk.
To mark the launch of the product called "World's First Silent Wearable Bracelet Pump," consumer tech company Elvie has released a new video-driven advertisement, featuring new pump-driven mothers.
Four real mothers dance on a song in a cow's grass-filled crib that includes some of the kind of sayings: "Yes, I'm milking myself, but you don't look like a tail" and "If you haven't done it, these aren't my breasts."
The core continues: "Pump It Out, Pump It Out, I Am Feeding Dem Babys, Pump It Out, Pump It Out, I Am Milking My Ladies."
Whatever the case, the advertisement, which has been posted on the firm's Facebook page, has caused online controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed responses from the audience, many said it presents the "efficacy" of the dairy industry in a light-hearted way.
"Using cows to advertise this product is a very bad decision.
"We need them to be pregnant and give birth to milk as soon as they are like us, except that they are stolen from them in the lunar days after giving birth to their babies," he wrote.
Elvie Breast Pump Nursing Bra (Elvie/Mother) fits consciously inside
Another comment: "Obviously, it's sad for both mother and baby.
But why not use them to advertise bristle pumps for mothers who have the opportunity to have their children?"
Another added: "How irrelevant is the advertisement."
Other people defended the ad, one of which said that the song of that ad was "humorous."
"I think it's a great idea.
I would have had it if I were still breastfeeding.
I have the experience of being a cow from pumping.
This ad is a little weird, but I saw it the way it is.
One wrote that this is a great product."
The other commented: "It's a fun advertisement for those mothers who pump (often in their workplace or toilet) and experience like "gay."
It is not advertising that promotes or decisive to the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women said they were dancing carefully pumping into their bra.
The concept behind this campaign is based on the knowledge that many women who pump breasts say they feel like they’re a cow.
However, the Elvi pump stays well hidden, it has no wire or tube and direct care fits into a nursing bra prematurely, turns the women without pumping, grabs their children and even goes out here.
Ana Ballerin, partner and mother of the ECD commented: "Elvi Pump is a revolutionary product, which deserves a striking and splendid launch.
By pointing out the parallels between the women and the cows of Deri, we want to bring breast pumping and its challenges to the spotlight, demonstrating a sense of freedom in a entertaining and related way, which is new.
This isn't the first time that Elvi has been in the pumpkins.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two children using the product appeared to be catwalking for designer Marta Jakuboski.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a tent camp on the border of Texas
The migrant children arrested were being spyed, even when there was no relative change in monthly boundary crossings, to some extent because the harsh acronyms and policies proposed by the Trump administration have made it easier for the children to be recruited with sponsors.
Traditionally, the maximum sponsors had appointed the migrants without the documents themselves and were afraid to jeopardize their own ability to live in the country by claiming them forward on any child.
The threat escalated further in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other household members or large members would have to give their fingerprints and the data would be shared again with the immigrant authorities.
Last week, a senior officer of Matthew Albens, Immigration and Border Customs Enforcement, presented evidence before Congress that the agency has arrested dozens of people who have been arrested for aggravating unidentified minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 per cent of the people arrested have no criminal records in the past.
"Approximately 80 per cent of people who are either sponsors or members of the sponsor's house live illegally in the country and are the maximum criminals.
So we continue to search for those individuals," Mr. Elbens said.
Requiring to prepare the children as soon as possible, the authorities introduced a new rule, according to which it was necessary to appear in court within one month of the child being arrested instead of 60 days, which was the previous standard according to the staff to be sheltered.
Many people appear through videoconferencing, rather than being personally present to present their case for a legal status before an immigrant judge, by means of videoconferencing.
Those who are deemed unworthy to be released are immediately expelled.
The longer children remain in detention, the more likely they are to be trapped or depressed, which may be attributed to violent incitement or attempts to escape, according to the system's report in recent months.
Lawyers or lawyers said those cases are taken to a high facility such as Tornillo, where it indicates that the child is struggling, they are ignored due to their size.
"Also, without giving the children enough time to be emotionally prepared or saying goodbye to friends, taking them to the tent city will further increase the shock that they are already struggling with,"" he said."
Syria has urged military forces occupying the U.S., France and Turkey to return immediately.
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moulem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even when the war was already in its eighth year.
Maulam, who also serves as a Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign military forces illegally reside on Syrian lands for excuses of fighting extremism and "will be treated accordingly with them."
"They have to leave the war land immediately and unconditionally," he told the Assembly.
Moulam stressed that the war in Syria "has almost ended", where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions have been ravaged from their homes.
He said that until Damascus, this "alarmistic war will continue until we clear up all areas of all terrorist groups and "any foreign presence" of both of us.
The United States has some 2,000 military forces in Syria, mainly training and advising both Khurdish and Syrian military forces in opposition to President Bashar al-Asad.
France has more than 1,000 military forces on the ground in a country devastated by the war.
On the case of refugees, Maulam said the circumstances were fine to return to them and he made "some Western countries" responsible for "spreading the fear of evil," which prompted the refugees to stay away.
"We called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to simplify this return,"" he said."
"They were politicizing on a completely humanitarian issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no aid to rebuild Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.S. politicians say, a recent deal between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in the vicinity of Idlib's final major rebellion creates an opportunity to put further pressure on political talks.
The Russian-Turkish deal or agreement prevented a massive attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces in the province, where there were three million people.
However, Moulam said the agreement has "clear time limits" and also expressed hope that military action will target the jihadists, including al-Qaeda fighters associated with the front, who will be "rejected."
U.S. Representative Taft Di Mistura expects to hold the first meeting of a new committee with the government and opposition members to prepare a post-war constitution to fix Syria's and election path soon.
Moulam has placed certain conditions in the committee for the participation of the Syrian government, which states that the work of the panel to "review articles of the current constitution" and warn against interference should be prohibited.

In the course of the Electron House, a strong medium-term flood of foreign money has eased
It was not surprising that Pennsylvania had suffered a flood of money or cash in the 17th, credited with the reconstruction of the Congressional Assembly, which led to two officials coming up for the same seat race.
He recently opened the front for the Democratic Rap Conor Lamb in the suburban Pittsburgh district - who won his seat in the second district in a special election last spring.
The Lamp was also involved in a second post race, Republican Kath Rothfas, which currently represents the 12th district of old Pennsylvania, which encompasses the new 17th.
In the case of unconstitutional prosecution by the old districts in favor of the Republican in January, following this decision of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, maps or maps were rebuilt.
In the new 17th race, an empty-handed battle between the key financial weapons, the Democratic Campaign Congress Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC) affected the campaign's economy.
Lamb's name became popular in Pennsylvania after a cancer victory widely seen in the special election of the 18th congressional district of Pennsylvania in March.
For this reason, the seat had been occupied by the Republicans for almost a decade and President Donald Trump had won the district by 20 points.
The political pandits pushed the Democrats a little further.
U.S. sanctions Al-Salvador to support China, then retreat
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing due to the resistance of Washington.
Mr. Trump met with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and stayed at a hotel in Panama until the Trump organization’s management team expelled the partners.
In a statement earlier this month, Department spokesman Heather Nort said that on "the recent decision not to recognize Taiwan now," officials of the political department said al-Salvador, the Dominican Republic and the Panamanian state of Kutniki Akhtriya.
But only Al Salvador was fined, which received an estimated <0x24>140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including Narcotics Control, Development and Economic Assistance.
The proposed penalty, which included targeting cuts and visa restrictions in financial assistance, would be painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
When progress was made in internal meetings or meetings, the North American and Central American officials focused on security and economic prosperity in order to follow that consolidation or population similar to last year. The High-Level Conference, which focused on the preservation and economic prosperity of the region, focused on
But by mid-September, top administration officials clarified that they want the conference to move forward and effectively terminate considering any penalties or penalties for al-Salvador.
Politicians said Vice-President Mike Penns is now ready to address the conference, which is now scheduled in mid-October, as a sign of importation of administrative places at the conference.
And three Americans from Washington returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without a harsh message or penalty.
The White House spokesman for Mr Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debates or controversy described by three U.S. officials, including two politicians, on the condition that the names are not clear.
Their accounts have been confirmed by an external analyst, who is close to the administration and also talk on condition of not clarifying the names.
The history of the study
The next case could be the report of Special Council Robert Mueller on the potential resistance in the court of Mr. Trump, of which there is now sufficient evidence in the public record.
Also, according to the Shri Mueller report, the direction of his inquiry changes if Shri Trump's campaign invades our elections with Russia.
When Congress meets the hand, Mr. Trump finds himself accountable in that body, when he prepares himself to go in front of voters again and perhaps in front of a whirlwind of his colleagues.
That is to say, a lot if or if and I mean to give no indication or suggestion that neither Mr Trump nor his counterparts in Europe is inevitable.
We all have options to choose on both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect how long the conflict can take.
In 1938, German officers were ready to take a move against Hitler, only if he was opposed by the West and supported by Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed, as a result of which we missed the opportunity to stop the narcissism of so many years.
The process of the historical center points around such divisive points and the unthinkable march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Americans now have to face many of these divisive points.
If Mr. Trump Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosentin, the person who controls the final result of Mr. Mueller's investigation, is fired from the job, what will we do?
Rosentin has been in this confusion since last year, when this paper has reported it, he has suggested keeping the president's record secretly and considering their unqualification for the office.
Mr. Rosentin said the account of the Times is not accurate.
"If the recently requested F.B.I. investigation of Bret Kawangooh is not complete or fair - or if he remains firm in the Supreme Court despite the factual allegations of sexual abuse and false testimony, how will we respond?"
And most of all, will we vote in the medium term for Congress, for which Mr. Trump will be responsible?
If we fail in these investigations, then democracy will last for the long cold.
But I don't think the lesson I've learned in Prega is because we won't fail.

Graham Doron's Rangers are optimistic even after a sharp Vienna meeting
The Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that after an influential draw against Vilariel in Spain earlier this month, the Austrians were given a chance to win them in the Group G of the European League.
Knee injury prevents midfielder Graham Duran from appearing for the first time in a 2-2 match with Vilariel, but he believes the Rangers can use that result as a springboard for big things.
"It was a good thing for us because Villariel was good," said the 31-year-old.
"We moved forward in the game with this belief that we can achieve something and come to a conclusion.
Maybe we can finally get it, but overall, the dra will probably be a fair result.
They were probably better in the first period and we were even better in the second period.
Heading towards Thursday, it is a second major European night.
"Hopefully we can get three points but it will be a difficult game because they got good results with the crowd behind us or the crowd in their previous game, I'm sure we will play well and get positive results."
"Whatever happened with my injuries and with the changes made to the club itself last year was certainly difficult but now there is a good experience in this place.
The squad is good and the boys are really enjoying it; they have got good training.
We hope that now we can move forward and be successful with our previous sessions backwards."

Despite the fact that the survey participants clearly know what kind of care they need, some people were talking about it with their family members.
Almost half of people across the country said they were talking to their partner about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them or take care of them, but they don't take any steps to interact," said Holly Cinder, vice president of life insurance business across the country.
Here is where to start from.
Talk to your partner and children: You will not be able to prepare to take care of your family, unless you tell them your wishes in advance.
Discuss with your counselor and your family where and how to get care, as they can be an important factor in determining the cost of options.
Ask your financial advisor: Your advisor can also advise you on ways to pay for those expenses.
A conventional long-term care insurance policy to help you pay these expenses in your fundraising options for long-term care or to insure your own health insurance is a hybrid cash-value life insurance policy that includes you.
Submit your legal documents: Make your legal battle easier.
Get a health-care proxy, so that you can appoint a trusted person to take care of your medical care and make sure that if you are unable to communicate or interact, professionals will follow your wishes.
Also, consider the right of the tower to inspect your finances.
You will choose a reliable person to make financial decisions for yourself and make sure that your bills are paid if you are incapacitated.

Tell that information in a written plan so that you are ready.

Federal prosecutors are demanding the rare death penalty for suspected NYC attack
Federal prosecutor in New York are demanding the rare death penalty for Saiful Cypov, suspected of an intruder attack on New York City that killed eight people -- a viral penalty given in the state for federal crime since 1953.
Cypov, 30, allegedly used a home-deposit rented truck to invade pedestrians and cyclists on the road to the west direction in downtown Manhattan in October.
According to information of the intention to demand the death penalty imposed in the southern district of New York, in order to prove the death penalty properly, the prosecutors have to prove that Cypov has "awarely" killed eight victims and "awarely" has "awarely" killed them
Both countries are likely to be sentenced to death, according to a court document.
A week after the attack, a federal grand jury struck Cypov with a baton for 22 charges, including eight murder charges for aid in racketeering, which were specifically used by criminals in cases of organized crime and in non-automotive vehicles.
Prosecutors said the attack requires "adequate planning and prior considerations" to be discussed, explaining the way in which Cypov implemented it in a "hateful, cruel and evil" manner.
"Safou Habibulavik Cypova by Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Clive's Anglo-Decat, Deren Drake, Ariel Allerge, Hernandez Ferrovi<0xC4><0x87>, Hernández Antoni, and Hernández Mendoza, and Alejandro Pirgu."
Five of the victims were tourists, who were from Argentina.
A case against the death penalty in New York's southern district has been pending for a decade.
Mulzim Khalid Bran was found guilty of the murder of two drug suppliers but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
In 1953, Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were sentenced to death for the last time in the New York federal case, a married couple who was found guilty of espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years ago.
John Rosenberg was sentenced to death by an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
A local resident of Uzbekistan, Cypov did not have any gloves or regrets for days and months after the attack, according to court documents.
Police said he told investigators that whatever he did he liked it.
Cypov told officials that he was motivated to attack after watching the ISIS video after encountering the crime on his phone.
Police said he also requested to show the ISIS flag in his hospital room.
He demanded that he not be guilty of the offence of 22 counts.
David Patton is one of the federal public defenders representing Cypov, who says they are "clearly disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that our decision to demand the death penalty instead of accepting life imprisonment without any possibility of being free will only postpone the mental trauma of these events to include all," Patton said.
The defensive team of Cypov had asked the former prosecutors not to demand the death penalty.
Tory MP says Nigel Faraj should be made the task force for Brexit talks
Nigel Faraz vowed to "gather an army of people" during the Tory conference.
The Eastern European leader asked politicians to "understand the atmosphere" of the Euroskeptics - as Theresa May's own MP suggested that they should talk with the European Union.
The conservative backbencher Peter Bon said in March in Birmingham that if Shri Faraj was the Brexit secretary, Britain would have so far 'expulsed' him.
But the challenges faced by Smt. Me in resolving her extremely divided rank have been highlighted by Pro-Remen Tory to add a separate opposition to Brexit in the city.
The prime minister has been struggling to keep track of the compromise plan of his chequeror during the attacks by Brexiteers and the European Union.
The allies insisted that he would try to make a deal with Brussels instead of backlash - and persuade Eurosceptics and workers to choose between their package and chaos.
"""Abandonment means leaving the rally in Solihal, in which he wants to ""chequer""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
He suggested that Mr Faraj should be made a partner and should be given the responsibility of negotiating with Brussels.
"If it were a charge, we would have gone out so far," he said.
"""I will stand for Brexit but we need to get the checkers out,"" Wellingboro MP or MP said."
Setting its opposition in the European Union, he said: "We don't need to be subject to anyone to fight a world war."
We want to make our own laws in our country."
Mr. Bone rejected all the suggestions that changed public opinion after the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British have changed their minds and they want to stay is completely false."
Tory Brexiteer Andrea Jenkins also said in March: "I'm just saying: Prime Minister G, people are listening.
"The Chequer is not popular among the general public, the opposition will not vote for it because it is not so prevalent between our party and our activists who actually encircle the streets and elect us first."
"Please leave the checkers and start listening."
In a message focused on Smt., he said: Prime Ministers maintain their jobs when they do not break their promise.
Shri Faraj said that the leaders of the rally should be made 'aware of the environment' if they cheat with the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
"This is now a matter between our people and our political classes,"" he said."
"They're trying to cheat on Brexit and today we've come here to tell them that 'we won't let you run away by doing so.'
"""I want you to create our political class, which is on the verge of cheating the Brexit by understanding the environment,"" he said."
"We are organizing the army of the people of this country who have given us victory in Brexit and who do not rest until we become an independent, sovereign and proud United Kingdom," he said.
Meanwhile, the Remnants march from Birmingham before a two-hour rally in the middle of the city.
A group of activists warned Toryes against the Brexit banner after the group's launch this weekend.
The Labour Pierre Lord Adonis shows a dialogue on security issues arising from the party app at the opening of the conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can have the right IT system for unrestricted borders and borderless free trade in Ireland and all the technology.
"It's a complete swing.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit, he said.

"When you see the releases and leaks and then they say, 'Hey, I didn't do it.'
I didn't do that."
Do you remember?
Daniel Finnstein, have you leaked?
I remember her answer... Did you leak the document - "Oh, oh, what?"
Hey, no.
I didn't leak."
Well, hold on a minute.
"We've leaked... no, we haven't leaked," he said pointing to the senator.

"They are destined to take power back by any necessary means.
You see their meaning, their dirt, and also that they don't care who they hurt or who they're running after to get power or power or control," the mediator reported on the president's words.

More than 800 people have been killed and many more have been missing after a major earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The aftermath of injuries in the area was continuously devastating and many people were trapped under the garbage in the city of Palu.

A spokesman for Indonesia's air navigation, Johannes Cirtreat, said that the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, Australia's ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan to take them from another city to a large hospital in Kalimantan.
Unfortunately, we lost them before reaching the point of the helicopter.
"Our heart was broken when they left," he said.
Meanwhile, officials fear that the number of deaths with the destruction of the country could reach thousands, the alphabetization agency says access to Dongala, Sigi and Botnosh is limited.
"The mortality rate can still increase as many bodies can still be plowed into residues or garbage, or in many places where it cannot be reached," the agency's spokesman, Sutopo Nughroho, said in a statement.
Waves up to six meters in height destroyed Palu, causing a mass burial on Sunday.

Micronesia Airplane Accident: Air Force Now Tells Laguna Airplane Missing One Man Since Accident
The airline, which operates the crashed plane in the Pacific Lagoon in Macron, now says a man is missing when it was reported last time that 47 passengers and crew or crew were safely ejected from the plane by drowning.
Air Niugini said in a release on Saturday afternoon that it could not identify a male passenger.
The airline said it is working with local officials, hospitals and investigators to find out the man.
The airline does not respond immediately to the request for additional information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
While attempting to land at the Falk Island airport when the plane crashed into the water, local boats helped save other passengers and crew.
Officials said on Friday that seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline said the six passengers were in the hospital on Saturday and all of them are now stable.
The cause of the crash and what kind of incident occurred is unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the two aircraft did not land properly on the runway.
Some witnesses or witnesses thought that the plane did not land on the runway.
US passenger Bill Jen said the plane had crashed a lot.
"It's a very good thing," Jane said.
Jane said she and others were pulled out of the deep water from the emergency exit that was present on the plane, drowning her and others.
He said the plane's employees were terrified and were screaming and he suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy said the sailors working around to improve the ferry also helped to rescue people in about 30 metres (100 ft) of water before the plane sank, using an airboat to bring people to shore.
The data from the Aviation Security Network indicates that 111 people were killed in a PNG-registered airline crash in the last two decades but none were included in the airline designation.
The analyst said the time of the night when the woman was burned alive.
The prosecution recovered its case on Saturday to re-accuse a man on charges of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
The U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Roulette presented the evidence for hours as an expert witness in the field of investigation analysis.
She told the jury how she used a cellphone record to bring together chamber activities such as 29-year-old Mulzim Quinton TV and 19-year-old victim on the night of her death.
Roulette said he received location data from several cell phones, which shows that the night of his death was with Tallis Chambers denying his previous claims, The Clarion-Laser reported.
When the data shows that when he said he was with his friend Michelle Sanford, at the time his cellphone was near the Chambers, police told Sanford.
Sanford came forward on Saturday and presented his statement and evidence that he was not in the city that day.
When asked by prosecutors if Tallis was telling the truth, when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "living because his truck was in Nashville."
The second inconsistency was that Tallis said he knew Chambers about two weeks before his death.
The phone records show that they had known each other for just a week.
Some time after the death of the chamber, Talis removed all the text or messages, calls or contact information of the chamber from his phone, Roulet said.
"Hel," he said, "he wiped him out of his life."
The defense side is ready to begin its final argument on Sunday.
The judge said that he was expected to go to the jury for hearing the case on that day.

NY Nanny filed suit against dual property after firing after "javatista" text
When a New York Nanny complains by a mother that she is "the other black person," she sues a couple of properties for biased snickering after misleading text.
Dual properties deny that they are resilient, running a suit for "attraction."
Linsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, on discovering that Giselle Maurice, a new babysitter, is expressing her bachelorette, who was black on her first day of work in 2016.
"No other black person," Mrs. Plasco Flaxman told her husband in a text.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it twice to Mrs. Morris.
According to a New York Post, after realizing her forgetfulness, a "unconstitutional" Plasco-Flaxman expelled Mrs. Morris, stating that her ex-girlfriend was an African-American who had done a bad job and had done a bad job.
Mrs. Morris was sent home to Ubar by paying for her one-day work.
Now, Maurice demands compensation of <0x24>350 per day for six months to retire from work on the property, he was appointed to start work in Live-In Gig although without a contract.
"Look, I want to show them that you don't do anything like that," he said, stating that "I know it's discrimination," he said in a post on Friday.
The pair said on the claims that they are racist, stating that after insulting him they can't trust him, it was reasonable to end Maurice's employment.
"My wife sent something that didn't mean she was.
He is not a racist.
We are not racist people," the man Plasco told the post.
But can you give your children into the hands of someone you have ever insulted, even if it was wrong?
Your newborn baby?
Leave it, too."
Like the case of "abduction", Plasco said that his wife had only been pregnant for two months and she was in "very difficult situation".
"You're going after someone like that?"
It is not right to do so," said Investment Banker.
While the legal case is still ongoing, there has been a rapid response to the indictment of dual property on social media for their conduct and reasoning.
"Padiston fears publishers that the reader will not add it to their own ideas and opinions, the new letter reveals.
Bond's daughter, Caren Jenkles, who was born after the book was approved, said in a letter: "It's hard to think about putting someone in their place before it's published for the first time.
It's amazing to know about Pandington's success."
Telling about his father, who had worked as a BBC cameraman before writing a children's book inspired by a little bear toy, he was optimistic about refusing his work and in the second book, he said that his 60th book after his death "was the book of the year."
About Paddington, whom he describes as "an important member of his family," he tells his father that he was proud of his potential success.
"He was a calm man and was not at all proud," he said.
"But because Pandington was so real to them, it was almost like you have a child who gets something: you're proud of them, even if you're not actually doing it."
I think he's seen Paddington's success that way.
"While it was his imagination and composition, he always credited it to Paddington."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
On landing, his daughter was taken to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nis, where the work done by doctors was useless.
"Nad was regularly saying that it was really bad, it wasn't expected of him," Mrs. Adenon-Laparos said.
"Then Nade called me by telling me that he's going to die in the next two minutes and I have to say goodbye to him.
And I did.
I said, "I love you so much, son.
I will be with you soon.
I will be with you.
The doctors who had given him the medicine to beat his heart were slowly ending up abandoning his system.
He had died a while ago and it was all over.
I just had to sit there and wait, even though I knew it was all going to end.
I couldn’t do anything screaming, screaming or crying because I was surrounded by my family.
I had to take care of everyone."
Eventually, Ms. Adnan-Laparus, who was saddened by the loss of her daughter, got on a plane with the other passengers - who were unaware of the situation they were going through.
"Nobody knows," he said.
"I put my head down and I was crying all the time.
It was difficult to express it, but I got to see a feeling of extreme sympathy for the nad on the plane.
She needed my love and understanding.
"I know how much she loved him."

Shri Park said that the strong border between North Korea and China and the high rates imposed by traders and chungichers were the main factor.
Pyongyang did not make any public comments.
A large number of mosquitoes from the north are eventually proposed for South Korea's citizenship.
More than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
The maximum China fled, whose border with North Korea is the longest and easy to cross the strongly protected zone of militarization (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers bugs to be illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often sends them back to their country by coercion.
Relationships between the North and the South - which are still technically at war - have been improved in recent months.
Earlier this month, leaders of both countries meet in Pyongyang for talks, which focuses on blocked nuclearization talks.
It became active in June after a historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they broadly agree to the conditions for working towards a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea's foreign minister, Ree Yang-hoo, blamed U.S. sanctions for lack of progress since then.
"Without trust in America, there will be no trust in our national security, and in such circumstances, there will be no way for us to first harm ourselves unilaterally," Mr. Rai said in a speech at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelory called Bret Kavangau "Mzedar" and said he is not eligible for the Supreme Court
House minority leader Nancy Pelosi called the Supreme Court's nominee Brat Kavangau "mzeddar" and said he is "not qualified by nature to work in the Supreme Court."
Pelosi commented in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas on Saturday.
"I can't think that any month can make such a demonstration," they call it "mezedar," Pelosi said on Thursday, giving his response to Kavangawa's evidence before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Kavangawa emotionally denied allegations that he had ever sexually abused Dr. Christine Blakey Ford when they were both teenagers.
In his initial statement, Kawangua was very emotional, sometimes stopping screaming and breathing while talking about his family and his school years.
He clearly punished the Democrat on the committee by proving false allegations of "extraordinary and coordinated character secrets" by the Liberals, who were angry at Hillary Clinton's loss of the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said he thinks that Kavangawa's witnesses have proved that he cannot work in the Supreme Court, as this shows that he is acting against the Democrat.
"I think he has made himself unworthy of those statements and the way he went to Clinton and the Democrats," he said.
Pelosi doubted that if asked if Kavangawa would become permanent and if the Democrats won a majority in the House of Representatives, he would still blame Kavangawa.
"I would say that -- if he doesn't tell the Congress or the FBI the truth, he's not reasonable for the Supreme Court, but because he's invited, he can still work," Pelosi said.
Kawangua is currently a judge in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeal.
Pelosi said that as a Democrat, he was concerned about Kavangau's possible rules against the cost-effective care of the Act or Ro Vwad, as he is known to be a conservative justice.
In the wake of his certification, Kavangawa avoided questions about whether he would reverse some of the Supreme Court's judgments.
"In the hearing of his confirmation, Kavangaua avoided questions about whether he would reverse some of the Supreme Court's judgments.
And women need to move it.
It's a religious objection, months and years of anger go out and he can't stop himself crying.
Mrs. Stemin told me 45 years later: "When we cry, we get angry."
"I don't think it's unusual, do you think?"
She was saying, "A woman who worked for me is a great help, who said that even when she's angry, she's crying, but she's developed a new technique, which means that when she's angry and she starts crying, she's talking to the person she was talking to."
I'm angry."
And then he was talking.
And I thought it was great."
Tears are allowed to come out as part of anger because they are basically misunderstood.
A beginner job, a man's one of my most stiff memories of the headquarters, when I found myself crying in an indescribable rage, I found that an old woman had stuck my neck in the back of the neck - a stiff manager in which I was always a little bit shy.
"Never cry in front of anyone," he said.
"They don't know how hard you are.
They think you're sad and you'll be happy to meet them. "
A woman president of a Democratic Congress from Patricia Shroeder, Colorado has worked with Gary Hart on the presidential run.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in connection with a boat or a name other than marriage and his name was taken back from the race, Mrs. Shreder, who was deeply disappointed, fled to the presidency himself.
"It wasn't a thought-provoking decision," he said laughing at me after 30 years.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called him "Snow White and Consumption Dwarfs."
Since the campaign had been delayed, he did not have time to raise funds and so he swore that until he raised <0x24>2 million, he would not take part in the race.
It was a lost battle.
He found that some of his supporters who gave the men <0x24>1,000 would give him only <0x24>250.
"Do they think I've got any discounts?" he wondered.
When he made his speech announcing that he was not going to launch any formal campaign, he could not cope with the emotions - thanks to those who gave him, the disappointment of the system and the frustration that caused him to struggle to raise money - and the reps only.
"You would have thought that I'd be going down the nerves break," Mrs. Shroder recalled how the press would have reacted to them.
"You would have thought that Clanex is my corporate sponsor.
I don't know what they're going to put on my salary.
"Did he cry?"
How the U.S.-China trade war could be good for Beijing
The beginning of the trade war between the US and China was about to slow down and while the war is now far from over, the crackdown between the countries could be beneficial to Beijing in the long run, experts said.
U.S. President Donald Trump said the first warning was given earlier this year by including major exports of sugar, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
With the new tariffs affecting items of up to <0x24>200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), the most significant increase this week is effectively taxed on all over half of the goods coming from China to the United States.
Beijing has resisted each time in its own way, most recently slapping tariffs of <0x24>60 billion to 5% of U.S. goods.
China has pledged to match the U.S. with shot-to-shot, and the world's second-largest economy is likely to timing soon.
Getting Washington back would mean hovering the demands, but publicly bending the head in front of the U.S. Z. Jingping would be too embarrassing for the president of China.
Still, experts say that Beijing can run its own move, the U.S. trade war can positively support China in the long run while reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing can create situations that either start economic telspin in the country, which is actually even more dangerous for a spectator than ever before seen by the viewers, is even more dangerous for a spectator," said Abigail Grace, a spokesman for the BBC.
"Syria is 'ready' to return refugees," the foreign minister said.
Syria said it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is appealing for help to rebuild the country devastated by the war of more than seven years.
Speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Maulam said that the situation in the country is improving.
"The situation on the ground is more stable and secure due to the progress made in anti-terrorism today," he said.
The government continues to relocate to areas destroyed by terrorists in order to restore the normal situation.
All the circumstances for the voluntary return of refugees to the country due to terrorism are now present and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
The other six million people living in the country still need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moulam said the Syrian government would welcome help in rebuilding the devastated country.
But he stressed that it would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from the countries sponsoring the uprising.
Europe wins the rider's cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Rider Cup against the American team from 16.5 to 10.5 in the final scoring goal at the golf national outside of Paris, France.
The U.S. has now faced six consecutive losses on European soil and has not won a rider's cup in Europe since 1993.
When Danish captain Thomas Jorne reaches the 14.5 points needed to defeat the American teenager, Europe regains its title.
American star Phil Michaelson, who competed in the maximum tournament, showed his T-shot in the water at the 3rd 16th hole by accepting the match from Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari has won all of his rounds by becoming 1 out of 4 players to score 5-0-0 since starting the current format of the tournament in 1979.
The American Jordan Speed was defeated by 5 and 4 by Denmark's Thorbzoon Olleson, the team's lowest rank.
World's top-ranked player, Dustin Donson, lost 2 and 1 to England's Lan Polter, who probably played his last rider's cup.
An experienced, Spaniard Surgeon Garcia has become the European winner every time in the tournament with 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't stop myself.
It was a difficult year.
So thanks to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm very, very happy to get the cup back.
It's about the team, and I'm very happy that I was able to help," Greece said emotionally after winning Europe.
He defeated his partner John Ram Mashal Thamai, who defeated U.S. golf legend Tiger Wood 2 and 1 in a singles game on Sunday.
23-year-old Rahm said, "I'm extremely proud of defeating Tiger Wood, I've grown to see them."
He has lost all four matches in Wood France and now has a 13-21-3 career rider's cup record.
One of the biggest players to date has only won 14 major titles in second place after Jack Nicholas.
The U.S. team struggled all weekend to find fireways with the exception of Patrick Read, Justin Thompson and Tony Finneau, who played golf with the entire caliber throughout the tournament.
Captain Jim Furke said after his squad's disappointing performance, "I'm proud of these boys, they fought.
In the morning, we put some pressure on Europe.
We defeated them.
Congratulations to Thomas.
He is a great captain.
All 12 of his players played a great game.
"We will regroup, I will work with the PGA and the Rider Cup Committee of the United States and move on with Thosm.
I love these 12 boys and I'm proud to be captain of them.
You should welcome them.
We've played better."
