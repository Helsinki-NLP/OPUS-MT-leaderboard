Triumph of right-wing populists in Austria, totaling 29 percent
A noticeable weakening of both parties of the former major coalition and a marked strengthening of the right-wing populist parties brought the preliminary results to the preliminary parliamentary elections in Austria on Sunday.
The Austrian People’s Party (<0xC3><0x96>VP) suffered particularly heavy losses, where the position of former President Wilhelm Molterer is seriously on the brink.
In contrast, the leader of the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZ<0xC3><0x96>), the Kärntner Head of State Jörg Haider, is preparing for a triumphant return to federal politics.
According to the results so far, Social Democracy (SP<0xC3><0x96>) remains the strongest force in the country with 29.8 percent of the vote, but loses 5.5 percent of the vote against the last elections in 2006.
Worse still, the <0xC3><0x96>VP cut, which lost almost nine percent of the vote with 25.6 percent.
These are the worst results of these two major parties in the history of post-war Austria, and especially in the People’s Party, which had demanded the previous elections, this is a truly disastrous result.
Even in early July, when the <0xC3><0x96>VP had withdrawn from the coalition, the People’s Party had a clear advantage over the SP<0xC3><0x96>.
The voters, however, have probably punished the party for letting the government fail.
Already in the first reactions to the results, there were speculations about a possible resignation of party chairman and former Vice Chancellor Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers believe that this could be the case already on Monday at an extraordinary meeting of the party chairman.
Such a development would probably pave the way for the most likely exit from the polling booth, i.e. for a renewal of the major coalition from SPO and <0xC3><0x96>VP.
In view of the strengthening of both right-wing populist parties - the Liberal Party (FP<0xC3><0x96>) provisionally received 18 percent, the BZ<0xC3><0x96> 11 percent of the votes - the Social Democrats still expressed their fears, but at the same time the European Union's fears have been expressed by the fact that in 1999, the European Party of Liberals (FP<0xC3><0x96>) had a tendency to express itself from the fact that in the year 1999, when the European party of the BPöp<0xC3><0x96> (theyp<0xC3><0x96>) was in the Pöp<0xC3><0x96>.
On this development, Jörg Haider, who has already stated that he is willing to work with every party, is obviously working on a return to Vienna to Austrian federal politics.
The Greens also joined Parliament, but suffered slight losses and fell from third to fifth among the Austrian political parties.
No other party is likely to have mastered the four-percent gate and, as a result, did not enter parliament.
Black Mountain: Relationships with India may cool
If it fails to resolve the problem with Czech scientists accused in India of illegal accumulation of cauliflowers, according to Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg, there could be a certain cooling of Czech-Indian relations.
This was emphasized by the minister in New York after today’s meeting with his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukhardshi.
“If this is not clear, then for sure, then there will be some cooling,” he said after a meeting that took place on a Czech initiative.
After the talks, Mukhardshi said the executive could only intervene hard in court cases.
In spite of all this, he pointed out that in the case of Petr <0xC5><0xA0>vácha, who was released from the charge and received a fine, the central government and the local government in Darjiling wanted the case to fall within their jurisdiction.
"His problem could be clarified," the minister said.
For Emil Ku<0xC4><0x8D>era, who was sentenced to three years in prison, Mukhardshi said it would be best if he appealed to a higher court.
He could thus request release on bail and wait in freedom for his verdict, the minister said.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner expressed the same opinion in negotiations.
"He recommends a referral to a higher court, then a mercy comes into question for him," the head of Czech diplomacy said.
The only way the Czech side can intervene in the whole matter is to provide the convicted with "competent legal support", the Indian minister said.
At the same time, he said that such assistance would already be offered to them by the Indian side.
“We have a great interest in maintaining good contacts with India, which have a long-term tradition.
The Indians also admit that,” Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, he confirmed, according to the Czech press agency <0xC4><0x8C>TK, before his partner, the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
“We really think it’s a big mistake to detain and accuse these Czech scientists,” he said.
One answer to the question of whether he has received the pledge from the Indian side to deal with the matter is the Minister's response.
"I've been promised a lot already," he just noted.
A Czech judge over the ring around the sea floor
He comes up with an electronic map depicting Australia and the adjacent sea areas.
However, he is not interested in the continent, but in a small point, lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and along with it the adjacent seabed.
The area is as large as the continent itself," said Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of the thirty-member staff of the UN Division for Oceans and Sea Rights.
His head, the division director, the Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, follows the interpretation and supplements it.
This is where work and enthusiasm prevail.
The ocean floor has so far a little known world that is rich in natural resources.
Here you can find petroleum, further rice and other non-renewable raw materials, but also unknown living organisms, which, for example, carry the key to the development of a cancer drug.
An ocean floor larger than the mainland
The Arranger States today vehemently declared their claim to the new maritime territories.
According to a UN convention, they exercise their rights, which they agreed in Montego Bay, Jamaica, in 1982.
This is mainly the area of the so-called continental shelf, which often enters the sea a few hundred kilometers away from the shores of a country.
According to the Convention, this country has an exclusive right to all sources of the continental shelf.
“Simplifiedly, as a continental shelf, the part of the ocean floor and its soles is considered to be a natural continuation of the continent below the sea surface.
It crosses the borders of the coastal sea, often the border of two hundred nautical miles of the so-called exclusive economic zone,” Mikulka explains.
The application submitted by the country concerned to the Commission to establish the external borders of the continental shelf must be supported by a comprehensive scientific and technical documentation based on many cost-intensive investigations and measurements.
It is the result of many years of preparatory work.
"One of our tasks is to provide legal and technical support to the Commission.
The Commission has so far negotiated five applications from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
So far, only the last three countries have been successful,” Mikulka adds.
The success of Australia, which was the first country to significantly expand its maritime areas, was recently echoed by an international echo.
But New Zealand is also a winner - the extension of the seabed, which was granted to the country by the Commission last week, is about 1.6 million square kilometres, which is about six times the size of the actual state.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in the investigations.
The profits that will flow to them in the future from the use of the seabed will, as they promise, have an invaluable value.
Other states will submit their applications gradually as well.
You can do this for ten years from the moment you ratify the Montego Bay Agreement.
Where the continental shelf ends, the area of the ocean floor begins, which is referred to by the Convention as the "common heritage of humanity".
No state has a special position here anymore.
The right to promote in this area is granted by an international institution established by the Convention.
"The seabed, however, is not a gold digging country," says Director Mikulka with some exaggeration, adding that "individual areas are legally precisely defined and the system is contractually anchored".
Czech Republic in the Pacific
Part of the seabed today also belongs to the Czech Republic.
It shares it with other states of the former Eastern bloc within the framework of the joint organization "Interoceanmetal".
It received the status of a so-called "road-breaking investor" in 1991 as a result of the Convention, as well as the investors of a few few other states.
The organization has the right to promote ClarionClipperton in the Pacific between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati.
The area to be investigated by the investor is slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The seabed is divided there, it is a kind of tatra on the seabed.
"You can promote there on an area of a total of 75,000 square kilometres.
The area is a rich deposit of polymetallic concrete that contains nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese,” said another lawyer, Indian Pakshi Rajan.
The Macedonian employee of the division Rober Sandev brings such concreteness as a pattern.
It reminds me of a little potato or, with a little imagination, of the legendary scheme that brought the legend to life after the Golem.
German Special Forces were on the spot for hostage liberation
The Egyptian government had asked for help from Germany to solve the hostage crisis - the experts came.
When it became serious, the special units were ready, but they did not come for use.
On the circumstances of the liberation of eleven European tourists abducted in Egypt, more and more details are known.
German special forces were also indirectly involved in the rescue operation, according to the Ministry of Defence and the Interior.
According to this, both specialists of the Bundeswehr and officers of the GSG 9, the air force of the Federal Police, the Federal Crime Agency and logistics experts of the Technical Assistance Service were on the scene of the release.
As ministry spokesmen said on Monday evening, however, the German forces were not needed because the hostages let their prisoners run and flee when they recognized signs of a violent liberation.
The Egyptian government has accepted the aid offered by Germany to join them as local support forces.
“Luckily, this has not happened,” a spokesman for the Federal Ministry of the Interior said.
The group was kidnapped by five Germans, five Italians, one Romanian and eight Egyptian escorts in southern Egypt on September 19.
After the kidnapping in a desert area in southern Egypt, hostages in the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad had been dragged in and out.
The identity of the hostages remained unclear until last as well as the details of the release or possible ransom payments.
The rescuers have now arrived in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the liberated hostages are in the custody of the German embassy.
He did not comment on the details of the release.
At first, there was no information on when they would return to Germany.
According to the "Bild" newspaper, the five holidaymakers and the special forces are scheduled to fly with an Air Force airbus and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
U.S. House of Representatives rejects bailout
The first chamber of the U.S. Congress has nearly failed the <0x24>700 billion bailout package for the financial markets.
The Dow Jones went deep.
With 206 to 227 votes, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected the government’s bailout package for financial markets.
Despite all the appeals made by U.S. President George W. Bush and leading politicians of both parties, there was no majority for the program to curb chaos in the financial markets.
In a dramatic move, supporters desperately tried to convince critics of the <0x24>700 billion package.
Barney Frank, one of the democratic negotiators, had called on MPs to agree, even if the plan was unpopular.
“It’s hard to get political recognition for avoiding something that hasn’t happened yet,” he admitted.
Even during the vote, the Dow Jones broke by more than six percent or by 600 points.
The reason was the concerns of investors that the state bailout could fail.
He recovered shortly before the end of the vote, then, after the announcement of the failure, dropped again.
Experts now expect further serious turbulence in the international financial markets.
In order for the program to enter into force, the approval of both the House of Representatives and the Senate is required.
Organizers record increasing number of bookings
It seems to be a good winter for the German tour operators:
In the case of travel bookings for the coming months, sales have increased significantly compared to the previous year, according to a study – even by more than 30 percent for the winter season.
Despite weak economic outlooks, the Germans’ desire to travel remains unshakable, according to a study.
For bookings for the winter season, the travel agencies recorded a 31 percent increase in sales compared to the previous year’s period, according to the Deutsche Reiseverband (DRV) in Berlin on Monday.
According to the study by the GfK market research institute, there are already increased booking numbers for the autumn months.
The DRV noted that the sales growth of travel agencies for October was around 11 percent compared to 2007.
Based on these results are figures from the GfK, which evaluates monthly booking data from 1200 German travel agencies and calculates it for the overall market.
The travel bookings made until the end of August 2008 were recorded.
Due to the weak dollar rate, travel to the United States was particularly in demand, the DRV said.
Here, the booking growth is about a third.
In addition, Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as the domestic fields, are particularly sought after destinations among the Germans.
In particular, package travel was high in the course, DRV President Klaus Laepple said.
Given the rising costs for energy and food, the costs are "better to calculate for the customer than for individually organized holidays".
Consumers could save money, among other things, through early-booking discounts or all-inclusive offers, Laepple said.
The summer months were also very well booked, so there will be a turnover increase again compared to the previous year – although according to another study, the number of Germans who took a trip decreased compared to the previous year.
My first time at Oktoberfest
Ballermann-After-Ski Hits in the Endless Loop, Liter-Krugen Beer and Promis in Designer-Dirndln.
A Wiesn debut.
Susanne Kronzucker and I don’t really have much in common.
She is a blonde, TV moderator and wears a tailor-made dirndl.
I have dark hair, am a student and my dress is second hand.
But one thing connects us: barely three minutes on the meadow, the photographers are already crashing on us and slicing the memory cards full - very sluggish and that on my first visit to the meadow.
That's how you make friends.
The cheap dirndl seems to fulfill its purpose.
Based in Wiesn-Touri and actually north of the White Wurst equator, the feeling of well-being remained within the range until now.
But once we arrived at the Theresienwiese, everything is half so bad.
Almost everyone wears dirndl or leather pants; no one looks upside down or embarrassed - everything is completely normal.
Strange glances at the chocolate banana stand only harvest my dirndl shorts.
A Munich woman reminds me that I had wrongly tied the skull: "Lefts hoist free, middle virgin, forgive right, whitewashed behind."
At home, I freeze the loop from the back to the left.
"Pass," he said and laughed.
Others make less effort with subtle flirting techniques and wear simple felt hats, on which stands "To drunk to get dressed!" and stretch the naked back against an unsolicited one.
The young man with the exhibitionist attitudes is Bob, who comes from England and also visits the Oktoberfest for the first time.
He finds it "gorgeous", with a long-distance "oooooo".
That’s what he told me after he got rid of his previous drunkenness.
Right next to one of those hydrants, everyone thinks he's a garbage collector.
So Bob is one of those famous "wildbieslers."
Others are not fortunate to get rid of alcohol in this way.
At eight o’clock in the evening, sanitizers walk in shawls over the stable, who have to take care of the poor swallowers.
The nurses always show up in the rudder - always four at a time dragging a covered garment from tent to tent.
This works as with most Wiesn visitors: Empty, full back.
Who is in the promille sarg below the plane, you can't see.
"These are the things that goarnimmer packen," one of the sanitizers called me on request and disappeared in the trunk.
Name of the accident victim announced by the police
The name of a 63-year-old pedestrian who died in the hospital after being hit by a vehicle in Essex was announced.
Carole Paulson, living on Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in the accident on Friday afternoon on Shenfield Road in the city center.
She was taken to Queen's Hospital in Romford, but later died.
A 51-year-old man was arrested after the accident on suspicion of light-duty driving.
He has now been released on bail.
Turkey Expands Diplomatic Horizon
Long before Turkey sought to join the European Union, the European powers were interested in penetrating deep into Turkey’s hinterland.
On the eastern side of the Bosporus, perhaps just 20 steps within Asia, stands one of the finest relics of this failed imperial endeavor.
The Hydarpasha railway station was designed by the two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in the Neo-Renaissance style.
At least that’s what the guides tell you.
The building sits knightly at the end of the railway staircase with a tower at every corner of the front and thus looks like some kind of provincial German town hall.
The stone is dirty.
The whole building collapses around
But once you are inside the curved ticket switch, there is no doubt about the supremacy of the project, whose westernmost access was this.
The station was opened in August 1908 by a German consortium, the Anatolian-Bagdad Society.
Germany, which was a late trainer in the imperialist game, had before his ambitions to dominate the Middle East, by means of a train connection to Damascus, Baghdad, and beyond what is now Saudi Arabia.
However, Germany’s imperialist projects took place during the First World War.
His railways were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his Arabs.
The relative isolation of its surrounding region, created by the insurmountable boundaries of the Cold War, has disappeared.
British forces pulled out of Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria
And there was also bad news for the Hyderpasha train station.
In 1917, an ammunition train flew into the air, destroying the artificial roof.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then, it has slowly collapsed, largely from history.
Nowadays, however, this railway line, at least symbolically, serves as a gateway to Anatolia and all the east of it to highlight the expansion of the diplomatic horizon of Tyukei.
The ruling Justice and Development Party, the AKP, has introduced a new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of the neighbouring regions, created by the borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
There is now a policy of approximation.
Notably, the Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian separatist groups Hamas and Fatah, with Iran and Iraq, and of course with the European Union and the United States.
In order to assess the corner details of this new foreign policy, I have climbed the night train to Ankara, the Turkish capital, to visit one of the leading foreign policy experts of the AKP, the Turkish MP Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning, about ten-and-a-half hours later, after a hollow ride on rails that produced the parallel of the old world in the well-known documentary "The Night Mail", I arrived in the Turkish capital, which will be named as a new city for the new world-wide project, to the Ottoman process.
However, the AKP, known for its Islamist roots, represents a paradigm shift in Turkish unity
This has caused a lot of mistrust in the West, especially in Washington.
A taxi took me to the main office of the AKP, a specially designed, ultra-modern stone and steel construction, in an evolving suburb, surrounded by half-finished shopping centers and bars where middle managers in costumes, both men's and women's dresses, wore off the clothes.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a middle-right politician of almost any other political party in Europe.
Suit, tie, I'm sure he even packed a blackberry.
“The objective of the party’s foreign policy is now to reintegrate Turkey with its immediate neighbors.
The Cold War was an exceptional event,” he told me.
Turkey was cut off from its backyard.
Nowadays, she has to look east and west at the same time.
There would be neither one nor the other.
She'd have to do both.
"But surely Turkey could at some point," I asked, "be forced to make a decision?"
"Turkey," he said, "didn't have to make that decision."
He then pointed out a point that almost everyone I spoke with here almost routinely said: Turkey's relations, not only with the Middle East, but also with the Caucasus and around the Black Sea, are as advantageous for Europe and the United States as they are for Turkey.
With Turkey on board, the embassy seems to be able, in a transmitted sense, to drive Europe as a whole on flat railways eastwards towards Asia and the Middle East.
Back at Hydarpasha Station, after another largely sleepless night, I thought of these two German lords, Mr. Knight and Mr. Conu, who had witnessed the construction of this building 100 years ago.
How surprising it would have been to learn that Europe’s ambitions in the Middle East could now, to a large extent, lie in the hands of Turkey.
And when I waited at the ferry station to bring me back across the Bosporus, I remembered that Turkey was always called “the sick man of Europe” in those days.
At the time, at least, there seemed to be little doubt as to which continent should have a right to this fascinating country.
In memory of Vernon Handley and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown writes: As Guildford's musical director since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley was responsible for the Guildford Philharmonic and Choir.
As part of his music program for the city, the following year he founded his great youth choir, Proteus.
It was designed for teenagers up to 21 years old, but when the choir sang for the last time in 1979, some of us were already at the end of 20 – we simply refused to leave the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological shape changer) stood for the choir's willingness and ability to attack any piece of music presented to him, whether it was a madrigal or from the Messiah, a capella or with a full orchestra.
The musical versatility of such a young choir was often astonishing, always exciting, and consisted solely of the inspiration of that man and his enthusiasm for the music, which over the years never faded.
How often did death stop us from “speaking the music for ourselves.”
He kept saying, "The composer knows what he wants."
It's all in music.
"Sing it too!"
His manner of conducting was absolutely clear and precise, never dominant, but never overwhelming.
No matter how high the musical level was, he always demanded an even higher level.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any conductor was to be beaten to the knight, it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well during the last two decades, from 1962 to 1982, where he led the Guildford Philharmonic.
Over the last 40 years, I’ve written criticisms for over a hundred of his concerts and I can honestly say that I’ve never been disappointed by a single one – I’ve often been inspired by them.
Death Handley was that rare combination of size and personal modesty.
He hated conductors who, according to him, simply “were going to live with one or two well-known shepherds in the world.”
So many of us will miss him.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
In your descent to William Woodruff (September 25), you write that "in 1946 he resumed teaching economic history in Oxford and received a Houblon-Norman research scholarship in 1950 ... while at the same time studying for a BSc, MA and doctoral degree.
This is a conclusion from an author's remark in Woodruff's book "Beyond Nab End", but it is not true.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a lecturer in economic history at the University of Nottingham and during this time he wrote a doctoral thesis on the British rubber industry under the supervision of Professor J.D. Chambers, which was later published in 1958 as "The British Rubber Industry".
He was in the United States from 1950 to 1951 in the course of a Houblon-Norman scholarship, and spent the summer of 1952 at the Universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham and went to Illinois.
It is not known why Woodruff wanted to hide this part of his career.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Philology.
`I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resino 'Flamenco and Life' because his photographs in black and white, documentary style, are fantastic.
They drew my attention to them because of their simplicity and the power they emit, as they always treat the protagonists with respect.
An exhibition that shows a lot of emotions.
Resino knows how to find the magic moments."
Second round of excellent sales at Honda.
In November, Honda will catch up with the marketing of the second generation of Honda Jazz.
While its predecessor model had a large interior, this large room limousine offers an even larger one.
In addition, the technical subtleties that make it even more convenient to drive and save gasoline.
Changes before the upcoming revolution.
This is the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although, aesthetically speaking, the new jazz has a similar line to its predecessor, the changes that have been made to this large limousine are numerous.
Among other things, the innovative design, the new space flexibility, the larger dimensions of the car and the new mechanics will be emphasized.
However, before you start analyzing the new model, you have to say that this new jazz appears six years later, after the first generation appeared on the market.
According to the first observations, Honda, compared to the other manufacturers, managed to renew this model for a shorter period of time.
Although Honda Jazz is less known in Europe, this model is a phenomenon in terms of its sales in other markets.
This is the case in Japan, where jazz is the best-selling car of the year 2002 and also in the course of this year 2008.
After jazz was released on the market, about one million models were sold in Japan alone.
The second sales market was the Old Continent, with about half a million cars sold in six years.
Nevertheless, Honda is trying to increase sales of the new jazz model within the segment.
In this way, while Japanese companies sold a total of 83,000 jazz models in 2007, the expected estimates are at 10,000 cars, representing 17% of the expected growth in the European market.
As far as the Spanish market is concerned, Honda has sold a total of 8,000 jazz models since 2002, representing 6.7% of the total sales of Honda in Spain.
As for the new generation of the model, the head of the branch in Spain expects to be able to sell 2,000 jazz models per year.
More specifically, the emergence of the new Honda Jazz model allows to conceal sales in Spain.
In reality, the brand’s managers hope to complete the year with total sales of 22,000 models. That’s 4,000 cars less than in 2007, a reduction of 16%.
Despite this sales growth, Honda has increased its market share in Spain from the previous year (1.6%) to 1.8%.
At the same time, the Japanese company hopes to reach 2% in 2010.
To achieve this share, Honda is relying on the emergence of a new model.
Insight, a 5-door hybrid car with a compact size of 4.7 meters in length, the Japanese company hopes to sell around 200,000 models a year worldwide.
According to market estimates by the Japanese manufacturer, 50% of Insight models are sold in the United States, while the remaining share is distributed on the Old Continent and Japan.
The launch of the Insight on the market is scheduled for the first months of the year, for the first time its public presentation will take place in January in Valencia.
With regard to the first generation, the new jazz is growing in all its sizes.
Its length is 3.90 meters (plus 5 centimeters), its width is 1.69 meters (plus 2 centimeters) and the distance between the axes is 2.50 meters, which leads to the assumption that it has become 5 centimeters larger.
The height, on the other hand, does not change and remains 1.52 meters.
Along with the increase in dimensions, the interior is also enlarged.
This success is due, on the one hand, to the new room flexibility program and, on the other hand, to the central position of the fuel tank, a solution that was also used in the predecessor model of Jazz.
Also, the capacity of the trunk, which has a system of double charging area, reaches up to 339 litres, which is 19 litres larger than the capacity of the first generation trunk.
It should be noted that these measures are available in the version with a 1.4-liter petrol engine, as the capacity of the Honda Jazz’s trunk with a 1.2-liter petrol engine is 379 litres.
Among other improvements, other than the additional equipment elements such as leather seats or the possibility of installing panoramic windows, an improved access to the seats is offered.
The opening angle of the rear doors is 80 degrees, with the first jazz having only 67 degrees.
The second-generation engines of jazz are also new.
At the beginning of its marketing, this small model has 2 versions of the petrol engines: 1.2 and 1.4 litres.
Both variants have i-VTEC system, which enables low fuel consumption and lower CO2 emissions, has excellent technical performance and at the same time provides high torque performance for the entire engine life.
The first 1.2-liter variant achieves the power of 90 hp at 6,000 torques with a maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4,900 min.
This petrol engine - the predecessor model of Jazz reaches 78 hp - has 5.3 liters of gasoline consumption and CO2 emissions of 125 grams.
With regard to the predecessor engine, which reached 83 hp in the previous generation, it is now able to reach 100 hp.
The Jazz 100 PS 1.4 has 5.4 liters of fuel consumption and 128 grams of CO2 emissions.
'Car Bee', which avoids collisions
In order to advance the development of accident prevention technologies, Nissan was inspired by the nature, more precisely, by the bees.
The Japanese company has developed a robot whose flight is due to the swarming behavior of bees and avoids accidents.
This robot is a bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive or BR23C and represents the first step in accident prevention technologies.
Engineers from Nissan Motor Co.’s technical development center have developed this small robot in cooperation with the Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology of the renowned University of Tokyo, Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, Head of Technology PR and R&D Brand Management, the BR23C is an extension of the four-layer Nissan safety shield.
This robot is designed to ensure that the cars of this brand are able to avoid collisions.
During the flight, each bee builds its own oval-shaped airspace, which is very similar to the Nissan safety shield.
But the most important thing is the bees’ facets, which can see at an angle of 300 degrees in all directions, which allows them to fly uninterruptedly in their personal airspace without interruption.
To reshape the whole perspective, the technicians developed the so-called Laser Range Finder (LRF).
It notes obstacles that are up to two meters away from the BR23C and within a radius of 180 degrees, calculates the distance to the object and sends a signal to a microprocessor on board, which is directly translated into a signal to prevent collision
At the moment when an obstacle is observed, the small robot will mimic the bee flight and immediately change the direction by turning its wheels by 90o or larger to avoid collision.
The biggest difference to any other system is that this avoidance maneuver takes place absolutely instinctively.
If it weren’t, the robot might not be able to react with enough speed to avoid obstacles,” explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and the project’s chief engineer.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot deviate either upwards or downwards, but also not overwards; it can only move in two dimensions and in the direction that allows it to rotate its wheels and not in the infinite directions and infinitely as the bees do.
For this reason, in addition to acceleration and braking functions, Nissan has used the rotational function so that the small robot avoids collisions.
`This device only needs a few seconds to process the information and act according to this information.
It does not require either the information or the intuitive logic of the maneuvers carried out, which is why it can work continuously with just a few dozen KB of storage space.
That sounds surprising, but it’s not about the GBs and not even the MBs of storage.
This is the first step in the development of technologies for the immediate prevention of collisions, a technology that Nissan will introduce in the next ten years with serial cars.
The robot works with lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and last longer than a variety of lithium-ion batteries.
Another possible application of this technology in the future could be the integration of the unit with a GPS navigation system by satellite to drive to the destination while avoiding obstacles along the way.
She's shaking before being charged with a mortgage.
It should be noted that the U.S. Treasury Department, except that it has sufficient liquidity to provide support, is not without skill.
Before the crisis and in order to prevent U.S. citizens from getting involved in mortgage history of allegedly payable banks, a fun and informative game was developed for Internet surfers: `Bad Credit Hotel', it says.
Or perhaps, the `hotel of bad credit' or of confusion.
The third aspect of this accommodation and especially of its receptionist is to think one, two, and up to three times if it’s time to ask for a loan.
And especially where you can do it, which is also probably the goal of the game.
It certainly has useful information, but without details.
This is a site for teenagers rather than a place for all spectators.
What will happen if the game is expanded?
Well, when a dreamy room appears in the hotel.
At least something, because it’s not about buying a better house
Morgan Stanley makes its capital available to MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the entry of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) into its company, making it the first bank in Japan to spend <0x24>9 billion and thus take over 21% of its capital, an innovation due to a strong fall in its exchange rate.
A week after a preliminary agreement was made public, the two banks declared that MUFG would buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley’s stock at a uniform price of <0x24>25.25, resulting in a total of <0x24>3 billion.
The assumed price is below 19% of the stock’s price value as of August 31.
MUFG will invest an additional <0x24>6 billion in the acquisition of convertible shares, which will guarantee it a 10% profit and can be resold at a price of <0x24>31.25.
Morgan Stanley said the global business will be based on a single average price of <0x24>29, which is 28% above the current price.
However, Morgan Stanley’s stock fell 6.79 percent to <0x24>23.07 by 17.00 GMT.
“This strategic link is an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley’s transition to the status of a holding bank,” said John Mack, CEO of the American Group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this status last week, allowing him to expand his business to new areas, but under the supervision of the Federal Reserve.
His connection with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces Wall Street’s biggest names to take a much more cautious stance than before.
The modalities presented on Monday also show that the agreement has changed over the last few days: Last Monday Morgan simply stated that it would sell up to 20% of its shares to Japan for about <0x24>8.5 billion.
“A week ago,” Tokyo chief executive Toshihide Mizuno said, “we thought that the stake would be entirely of tribal shares.
But given the current economic and market situation, we wanted to reduce the risks and protect ourselves."
Based on a balanced average price, MUFG will pay 7% below its price value for its Morgan Stanley shares.
And the business will go away with a decrease in profits of about 20% per share.
The agreement provides that in one year, MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferential shares into stocks if the latter is exchanged at more than 50% above the sales value within a given time frame, i.e. approximately <0x24>47.
Morgan Stanley assures that the funds delivered by MUFG will enable him to take advantage of investment opportunities, strengthen his balance sheet and increase his sales.
However, a spokesman for the group refused to provide more detailed information on the strategic plans of the two new allies.
After investing in MUFG, Morgan Stanley should be able to book a solvency rate of about 15%, one of the best in the sector.
Morgan said he had "significantly" lowered his balance sheet since the end of August.
The last few weeks have been tough for the group, who had to watch their exchange rate drop by half, while the price for insolvency insurance has accelerated to the level.
This price went back on Monday, but remained at a high level, at about 12%.
Goldman Sachs, the only surviving major investment banks on Wall Street after the bankruptcy of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the acquisition of Merrill Lynch, announced last week <0x24>15 billion, partly at Berkshire Hathaway, the group of Warren Buffett.
Rafael Correa on Monday in Quito.
The republic re-established around 21st century socialism.
This is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
It was this Sunday, following the example of his peers and friends, that he chose the plan for a new constitution.
Mission fulfilled, because according to the public results of 80% of the voters, 64% voted 'yes' in the referendum.
According to these results, 28% voted ‘no’, 7% of the ballots were invalid and 0.7% were empty.
In order for the draft constitution to be adopted, more than half of all votes cast must be obtained.
On Sunday, two polls conducted at the polling stations and a countdown of a non-governmental organization announced a clear victory for 'yes', and he predicted 63% to 70% of the time.
On the night of Sunday to Monday, Rafael Correa had, by the way, called for the victory of his draft constitution.
“The Constitution has triumphed overwhelmingly,” he said in Guayaquil, the seat of the government 280 kilometers southwest of Quito, and congratulated the Ecuadorians.
Of course, Rafael Correa was congratulated by Chávez and Morales, but also by his Chilean like-minded Michelle Bachelet.
The election, which was held in silence according to the observation board of the Organization of American States (OAS), referred to a text consisting of 444 points to secure ‘new socialism’, for which the president is committed.
The draft constitution transfers the state power to the economy by giving it the sole right to 'development planning' in a country that lives mostly from the oil supply by foreign companies and from the foreign exchanges that send immigrants to the country.
The project, which is being pushed forward by the Correa elected in 2006, also grants the Head of State more comprehensive power, which will be able to exercise up to two consecutive mandates of four years each, and will have the opportunity to dissolve the National Assembly.
Correa has already announced that he will use this power and will seek a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution also guarantees the principle of free medical care and schooling, which the President has already begun to introduce in this country with 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
Ultimately, it also plans to ban the presence of foreign troops, which will put an end to the agreement between Quito and Washington to use an Ecuadorian base as a base for American antidrug operations.
19 hostages freed in Chad
An Egyptian commando launched the attack on the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight companions, who had been captured ten days ago.
They are in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions, who were held captive in the desert for eleven days, were brought back to the Egyptian capital this afternoon healthy and unharmed.
The next day, they were freed from an Egyptian command in Chad.
Apparently in good condition, the hostages arrived on board a special aircraft at al-Maza military base right next to Cairo International Airport at about 3:30 p.m.
They were taken directly, without being able to speak to the press, on board a helicopter to the hospital of Maadi, a foreign district of Cairo, to be examined there.
They enjoy all 'best health' and the kidnappers 'were not paid a ransom', said Egyptian tourism minister Zoheir Garanna on the roll-field.
After being captured on September 19 at a field car safari at the foot of Mount Ouanat in the border area of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, the hostage group was repeatedly brought from one hiding place to the next by 35 unknown hijackers.
These are eleven tourists – five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian – and eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the agency Aegyptus, the organizer of the safari.
An Egyptian security official said 30 members of the special forces, aboard two helicopters, launched the attack at night, just before dawn.
“On both sides were shots and half of the kidnappers were killed, the rest fled,” said the official, who wants to remain anonymous.
He said a total of 150 members of the Egyptian special forces had been sent to Sudan, where they received support from German and Italian commandos.
The chief of Italian diplomats, Franco Frattini, reported from Belgrade, where he is, about the role played by the secret agents and elements of the Italian special forces.
“We must recognize that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and performance of our men from the intelligence and special forces,” he said without further details.
He also argues that a ransom has been paid.
On the eve, the Sudanese army claimed to have stopped a field vehicle during a patrol in which the kidnappers were, six of whom they killed, including the leader from Chad, and two arrests.
The army stated that it was linked to a rebel group from Darfour, but the movement Liberation du Soudan Unité (SLA-U) was immediately opposed.
Letters - The Silent Majority of Culture
A debate on the financing of culture is headlines and is a central topic of the current election campaign.
It's a little better.
But an area of our cultural life remains in oblivion.
Who will stand up and expose the pitiful amounts that are given to the small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or national historical sites that are starving to death?
Which politician will dare to remind the federal government that it neglects its monuments and its culturally important structures?
That there are no laws in Quebec, as well as in Canada, that effectively protect our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government provides <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.5 million only for the restoration of the castle of Chinon in the Loire Valley?
With our American neighbors it is written in the Constitution of their country that the protection of the American cultural heritage belongs to the American culture, and that this cultural heritage must be protected by all citizens, all MPs and all government districts, in mutual agreement.
In Quebec, the Association of Historical Societyes of Quebec, at least 40,000 volunteers, gathered in 211 historical societies, strive to deal intensively with history, with a few groceries, to save the numerous private archives, and to preserve the archaeological records.
They are also often the watchdogs of our cultural heritage who protest with the power of despair when promoters and decision makers release their bulldozers on our old stones and forgotten cemeteries.
When will there be a stage for history and cultural heritage?
Benelux governments state-owned parts of Fortis Bank
With a partial nationalisation, the Benelux countries of the Belgian-Dutch Fortis Bank, which was hit by the U.S. financial crisis in turbulence, want to take the lead: the three states put the Banking and Insurance Institute, which also has subsidiaries in Hungary, on a total of EUR 11 million.
The governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands have consulted at the highest level over the weekend, together with the President of the European Central Bank and the Commission’s Competition Officer.
In the eurozone, Fortis is the first victim of the international financial market crisis that has been going on for a year, so decisions now made in connection with the bank could be of a precedent.
According to the decision taken on Sunday night, all three states will buy the respective shares of the bank at about 49 percent.
The bank is likely to sell some of its shares, especially the insurance activities purchased by the Dutch ABN Amro last year.
Fortis shares started a steep valley ride last week, with serious crisis scenarios already taking place in the second half of the week.
However, analysts agree that the bank, with its 85,000 employees, is too large for a plethora.
The Institute's securities fell 12% to a 14-year low on Friday.
Since January, the value of the shares has fallen by more than two-thirds.
Given the current stock prices, the group’s market value is EUR 14 billion, which is unrealistic according to management.
According to the management, the <0x24>700 billion costly US bailout package and the uncertainties that resulted in the markets are due to the downturn of Fortis shares.
On Monday, however, the prices increased slightly.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed as the new Director General of the Bank.
The money institute was also looking for a private buyer, but it did not find any interest in a factual offer.
The Belgian government, however, was striving to calm down – no investor should be shaken by his money, it said.
There has been no panic among the customers so far, the bank’s branches have not been stormed.
In Hungary, Fortis has independent branches, but it also calls its own leasing companies.
Fuchs in the chicken stall
Due to a person’s drug use in America, life and health insurance often refuses to enter into a contract with a customer.
Data protection experts fear that the data market could become uncontrollable.
"There are data protection programs that in any case link the use of the drug data to the consent of the data subject.
These should be in independent hands, otherwise we trust the chickens to the fox," quotes the Washington Post Richard Dick, developer of the program for tracking prescription data.
Insurance determines the fees and the amounts of reimbursement in case of damage depending on the health of the customer, and should the risk be overestimated, the insurance will not be completed at all.
Previously, the customer was sent for a medical examination, and the contract was concluded only with the knowledge of the results of the examination.
Ten years ago, Dick invented a much cheaper method: Using the customer’s identification number, he draws the data of the last one-and-a-half years from the pharmacy, which drugs were purchased, and the program calculates the patient’s disease and how his health is.
For example, if he regularly buys large amounts of cholesterol-lowering drugs, it could result in his blood fat levels being untreatablely high, which would automatically put him in a higher risk group.
There are several versions of the program in circulation - some even define a risk multiplier, so insurance only has to do more to the paper cram, but there are smaller difficulties.
One of the drawbacks is that many medications can be taken for various purposes, such as migraines and heatwaves, but also for depression.
The latter is a high-risk factor from the insurer’s point of view, while the aforementioned ones are not.
For the enquiry and processing of the data, companies have formed their own, who, before obtaining the data, ask the patient for their consent.
In the meantime, they have to do so by law, although omissions have not been waived so far.
Some companies even process the results of laboratory tests and combine them with data on drug use, thus providing an even more accurate picture of the health of patients.
More and more companies have access to the data, and controlling their use is becoming more difficult at the same time.
While there is a separate data protection law for health data, its effect extends only to health service providers and insurance.
The bill has already been submitted to Congress, according to which the authorities could also control the data processing companies.
Dick Richard understands that this is too little, so he wants to develop his program so that the data can only be shared with the consent of the data subject.
Another question is, of course, that the data subject can hardly deny access to his or her data, since otherwise the insurance companies do not enter into a contract with him or her.
And so the chickens are in some way left to the grace of the fox.
Global Dining Plan from Marseille
The European Union and India are doubling trade
Since the European Union and India are each other's leading trading partners on both sides, this was the main topic among other global problems at the ninth summit.
The French-Indian summit is also taking place today, which mainly discusses cooperation in the nuclear energy sector.
While the European Union recognizes that India is an emerging, democratic great power, which should be given more votes and co-linguistic rights in international affairs, the Member States have so far failed to agree whether or not to support New Delhi's permanent membership in the UN Security Council.
This issue was not discussed at the ninth summit in Marseille yesterday.
The French President and current President of the Council of the EU Nicolas Sarkozy, as well as Commission President José Manuel Barroso and Chief Diplomat Javier Solana received Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. An agreement was reached, according to which trade will double to 100 million in the next five years.
Given the fact that trade in goods increased from 25 billion to 55 billion between 2000 and 2007, this target is not at all so ambitious.
In this sense, the 26 existing civil aviation agreements with India have also been legally merged into an agreement, so that in the future air traffic will also be airborne.
India wants to sign the free trade agreement with the Union by 2009.
Sarkozy promised to accelerate the pact.
The aim is to create a balance in the currently unbalanced relationship between the EU and India: While the Union is India’s number one partner, New Delhi is only rank 9th among EU partners.
The summit was dedicated to global concerns.
Among them were the situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and terrorism, which both sides strongly condemned, and the convening of a UN conference was also encouraged.
The Doha round should also be completed, with both sides to blame for the failure.
The EU stressed that it is sticking to its energy and climate programme, which means that emissions of pollutants should be reduced by at least 20% by 2020.
India also agreed, as with the proposal, to close a kind of global compromise at the upcoming climate summit and to reduce greenhouse gas production by 50 percent by 2050.
The rise in food prices should also be combated, so both support the convening of an international conference on the financial crisis.
The head of the Indian government is visiting the French capital today, where he will sign an agreement on the peaceful use of nuclear energy at a bilateral meeting.
In Paris, however, contracts to French companies worth <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>20 billion are expected for the construction of nuclear reactors in India.
According to the Agency's reports, the agreement is to be concluded for 15 years.
More than 300 Italian publishers in Frankfurt
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the Frankfurt International Book Fair.
More than 300 Italian publishers will be present at the 60th Book Fair, the most important international event for the acquisition of rights.
The Frankfurt International Book Fair expects more than 7,000 exhibitors from 101 countries for the current event. They will distribute over the 171,790 square meters of the exhibition and present over 403,000 titles. Turkey will be the guest of honor of the event.
Maria Giro, Under-Secretary of the Ministry of Cultural Affairs and Activities, will represent the Italian Government during the opening ceremony in the exhibition hall: Italy will be represented in the 264-square-square-square exhibition space "Punto Italia".
This will be followed by a press conference near the Room Structure in Exhibition Hall 5.0 of the Book Fair: on this occasion, figures, trends and perspectives around the publishing industry in Italy will be discussed.
According to the data, the importance of the books of foreign writers decreases in the whole, but especially in the adult and youth section.
Billionaire Steve Fossett’s Missing Small Airplane Retrieved a Year Ago
Steve Fossett's small plane, the billionaire who disappeared on a flight over the Nevada Desert on September 3, 2007, was found.
The items have been found on a high plateau at 3000 m altitude, in the Sierra Nevada Mammoth Lakes area between the state of California and Nevada.
However, no human remains were found inside the plane.
The sheriff of Madera County, John Anderson, fully cleared the last doubts during a press conference: "The plane has been located, a troop has been sent to. Now we have the certainty that this is the plane that Steve Fossett flew with on the day of his disappearance."
Mr. Anderson also confirmed that no human remains were found in or near the plane.
The 63-year-old billionaire was declared dead in February.
The U.S. Department of Traffic Safety (NTSB) notified that a crew was sent a few hours after the plane was spotted, identifying the aircraft: it was the Bellanca 8kcab, which was lost on September 3, 2007, after Fossett was taken to a 3-star flight in Neringdaton.
Yesterday, in California, near the Nevada border, some of Fossett’s personal items were found by a couple near their home on Mammoth Lakes.
These are two cards with the name Fossetts, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, cash and a jacket.
The search for Fossett had been abandoned a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire had taken a place in history through a long series of records.
In 2002, he managed in the sixth lap, the first person to circumvent the world balloon in a hot air balloon: a two-week, lonely flight.
Three years later, he traveled the world in a single flight without landing in an airplane.
Among its numerous records is also a 15445 m altitude flight over the Andes, but this one with a co-pilot.
Glk, the ad you don't expect
A suv that falls from the traditional schemes due to its original design and special line guidance, the unloading surface and its clear angle.
With this offroader, Mercedes-Benz has tried to breathe new life into the sector.
It is precisely because of its extraordinary properties that the Suv Glk will also be unconventional, which will be seen from October 17 in the showroom of Mercedes-Benz.
For example, the advertising drums that will accompany the new model’s appearance will also appear in a new dress, namely in the form of a 3D campaign – a novelty in the automotive sector in the backdrop of Italy.
A project with a maximum effort to be carried out in various phases, which will take the central shopping mile of Milan, the Corso Como, until November 15.
The first phase will consist of the presentation of the car in shape, with 3D glasses distributed near Corso Como to give the whole a special look: the new Suv will thus appear in its almost real dimensions as a three-dimensional model.
In fact, the car appears so apparently from the poster on which it is depicted.
With the help of Elumina8 technology, the new Glk will be illuminated at different moments in all its details, in order to reassemble itself as a whole.
Undoubtedly, it is the concern of Mercedes with this advertisement to introduce a new kind of auto-advertising into this rather stereotype field.
But will it succeed in stimulating the interest of future buyers? We will see.
Now it is clear who the Italian Hooligans are.
They come from Triveneto – now they risk stadium ban
Who are only these 150-200 boys and girls, for whom all Italy is now ashamed? They are part of the group "Ultras Italia", which has been travelling behind the Italian national team for years and which, frankly, until recently did not cause serious problems.
Never before have there been clashes with enemy fans.
The origin of the group lies in the right environment.
The sponsors are from Triveneto.
From Verona, Padua, Trieste and Udine.
Among them were other smaller groups from Campania and Apulia in Sofia.
They carry the tricolori, where the cities of the militants appear, but they were removed on Saturday to avoid identification.
Their role models are the English fans.
In Bulgaria, there was a clash with a truly radical right-wing fan scene, that of Levski.
The Figc provided the Italian fans with 144 cards for the game: they were all on-name and thus easy to control.
In fact, they were also completely controlled by the Viminal: among those traveling to Sofia there was no one with an ongoing stadium ban procedure.
Four fans of the Italian team, who had already been preloaded in this regard, were also denied the ticket and the trip to Bulgaria.
Now the Viminal is awaiting the reports of the Bulgarian police to initiate further steps: in this case, the detained or identified typhoons can expect a stadium ban of at least five years.
This is an international ban that prevents access to the stadiums throughout Europe.
Our hooligans will no longer put a foot in a stadium.
Fortunately.
But now, of course, there are fears of imitations, which could follow these little more than 150.
“This fire must be extinguished immediately, and that will in no case give such behavior an opportunity for justification,” the Viminal said.
Therefore, "Eyes on especially also with regard to the national team game on Wednesday in Lecce."
In fact, there is a small nucleus of the Italian ultras in Apulia.
Tomorrow, the Osservatorio (Sports Supervisory) will gather on Tuesday the Casms, which can count on a part of the Aise, i.e. the intelligence services that deal with the problem of stadium management.
"Duce-Duce calls and raised right arm during Mameli's hymn? In Bulgaria this is not a crime..."
This is the thought of Domenico Mazzilli (clearly expressed without joy), who has been the director of the Osservatorio on the Viminal for a few weeks (he took over the posts of Francensco Tagliente and then Felice Ferlizzi).
Previously, Mazzilli was the police president of Trieste, where now a core of supporters of the 2002 founded Ultras Italia comes from.
It is true, Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it is not against the law to praise the Duce, but undoubtedly the behavior of these 150-200 people was a shame.
“I’m not a sociologist – adds the No. 1 of the Osservatorio – crimes are condemned in the country of their acts.
So far, this group had been held captive, but now it is necessary to think about what has happened and what will happen.
But we are also talking about the poppies during the Mamelis hymn: this too is not a crime, but they allow me, since education is lacking...”
