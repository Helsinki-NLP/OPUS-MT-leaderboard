Biker reacts lightning fast and prevents worse
On Friday night, a traffic accident occurred on the country road between Machtolsheim and Merklingen, in which a motorcyclist was only slightly injured due to his rapid reaction.
The driver overlooks the biker
A 44-year-old driver wanted to take her VW from Merklingen to the left on Landesstraße 1230 towards Machtolsheim at around 21.30.
In this case, she oversaw the 24-year-old motorcycle driver coming from Nellingen.
Hand and foot brake levers fly away in the event of collision
The biker still tried to evade the car, however, striped it in the rear of the vehicle.
Due to the strike, the hand and foot brake levers were torn down on the Suzuki and the driver was no longer able to brake.
Spiritually, he steered his motorcycle in the green stalls next to the road and let it roll out there without falling into it.
Biker suffers leg injury
However, due to the collision with the car, the biker suffered an injury to the abdomen and had to be treated in a clinic.
Breastfeeding: Corona mass infection: 174 harvesters infected
After a coronavirus mass infection in a large vegetable garden in Lower Bavaria’s mammals, nearly 500 people are under quarantine and are no longer allowed to leave the plant.
A security service monitors the ban.
A total of 174 harvest assistants were tested positive for the Corona-Error Sars-CoV-2 during the series examination, according to the Landrat Dingolfing-Landau news agency on Saturday evening.
"To avoid further proliferation, we must unfortunately take this step to protect the population," Landrat Werner Bumeder (CSU) said.
Earlier, seven employees had already been infected in the plant - this was the reason for the horse test.
The plant is a large vegetable garden, which grows strawberries, cucumbers, cabbage and red beet - but the cucumbers are only for insertion glasses.
Mamming is a rural municipality with a population of about 3300, not far from Dingolfing with its large BMW factory.
Bumeder appealed to the citizens to keep calm: "According to our information, this is a closed circle of people".
In the yard, infected people were separated from uninfected employees, the site is now surrounded by a fence.
Green and the SPD gave the government co-responsibility.
The two opposition factions accused Prime Minister Markus Söder (CSU) and his cabinet of neglecting control of the accommodations of seasonal workers.
“This can be bitterly revenge if such local infections occur and regional lockdowns need to be arranged,” said Jürgen Mistol, the Greens’ parliamentary director.
The SPD looks very similar: “We have already requested a special control program for farms with harvesters after the Corona outbreak in the Wiesenhof slaughterhouse in mid-May,” said environmental expert Florian von Brunn.
"It is precisely the hygiene conditions in the workplace and the living conditions that must be strictly controlled from our point of view.
Obviously this hasn’t happened.”
The explosion came with “announcement”.

Report: Seehofer urges longer storage of inventory data
The storage of stock data is currently suspended.
Federal Interior Minister Horst Seehofer, however, called for an extension of the storage period after a media report.
He wants to strengthen the fight against child abuse.
Federal Interior Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU) has called for an extended storage of inventory data by half a year, according to a media report.
As reported by the "image on Sunday", Seehofer asked Justice Minister Christine Lambrecht (SPD) in a letter for a rapid change in the law.
Seehofer therefore wants to strengthen measures against child abuse.
"It makes sense to make urgently necessary adjustments in the law right now," the newspaper quoted the letter as saying.
Currently, stock data storage is suspended.
A decision of the Court of Justice is expected to do so.
Seehofer, however, wants the amendments in advance, so that they can be applied immediately after a possible positive judgment, the report says.
A spokesman for the Ministry of Justice told the newspaper that it could only be reasonably examined whether legal adjustments would be needed if the courts had decided.
In the fight against child abuse and child pornography, Seehofer, together with the interior ministers of the countries, had already decided in June to save inventory data.
NBA: Stripclub winner for Clippers star Lou Williams
Excitement in the NBA!
Lou Williams, 33, a basketball professional at the Los Angeles Clippers, is said to have left the tournament quarter in Disney World in Orlando, Florida, with permission for a funeral.
According to U.S. media reports, however, he still visited the "Magic City" strip club in Atlanta in the evening.
Williams, who is reported to have admitted to the visit according to ESPN, is again in isolation, is being tested daily for Covid-19.
Its reason for visiting: Chicken Wings.
In February of last year, "Sweet Lou", as he is called in the NBA, has already expressed his love for exactly these wings.
The American wrote: "Magic City and Blue Flame (another strip club in Atlanta, A.R.) have the best wings in the city".
NBA insider Shams Charania announced on Twitter on Sunday that NBA Williams had ordered a 10-day quarantine.
This means that the Clippers star misses the first two official matches after the test game phase.
In Disney World, the NBA wants to finish the Corona season.
Currently, the best 22 teams with training games are preparing for the season final starting at night on Friday.
Söder comments on the Corona situation after mass infection
Munich - Health Minister Melanie Huml (CSU) has already announced a tea plantation for large farms on Sunday.
The press conference will be seen live on our homepage.
The case in Mamming in Dingolfing-Landau County has frightened authorities and politics.
Almost 500 harvesters from several countries are currently working on the large vegetable farm, with over a third infected with the coronavirus.
The court is currently under quarantine and is closed with a construction fence.
No one can leave the premises, food is delivered.
The 3300 inhabitants of the municipality are now offered free coronavirus tests by the authorities.
Since harvesters had little contact with the local population, the Land council has so far assumed that the infections did not spread beyond the court.
"Consciousness": Confession of the alleged firefighter of Nantes
"My client has proven to be cooperative," lawyer Quentin Chabert told the newspaper.
The defendant added, "He regrets the actions very much, the confession was a liberation for him."
His mandate was "pleased by conscience and greatly taken by the extent of destruction".
In the case of a conviction, the man will be sentenced to 10 years in prison and a fine of 150,000 euros.
The Gothic St. Peter and Paul Cathedral in Nantes was severely damaged by a fire last Saturday night.
The fire broke out in three places far from each other in the church.
Laboratory investigations hardened the suspicion of fire foundation.
The suspect now detained had already been arrested a few hours after the fire.
He was released a day later.
The man volunteered for the Diocese of Nantes and was responsible for the closure of the cathedral on the eve of the fire.
As there was no trace of a violent intrusion into the church, he quickly stepped into the eye of the investigators.
Discuss the abolition of the 50<0x2B>1 rule
Former DFB President Reinhard Grindel has recommended considering the abolition of the 50<0x2B>1 rule.
"German football should at least discuss setting conditions and clear rules for investors before the European Commission creates completed facts," Grindel said in a statement.
"For the clubs that are closest to Bavaria and Dortmund to become dangerous, the 50<0x2B>1 rules do not work anyway: see Leipzig or Leverkusen.
In so far as we do not go around the debate about whether or not it is forbidden for associations that want to break into this phalanx to facilitate the involvement of investors."
However, he has doubts as to whether there is a willingness in the German Football League to allow majority participations that are prohibited by the 50<0x2B>1 rule in the Bundesliga.
"It remains a legal risk to draw investment fences in a European single market to the Bundesliga's economic location," Grindel said.
The former DFB chief sees the danger that "trying to ensure more competitive balance in the Bundesliga will ultimately only weaken the competitiveness of our top clubs at European level, but not lead to more tension in the championship".
Even an even distribution of TV funds will not have a decisive effect.
"FC Bayern makes a turnover of 750 million euros, Borussia Dortmund of 500 million and RB Leipzig of 300 million.
So the differences between the first three clubs alone are already huge.
The other 15 associations have an average budget of 130 million,” the 58-year-old said.
Looking at the past, Grindel feels betrayed.
"Unfortunately, there have been people who have noticed this mistake and pierced the press, instead of addressing me," Grindel said of the acceptance of an expensive watch that had led to his resignation in April 2019.
"This has already been very busy for me humanly."
The gift worth about <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>11,000 he had received from a Ukrainian official.
"I committed a compliance breach, and it was right to take the consequences out of it," Grindel said.
"With the ominous gift of the watch, I have been completely transparent and seamless.
Many people in the DFB knew about it.”
He never “made a heel out of the gift,” the 58-year-old said.
"That can be called naive, at least this form of transparency was the complete opposite of corruption."

Investigations have been initiated.
Rakoczy in Bad Kissingen: Historical costumes against Corona
Although the large sauna in the town was lacking, visitors and performers enjoyed the Rakoczy flair of the alternative program.
It was unusual for visitors, performers and organizers: the Rakoczy weekend without the Rakoczy party.
But: Even though the big party parties in downtown were missing, the crowds and program highlights like Saale, Rakoczy ball or festivities burned, so many came at their expense with the Corona-compliant alternative program.
"I think we've managed to spread Rakoczy flair," says curriculum director Sylvie Thormann.
The guests would have accepted it well.
In principle, it goes back to the beginnings of the Rakoczy festival, as well as the historians alone were the focus of the festival.
Pleasant atmosphere
Vesna Konhäuser has been visiting the Rakoczy-Fest Bad Kissingen with her husband for more than 25 years.
This time in the Corona year.
The couple have made it comfortable at the Luitpold Casino, watching the historicals while flinging and listening to Cuban live music at the game bank restaurant.
"I find it so pleasant," says Konhäuser.
She misses the masses of people who otherwise do not belong to Rakoczy.
But for this, you lack the usual program highlights, especially the halls on Friday night, as well as the historic fortress and the final fireworks on Sunday night.
"That's a shame.
The weather would have been great this year,” she says.
Rakoczy Reitturn to be held again
For the performers of the historical tourists, the alternative program meant in part more work.
About Christina Gold, who participates in the festivities in a normal year and can be seen there on the Kutsche of the Kurgarten café.
This year she was walking in the city on Saturdays and Sundays in costume.
"It's already harder, otherwise we'll have it easier," she says.
The riding club had less to do, even if individual riders were on the move in the park.
"We are very hopeful that the riding quadrille will take place again next year," said Ulrike Waldhofen, the chairman of the team.
She announced that after several years of pause in 2021, a Rakoczy riding tournament will also be held again.
28 Corona cases in Spanish second-tier Fuenlabrada
Spanish footballer CF Fuenlabrada is slipping deeper into the crisis due to a coronavirus outbreak.
Since the newlywed from near Madrid, despite the first coronavirus cases, flew to the city of A Coruña on July 20, a deep blow follows the next.
Till Sunday, 28 players or team members had been tested positive, one of them came to the hospital, the club said.

When the team was already in A Coruña, "five or six" other team members were positive in the Corona Test.
The game was cancelled 60 minutes before the start, Tebas Llanas said.

"I'm just sticking out with the team the framework conditions, how and in what form it could go on," the 35-year-old told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung on Sunday.

Kovac testes with Monaco against Frankfurt

The eight-time French champion will be staying at the Hessen, the former club of Croatia, on August 1.

Before moving to FC Bayern Munich, Kovac had coached the Hessen from 2016 to 2018 and led to the victory in the DFB Cup.
"A high-ranking opponent like Monaco is a good test for us in terms of the game against Basel.
Like all Frankfurters, I look forward to seeing you again with Niko Kovac,” said Eintracht coach Adi Hütter.

Argentina rejects the offer of the creditors
The new demands could not be met, the Ministry of Economy in Buenos Aires said on Saturday.
"This would be not only irresponsible, but also unfair," it said in a statement.
"While 50 percent of children in Argentina live in poverty, we cannot increase the short-term profits of our creditors".
The debts of the second largest economy in South America are no longer viable under current conditions.
Argentina is therefore calling on its private creditors to give up part of its <0x24>66 billion (about <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>59 billion) claims.
If there is no agreement, the country will again be threatened by the government.
It would be the ninth insolvency in Argentine history.
Lastly, lenders had demanded higher interest rates on state bonds and amendments to some contract clauses.
However, the Argentine government is holding on to its latest offer and is not ready for any further concessions.
Argentina is in a serious financial and economic crisis.
Lastly, the inflation rate was more than 50 percent.
For the current year, experts expect a decline in economic power of about ten percent.
At the end of May, Argentina had failed to meet interest claims amounting to <0x24>503 million, resulting in a limited default on payments.
Professionally arrived - not yet private
"It's going great" - this conclusion draws Dr. Stefanie Kramer after her first days at the notariat in Eggenfelden.
In the end, everything went very quickly: in mid-May, Dr. Stefanie Kramer learned that she will be the successor of Lutz Feller at the notary office in Eggenfelden.
Already six weeks later, in early July, the graduated lawyer took up the job, the normal day business has long been on full tours.
"But I still have to arrive privately," she explains in a conversation with the Rottal indicator and laughs.
The short lead time, of course, has not been enough to move the food point from Regensburg completely to Eggenfelden, reports the born Dingolfingerin.
Currently she is with her husband, who works as a judge at the county court in Regensburg, looking for a suitable apartment or house in the city.
At least her husband has been able to apply for a short-term parental leave in order to be able to ensure the care of both daughters (31<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 and 11<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 years old).
In order not to have to travel every day from Regensburg, she sometimes also has a place to stay with her parents in Dingolfing, the 39-year-old explains.
Growing up in the neighbouring district, the city of Eggenfelden has, of course, been a term for a long time.
During local visits with her family in the past months, she recently found that "Eggenfelden is a really beautiful small town".
The more pleased she was that she had raced in the selection process around the free space.
Also in Dr. Stefanie Kramer’s professional career, her homeland Niederbayern plays a central role: after studying law in Passau, she passed her referendum period and the 2nd state exam in Regensburg.
After several stations as a notarist, including in Rehau and Hof in Oberfranken, Babenhausen in Unterallgäu and Regensburg - during this time she also "alongside" the promotion in labour law - she took her first place as a notary in Rotthalmünster in Passau County in 2012.
In 2016 she went on parental leave, followed by the move to Regensburg.
Since then, she has held representative offices in various notariats.
When the position in Eggenfelden was laid off due to the imminent retirement of Lutz Feller, she saw the right time for full professional re-entry, the 39-year-old explains.
The team of their predecessor, who will take over the holiday representation at the notariat office in the future, has completely taken over Dr. Stefanie Kramer - and immediately has a praise for the team at the office: "It's going great!"
The fact that she can rely on recorded processes here makes it easier for her to take care of the upcoming shift of the private food point.
In terms of kindergarten and kindergarten areas, she has already made contact with a local facility.
And if everything works out as desired, she hopes to be able to follow her hobby here too soon - and get to know the most beautiful jogging tracks in the Red Valley.
BVB plans to start league with a maximum of 15,000 spectators
Dortmund The largest German football stadium in Dortmund will not even be filled to 20 percent for the start of the season in the event of a fan return.
“Based on the distance regulation, which is compulsory to comply, we plan to have 12,000 to 15,000 spectators according to the current state,” Borussia Dortmund’s CEO Carsten Cramer told the Daily Mirror.
Normally, the arena in the revierstadt at Bundesliga games has just over 81,000 spectators.
In the ghost games caused by the Corona pandemic last season, the BVB lost around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>4 million per game.
The Cramer, responsible for marketing, digitalization and internationalization at the BVB, hopes that, in addition to the normal spectators, some of the around 4,000 seats in the hospitality area can be reopened: "It is of course a blow to the office if these revenues completely break down."
In the face of the ongoing coronavirus crisis, everyone is currently "well advised to take a stable sideline for the first time".
“If many companies are not doing well and 6.8 million people are working short in Germany alone, the need for entertainment is limited,” said Cramer.
The Dortmund marketing chief praised the BVB professionals for their pay-off share, which is supposed to contribute to overcoming the crisis: "Of course, players know that their pay-off has a different effect than when we look at short work for 100 people working in merchandising."
Small Miracles: Early Start to Life with a Few Hundreds of Grammes
Harder than a packerl butter, just three tablespoons of blood throughout his body: that was Gabriel when he was born - he weighed exactly 273 grams.
The bub is one of about 400 premature babies that are taken care of at the children’s clinic in Graz every year.
A quarter of them weigh less than 1,500 grams, a few - like Gabriel and his brothers Raphael and Michael - are extremely lightweight with not even a kilogram of birth weight.
They are so small and so early that neither lungs, intestines, or muscles are fully formed.
Your skin is sometimes so delicate that it could damage the electrodes of an ECG.
And they are so tiny that they sometimes wear doll clothes and mini-windows made specifically for them.
But not so small that they would not be at voice - "and how," Berndt Urlesberger whispered.
"Although of course they don't scream as loud as big babies".
When the Whiteboard becomes the stage
Despite the Corona Theater in the classroom: The Whiteboard as a stage experienced the 9th grade of the St. James High School in Abtsgmünd just before the start of the holidays.
Actress Julia Sylvester from the Aalen Theater presented the production "Das Hauskleid" to the students - via video.
Subsequently, the students were able to exchange via Skype with the actress and director Winfried Tobias about the play and the performance.
The idea for the performance format was born from the current Corona situation.
Teacher Teresa Nar was pleased with the enrichment of the lesson.
Even if all the participants agreed at the end that the direct meeting in the theatre and stage space would provide additional stimuli, the theatre also shows the potential for contact with the schools.
“If we continue to improve the technical framework, it could be an interesting addition to the gameplay,” said director Winfried Tobias.
First round: TSV 1860 would meet Eintracht Frankfurt in the DFB Cup
Should TSV 1860 qualify for the DFB Cup, the Lions will meet Eintracht Frankfurt in the first round.
This resulted in the release on Sunday.
Munich - Sixty possible opponents in the first round of the DFB Cup are fixed.
The Lions would meet at Eintracht Frankfurt with a successful qualification.
This resulted in the opening on Sunday night at the ARD sports show.
Because the participant field is not yet complete due to the Corona pandemic, seat holders were used at the exit.
Thanks to the voluntary resignation of semi-final opponent FC Memmingen, the TSV 1860 is already in the final of the Bavarian Toto Cup (September 4 or 5).
There the lions meet either the Würzburger Kickers or Viktoria Aschaffenburg.
Should Würzburger Zweiliga-Aufstieger reach the final, sixty would already qualify for the first round in the DFB Cup.
Otherwise, the Giesingers would have to play in the final against Regionalligist Aschaffenburg.
The first round of the DFB Cup will be held between September 11 and 14, and thus a week before the third league start.
"From the Wind": film legend Olivia de Havilland is dead
The film legend and Oscar winner Olivia de Havilland is dead.
She died in Paris on Sunday at the age of 104, a spokeswoman for the German news agency said.
De Havilland was best known for her role as Melanie Hamilton in the South American film "From the Wind" (1939).
Born as a child of British parents in Tokyo, Olivia de Havilland moved to California as a child.
The Austrian theaterman Max Reinhardt discovered the 19-year-old in the role of Shakespeare's "Summer Nightmare".
The Warner Brothers film studio contracted her for seven years and brought her out with Erall Flynn.
Eight movies she filmed with the heartbreaker.
In 1946 she won her first Oscar in the lead role of "To Each His Own".
The film was directed in Germany under the title "Mother Heart".
Three years later, the award came as the best actress in William Wyler's "The Heiress" (The Heir).
Many recognitions were also given to her as a neurotic eccentricist in "The Dark Mirror" and "The Snake Mine".
Daphne du Maurier introduced her in 1952 for the lead role in the filming of her novel My Cousin Rachel.
The piece became a worldwide success.
With her longtime girlfriend Bette Davis, she played in "Wiegenlied for a Body".
From his marriage to the writer Marcus Goodrich (1946 to 1953), his son Benjamin emerged.
In Paris, de Havilland married journalist Pierre Paul Galante and had the daughter Gisèle with him.
This marriage broke up, too.
However, rumors about an affair with former British Prime Minister Edward Heath have never been confirmed.
"Road to Timmendorf": Beach volleyball: Thole/Wickler miss Finale bei Comeback
World Cup seconds Julius Thole and Clemens Wickler missed the final at the beach volleyball tournament "Road to Timmendorf".
At the meeting of the top teams in Düsseldorf, they presented their national team colleagues Nils Ehlers and Lars Flüggen with 1:2 (17:21, 21:17, 19:21).
Last time, Thole/Wickler played at the World Tour Final in Rome in September last year.
In the final game at the Rhine, their goalkeepers Ehlers/Flüggen defeated the surprise team Lukas Pfretschner and his interim partner Steven van de Velde by 0:2 (17:21, 17:21).
In addition to the show tournament, three start places for the German championships were played in early September in Timmendorfer Strand: the tickets were secured by Armin Dollinger/Simon Kulzer, Manuel Harms/Richard Peemüller and Simon Pfretschner/Milan Sievers.
Kalbitz eject from AfD confirmed - FDP speaks of "Feigenblatt"
The exclusion of Andreas Kalbitz from the AfD is, from the viewpoint of the FDP, only a “feelsheet” and does not change the character of the party.
"The AfD is the parliamentary arm of the right-wing extremists in Germany.
Andreas Kalbitz is only part of the tip of the Iceberg of the Radicals in the AfD,” FDP internal politician Benjamin Strasser told the dpa news agency in Berlin.
The Federal Arbitration Court of the AfD on Saturday in Stuttgart had confirmed the exclusion of Kalbitz, which was decided by a majority by the Federal Board in May.
Kalbitz is the chairman of the AfD faction in the Brandenburg Landtag.
“If the AfD were really about consistently removing right-wing extremists from their party, officials like Björn Höcke and his supporters would have long been excluded,” Strasser said.
"But there is no political will in the AfD, because right-wing extremism is now part of the party."
Similarly, CSU Secretary-General Markus Blume said: "The fact that Andreas Kalbitz is now excluded says nothing and does not change anything," he told the "World on Sunday".
"It speaks rather volumes, how many frenetic supporters still have a right-wing extremist in the middle of the AfD".
Blume assumes that the AfD will land below 5% in elections in the future.
"The days of the AfD in parliaments are counted".
Kalbitz was one of the spokesmen for the officially dissolved "wing" around the Thuringian AfD country and faction chairman Björn Höcke; the constitutional protection classifies the swing as a "secure right-wing extremist endeavour".
In May, the AfD Federal Board had expelled Kalbitz from the party.
As a reason, he stated that Kalbitz had not stated an earlier membership in the now banned right-wing "Heimattreuen Deutschen Jugend" (HDJ) and among the Republicans when he joined his party.
Kalbitz contests membership in the HDJ.
Even the chairman of the left faction in the Brandenburg Landtag, Sebastian Walter, stressed that the decision of the Federal Arbitration Court does not change the nature of the AfD: "The wolf has only eaten cream.
The AfD remains a far-right party, with or without calbitt".
Neither the Federal Party nor the right wing will be weakened by this decision.
"The maneuver of the Meuthen troop is transparent.
"You want to escape further observation through constitutional protection and try to get through the radar," Walter said.
"The AfD will not let go of the spirits she called.
A draft does not change anything,” Brandenburg SPD Secretary-General Erik Stohn commented on the decision in the Kalbitz case.
"Here the AfD country association and the faction until today held its rightful leader".
The legal dispute over Kalbitz’s membership in the AfD will continue.
He announced on Saturday that he will now proceed civilly against the decision of the Federal Arbitration Court.
North Sea wind farms provide 21 percent more electricity
The wind turbines in the German North Sea have supplied 11.51 terawatt hours of electricity in the first six months of the year.
That’s 21 percent more than in the same period last year, said network operator Tennet in Bayreuth.
Tennet is responsible for the transmission of the North Sea electricity to the mainland and for the transmission through the German electricity grid.
The Baltic Sea wind farms, which are not part of Tennet’s network, have consumed another 2.22 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity.
In total, the wind current from the North and Baltic Seas is 13.73 TWh, compared to 11.64 TWh in the first half of 2019.
The wind at sea makes up almost 19 percent of the total wind current in Germany, which is about four percentage points more than a year ago.
New wind farms provide higher production capacities
The increased contribution of offshore wind energy is due, in addition to the wind conditions, to higher production capacity, because new wind farms have been networked in the past twelve months.
If the 1270 wind turbines in the North Sea were all running at the same time with full power, they could generate an estimated 6.7 gigawatts of electricity.
The transmission capacity is sufficient; according to Tennet, it is at 7.1 gigawatts.
By 2030, it is expected to rise to 17 gigawatts in the German North Sea.
“In Germany and the Netherlands, we are investing <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>20 billion in expanding offshore network connections by now,” said Tim Meyerjürgens, Tennet’s Managing Director.
In reality, wind farms can’t use their capacity even at sea, but they can reach about 40 percent.
This year’s record day is January 2, when the North Sea wind farms generated more than six gigawatts of electricity.
On average, the North Sea wind turbines produce about 2.5 to 3.0 gigawatts of electricity, equivalent to three to four nuclear power plants.
This could supply nearly seven million households with electricity.
Art "Skirmish" - an exhibition by Leipzig artist Christian Bold in the gallery of the Gmünder Kunstverein.
It was almost a small anniversary celebration of 130.
Birthday of the Gmünder Kunstverein: The exhibition opening "Skirmish" with works by Leipzig artist Christian Bold blew up the usual frame after the Corona break.
Much more art friends than usual pursued the dialogue between the artist and the chairman of the art association, Professor Dr. Klaus Ripper.
The musical equivalent was delivered by the band "Defenders of the Universe" on the southern grain house square.
To the north of the gallery, the association "Sandtogether" committed itself.
Freital: Windbergfest cancelled due to Corona
Windberg Festival will not take place this year.
The city of Freital cancelled the three-day festival scheduled for September.
In other years, over 30,000 people had visited this city festival.
"We really did not make this decision easy and - in the awareness of how difficult it is economically for the participants - we hoped until the last minute," said Mayor Uwe Rumberg.
"But in the end, we are responsible here as organisers for the health of many thousands of people."
Because if tens of thousands had flown to the mainland and to the main tent, minimum distances, hygiene regulations and a contact tracking in accordance with the current Corona protection regulation could not have been observed.
Or the restrictions would have been so strong that there would not be much left of a folk party.
In addition, the organisational and monitoring effort would increase disproportionately by a number of times.
Rumberg comforted the next year.
Then the city of Freital celebrates its 100th anniversary with the Winterberg Festival from 7 to 9 May 2021 and the Saxony Day from 10 to 12 September 2021.
Dressur Olympic Winner Worth not to beat in Achilles
Achleiten - Six-time Olympic winner Isabell Werth was the outstanding rider at the Dressur Tournament in Achleiten, Austria.
The 51-year-old from Rheinberg came to four wins on the weekend with four starts.
After winning a Grand Prix for the debut with Weihegold and Quantaz, she was also not to be beaten on Sunday in the Grand Prix Special and soon.
On the 15-year-old Stute Weihegold on Sunday, Werth played in the special against Austrian Victoria Max-Theurer on Abegglen.
Also in the curve on Saturday, the Germans were clearly on Quantaz before their 34-year-old pupil Victoria Max-Theurer.
Werth's winning horse Quantaz belongs to Max-Theurer.
The most successful dressmaker in the world is set to establish the 10-year-old henchman in the Grand Prix.
For Quantaz it was the first time ever.
Already in the first tournament in Achilles three weeks ago, Wert had won all four major tests.
The last of the three international tournaments is scheduled for August 14-16.
More fleets in Worms
The University of Worms continues into the air: the "DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung" establishes a professorship for "Air Traffic Management".
A corresponding contract between the university and the DFS has now been signed in Worms.
The contract was initially concluded for three years and will start in 2021.
With the professorship there is the possibility to allow the start of studies not only in the summer, but also in the winter semester.
This means that twice as many students can be trained as before.
At the same time, the capacities are used equally both in the university and at the DFS Aviation Safety Academy.
The DFS will advise the university on the establishment and occupation of the professorship.
Represented at the University since 2019
Since the summer semester of 2019, the first students are in the Air Traffic Management curriculum as part of their training as pilots at Worms University.
This year, nine students started.
So far, the experiences of the DFS are very positive, the performances of the students are excellent.
The combination of study and lottery training contributes significantly to further increasing the attractiveness of the lottery profession.
“In these times, it is not easy for us to promote economically.
However, we strongly expect that air traffic will recover and grow again in the long run.
In order to fulfill our legal mandate in the future, we need highly qualified personnel,” says Professor Klaus-Dieter Scheurle, CEO of DFS at the signing of the contract.
"For the DFS, the Foundation's professorship is a future-proof investment that will provide flight fleets with a broad, professionally interdisciplinary knowledge base in the long run.
Therefore, we continue the good cooperation with the university and at the same time support our attractiveness as an employer.”
Professor Dr. Jens Hermsdorf, President of Worms University, said: "The foundation professorship forms an important bridge between science and economics.
With her we would like to connect to the already existing cooperation with DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung as a practical partner for the dual bachelor’s degree program Air Traffic Management.”
The trust of Deutsche Flugsicherung is for the University of Worms’ motivation and commitment to further expand its teaching and research competence in the future fields of aviation.
In the use of tomorrow’s flight fleets, the university, with its first foundation professorship for a dual course of study, can set very special highlights and innovative focuses for its students.
Dr. Denis Alt, Secretary of State at the Ministry of Science, Education and Culture, stresses: "The University of Worms has a unique feature in Rhineland-Palatinate with its focus on aviation.
Today's signing of the cooperation agreement strengthens the profile of the university".
Rescue helicopter landing on A 45
For about 30 minutes, the A 45 motorway was completely blocked in the direction of Aschaffenburg on Saturday afternoon, as the rescue helicopters were in use after a traffic accident.
A 76-year-old man drove straight into the curve with a Ford at 12.40 p.m. on the exit of Alzenau-Mitte and landed on the guiding board.
Due to the impact, the front airbags triggered, the driver suffered minor injuries in the face and had to be taken to a hospital for treatment.
The injuries of the 72-year-old passenger were taken care of by the emergency doctor and the patient subsequently flew to a hospital with the rescue helicopter.
At the moment, however, the police assume that there is no life-threatening threat.
The damaged vehicle, which resulted in damage of approximately 2,000 euros, had to be pulled off.
Heil wants to examine other industries after meat industry
The Corona crisis brought the situation in parts of the meat industry to light again.
Violations of the law are soon to come.
But are they on the right, and will they stay there?
Federal Labour Minister Hubertus Heil (SPD) wants to review other sectors according to the strict regulations now planned against malnutrition in the meat industry.
"We will look at the industry for the industry and then take appropriate measures for the industry if necessary," Heil told the German Press Agency in Berlin.
Germany’s employers already warn against restricting work contracts in general.
Following the massive coronavirus outbreak at the meat giant Tunnies in North Rhine-Westphalia, the Bundeskabinett wants to pass a law on salvation on Wednesday.
Great slaughterhouses should no longer be allowed to employ foreign personnel when slaughtering, dismantling and processing meat.
For this purpose, the use of work contracts as well as hire workers should be prohibited there.
Employer President Ingo Kramer said the dpa: "Finger away from a general restriction on employment contracts and employee oversight if you don't want to completely disrupt the economy".
Work contracts, for example, are the basis for their value creation in the customer for large areas of crafts, construction and plant construction.
"The mistakes of individuals cannot destroy such an important instrument".
Heil said: “My goal is not to ban work contracts everywhere in the German economy.”
Work contracts make sense.
"When an industrial company hires a craftsman to install a security facility, it is a very normal work contract."
The German meat industry considers a prohibition of contracts of work and hire to work unconstitutional in its industry alone.
It is not possible to explain why in the future, when serving and packing cheeses should be considered a different labour law than in the case of sausages, according to the "New Osnabrücker Zeitung" (Saturday) in an opinion on the bill.
With a ban, consumer prices would increase by 10 to 20 percent per kilogram and product.
Multiple Eastern European employees from contracting companies worked in the industry after the results of a NRW Occupational Safety Administration examination partly 16 hours a day.
Often they did not take a break.
Salary was retained for protection equipment or rent.
It was also found that the situation in the accommodation of employees was often miserable.
Heil said a relatively sharp law had already entered into force for the meat industry in 2017.
However, through "complicated constructions", these have been circumvented.
"Now it has to be cleaned fundamentally".
The politician announced: "The Occupational Safety Act, which we want to adopt in the Cabinet at the end of July, also includes measures that concern not only the meat industry - for example, higher rates of checks on occupational safety or clear criteria for community accommodation."
The draft of the DPA includes amendments to the Act on the Protection of Worker Rights in the Meat Industry and to the Labour Protection Act.
Brandenburg’s Minister of Consumer Protection Ursula Nonnemacher (Green) believes more intensive controls are necessary.
"I wish we could do even more controls in many areas of control: food controls, animal protection, all possible, for example, animal transport," Nonnemacher said on Sunday in the RBB broadcast "Brandenburg current".
However, more staffing is also needed for more controls.
Three dead in crash of ultralight aircraft in Germany
Three people have died in the crash of an ultralight aircraft at a multi-family house in Wesel in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia, according to police.
A child was easily injured.
Two more people have been rescued in the accident, a spokesman for the Wesel Circle said.
A parachute was found at the scene, police said.
The "Rheinische Post" reported, referring to eyewitnesses, that the plane had collided with a hot air balloon before the crash.
The house is a one- or two-family house.
More details were initially not known.
Cleaning of the Frankfurt Opera House peacefully
A week after the protests in Frankfurt, the cleaning of the opera house at night on Sunday is also peaceful.
Lastly, a few dozen people remained in the square, but left before the opening hour at 1 p.m.
The police had been in service since early evening with numerous officials, a larger police order was seen throughout the city area.
For the first time this weekend, from midnight onwards, there was a ban on the entrance to the opera house, where there had been crawling a week ago.
Police had been attacked out of the crowd with bottles.
At least five officers were injured after police inputs, several police vehicles were damaged.
The night of Saturday was also quiet.
Car crashes: Young woman seriously injured in accident on Bundesstraße 83 near Hofgeismar
In an accident between Schöneberg and Hümme, a 21-year-old girl suffered serious injuries on Sunday at about 13.25 p.m.
She was taken to the Kassel Clinic.
With thermal imaging cameras, the fire brigade was looking for possible passengers.
According to police, the woman was heading to her home in Hümme on Bundesstraße 83 when her car fell off the road for an unexplained cause and crashed several times.
In order to save the deceased, the fire brigade had to cut the roof of the car.
Since it was unclear whether anyone else was in the vehicle, the adjacent cornfield was searched from the rotor with a heat image camera.
The drone stack from Warburg, which also works with thermal imaging cameras, had also been ordered for personal search.
However, the employed forces did not find anyone among the high corn plants.
The injured was taken to the Kasseler Klinik for further care by the rescue vehicle.
Nearly 50 firefighters from Hofgeismar, Hümme and Schöneberg were on site.
The federal road was closed for two hours due to the accident.
Juventus Turin Master in Italy
Turin - After a redeeming goal by Cristiano Ronaldo, record champion Juventus Turin has secured the Italian championship for the ninth time in a series.
The team around the five-time world footballer perfected the 36th Scudetto of the club's history with a 2-0 (1-0) on Sunday night in the home game against Sampdoria Genoa.
Ronaldo scored 1-0 before the half-time.
With 83 points, Turin, who entered without the last long-injured ex-national player Sami Khedira, is no longer delaying two days before the end of the season of Serie A.
The Inter Milan range is seven points back.
Juventus was harmless despite optical superiority in the first half, then Ronaldo met after a free kick with the last action.
An example of Miralem Pjanic used the 35-year-old from the penalty area directly with a flat shot (45.<0x2B>7).
Ronaldo also played 2-0 against the now more offensive guests, after his shot, Federico Bernardeschi (67th).
This ensured the glossless but decisive success.
In the 89th minute, the foul meter dropped to the latte was thought to have secured only Ronaldo with regard to the goalkeeper score.
“It’s complicated to stay mentally and physically at ball height for 90 minutes.
The games are strange, and the momentum is changing very easily," said coach Maurizio Sarri after a 1-2 win over Udinese Calcio on Thursday.
The mental exhaustion of his players is especially great, the Juve coach said.
Due to the defeat, the Turinians had not yet been able to make the championship perfect.
Lastly, Juve had the reassuring lead at the top of the table, mainly due to the weakness of its competitors.
In the eleven games ahead of the game on Sunday, the Sarri team had only five wins.
Whether Ronaldo will become a goalkeeper is questionable.
For while the Portuguese superstar has scored 31 goals so far, former Dortmund Ciro Immobile has already scored 34 goals in his account - as many as Robert Lewandowski won the title of FC Bayern.
The record is held in Italy by current Juve professional Gonzalo Higuaín.
The Argentine scored 36 goals for the SSC Naples in the 2015/2016 season.
In August, the "Old Lady" of Italian football awaits the next title opportunity.
Juventus is in the Champions League final, but on August 7th, they will have to compete against Olympique Lyon in a 0–1 draw to reach the final tournament in Lisbon.
In the next K.o. round, Real Madrid or Manchester City would be expected as opponents.
Baden-Württemberg: Over 250 illegal car races recorded
Stuttgart - Despite all threats of penalties and court rulings, drivers continue to give gas in countless illegal races on the Baden-Württemberg roads: Last year and the first four months of this year, the police have already registered more than 250 illegal car races in the southwest.
Comparative values for the previous years are not available, but the lawnmowers are doing more and more work to the judiciary: In the state prosecutors between Konstanz and Mannheim, a total of 155 investigations were conducted in 2018 for illegal races, a year later there were already 252 and in the course of the year until 15 Jun.
The race was less about organized events, as the Ministry of the Interior’s response to a request from the Landtags-SPD shows.
In most cases, the drivers have spontaneously confronted each other or had taken the flight from the police – this is also seen as an illegal race.
German men between the ages of 18 and 60 were the main drivers.
113 Penalties - 15 times detained
Only in comparatively few cases are the rasers caught and also asked for cash: According to the Ministry of the Interior, a total of 113 fines have been imposed since 2018 and 15 fines have been imposed.
However, there is no indication that the number of illegal car races is actually increasing.
Rather, other drivers reacted more sensitively than before due to the various tragic accidents and processes of the past years, and showed more frequently, a ministry spokesman said.
Highway 8 is particularly popular among racers, and drivers are always slowing down traffic to take up space and take advantage of the free route for a race.
Last August, a dozen drivers were caught near Kirchheim under the roof, three months earlier there were even 18 drivers on the A8 near Merklingen.
A81 is the most popular "runway"
On the A81, the police register even more races than on any other federal highway.
With a speed limit there is attempted to brake the razor on the particularly affected section between narrows and noisies.
The most expensive and enjoyable sports and luxury cars often have Swiss badges because drivers avoid driving too fast and driving races in the neighbouring country for lawn to Germany due to the high penalties.
For the SPD, the speed limit should not be reduced to a few routes: “With a total speed limit of 130 km an hour, we would create this problem on motorways from the body,” says Martin Rivoir, the traffic expert of the SPD-Landestag faction.
"The barrier threshold for lawnmowers would be significantly higher if you weren't supposed to be legally on the road here and there with 200 hours and more".
Rivoir says less about enlightenment or image campaigns: “Whoever goes through all the rules in this way and puts not only his own life at risk, but also the lives of other road users, is barely accessible with reason.”
ADAC calls for stronger action by the police
However, this is not enough for the ADAC: "We assume that the lawnmowers cannot be distracted from the speed limits," says Holger Bach, Head of Transport and Environment at the ADAC Württemberg.
It requires additional as well as tougher controls on the affected routes.
It is not uncommon for the high-profile force fair to become more painful and serious: between January 2019 and April 2020, three people died in the races nationwide, two of whom were not involved in a night crash in Stuttgart city centre and one in Gerlingen.
In November, two young men were given a car race.
One of the vehicles came down from the street, crashed against a garden wall and stayed on the side, the 18-year-old passenger died.
21 other people were injured in the races of the last two years.
However, tougher penalties are not necessary according to Interior Minister Thomas Strobl: "Legislative action needed to sanction illegal motor vehicles more severely is not seen," says the Ministry of Interior paper.
Blue light of July 23: Thirsty intruder steals drinks from imbiss
Rohrdorf: A man broke into an imbiss on Thursday in Rohrdorf (Calw County) and stole drinks and cash.
A witness heard noises in the valley road around 3.40 p.m. and ran towards the impass.
There he noticed a man who served himself in the refrigerator with drinks and then left the imbiss by a previously knocked door.
The perpetrator fled to the meadows behind the imbiss.
According to police, the burglar also used a cash register and stole cash in the low three-digit area.
The suspect is described as follows: He is about 1.75 to 1.80 meters tall and of strong stature.
In fact, he wore a black hoodie sweater, black pants and light shoes.
Further evidence is being received by the police.
Ackermann sprints to win final stage at Sibiu Tour
Cycling professional Pascal Ackermann has fought his second day victory at the final stage of the 10th Sibiu Tour.
The 26-year-old Pfälzer from team Bora-hansgrohe went through the 109-kilometre-long section with a start and goal in Hermannstadt in the mass sprint, after he had already won a stage on Saturday.
It was the season's three and four wins for the farmer.
In the overall score, his Austrian teammate Gregor Mühlberger came through.
The 26-year-old had decided on mountaineering for himself in the morning, thus taking the lead in the class.
Only 104 drivers had entered the final stage in the evening.
No less than 18 starters had fallen victim to the time limit in mountaineering.
"I'm really happy to start the season with a win," Ackermann said after his success on Saturday.
"The sprint was really hectic," said the 26-year-old.
300 meters before the goal, he just pulled his sprint, "and it also worked perfectly."
According to the rules of the UCI World Federation, a Corona test was performed on all race participants and their companions six days before the start of the race.
During the entire tour, drivers and caregivers were separated in isolated hygiene bubbles from the organization team as well as from the media.
Viewers at start and destination were not allowed.
Headquarters gave instructions for laity reanimation
Düsseldorf - A tragic accident on Sunday afternoon in Düsseldorf-Garath.
In a multi-family house, a child (4) suddenly lay in the water while bathing.
According to the fire department, the emergency call arrived just before 1 p.m.
"A leadership dispatcher immediately gave instructions for laity reanimation," a fire spokesman told BILD.
The arrival of the rescuers took the resuscitation measures shortly afterwards.
The life-threatening child was transported to the clinic under reanimation.
Why it crashed is unclear.
Police have routinely carried out investigations into the accident.
The fire spokesman: "We're assuming a tragic accident in the apartment."
Nuremberg: Unapproved tuning meeting - police attack, 700 vehicles and around 1100 people
Hundreds of cars and temporarily over 1,000 people took part in a "tuning meeting" on the parking lot of a furniture house on Saturday night.
The police enforced their announcement to enhance control of such events.
A big tuning meeting was held on Saturday evening (July 25, 2020) in Nuremberg Südstadt.
Hundreds of vehicles were involved.
According to the police of Mittelfranken, around 22.30 a.m., an increase in vehicle surge was detected by the Nuremberg traffic police in the area of a large parking lot in the Ingolstadter Straße.
After that, the police took over a variety of vehicle controls.
It was not until recently that the police had announced their intention to step up against the so-called car bags.
Illegal tuning meetings in Nuremberg: Only a small part of the "scene"
Officials included around 700 vehicles and about 1100 people, according to the police.
However, only a small proportion of the attendees are assigned to the "auto bags" and tuning scenes.
Apparently, most of the scene in question came from the police appeal.
On the basis of the vehicles and persons located on the site, it is to be assumed that these were predominantly bulkheads.
In addition, the majority of the attendees adhered to the applicable rules on infection protection, in particular the observance of the minimum distance and the wearing of a mouth-nose protection.
The on-the-spot checks were completed at around 1:00 a.m.
In total, the officials detected structural changes in 10 vehicles in such a way that the operating permit was extinguished.
Four of these vehicles had to be secured.
No auto racing
There were no illegal car races.
"The Central Franken Police Bureau will continue to keep an eye on what is happening and will continue to carry out enhanced control measures, including in connection with the emergence of Shaulisti," he said.
News5 spoke with Jürgen Schrödinger of the carriage company involved: "They have all the beautiful rims that we are not allowed to rape," said Schrödinger.
Special bands would be used for this.
Also because the cars are wider, the company must be careful not to make any damage.
"Young people are finally supposed to keep their cars intact".
Labour Agency figures: 900 suspected cases of misuse in short-term work
Berlin - The Federal Agency for Labour (BA) is investigating around 900 suspected cases of misuse of short-circuit wages.
"This is extremely little for more than 880,000 companies that have shown short-term work," said Daniel Terzenbach, the director of the operating business, to the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung.
When, at the beginning of the Corona crisis, many companies had suddenly applied for short work, the BA had to react quickly.
The exam usually lasts up to three weeks.
“So much time was not available to us in this hot phase.
The more we look at the final calculations.
I'm sure there's going to be a lot more.
We’re not naive and we have a long breath.”
Indications of abuse often come from the employees or trade unions concerned.
In addition, use the BA analysis software to identify patterns of abuse.
According to Terzenbach, the BA is preparing for a possible insolvency wave in the autumn.
“Will there be significantly more insolvency than last year?
The assessments go hand in hand, but we are preparing for the case and are already training our employees in the labor agencies to process applications for insolvency money.”
The numbers are still indistinguishable, Terzenbach said.
World Heritage in Potsdam: Party dissolved in the New Garden
Potsdam - On Friday night, about 40 young people celebrated a party in the New Garden.
The gathering was disbanded at 20.48 p.m. by the Prussian Castles and Gardens (PSG) Foundation, the foundation said on request.
The young people would have left the park.
On Saturday night, some young people would have played rugby in the New Garden.
The meadow had been cleared by retrievers, SPSG spokesman Frank Kallensee said on Sunday.
There are always illegal celebrations in the parks.
In the parks of the Foundation there are gatherings that do not comply with the distance and hygiene rules of the Covid-19 Intervention Regulations.
At the end of June there was a celebration with about 300 people in the park Babelsberg, a week later around 150 people celebrated in the New Garden.
Even without a corona regulation, the parks will be closed when the darkness breaks.
Parking on the meadows is prohibited, there are only a few exceptions.
The Foundation has long complained that visitors would leave more and more trash and destroy protected biotopes.
In Berlin, however, illegal park parties have reached a different dimension.
In the Hasenheide district of Neukölln, 5000 people celebrated an illegal techno party on Sunday night.
The event was disbanded by the police.
Austria: Mass tests after Corona outbreak in tourist destination
With hundreds of tests, authorities have responded to a coronavirus outbreak in the popular Upper Austrian tourist resort of St. Wolfgang.
The number of confirmed cases increased to 48, according to the state authorities in Linz.
More than 100 results were available in the evening.
According to this, many of the infected are young trainees in tourism establishments, but at least one holiday visit has also been tested positive.
Residents, guests and tourism staff were asked to stay in their accommodations on Saturday night.
The lockdown time was set at 23:00.
"There are cancellations and cancellations" of bookings, said the head of the Wolfgangsee Tourism Association, Hans Wieser, the DPA.
Individual guests are also travelled in advance.
St. Wolfgang is the most important tourist destination in Upper Austria, with more than 400,000 overnight stays last year.
In a normal season, about a third of the guests are German.
On Friday, the first infections were made public.
On Saturday, the head of the district authority, Alois Lanz, defended the behaviour of the trainees who had celebrated in several locations and could have been infected there.
"We all liked to do that in our youth," he told <0xC3><0x96>1.
However, two bars were closed on Friday to prevent further infections.
The Tourism Association launched an information campaign to raise awareness among young employees of the risks of Covid-19.
As of Saturday, hundreds of employees, vacationers and locals were tested.
In addition, all guests who were in St. Wolfgang from July 15 were contacted.
The outbreak is a reminder of the Austrian ski and party town of Ischgl in Tirol, which was a centre of the spread of the coronavirus throughout Europe during the early stages of the pandemic.
In total, more than 1,500 people are currently infected with the virus in Austria.
The main focuses of the new infections are Vienna and Upper Austria.
Premier League: Man United and Chelsea qualify for Champions League
London (dpa) - English football record champion Manchester United returns to the Champions League after a year of absence.
On the last day of the Premier League game, the Red Devils secured third place by a 2-0 (0-0) victory against direct competitor Leicester City.
The foxes now have to be satisfied with the Europa League, because FC Chelsea still passed and qualified fourth for the king class as well.
In the battle against the descent, Aston Villa was allowed to cheer.
Manchester United went through a penalty kick by Bruno Fernandes (71st minute) in the lead.
After a red card for Leicester City in the aftermath, Jesse Lingard (90.<0x2B>8) came to the final.
Chelsea, in the Champions League eighth-final opponent of FC Bayern, won thanks to Mason Mount (45.<0x2B>1) and Olivier Giroud (45.<0x2B>4) in parallel with 2:0 (2:0) against the Wolverhampton Wanderers.
"That means a lot to me," said coach Frank Lampard, who is also in the FA Cup final against Arsenal in his first season as Chelsea coach.
Chelsea's victory against Wolverhampton also benefited from Tottenham Hotspur, which with a lean 1:1 (1:0) passed the Wolves at Crystal Palace and started sixth in the Europa League.
Aston Villa decided the distance with FC Watford and AFC Bournemouth for themselves, but had to shake at West Ham United for a long time.
The late leadership of Jack Grealish (84th) equals Andrej Jarmolenko (85th) immediately.
The 1:1 (0:0) was enough, however, because Watford lost 2:3 (1:3) to Arsenal.
The club, which scored three coaches in the season, declined after five Premier League years.
Just like Bournemouth, who could no longer save himself by a 3:1 (2:1) at FC Everton.
At the end, one point was missing.
FC Liverpool, who has been England's champion since the end of June, secured a club record with a 3:1 (1:1) win at Newcastle United.
99 counters are the highest score the Reds have ever achieved in a football season.
Coach Jürgen Klopp and his team almost missed the record in English football.
The top scorer is Manchester City with 100 points in the 2017/18 season.
After Newcastle's first-minute lead, Virgil van Dijk (38th), Divock Origi (59th) and Sadio Mané (89th) played the game for Liverpool on Sunday.
"For this wonderful club, it was an extraordinary season," said van Dijk after the game, "that should motivate us to defend the title.
It's going to be hard."
At the end of the day, the Premier League bosses will also be satisfied.
Due to the coronavirus crisis, football operations in England were suspended from March 13 to June 17.
In the meantime, even a premature cancellation or cancellation of the rest of the games was discussed on neutral ground.
Eventually, however, the season could be played without any special events - however, as in Germany without spectators in the stadiums.
Arrests and violence in demonstrations against Netanyahu
The protests in Israel against Prime Minister Netanyahu are becoming more and more violent.
During the night there have been violent clashes.
Israeli police violently marched in Jerusalem on Sunday night against participants in a demonstration against right-wing Conservative Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
Twelve people have been arrested for participating in riots, police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said.
The police, among other things, used water jets to dissolve the protest.
A total of 6,000 people had gathered, according to media reports on Saturday night, near Netanyahu’s headquarters.
They protested against unemployment, corruption and Netanyahu’s handling of the Corona crisis.
The protesters beat the drums, flashed in horns, and called on Netanyahu to resign.
Participants of a regional demonstration that supported Netanyahu were also arrested, the news site "ynet" reported.
Also in many other places in Israel, people were demonstrating, including in front of the prime minister’s private villa in the coastal city of Caesarea and in a park in Tel Aviv.
A man was arrested by police near Tel Aviv on suspicion of spraying pepper spray from a driving car on protesters on the street.
Another man was arrested after a knife attack on a protester in the south of the country.
The protester was slightly injured in the neck.
In Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, there have been several demonstrations against Netanyahu.
The statements accompany the corruption process against the head of government.
Last week, Netanyahu was also criticized for handling the coronavirus crisis.
Among other things, he is provided with quick reliefs and a lack of preparation for a second Corona wave.
The Corona crisis has hardened the economy of the country.
Lastly, the unemployment rate was more than 20 percent.
The number of new coronavirus infections in Israel last rose to an ever-new record.
Ahlen accident (NRW) - Transporter forces on car - nine injured - Ruhr area - Bild.de
Ahlen - An incident on Saturday afternoon on the B58 at Ahlen claimed nine mildly injured.
A driver was driving with her two children (3, 5) towards Beckum.
Police: “Probably she had suddenly braked because she wanted to turn around.”
The driver of a Mercedes transporter who drove behind her must have seen it too late.
He pushed on the back of the car.
In the accident, three passengers were injured in the car and six in the transporter.
Several ambulances took them to a nearby hospital.
North Korea sets off border city after suspected coronavirus
North Korea has so far seen a "bright success" in its own measures to combat the coronavirus.
This is the first time the country has reported a suspected case.
Due to a first official coronavirus suspect in the country, North Korea has completely shut down a large city out of fear of disaster.
Despite the most severe epidemiological defensive measures in the past six months, “the malicious virus could have been dragged into the country,” state media reported.
For the region around the border town of Kaesong, the state of emergency has been imposed.
The Communist leadership called for the highest level of alarm.
If the suspected case is confirmed, it would be the first official case of infection with Sars-CoV-2 in the shot country.
North Korea has so far not registered a single infection and described its defensive measures as a "brightening success".
The information was questioned abroad.
The symptoms of the disease were reportedly identified by a "expulsionist" who illegally crossed the military demarcation line between South and North Korea on July 19.
The person moved to South Korea three years ago and has now returned across the border.
There was no confirmation from South Korea at first for the crossing of the four-kilometre-wide and largely still mined military buffer zones.
The South Korean military, however, said the national news agency Yonhap claimed the possibility of illegal border crossing with North Korea was high.
There have been investigations of some people.
North Korea said on Saturday it called for an emergency meeting of the Labour Party’s political office under the chairmanship of powerful Kim Jong Un over suspicion.
The "dangerous situation in Kaesong could trigger a deadly and destructive disaster".
Kim ordered Friday as a preventive measure “to block Kaesong completely and to isolate every district and region from others,” he said.
The person concerned, as well as all people in Kaesong who had been in contact with them, had been placed under quarantine.
The Central Military Commission of the Party is therefore to investigate the "extraordinary case" and the conduct of the military unit responsible and, if necessary, impose severe penalties.
It is estimated that 300,000 people live in Kaesong.
Tension before Council meeting: City-East and noise protection are still ahead of a big summer break for discussion
"In addition to environmental issues, the members of the committee will also vote on the construction plan for the large project of the city centre development-east," it says rather randomly in the middle of the city press release for the next municipal council meeting on Tuesday, July 28, at 4:30 p.m.
However, the revaluation of the eastern city is controversial until the end.
The majority in favour of this is scarce, and lastly in individual committees, depending on the presence, even rejecting it.
An appeal from the economy (building, real estate, trade and IT), the project developed out of the citizenry and then from the administration and council of the municipality now fails to fail after almost ten years of preparation, criticised project opponents Reinhard Klein, "Reinigung", "Verküssung", "External Parliamentary Opposition", "External Parliamentary Opposition", and "External Parliamentary Opposition".
"Everyone thinks it's better to know," said Klein, who has been a member of the municipal council for a year as the sole representative of the Pforzheim Citizens' List.
In fact, after reading the treaties, he is in this position: "I know what I'm talking about".
The exit of the city is cheaper, the Technical Council is against the statements of the municipality after grants, of which Klein is convinced to renew for 8.5 million euros.
The city will evolve very differently from what is predicted in the city hall and on the side of the economic supporters.
To shape the city by its own strength and not by an investor: this is his plan B. The FDP/FW/UB/LED faction, who also rejects the project, introduced an alternative concept a day after.
In essence, it also provides for the renovation of the Technical Council, the opening of the Schlossberg, the leasing of the ex-Thal for administrative areas and a small-scale downtown remodeling, ideally with local carriers.
Environmental themes play a central role
In addition, environmental themes will play a central role.
The municipal council will, among other things, vote on the noise action plan.
This includes a number of measures to protect the Pforzheim population from health noise burdens caused by road traffic, including many time cuts.
In a press release, the local transport club Germany welcomes the widespread introduction of Tempo 30. However, the political leaders in the city are not innocent of the fact that this has to happen because they have to do so by neglecting the bus traffic at reduced speeds, by taking the car and by having little commitment to wheel traffic.
The municipal council also approves the participation of the city of the Energy and Climate Protection Agency Pforzheim/Enzkreis.
The agenda also includes accession to the Baden-Württemberg Climate Protection Pact, the re-establishment of parental contributions in urban day care facilities and the application for admission to the Federal Smart City Promotion.
Citizens are welcome, but they have to take Corona protection measures.
Tim Zimmermann starts the new season with a lot of delay
With almost half a year’s delay, Tim Zimmermann will start his first season at the ADAC GT Masters on July 31.
Before the league of supersports cars could take on regular operation, the first test rides were held.
For Zimmermann, it was about getting to know his Lamborghini Huracan GT3 more closely.
The Corona crisis has for a long time prevented Tim Zimmermann from launching his first service ride in the new Lamborghini Huracan from Grasser Racing.
Under special hygiene conditions, this was now possible.
The 23-year-old Langenargener turned his first round on the Lausitzring and was able to get used to his GT3 car premiere.
“There are already a few things that are different from the Porsche of the pre-season,” Zimmermann says.
"With the ABS, for example, you have to go into the curves differently.
But it really did have a lot of fun."
Zimmermann also had fun with Steijn Schothorst, with whom he will share his orange sports car in the GT Masters.
Despite his only 25 years of experience in GT sport, the Dutchman has been able to help his new teammate in many ways.
“I’m not a beginner in motorsport, but every new series also brings new challenges,” Zimmermann says.
"Steijn and I understand each other blending and we have made tremendous progress on the Lausitzring as well, from session to session."
That’s where the GT Masters will start their first race at the Lausitzring.
As of July 31, the 33 supersport cars will race through the Lausitz.
Zimmermann, who is one of 15 newcomers in the series, knows the route.
In 2015, he was the last guest in the motorcycle.
"It worked fast and I had to get used to the track a little bit," says Zimmermann, who starts for the Friedrichshafen racing community Graf Zeppelin.
"The lausitzring has many fast passages that you need to optimally meet in order to be fast".
How fast Zimmermann really is then, it turns out in two weeks.
"Of course, the teams are playing poker at the tests a bit," he says.
"Finally, we are very satisfied and look forward to the first weekend at the Lausitzring."
The race in Brandenburg will be the start of a tightly pressed calendar.
There will be seven races by the beginning of November.
The momentary stand is that no spectators will be allowed - but there is a prominent guest.
In mid-August at the Nürburgring, former Formula 1 pilot Niko Hülkenberg will take on the GT steering wheel.
British Transport Minister of Quarantine Decision Caught Cold
The British government’s decision to quarantine Spain’s urls for two weeks after their return has caught the country’s transport minister cold, according to press reports.
Grant Shapps is currently on vacation in Spain, while his colleagues at home decided on Saturday.
Due to the ever-increasing number of coronaviruses in Spain, the cabinet in London removed the country from the list of countries from which it is possible to enter without quarantine charges.
The new regulation will apply from Sunday, so Shapps will also have to go back to quarantine after his return.
In Austria, the government has also imposed quarantine measures for returnees.
But the scheme applies to those who are only on holiday on the day of departure, only from Saturday, August 1st, and was not introduced overnight.
Spain, by the way, is considered one of the "safe countries" in Austria so far, for which no quarantine is required in Austria.
"Many ministers may have known in advance that there is a possibility that a quarantine will be imposed on vacationers in Spain," Labour MP Diane Abbot said.
"But apparently no one has made the effort to tell Grant Shapps".
Almost a month after the end of the coronavirus outbreak in Spain and the expiry of strict exit barriers, the number of infections in the country is rising again.
Virologists mainly make nightlife responsible for the new spread.
Spain is one of the most favorite holiday countries in the UK.
From unnecessary travel to the Spanish mainland, the British government advises that the Canary Islands and Balearic Islands, which are particularly popular with British holidaymakers, are exempt from this.
To date, more than 272,000 infections with the novel coronavirus and more than 28,000 deaths have been recorded in Spain.
Russia: Day of the Navy: Putin Announces Hypersonic Weapons for Warships
Russian President Vladimir Putin announced on the day of the navy in his country the equipment of warships with the most modern hypersonic weapons.
With these weapons unprecedented in the world, Russia’s naval capabilities would be expanded, Putin said on Sunday at the central naval parade in St. Petersburg.
The Ministry of Defence also informed Interfax about the successful tests of the hypersonic rocket Zircon built for the Navy.
The hypersound guns have a multiple of the sound speed of around 343 meters per second.
They are considered weapons of the future.
Underwater Tropedeo is being built
It will also be built on the nuclear-powered submarine torpedo Poseidon, it was said.
The planned sea drone is planned to destroy coastal targets.
The president, who himself was riding a military boat, said that only this year 40 new ships would be put into service by the individual fleet associations of the world’s largest country.
Russia has a coastal area as large as no other country in the world.
For 300 years, the navy has been reliably protecting Russia, Putin said on the day celebrated by sailors nationwide.
Also in many other Russian coastal locations, the navy begins the day of the navy with parades.
In Syria, where Russia is fighting alongside power-holder Bashar al-Assad, the military demonstrated strength at a gun show in the Mediterranean port of Tartus.
There was also ammunition fired.
In a video released by the Ministry of Defence, not only warships, including a submarine, but also helicopters and fighter jets were shown.
Hurricane "Hanna" reaches Texas: Help for Corona Difficulty
Washington - The first hurricane of this season across the Atlantic has landed in Texas.
Life-threatening floods, strong winds and heavy rains now threatened parts of the US state, the National Hurricane Center of the US Climate Agency (NOAA) said on Sunday night.
Governor Greg Abbott called for the emergency for many districts.
The coronavirus pandemic in Texas has made it harder for helpers to work, Abbott said.
Evacuees are called for caution
"Every hurricane is a huge challenge," Abbott said, according to the Houston Chronicle newspaper.
In view of the storm in Texas, he added: "This challenge is complicated and will be aggravated given that it runs through an area that is the most affected by Covid-19 in the state."
According to the Johns Hopkins University, about 5,000 people have died in Texas alone as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.
Abbott called for caution to people who had to leave their homes.
They should not miss the practices "we've become accustomed to", such as wearing masks, the governor told CBS.
It is important that everyone keeps their distance.
Therefore, hotel rooms have also been provided in some places.
In addition, they should be tested for Corona in emergency accommodations.
Damage was initially reported only from the coastal town of Port Mansfield.
Storm Warning Retrieved
With wind speeds of up to 150 kilometers per hour, "Hanna" was reportedly landing on the island of Padre Island right off the coast of Texas.
The Tropical Storm had previously been elevated to the lowest level hurricane.
For the coastal section from Port Mansfield to Sargent, a storm flood warning was initially issued and later resumed.
Authorities expected a weakening, as Hanna moved further into the country’s interior and headed for northeastern Mexico.
"Douglas" moves to Hawaii
In the Pacific, Hurricane Douglas was on its way to Hawaii on Sunday night at wind speeds of about 150 kilometers per hour.
The hurricane center, however, expected it to further weaken.
It is predicted to be near Hawaii's largest islands on Sunday (local time) - then as a storm just below the hurricane threshold.
Over the Atlantic this year, NOAA expected an above-average active hurricane season, according to a May forecast.
From June to the end of November, up to ten hurricanes could be expected, including up to six very strong storms, the authorities had said.
On average, there are six hurricanes per year across the Atlantic, three of which develop into storms of great magnitude.
Given the available climate data and the higher water temperature in the Atlantic and Caribbean, the likelihood of a normal season is only 30 percent, compared to an under-average even just 10 percent, it said at the time.
U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted that his government was closely monitoring the storms and in contact with the affected states.
Four Gates Announced: Video Assistant "punished" Sassuolo
Sassuolo's Filip Djuric has been denied two goals
Naples - Four goals scored, four goals scored: Sassuolo Calcio experienced a raven-black evening at 0:2 (0:1) at SSC Naples in the Italian Football League Serie A - and was really angry at the referee's video assistant.
"A festival not given gates for Sassuolo.
The VAR has never gone so hard against a team," commented the "Corriere dello Sport".
Host Naples had led through a goal of outside defender Elseid Hisaj in the 8th minute, in the 32nd minute Filip Djuric first cheered the match.
The Video Assistant Referee (VAR) withdrew the hit due to an off-the-shelf position.
Five minutes later, Djuric shot the ball again into the net - the VAR hit again.
The goalkeepers Francesco Caputo (50th) and Domenico Berardi (61st) also took back the referee's team on notice of the VAR.
In the aftermath, Allan made the 2-0 final for Naples and the bitter evening perfect for Sassuolo.
"The VAR is worse for Sassuolo than a radar trap on the road and punishes Sassuolo like no other team.
The new technology sets records," writes the Gazzetta dello Sport.
FC Bayern Munich: Pavard injured
Munich (dpa) - The start to the hot preparations for the Champions League began with a rebound for double winner FC Bayern.
After a short break and a few days of training, Hansi Flick, who recovered "somewhat well" from his first team training, must consider how he can rebuild his successful defense after the injury of World Champion Benjamin Pavard.
The Frenchman, who is behind captain Manuel Neuer and midfielder Joshua Kimmich, suffered a ribbon injury to the left foot root and threatens to be missing in decisive royal-class duels.
In Munich’s Schmuddelwetter, the defender broke a training game and was driven off the pitch with a golf card.
How long the unrestricted tribal player must pause in the fight for the title is open.
A bet in the eighth-final rematch against FC Chelsea on August 8 is unlikely to be possible, and the 24-year-old can hope for the final tournament starting in Lisbon on August 12.
The Bayern will not be able to stop the mishap from training on Sunday.
Flick named in his personal triple formula the three attributes he wants to see from his stars on the way to Portugal’s capital.
Quality, intensity and concentration are to be shown by his winning title collectors in the ideal 28 days until the Kings Class final on August 23.
"We have mastered the duty tasks with championship and cup simply excellently.
Now it’s time to create the special one,” Flick said.
Until the Munichers can deal concretely with the final tournament and before a training camp in the Algarve, however, for the first time there is an eighth-final obligation against FC Chelsea.
After the 3–0 draw ahead of the Corona break, the Londoners in the home arena should not again become Bavaria’s nightmare, as in the lost “final dahoam” in 2012.
“We have to go through the door first.
We want to win, create good conditions and build trust with a good game,” Flick said.
A test to vote against Olympique Marseille will be held on Friday.
With a long speech, Flick had sworn his stars, who had 13 days of vacation after the Double, to a one-time August.
He welcomed 31 players at Sábener Straße, including the new players for noble shopping Leroy Sané, who first met all his new colleagues on the pitch after his shift from Manchester City.
"Leroy fits well like all the new ones," Flick reported.
But instead of talking about the new season, when Sané & Co. is no longer allowed to just train, Flick preferred to talk about the current title project of the German series champion.
After days of single and small group training, he is now trained in team strength for the Londoners, who are unlike the Flick ensemble in the rhythm of the game.
After that, the Munichers could face a quarter-final against FC Barcelona and Lionel Messi, in the semi-finals are possible opponents Real Madrid, Manchester City or Juventus Turin.
A way to the final in Lisbon "is not so easy," the head coach stressed, who can rely on the services of his new assistant Miroslav Klose in training from Tuesday.
The World Cup record shooter Klose and Flick know so many common tournament preparations, which is especially important in the 0-to-100 match.
With his current team, working is “a pleasure,” Flick praised.
The "focus on winning" is an impressive essence of his team.
In the tournament with nine teams, it was also an ambitious one on Sunday.
All of the supporters were there, including the emigrant Thiago and defender David Alaba, whose stay beyond the Royals season is not secured.
Formula 1 Needs a Special Rule to Cut Her World Champion
Since it is not possible to drive on the required number of continents, the FIA must improvise in order to award the World Cup title.
All American races were cancelled.
Race calendar is becoming more and more concrete
The race calendar of the current Formula 1 season continues to take shape.
Three more races were added to the ten Grand Prix confirmed so far during the week.
In October it will be held at the Nürburgring in Germany and in the Portuguese Portimão.
On November 1, Lewis Hamilton and Co. will compete on the Italian tradition runway in Imola for World Cup points.
Thus, the 2020 racing calendar includes 13 runs according to the current stand.
“We are delighted that we continue to make great progress in completing our 2020 season plans,” said Formula 1 boss Chase Carey.
In total, 15 to 18 races in the royal class of motorsport will be completed in this exceptional season.
Formula 1 is set to close its season in Asia.
The final race calendar will be fixed and published in the coming weeks.
Prior to the already officially contested races in Bahrain and Abu Dhabi in December, media reports said there could still be appearances in Vietnam and Malaysia at the end of November.
Rules require races on three continents
The Formula 1 regulations require races on at least three continents to be awarded the World Championship.
Although, as is currently planned, only two continents will be driven, there is supposed to be a world champion.
Using a special rule, the FIA wants to award the titles, citing “exceptional circumstances” due to the coronavirus pandemic.
The traditional start of the season in Australia in March had to be cancelled in the short term due to the oncoming coronavirus crisis.
A return to the continent this year is not an issue.
In addition, Formula 1 will not be hosted in America this year.
Resignation is Criticized in Brazil
Due to the strained coronavirus situation, the races will not take place in Canada, the United States, Mexico and Brazil.
"We are looking forward to being with them again next season," Carey said.
The cancellation of the American race was especially critical in Brazil: “The cancellation did not come as a surprise to us, but we cannot accept the reasons for it,” said Tamas Rohonyi, promoter of the Grand Prix in São Paulo.
Thus, the number of infections in the São Paulo area is significantly lower than in other regions of Brazil.
The concerns of some teams not wanting to drive in Brazil would also not justify a resignation.
Be prepared for the required safety measures.
Greta Thunberg: Bad look at Donald Trump around the world
Greta Thunberg spoke about her meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump.
Greta Thunberg was a guest on Stephen Colbert’s famous Latenight show via video circuits and told in an interview what she had in mind when meeting Donald Trump.
Climate Quiz Greta Thunberg was a guest on a popular U.S. Latenight show via video circuits.
She spoke, among other things, of her struggle against the powerful of the world.
She also spoke about her famous "bad look" at her meeting with Donald Trump.
New York City – Over the past two years, climate activist Greta Thunberg has been paying attention to her tireless efforts for the “Fridays For Future” movement.
Now she spoke in a well-known Latenight show about her plans for the future as well as her meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump at the UN climate summit last year.
Latenight moderator Stephen Colbert welcomed the 17-year-old Thunberg on your show on Tuesday and conducted a longer interview with the Swedish woman.
She spoke not only about her fight against climate change, but also about her conflict with the world’s powerful.
"There are some things that surprised me," she said.
“How far people go to direct the focus away from the climate crisis,” she said.
“Everything from organized hate campaigns to threats just because a group of children are walking down the street,” she said.
Heads of state and leading politicians who are mocking them on social media, or even trying to silence them, find it "deceitful" as they show them the reactions, "because they have no other answer."
It was particularly interesting at the end of the interview when Greta Thunberg was addressed to a well-known scene in which she cast a bitter look back at US President Trump.
At the 2019 UN climate summit in New York, for which the actress sailed across the Atlantic, her expressive gaze was captured by the cameras and has since been seen by countless people on the internet.
The short clip created a GIF, an animated image that eventually became one of the most commonly used images for Trump opponents.
But what did the 17-year-old think of the U.S. president at the moment?
To Stephen Colbert’s relatively open question, she answered only briefly and dryly: “To be honest, I don’t think that needs any further explanation.”
With the shocking answer, the experienced satirist Colbert probably had not anticipated and disappeared briefly laughing out of the picture.
With her "How dare you?" speech on the principles of climate protection, she remembered many at the climate conference.
Ex-Dortmunder Real Estate with Triple Pack for Lazio Rome
Ciro Immobile is now in the race for Europe’s Golden Shoe with Bavaria’s Robert Lewandowski.
The former Dortmund Ciro Immobile has the best chance of becoming a goalkeeper king in the Italian football championship.
The former BVB professional assisted Lazio Rom’s 5:1 (1:1) victory against Hellas Verona in three matches, including two transformed eleven metres in the succession times of both halves.
With this, the 30-year-old from the table quarter has now 34 season goals on his account before the end of two games - just as much as Robert Lewandowski of FC Bayern Munich achieved in the last Bundesliga season.
In Italy, Cristiano Ronaldo is followed by 30 goals so far, the Portuguese superstar met with the top rider in the evening at Sampdoria Genoa.
Fleetwood Mac co-founder Peter Green has died
His life was like a horseback riding: after a rapid ascent with Fleetwood Mac it went steeply up and then slowly up again.
Bluesrock guitarist Peter Green has died at the age of 73.
Genius guitarist, drug junkie, cult fan: The band's co-founder Fleetwood Mac, Peter Green, is dead.
He died peacefully in his sleep at the age of 73, family members said in an official statement on Saturday that another statement would be announced for the next few days.
Top musicians like Peter Frampton honored Green as one of the best blues and rock guitarists.
Mick Fleetwood spoke in an emotional response of a "monumental loss" for all former and current members of the band Fleetwood Mac.
The drummer Fleetwood and guitarist Green had founded the legendary band in London in 1967, until today, his dream instrumental hit "Albatross" is unforgettable.
The musician's life ("The End Of The Game", "In The Skies") equalled an aerial ride.
With Fleetwood Mac, Green experienced a rapid rise - the band celebrated their greatest successes but then without him.
It was said to have been disputed, among other things, because Green wanted to donate all of the group’s profits for charitable purposes.
He began to appear in wide garments and with great crucifixion.
Mental problems are also expected to play a role.
Already three years after its founding, Green left the band in 1970.
There was a social downturn.
The bluesrock guitarist suffered from drug abuse and schizophrenia, as biographers reported.
For a long time, Green was treated in psychiatry.
During most of the 1970s, the musician disappeared from the surface.
He is said to have lived temporarily on the street, worked as a cemetery gardener and spent a while in an Israeli kibbutz.
Green was born in 1946 as the son of a Jewish working family in the London district of Bethnal Green.
In his early years, he became passionate about US blues musicians such as B.B. King and Muddy Waters.
At the age of eleven, he learned the first guitar grips.
At the age of 15, the teenager began playing professional guitar and five years later had the chance to be a lead guitarist for the instrumental band Peter B's Looners on stage.
Shortly thereafter, he was hired as a replacement for his Idol Eric Clapton with the Bluesbreakers.
In the middle of the blues boom, Green founded Fleetwood Mac in the summer of 1967 along with his bluesbreakers colleagues Mick Fleetwood and John McVie.
The song "Albatross", composed by Green, awarded the band the first number one hit in the winter of 1968/69 and catapulted it to the top of the British music scene.
But the rapid rise soon showed its shadow sides: Green did not exacerbate the media outlet, his experiments with the drug LSD became increasingly extreme.
The life between music and addiction, he later commented in an interview: “The worst thing that has happened to me in my life is the drugs – the best thing was to land a number one hit.”
By the end of the decade, Green was surprisingly successful with an album inspired by religious themes.
Meanwhile, Fleetwood Mac swims in a new formation on a success wave without it.
Her 1977 album "Rumuurs" sold more than 40 million times worldwide.
Despite several small solo hits, Green did not make a major comeback until he re-started in 1996 with a group of friends.
The British Daily Telegraph spoke of a rock star returning to Earth at the time.
Green released several albums with the Peter Green Splinter Group until the band disbanded in 2004.
For music experts, he was a blues legend in his lifetime – and with his gentle sound one of the most influential guitarists of the past decades.
