In Kineshma and district, two men committed suicide
Previously, one of the men had committed suicide.
On October 30, about 1-00, in the village of Lugovoe, at the place of his residence, a man born in 1947 committed suicide by hanging.
It is known that he had previously committed suicide attempts.
What prompted a man to take such a step is unknown.
On October 31, at 11-50, at the place of residence, he died by hanging a 41-year-old man, a resident of Kineshma.
No signs of a violent death have been detected, the press service of the Ministry of Interior "Kineshemsky".
Do you have a black box in your car?
While American road designers are trying to find money to repair a broken road system, many begin to see the solution in a small black box neatly arranged on your car’s dashboard.
These devices, which track every mile driven by a motorist and transmit this information to officials, are at the center of a controversial attempt to modernize America’s outdated highway financing system undertaken by the planning authorities of Washington and the state.
Usually, the boring highway planning arena has unexpectedly spawned intense debates and colorful alliances.
Libertarians have joined environmental groups in lobbying to give the government the right to use small boxes to track the number of miles you drive and possibly even where you drive them—and then use that information in the compilation of tax bills.
The tea-drinking movement in shock.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also deeply concerned and raises a number of questions about privacy.
And while Congress cannot yet agree on whether to continue or not, several states are not going to wait.
They’re thinking about how you can switch over the next decade to a system where drivers pay for every mile of road they drive.
Thousands of motorists have already tested these black boxes, some of which have a satellite tracking function.
This is really necessary for our country.
“That’s not the question we might have a choice about,” said Hassan Ihrata, executive director of the Southern California Government Association, which is preparing plans to start tracking the state’s mileage traveled by each California motorist by 2025.
There will be a change in how we pay these taxes.
The technology already exists for this.
The need for this is compounded by the lack of funds from the Government Fund for the construction of highways, funded by taxes that Americans pay on gasoline stations.
Americans don’t buy as much gasoline as they used to.
Cars drive more than a mile per gallon.
The federal tax itself, 18.4 cents per gallon, has not been raised for 20 years.
Politicians do not want to raise taxes by even one cent at high gasoline prices.
“It’s simply impossible to keep the gasoline tax,” said Lee Mannich, a transport policy expert at the University of Minnesota.
In his state, 500 tracking devices were recently installed on cars to test the error payment system.
“It will be the best alternative in the long run,” he said.
Boredom calls this a misleading user charge.
It is not surprising that this idea attracts urban liberals, as with the help of taxes it will be possible to change the nature of travel to reduce road congestion and greenhouse gas emissions, for example.
California’s planning authorities are monitoring this system as they develop strategies to achieve the targets set by the state’s ambitious global warming laws.
However, House Speaker Bill Schuster (Republican, Pennsylvania), chairman of the House Transportation Committee, said he also sees the system as the most viable long-term alternative.
Adherents of the free market in the “Reason” fund are also delighted that they will make drivers pay for every mile.
“It’s not just a tax that will go into a black hole,” said Adrian Moore, vice president of political affairs at Reason.
People pay directly for what they get.
The move is also backed by two former U.S. transport ministers who in 2011 called on Congress to move toward mispayment.
The U.S. Senate last year approved a $90 million pilot project that would involve about 10,000 cars.
However, House leaders rejected the proposal because of fears of rural lawmakers representing voters who often have to travel many miles in everyday life to get to work or to the city.
Several states and cities, however, are on their own.
The greatest enthusiasm is shown in the state of Oregon, where 5,000 drivers are attracted to participate in the largest experiment in the country.
These drivers will soon pay the state for mileage instead of a gasoline tax.
In Nevada, the pilot project has already been completed.
It is being considered in New York.
Illinois will test it on a limited basis with the participation of trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes the transportation departments of 17 states on the east coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is exploring how they can implement these changes.
This concept has not been universally accepted.
In Nevada, where about 50 volunteer cars were recently equipped with these devices, drivers were concerned that the government could track every step of their way.
“The concern about the big brother and things like that is a big problem,” said Alauddin Khan, head of strategy and efficiency management at the Nevada Department of Transportation.
It wasn’t what people wanted.
When the tests were in full swing, the U.S. Civil Liberties Union office in Nevada warned on its website: “It will be quite easy to turn these devices into full-scale tracking devices.”
There is no need to create a huge, bulky technological infrastructure that will inevitably expand to store records of the daily movements of individual citizens.
Nevada is one of the few states that are conducting difficult searches for cheap technology that would allow state authorities to take into account the mileage traveled by car, but without information about location and time.
If you can do that, Khan said, society will feel more relaxed.
The search for this technology led some state agencies to a small young company in California called True Mileage.
Initially, this company was not involved in assisting in the collection of state taxes.
It sought to enter the emerging market of car insurance, in which drivers pay on a mileage basis.
But the devices it tests attract road designers because they don’t use GPS and provide a limited amount of information that is downloaded periodically using a modem.
“People will be more likely to do this if you don’t track their speed and track their location,” said Ryan Morrison, CEO of True Mileage.
There have been several major errors in some of these state pilot programs.
There are far less expensive and less compulsive ways to do this.
In Oregon, designers are experimenting with providing drivers with different options.
They can choose a device with or without GPS.
Or they can completely abandon the device, deciding instead to pay a fixed fee based on the average number of miles that all residents of the state travel.
In other places, they hope to sell the idea to a cautious public, forcing devices to do more, not less.
In New York, transportation officials are keen to develop a taxation device that will also accept parking meter payments, provide “pay as you drive” insurance, and collect real-time speed data pools from other drivers that drivers could use to avoid traffic jams.
“Automobilists will be attracted to the benefits that they will be offered,” – says the document of urban design.
Some transport system designers, however, are wondering whether all talk of mispayment is simply a huge distraction.
In the San Francisco Bay Area City Transportation Commission, officials say Congress could very easily overcome the bankruptcy of the Highway Construction Trust Fund by raising gasoline taxes.
An additional one-time or annual tax could be levied on hybrid drivers and others whose vehicles do not use a lot of gasoline to pay their fair share.
“There’s no need for radical surgical intervention when all you have to do is take aspirin,” said Randy Rentshler, director of the Commission on Legislation and Public Relations.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of drivers will worry about their privacy and a host of other things.
EU prepares measures to support Ukraine in case of economic pressure from Russia
The European Union has a standby plan to provide Ukraine with gas, as well as to reach an agreement with the IMF on emergency credit, if Russia takes any action in response to the possible signing of the EU-Ukraine Association Treaty at the Vilnius Summit.
The IMF is negotiating a stand-by loan, and another EU official, who is directly involved in the negotiations, added that their goal is to conclude an agreement in the near future.
In addition to the potential loan from the IMF, Ukraine can receive 610 million euros from the European Union itself.
Analysts interviewed by Reuters doubt that Ukraine and the IMF are able to overcome long-standing disagreements about the terms of funding.
He does not believe in the possibility of reforms needed to get help, and the international rating agency S&P, which on Friday lowered Ukraine's sovereign rating by one step - to "B-" with "B".
However, EU representatives say that the IMF can show flexibility in terms of lending, taking into account the circumstances of Ukraine.
In addition to the country’s financial support plan, the EU has a reserve option to provide Ukraine with gas, most of which now comes from Russia.
Perhaps it will be gas from Nord Stream or vice versa from Slovakia.
The latter, according to officials, is the most possible and acceptable way in case Russia “isolates” Ukraine.
Analysts believe that this method of reversing deliveries to Ukraine can only be used for a few weeks, and will likely lead to a decrease in deliveries to other regions.
"Negotiations are being held between the EU countries and Ukrainians on how to create favorable conditions so that Ukraine can import gas from other sources, not from Russia, or from the same source, but on other routes," the source added.
Russia out of the fight for pollution of cities by cars
Attempts to solve the transport problems of large cities have been observed in most of the world’s megacities since the second half of the twentieth century.
As a rule, it was either about their redevelopment and expansion of highways, or about attempts to reduce the demand for road trips, the number of cars and the time of their use.
A well-known example is Singapore, where a strict quota is introduced for the increase in the number of private cars, and the right to purchase them is purchased at auctions.
Its price can be two to three times the price of the car itself.
European cities, including London, have introduced a fee to enter the city centre.
In Germany, for example, in Hamburg and Stuttgart, so-called green zones are introduced, which only allow entry to cars with a certain eco-class that also use high-quality fuel (including biofuels or electric cars).
The Beijing Environmental Protection Agency, for example, approved in 2012 a “five-year clean air plan” totaling around 250 billion yuan (about $40 billion).
According to Lee Kunsheng, director of the Transport Pollution Control Department of the Beijing Municipal Environmental Protection Bureau, the main goal of the five-year one is to reduce the leading air pollutants by 20-35% by 2017, increasing the number of private cars used to the level of not more than 6 million (now not more than 5.2 million), and increasing the number of private cars used to the level of 6 million.
According to the agency, motor vehicles in Beijing are now responsible for 22.5% of total air pollution.
Among the main measures of the program is the restriction of the use of road transport, as well as the introduction of additional taxes for car owners.
Among other things, the urban measures of the "green five-year" include the accelerated compared with the rest of the country the transition to the euro standards of fuel, the introduction of local eco-standards and the marking of cars and fuel, the restriction on the entry of cars into the central part of the city, the prohibition on the use of obsolete vehicles (in addition to the
Among the car innovations of Beijing also includes a ban for all private cars on the movement within the fifth transport ring (only in the capital of China there are six of them) one day a week (relevant information is contained in the registration plate of the vehicle), as well as the issuance of registration plates for cars, on the basis of the lottery (
According to the current state program "Environment Protection for 2012-2020", the number of cities with high and very high air pollution should be reduced to 128 (in 2012 there were 138).
According to the Ministry of Nature, in 2011, “transient sources” accounted for 41% of all emissions of pollutants into the atmosphere of cities.
In Moscow, for example, emissions from cars are ten times higher than industrial, and in St. Petersburg - nine times.
In Russia, they are only beginning to think about the possibilities of restrictive regulation of cars on the streets of cities.
Mikhail Blinkin, Director of the Institute of Transport Economics and Transport Policy of the HSE, believes that administrative and fiscal measures aimed at suppressing demand for road trips are a matter of course unpopular, they can be adopted by society only if they are fully universal.
In the case of Moscow, there is a unique problem associated with the structure of its fleet, where there are two clusters of weakly sensitive to any regulatory influences - office and personal cars, as well as cars of "privileged" users, the total number of which is not less than 200,000 cars.
Recently, urbanists from the ECOM center in St. Petersburg prepared a study, which analyzes the balance of urban areas between residential development, the area of roads and the number of motor vehicles.
The main findings of the researchers: the city center is provided with roads twice as much as required, and most motorists living in the center do not use cars every day, leaving them for a long time in parking lots or just on the streets.
As a result, it is proposed not to build parking spaces, but car storage spaces, not to expand, but to reduce the driveway (in order to make the streets more pedestrian-friendly), as well as to limit the use and placement of personal transport within the boundaries of the city of the area of the historical center’s security zone (common area of about 32 square meters).
Penalties for unauthorized street trade in Vologda will increase several times
According to the city authorities, increasing the amount of fines will help to bring order in Vologda and free the streets from natural tents and trays.
Most street vendors do not pay taxes, the products they sell often do not pass appropriate sanitary controls.
This means that the health of the wetlands is at risk.
Thus, the lower limit of the fine for citizens for unauthorized trade from November will increase by six times - from 500 rubles to 3000 rubles, reports the press service of the Vologda Administration.
Goldman Sachs warns of risks to Russian economy
Goldman Sachs has warned of rising risks to Russia’s main driver of fragile economic growth – consumption.
This is primarily a crisis of non-payments on unsecured consumer loans and massive reductions in workers.
Our main concern now is not that growth has slowed, but rather, the structure of that growth.
Recently, it is completely driven by consumption, which almost does not slow the turnover," said Goldman Sachs chief economist for Russia Clemens Grafe, presenting the quarterly report of the investment bank on the Russian economy.
Now nominal wage growth in Russia is about 10%.
With inflation at 6%, it will be able to meet future consumer demand at about the current level, Goldman Sachs expects.
But the profitability of Russian companies is declining, so they are likely to optimise personnel costs.
Today, we see a significant increase in the share of wages in GDP: if wages increase by 10%, then GDP - only by 2%, - Mr Grafe explained.
The companies are facing a decline in profitability.
If it does not grow, it can lead to redundancies and rising unemployment.
The Russian business cannot raise salaries, commented the chief economist of Barclays Capital on Russia and the CIS Vladimir Pantyuschyn.
Unemployment near historical lows, competition for workers is high.
In order to lure employees out or retain current ones, employers have to raise salaries.
Consumption in Russia is undergoing a very rapid growth in borrowing.
According to Mr. Graf, because of the extremely high interest rates on consumer loans, this type of lending does not have a multiplier effect on the economy of the country.
“We haven’t seen any benefits for the economy from the growth of consumer lending, money doesn’t spread across the economy, but returns to the same banks in the form of interest payments,” the economist said.
But the problem is different - Goldman Sachs expects a rise in overdue unsecured loans.
They are mostly taken by poor people, who have nothing to provide.
Interest rates on such loans are high.
As a result, they are not returned more often,” said Graphe.
Therefore, the second threat to the growth of the economy in Russia is a possible crisis of default on unsecured loans.
Vasily Solodkov, Director of the Banking Institute of the HSE, already sees signs of an impending banking crisis.
Small credit institutions, having no access to cheap resources, such as state banks, were forced to raise public funds at high interest rates.
In response, the state banks went on the path of war and began to lower the loan rates, - continues the economist.
Small credit institutions cannot issue loans at the same interest rate, otherwise they will have a negative interest margin.
If the state banks do not give up dumping, Russia is in danger of a full-fledged banking crisis, believes Vasily Solodkov.
The deprivation of licenses of a number of banks in recent weeks the economist considers a forerunner of a massive collapse.
"The state banks themselves will not cope with this situation: the deposit insurance system was originally not designed for a systemic crisis," the head of the institute warns.
But the growth of consumption will slow without a crisis of non-payments, the investment bank believes, - due to the refusal to index the salaries of civil servants and military, laid down in the current version of the draft budget.
Part of the impact on consumption will be mitigated by freezing tariffs on natural monopolies (and, as a result, reducing inflation).
But only partially: if investments do not grow (and there are no prerequisites for this yet - see the guide), consumption growth will still slow down, Goldman Sachs is confident.
Vladimir Pantyushyn of Barclays Capital does not yet see the prerequisites for the implementation of pessimistic scenarios.
“The main risk is the continued fall in oil prices,” he says.
According to him, Russia’s economy will begin to shrink at a price of oil below $90/barr.
Goldman Sachs also noted that the central bank is not yet in a position to lower interest rates in the economy.
There is a paradoxical picture: inflation has fallen, and banks have started raising rates.
This could mean that they didn’t believe the central bank, which announced the transition to targeting inflation,” said Clemens Graphe.
The interest rate policy of the Central Bank does not affect market rates, it only affects interbank lending rates.
“For the Central Bank, this is the collapse of all hopes,” said Clemens Graphe.
The money received at the auctions of the Central Bank, banks use not to lend the economy, but to manage their liquidity
As soon as the rate drops, the exchange rate changes immediately, which means that the funds are trying to go on speculation against the ruble.
“Sooner or later the Central Bank will understand that this strategy is not working,” Graphe said, reminding that the state plans to release the ruble into “free flow” by the end of 2015.
But it will either have to do it earlier, or raise the central bank’s key rate (5.5%), he believes.
According to him, the rate of the ruble is now artificially exceeded by 10%.
There is only one way to lose weight, says the expert.
But if the Central Bank plunges in the financiers at least a shadow of doubt that the liquidation of the currency corridor is not part of the policy of weakening the ruble, it can bring down the ruble much stronger.
In Chelyabinsk held the 2nd Congress of Peoples of the Southern Urals.
The Forum is dedicated to the Day of People’s Unity, the 400th anniversary of the restoration of Russian statehood and the 20th anniversary of the adoption of the Russian Constitution.
Delegations from all cities and districts of the region, representatives of national and cultural associations, religious confessions, legislative and executive bodies participated in the work of the congress - a total of about 350 people.
The course of the forum is aimed at strengthening interethnic harmony.
We can set an example here not only for other regions, but also for other countries.
We have no disagreements or disagreements.
We live in complete mutual understanding,” said Teofan, Metropolitan of Chelyabinsk and Zlatoustovsky.
During the meeting, a number of issues were considered, including the education of patriotism, cultural cooperation.
At the end of the session, a resolution was adopted.
The unofficial part of the forum continued at the opera and ballet theatre.
The exhibition of national and cultural associations of the Chelyabinsk region was opened here.
Snowden ready to “cooperate” with Germany on U.S. intelligence issue
Edward Snowden, a U.S. intelligence whistleblower, said he was ready to go to Berlin to testify to the German parliament if the U.S. National Security Agency and its director, Keith Alexander, could not answer questions about their activities.
German MP Hans-Christian Ströbele met with Mr Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he was granted asylum to discuss his testimony in Germany.
A letter from Mr Snowden, which the deputy presented to the media in Berlin on Friday, said: "Although the result of my efforts was clearly positive, my government continues to treat disagreement as treason and seeks to criminalize political statements with criminal charges that do not give anything."
But telling the truth is not a crime.
In the letter, Mr. Snowden said he believed that the support of the international community could persuade the US government to abandon criminal charges against him.
The charges brought by the U.S. Department of Justice include espionage and theft of state property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, Germany’s interior minister, told Zeit Online: “If Mr. Snowden is willing to talk to German officials, we will find ways to make this possible.”
Relations between the United States and Germany became tense after allegations that the NSA was listening to Chancellor Angela Merkel’s phone.
Thomas Opperman, a deputy who heads a parliamentary group that oversees intelligence, said if there is an opportunity to listen to Mr Snowden as a witness, “without endangering him or completely destroying relations with the United States,” it should be used.
Mr. Str<0xC3><0xB8>bele, a member of parliament from the Green Party of Germany, posted his photo with Mr. Snowden on Twitter.
During his visit to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr. Str<0xC3><0xB8>bele said that, according to the lawyer of the former NSA contractor, Mr. Snowden could not have returned to Russia if he had left.
If Mr Snowden were to testify in Germany, he would need assurances that he would be “safe there,” the deputy said.
Snowden said in his letter that he faced a “hard and constant” campaign of persecution that forced him to leave his home.
However, he said he was inspired by the global response to “his political statements.”
Citizens around the world, as well as high-ranking officials—including in the United States—have found the disclosure of an uncontrolled system of all-out surveillance to be beneficial to society.
The letter proposes to cooperate with the German authorities "when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation will be solved".
Frontier Airlines will charge a fee for hand luggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge passengers up to $100 for carrying hand luggage on board their flight.
Frontier Airlines plans to start charging up to $100 for hand luggage and $2 for coffee or soda, although their announcement on Wednesday said passengers will be able to keep the entire bank.
The new fee for hand luggage extends to bags in the upper luggage compartments, so small bags placed under the seat will remain free.
Frontier said it would charge $25 if the fee was paid in advance, and $100 if travelers would only pay when they landed.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O’Malley said a $100 fee should make passengers pay in advance.
“We don’t want to pay for it,” she said.
The airlines began charging for the first and second bags to be handed in in 2008.
Passengers trying to avoid these charges are loading as much as they can into the hand luggage placed in the upper luggage compartments, which is why these compartments often lack space.
Fees are one way to make passengers carry less on board.
O'Malley said this new tax wasn't really about making money.
The fact is that the most loyal Frontier customers say that finding a place in the top luggage compartments is becoming increasingly difficult.
Passengers who buy tickets on the airline’s website will not have to pay.
This means that one passenger in a queue at the start of the Frontier flight may be able to carry a bag for free, while the next passenger in a queue may pay $100 for the same bag.
O’Malley said the change in procedures on the website and at the Frontier check-in stands was meant to ensure passengers would know about the collection before they get to the boarding gate.
The new Frontier fee for hand luggage will not start to be charged until the summer, although the date has not yet been set.
Passengers often complain about baggage fees and other fees, but airlines love them.
They claim that handling baggage costs money, and passengers who need this service should pay for it.
Many on Wall Street consider the addition of baggage charges a sign that airlines are charging enough money to cover the cost of air travel after several years of losses.
However, most of them did not touch the fees for hand luggage.
Spirit Airlines Inc. introduced the first manual set fee three years ago, and another Allegiant Air discounter later followed suit.
The only other airline with such a fee is the Hungarian Wizz Air, said airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who closely monitors the additional fees.
According to his December 2011 report, the cost of hand luggage brings Spirit $50 million a year.
Sorensen, a former Midwest Airlines top manager, recently flew a Spirit flight, and he was interested in what he would find at the boarding gate when passengers encountered an unusual Spirit baggage charge.
“The landing process was the smoothest I’ve seen in my airline career,” he said.
I was expecting to see the teeth crunch and the appearance of a fight at the exit to the landing.
The plane was full, he said, “and the landing went fast.”
Frontier also follows Spirit for a $2 fee for coffee, tea, soda or juice.
Frontier said that passengers who receive soda or juice can keep the entire can and that the coffee will be provided free of charge.
It will continue to provide water for free.
US Airways briefly tried to charge for drinks in 2008, but gave up seven months after passengers began complaining and no other major airline followed suit.
The Frontier initiative to charge for hand luggage when passengers do not buy tickets directly from the airline is its latest measure to attract customers to its website.
Airlines pay online ticket vendors such as Orbitz, from $10 to $25 for every ticket sold.
This gave all airlines an incentive to encourage passengers to buy tickets directly from them, rather than contacting the online travel agency.
Frontier, however, went beyond everyone in this area.
In September, she began giving twice as many frequent flyer bonus miles to customers who bought tickets through an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, it cut the premium mileage to 25 percent of the travel mileage.
For example, a 1,000-mile trip with Frontier, purchased from an online travel agency, would earn 250 miles.
In addition, passengers can choose a seat in advance only if they buy tickets directly on the Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base in its hometown of Denver, but its business is shrinking and becoming lossy.
Revenue fell by 9 percent, and flight options fell by nearly 13 percent in the first quarter, according to financial results released Wednesday by parent company Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic is trying to fix the finances of Frontier as part of the airline's sale.
NSA blames “internal error” not hackers in stopping the site
The National Security Agency said Friday night that shutting down their site for several hours caused a technical failure, not hackers, as claimed on the network.
“NSA.gov was unavailable for several hours tonight due to an internal error that occurred during the scheduled update,” the intelligence agency said in an official email.
The problem will be solved tonight.
The statement that the interruption was caused by a distributed denial-of-service attack [DDoS] is incorrect.
Earlier this evening, online server monitoring systems reported that the NSA’s website hadn’t worked for at least six hours, and the site was still inaccessible to some users.
Earlier, an NSA spokesman told ABC News that the agency's internal secret network was "not hacked".
No classified information is at risk, the spokesman said.
At least one online group of hacker activists said it was responsible for decommissioning the NSA’s website via a DDoS attack.
DDoS attacks are designed to clutch the target site with traffic until the servers are overloaded and the site goes out of business.
The tactics of hackers are relatively simple, and the attacks are not designed to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
Previously, the super-secret NSA, once nicknamed "No Such Agency", was in recent months in the center of public attention and fierce criticism after a series of revelations about its extensive surveillance programs abroad and within the country - all this is a reaction to the secret files of the NSA.
The growing controversy around the agency has prompted speculation that today’s incident was the result of targeted actions by hackers.
Bombardier’s profit declines with drop in deliveries and aircraft orders
Bombardier, a Canadian aircraft and trains manufacturer, reported a 15 percent reduction in net profit on Thursday due to declining orders and deliveries of aircraft in the third quarter and contract problems in its rail division.
Montreal-based Bombardier has also not released any flight test data for its latest CSeries aircraft and has not provided new information on whether ambitious plans to put the aircraft into commercial operation by next September will be implemented.
After the first flight of an experimental sample of the aircraft, which took place about a month and a half ago, it flew only three more times, which raises questions about whether the testing stage is on schedule.
The results did not justify the forecasts and led to a fall in stocks by more than 8 percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerxen, a National Bank Financial analyst, on Thursday lowered his valuation from “over-medium” to “medium” because of the belief that stock growth is limited in the coming quarter or two.
“Although the decrease in the number of aircraft deliveries was generally predictable, we are certainly disappointed by the profit indicators of the transport department,” Doerksen said in a stock market review.
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for CSeries as the flight test program continues.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more skeptical of the program.
Bombardier hopes the CSeries family of aircraft will allow it to win a place in the lower price segment of the market, which is now dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first experimental sample of the aircraft was presented in March and made its first flight in September after several months of delay.
However, the firm orders for CSeries are not yet too many – 177, as potential buyers are waiting for flight test results to test the company’s claims about fuel efficiency and potential economy of the new liner.
There are currently 403 orders and agreements with 15 customers and operators.
Chief Executive Pierre Bodouan was confident that Bombardier would reach its target of 300 firm orders by the time the first aircraft would be put into commercial operation.
On Thursday, the leaders also assured analysts and media that the program is moving forward as planned.
“The test model of the aircraft did not stay on the ground longer than expected,” Bodowan said during a telephone conference, adding that ground tests and software updates were planned during the aircraft’s downtime.
All manufacturers plan the tests differently.
We decided to take the first flight and take a break for updates, so we did.
This will be the case throughout the flight test program.
The second of the five test samples is expected to fly in the coming weeks and all the rest will soon follow it, the company said.
Still, analysts are skeptical about the statement that the first customer will be able to start operating the CSeries aircraft 12 months after its first flight.
Bombardier said it is evaluating the timeline for commissioning and will provide new information in the next few months.
“This slow pace of flight testing – although apparently in line with Bombardier’s internal schedule – supports our view that commissioning will be postponed to the first quarter of 2015,” Doerxen said.
In the third quarter ended September 30, Bombardier’s net income fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, from $172 million, or 9 cents per share, last year.
Adjusted earnings per share remained the same – 9 cents.
Gross income declined slightly, from $4.2 billion to $4.1 billion.
Analysts expected a profit of 10 cents per share and gross income of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The world’s fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer said it had delivered 45 aircraft for the quarter, down from the previous year’s figure of 57.
The total number of orders fell from 83 to 26 aircraft.
The order portfolio of the aerospace division amounted to $32.9 billion as of September 30, unchanged from December 31.
“In the aerospace field, the results matched our goals, but the small number of orders received and general market conditions became an unpleasant factor,” Boduan said.
Gross revenue in the aerospace sector fell by 13 percent to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world’s largest train manufacturer, said gross revenue in the sector grew by almost 11 percent to $2.1 billion.
The portfolio of orders in the transport division amounted to $32.6 billion as of September 30, which is slightly higher than the figure from December 31.
The revenues of the transport unit were adversely affected by problems with the execution of several large contracts.
The management said that a new development plan will be presented in the fourth quarter.
Shares of Bombardier, which also announced that Google Chief Financial Officer Patrick Pichett will join the board of directors, fell by 8.5 percent to $4.83 in auctions on mid-Thursday.
Brazil’s Embraer SA, the world’s third-largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and closest competitor to Bombardier, reported a 10 percent decline in quarterly revenue on Thursday.
Sony Expects Lower Annual Profits
The Japanese electronics manufacturer, Sony Corporation, having completed the past quarter with a net loss of 19.3 billion yen, or $197 million, has cut its profit forecast for the current fiscal year.
Sony’s July-September 2013 results were more disappointing than expected due to a drop in demand for Japanese-made TVs, video cameras and personal computers.
Sony's TV business, which brought the company its first operating profit in three years of 5.2 billion yen, fell again to 9.3 billion yen of operating loss in the reporting period.
The Japanese consumer electronics market is experiencing difficult times, especially due to the decline in demand for televisions.
And while competitors are striving to find a way out of a difficult situation, Sony continues to focus on the consumer segment.
For example, one of Sony’s main rivals, Panasonic Corporation, has recently shifted its focus to industrial components: here, the company’s sales are growing at a high rate, especially through automotive systems and environmentally friendly technologies.
As a result, by the end of the fiscal year, which ends in March 2014, Sony expects to receive 179 billion yen of operating profit against the previously expected 230 billion yen.
At the same time, according to the agency Thomson Reuters, analysts assumed that the figure will be significantly higher and will amount to 221 billion yen.
Looking to get out of the crisis, Sony is expanding its product line-up.
In the middle of this month, it was announced the start of sales of "smart" watches from a Japanese corporation, equipped with a number of fashion features that will allow you to get rid of the need to deliver a smartphone from your pocket 100 times a day.
After Sony lowered its annual earnings and earnings forecast, the company’s shares at the opening of Tokyo’s tours in the morning lost more than 11 percent, falling to the level of 1,668 yen per share.
The speech gene has been shown to stimulate the formation of synapses
Scientists from Johns Hopkins University and Mount Sinai School of Medicine have discovered a protein through which the Foxp2 speech gene performs its function by stimulating the formation of new connections between neurons.
The study is published in Science, on the website of the journal you can read its brief content.
The Foxp2 gene is the first known gene whose function is directly related to speech.
His role was established in 2001 through the discovery of a family of several people who could not pronounce words correctly and sometimes did not even understand each other.
The researchers found that family members had a disruption of the Foxp2 gene, but how it performs its function was not known.
In a new study, biologists have shown that at least part of its functions Foxp2 performs as a stimulant for the formation of new synapses in the brain area associated with speech formation.
This is accomplished by another gene, SRPX2.
The latter was discovered as a result of the search for factors that stimulate the formation of synapses.
SRPX2 was one of 10 similar genes found by the authors, with only Foxp2 deriving its activity.
That SRPX2 actually affects vocalization, the scientists confirmed in the experiment on mice.
When the gene activity of animals was artificially reduced, they screamed less when separated from the mother.
If the activity of the gene was restored, the frequency of the emitted sounds was also restored.
Previously, the mice also showed a link to the vocalization of Foxp2.
Animals that received a human copy of the gene were fed more actively and at a lower frequency than regular mice.
So far, however, scientists do not know whether the work of Foxp2 and, accordingly, the SRPX2 controlled by it is related to purely "mechanical" properties of sound formation or more subtle processes.
A cocaine addict lawyer who warned the leader of a criminal group about a police investigation is in prison
42-year-old Basharat Ditta handed over information to criminal authority Neil Scarborough
The lawyer feared that his secret drug addiction would be revealed.
He was sentenced to three years in prison by the Liverpool Royal Court.
A prestigious lawyer who told the drug lord about a major police investigation because he was afraid of exposing his secret drug addiction was sentenced to three years in prison.
42-year-old Basharat Ditta has been handing over secret information to the criminal authority, Neil Scarborough, about an investigation into his drug trafficking activities after he was threatened because of his cocaine addiction.
A lawyer nicknamed Bash and nicknamed among criminals “a cool lawyer” was arrested at his home in 2011 after a police surveillance operation on Scarborough, which he had previously represented in a drug-related court.
Officers noticed a 32-year-old Scarborough left three bags of cocaine at a lawyer's home in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was having dinner with a lawyer's association with colleagues.
The investigation revealed that Ditta was “regularly” using a class A drug after tests showed traces of cocaine in his hair, on his wallet and on credit cards.
For eight months from January to August 2011, he illegally tried to obtain information on the arrests of two persons on behalf of Scarborough, as well as one of his accomplices.
All four suspects were under police surveillance at the time as part of a large-scale investigation into the activities of a criminal organization selling heroin and cocaine in Lancashire, Cambria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
They and 32 others were later imprisoned after police seized heroin and cocaine in a series of raids worth <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million and more than <0xC2><0xA3>200,000 in cash.
42-year-old Ditta passed on the information to the criminals for fear that his cocaine addiction would be revealed.
Today at the Liverpool Royal Court, Ditta, who works at the Blackburn-based law firm Forbes Solicitors, was covered with shame after acknowledging his guilt in two cases of deliberate obstruction of justice following a three-week court case in Liver.
He confessed to storing cocaine at one of the previous court hearings.
The lawyer's disclosure came after police investigating Scarborough's activities found out that he had been talking to Ditt on the phone regularly since February 2011.
Two detectives tracked down the suspect and found him approaching Ditt's home in Blackburn and placing drugs of 60 percent purity in a black golf glove under a lawyer's garbage can.
Shortly after the transfer, Scarborough was repeatedly summoned by Ditt, who was at a dinner party at Blackburn Rovers' Ewood Park football stadium.
The lawyer returned home for the drugs; there were nine conversations between them.
The court found that Ditta “regularly” used cocaine after tests found traces of Class A drugs in his hair, wallet and credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested, but denied cocaine use, said he was talking to the suspected dealer because he was his client, and insisted that their communication was a “lawyer’s secret.”
During his detention, Ditta took his wallet and tried to take out several credit cards, but all of them were confiscated, and he also had a hair sample taken.
During an interrogation at the police station, he said that along with his workplace, he also had a home office, and clients came to his home for legal matters.
However, the court learned that after the important arrests, he called the largest drug traffickers, a number of whom he had previously represented in court, to tell them what detectives knew about them.
In her indictment, White said, “If anyone knows that a law should not be violated, it is a criminal lawyer.”
Mr. Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal lawyer because he has entered into too close a relationship with certain clients.
The contact we are talking about is not just a drug dealer, but a drug dealer who supplies his own lawyer with drugs.
Some of his conversations will certainly prove legitimate, as he was their lawyer.
However, this has largely crossed the boundaries of the usual lawyer-client relationship.
He prevented the police investigation as much as possible to allow these individuals to continue their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta did not honor his profession, but shamed it.
He got too close to certain clients, particularly Scarborough, and allowed him to doubt his disinterest.
"If I were a corrupt lawyer who I am not, and I wanted to pass on the information to Mr. Scarborough, I wouldn't have waited 15 hours, I would have done it immediately."
But after the meeting, Senior Officer Lee Holstead of the Lancashire Police said: “Mr. Ditta turned from a criminal lawyer to a criminal as soon as he began acquiring drugs from organized crime representatives.”
His addiction to cocaine made him hopelessly compromised and vulnerable to the targets of the main members of the criminal groups who commissioned him to obtain valuable information about police investigations.
Lawyers must adhere to the highest standards of professional ethics and instill trust and confidence in society.
Mr. Ditta betrayed this trust and tried to cover up his profession.
The investigation into Mr. Ditt ' s case was conducted by the Lancashire Division of Highly Dangerous Organized Crime, which had already been convicted of three cases of possession of cocaine, and now also of obstruction of justice, demonstrating our desire to achieve a just punishment for criminals.
Let this case serve as a warning to criminals that no one is outside the reach of the law.
We'll find you and bring you to justice.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years after pleading guilty to a conspiracy to supply heroin, cocaine and marijuana.
Another 35 persons involved in the fraud were sentenced to 153 years for drug-related crimes.
On his website, Ditta organized a question-and-answer conversation in which he says that his dream job is a lawyer representing clients with the death penalty in America, the perfect companion for him at dinner – Mohammed Ali, and motivation at work is inequality.
The stadium in Yaroslavl is not ready to receive 22,000 spectators, police officials said, who were present today at the meeting of the CDC of the Russian Federation.
The ticket program is exaggerated, in their opinion, about twice.
During the 1/16 final match of the Cup of Russia with Spartak, only a thousand stewards were involved under the regulatory norm of nine thousand.
Spartak fans had 2,200 seats, i.e. 10 percent of the capacity of the stadium, however, according to the agreement with the Moscow club, they were sold 5 thousand tickets.
This data was announced by the head of the CDC, Arthur Grigoryantz.
Americans were listening to Japanese high-ranking officials
On Friday, November 1, a U.S. intelligence official who chose not to disclose his name said the U.S. was listening to phone calls from senior Japanese officials.
This man confirmed that in the country of the rising sun there are several points intended for listening.
At the same time, he noted that the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, New Zealand do not conduct intelligence activities against each other.
This, he said, happened during the Second World War, when these countries were allies.
But Japan, like Germany, despite allied relations with the Americans in the post-war period, are objects for intelligence activities, NHK TV reported.
Neither party has officially commented on the information so far.
We will remind, news about the surveillance of the US intelligence services under the chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany appeared last week.
According to German journalists, the NSA may have been listening to Merkel’s phone for the past ten years.
The Chancellor herself, according to some reports, took the news of her audition very painfully.
She said that, in her opinion, the allies of Germany and the United States for decades, such surveillance of the head of government is unacceptable.
Meanwhile, Edward Snowden said he was ready to share details of Angela Merkel’s phone calls with German prosecutors.
The German specially flew to Moscow to meet with a former CIA employee.
Bashkiria may put the grain to auction no earlier than the beginning of 2014
Bashkiria in the course of state procurement interventions can put the grain up for auction no earlier than the beginning of 2014, says the Minister of Agriculture of the Republic Nikolay Kovalenko.
To date, market prices are such that they do not stimulate sales to the intervention fund.
While the price in the market is higher, there is demand.
"Perhaps the grain will be put up for auction after the New Year," he said at a press conference yesterday.
The Minister recalled that in the current year, crop sowing under the 2013 harvest amounted to 3.1 million hectares, including the area of cereal crops - 1.7 million hectares, which is 3.3% more than last year.
Under the 2014 harvest, 550,000 hectares were sown (by 105,000 hectares more than in 2012).
The area under winter wheat and triticale was increased, the rye remained at the same level.
In the bases of the Ministry of Internal Affairs there is no group "Brothers Circle", to which in the United States included Leps
In the databases of the Russian security forces of the group "Brothers Circle", to which Washington has included the singer Gregory Leps, does not mean.
As noted by "Interfax" in the law enforcement agencies of the Russian Federation, after the media appeared reports about the inclusion of the U.S. Treasury Department Gregory Leps in the checklists on the suspicion of belonging to the Eurasian criminal syndicate "Brothers' Circle", all the databases were checked.
The dissemination of this information contributes to the maintenance of the myth of the so-called “Russian mafia”, which allegedly operates abroad, according to the authorities.
"Even in the name itself - 'Brother's Circle', there is some element of mystery, there is a hint of a secret lodge.
“It’s all very similar to a PIAR action,” the agency’s interlocutor said.
On October 31, the U.S. Treasury announced the inclusion in its checklists of suspected members of the Eurasian criminal syndicate "Brothers Circle" Arthur Badalian, Gregory Lepsveridze, Vadim Lyalin, Sergey Moskalenko, Yakov Shbalsky.
The individuals on this list are suspected of having ties to some of Vladislav Leontiev and Gafur Rahimov, who are considered influential members of criminal groups and have been on U.S. sanctions lists since February 2012.
According to the US authorities, Grigory Leps "serves as a courier to deliver money on behalf of Vladislav Leontiev".
The production center of Gregory Leps refused to comment on the U.S. allegations against the singer, calling them "crazy."
In 2011, U.S. President Barack Obama named the Brotherhood Circle as a “substantial transnational organized crime group” and instructed the finance minister to “undermine and prohibit their global criminal operations.”
The blacklisting of a person by the U.S. Treasury entails the blocking of his assets in the U.S. and the ban on business contacts with persons residing in the United States.
Scandalous video reached the police
Toronto boss Rob Ford, known for his outrageous and frankly reckless moves, got caught smoking crack.
The Canadian city police said they have a video footage of the incident and are ready to start an investigation against the mayor.
He said he would not leave his post, CNN reported.
The information that the authorities have evidence of drug use by Rob Ford appeared on the Toronto police website.
Local law enforcement chief Bill Blair held a press conference on the issue.
The sheriff said he was not authorized to share the data with the public, but he was responsible for their existence.
According to Blair, a video compromising Rob Ford was discovered during an anti-narcotics raid carried out by security guards in the summer of 2013.
Previously, the existence of this video has already been written by the Canadian press, but until recently there was no confirmation.
The mayor himself does not comment on this.
He just says he's not guilty and he's not going to resign.
The video footage found by the police is one of the evidence in the case of 35-year-old friend Ford Alexander Lisi, who is accused of light drug trafficking, extortion, illegal income, and criminal conspiracy.
Sometimes Lizzie served as the driver of Rob Ford.
Residents of the city have long demanded the resignation of their mayor.
He repeatedly quarreled with journalists, appeared in public in drunken form, allowed himself to make racist and sexist statements.
Rostovaeroinvest JSC has recognized the German company Assmann Beraten + Planen as the winner of the tender for the selection of the general designer of the facility.
The amount of the contract in Rostov-on-Don is not disclosed.

A politician in Turkey announced a hunger strike against the wall on the border with Syria
In mid-October, authorities began construction of a partition wall in the Nusaybin area in southeastern Turkey.
Local residents and representatives of the pro-Kurdish party PMD strongly opposed the construction.
The mayor of the Turkish city of Nusaibin Aishe Gekhan, on the border with Syria, announced a hunger strike in protest against the construction of a dividing wall on the Turkish-Syrian border, RIA Novosti reported in the press service of the Party for Peace and Democracy (PMD) on Friday.
Police have repeatedly staged protests.
Turkish Foreign Minister Muammar Güler first denied the construction, then said the wall was being built to ensure border security.
"Mayor Nusaybina Aishe Gekhan, a member of the PMD, declared a hunger strike, thus turning her protest against the construction of the wall into a deadly struggle," the party's press service said.
The mayor of the city believes that the construction of the wall is designed to isolate the Kurdish population of the two countries from each other, the Kurds crossed this border freely for half a century.
“This is an inhumane situation with which the Kurds will never agree,” said Aisha Hekhan.
According to the press service, a rally against the construction of a partition wall is planned for November 7 in Nusaybin.
Venezuela to set exchange rate for tourists
Venezuela will introduce a special exchange rate of its national currency, the bolivar, against the dollar for tourists.
This was reported by Bloomberg on November 1, citing a government decree.
Foreign travelers will be allowed to exchange amounts equivalent to ten thousand U.S. dollars per year.
Venezuela will also allow tourists to sell up to 25 percent of the bolivars purchased in the country at the time of departure.
The specific exchange rate of the bolivar against the dollar will be established at a later date.
In February, Caracas was forced to devalue the local currency to 6.3 bolivars per dollar.
However, on the black market, one dollar is valued at 57 bolivars.
Since the beginning of the year, the bolivar has lost almost 70 percent of its value.
In September, inflation in Venezuela was almost 50 percent.
On October 18, the Minister of Petroleum Industry and Vice President of the Economy Rafael Ramírez said that Venezuela has no plans to devalue the bolivar.
According to unofficial information led by the agency, Caracas may still decide to lower the national currency rate after the municipal elections in December.
The policy of curbing prices for products and consumer goods, as well as the high degree of regulation of the Venezuelan economy, has led to a shortage of a number of goods and the functioning of the black currency market.
In the spring of this year, the media wrote that there was a shortage of toilet paper in Venezuela.
The director of "Ugra" Andrey Belmach noted that so far it is difficult to say how long it will take to find a new head coach.
This post became vacant after the resignation of Sergei Shepelev.
The resignation took place only a few hours ago, so to say how much time it will take to find a new coach, I am not ready," itar-tass quotes Belmach.
Maybe a day.
Maybe even a month.
We are exploring all possible options.
Priority will be given to the Russian specialist.
I want not just to find a coach, but a person who will work in our club for several years and achieve certain results with him.
Kenyan Press Aggrieved by Provocative Media Law
“This is a terrible place, and there is reason to ask: what can prevent Parliament from destroying the independence of the judiciary in the future?” the newspaper said, calling the law unconstitutional.
“This law is very harsh and punitive and we reject it,” said Cyrus Kamau, managing director of Capital Group, a parent company of CapitalFM, which includes one of Kenya’s most respected independent radio stations and news website.
He said the new media judiciary would “always be biased, as it is a continuation of the government,” and restrictions on content and advertising would harm Kenya’s position in the global economy.
“I hope the president will listen to us and we ask him to reject this bill and return it to the deputies,” he said.
According to The Star, the new law will essentially allow the government to “take the media with a dead grip,” and The Standard reported that democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya “have been severely hit,” and criticized the bill as “draconian.”
The bill is part of measures taken to strengthen national security following the September attack by Muslim terrorists at the Westgate shopping mall.
Kenyan media have angered the authorities by broadcasting footage of surveillance cameras where troops who were sent to the attack site allegedly robbed an expensive shopping mall.
Police chief David Kimayo’s response was to call two journalists and a media official for questioning, although the call was cancelled after mass media protests.
Under the new law, publishers can be fined up to 20 million Kenyan shillings, and individual journalists up to one million with an additional risk of being "excluded from the lists", i.e. being banned from receiving official journalist accreditation.
The court also has the right to confiscate the property of the offender if the fine is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, “even a single fine is enough to paralyze the work of most FM radio stations.”
She also said the measures could have a devastating effect on Kenya’s so-called “vived blogosphere.”
Politicians understand that by forcing the media to remain silent, they will be able to do whatever they want with impunity.
“No one will ever know,” Nation journalist Mutuma Matthew wrote, describing the Kenyan media as a key source of restraining and balancing forces in public life.
“The politicians themselves will destroy the country and bring us back to hunting and gathering,” he wrote.
Kenyan lawmakers have been the target of public anger in the past.
In May, they voted to repeal the cuts set by the National Wage Commission and restore their huge salary of about 532,000 shillings a month, one of the highest in the world.
In the municipal payments of Voronezh will appear a new line of expenses - deductions for the capital repair of the house.
According to the most approximate calculations for a standard two-room apartment from the new year will have to pay from 100 to 400 rubles per month.
The exact norm will be determined by the government of the region.
But when to paint the entrance, put in order staircases or even replace the elevator - will decide the tenants themselves.
Such a law was approved by the deputies of the regional duma.
Vladimir Klyuchnikov, Chairman of the Voronezh Regional Duma, noted: "In this case, too, it is necessary to put order - to establish the order of the renovation of houses, to accumulate funds not in managing companies - which we often register in Moscow, Orenburg, and elsewhere, the state will be established control of the
Under the control of the state now and share construction.
The law that protects against fraudsters is approved by the oblhum in the final reading.
The document was not born in an empty place.
In our region, 4,500 people were affected by dishonest builders.
Most of the problems were solved.
By the way, the new law prescribes rights and obligations for all shareholders.
Vladimir Klyuchnikov, Chairman of the Voronezh Regional Duma, said: "It is no secret that abuses in this sphere also began, related to the fact that in the 98th year the debtors were the same, and in the 2000s the same debtors."
People started making money on it to cover the loophole, including enacting these two laws.
Under Voronezh, it was decided to build a temporary residence center for foreign citizens subject to deportation.
The regional parliament passed such a law not only under the pressure of the federation.
The problems associated with illegal migrants in the region at least address.
Last year, more than 100,000 foreigners were admitted to the immigration register.
But only one in five has an official work permit.
Where others work and whether they pay taxes is a big question.
Vladimir Klyuchnikov, chairman of the Voronezh Regional Duma, said: "They violated the legislation, but they are not criminals."
There are no ships, but they have to be deported - they have to be held somewhere.
Such a decision the federation has made that at the expense of regional funds such places to equip.
In the Voronezh region, such a place is defined - it is the Old Olshanka of Semiluk district.
Well, and lately, the regional parliament has granted new benefits to many parents.
First, families where they raise 5 or more children are completely exempt from transportation tax.
The budget in this case loses 3.5 million - but as much as many parents save.
Secondly, and this is the main thing, those who adopt 3 or more babies, from the new year will issue housing subsidies.
For each member of the family, the new law provides for 18 square meters, at a price of 30,000 per meter.
The family, for example, of 6 people - dad, mother, native child and 3rd - adopted.
For them, according to the regulations, the state acquires housing with an area of 108 square meters - for 3 million 300 thousand rubles.
For the left bank or the South-West microdistrict is quite an acceptable option.
Well, you can buy a whole cottage at the center of the paradise for this amount.

U.S. Secretary of State: intelligence agencies sometimes "go too far" in the collection of data
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry acknowledged that when collecting data and eavesdropping, U.S. intelligence agencies sometimes "go too far," but the politician noted that the information appeared in the media about eavesdropping 70 million people is not true.
I assure you that innocent people were not harmed in this process, but there was an attempt to gather information.
Yes, in some cases, it went too far and was wrong.
I admit it, as the president also admits ... and we will ensure that this does not happen in the future,” the state secretary told AFP.
Italian workers with an internship give way to young people
Unemployment in Italy is breaking records.
Data released on Wednesday showed that 12.5% of the country’s population is now unemployed.
Things have not been so bad since the Second World War.
Among young people, this figure is several times higher.
40.4% of the population aged 15 to 24 are unemployed.
According to the Italian authorities, one of the solutions to this problem is the early retirement of older workers.
Such an experiment is already carried out by the largest energy company in the country, and the adopted laws allow regional authorities to provide part of the early retirement pension for employees with an internship.
However, on the other hand, Italy has a common problem for Europe of the ageing population.
And economists are not sure that the premature rotation of staff justifies itself.
What will lead to the construction of TPU in Moscow
Every year, the capital’s authorities promise to equip more and more transport and transit nodes (TPUs).
By 2020, it is planned to put 255 TPU into operation.
What the project actually turns out to be, our correspondent understood.
A few months ago, there was a construction fence near the metro "Smolenskaya" Arbatsko-Pokrovskaya line.
The inscription said that the transport and transshipment hub was being set up.
All this was very strange, because next to "Smolenskaya" no ground transport stops and, therefore, it is not possible to move to it.
To get to the nearest trolleybus stop on the Garden Ring, you have to cross about 130 meters, including the ground crossing through the Karmanytsky alley.
Now at Smolenskaya almost everything is finished.
The flower box disappeared, the newspaper stand was dismantled, and the asphalt before the entrance was replaced by a pavement.
Here's the whole transport hub.
Transportation and transfer nodes are flat and capital, - explained in the press service of the capital's transport department.
There are no capital TPUs yet.
And flat ones involve the construction of parking lots, the withdrawal of commercial facilities that impede the movement of passengers, the creation of small architectural forms and improvements.
In fact, flat TPUs are not even engaged in transporters, but professional upgraders from the department of capital repair of the city of Moscow.
The transport hub is not necessarily a complex structure, - explains the director of the Institute of Transport Economics and Transport Policy of the Higher School of Economics Mikhail Blinkin.
Sometimes it is enough to have a roof over your head and a sign warning about the time of arrival of the transport.
For example, the Yasenevo subway recently opened a completely full-fledged flat transfer node.
Let there be no canopies, but with intercepting parking lots and a signpost indicating when the bus will arrive.
But in pursuit of the number, officials record everything in the TPU.
In 2011, the city planned to build all 151 nodes, 59 of them with capital construction.
Now there are 255 TPU in the plans for 2020.
One and a half of them are expected to return this year.
Although there is a program for the development of TPU in the city, there are no qualitative criteria, - says Alexander Morozov, co-chair of the public organization "City and Transport".
The number of objects is reported, but the quality of the transplant on each of them often deteriorates.
The criteria, in the opinion of the expert, should be two: first - a reduction in the time of transplantation, second - convenience.
First of all, the possibility of changing the mode of transport without going out under the rain.
In Moscow, when arranging a TPU, sometimes the exact opposite happens.
A vivid example of the subway "VDNH".
Previously, suburban buses from the Yaroslavl highway came to the square in front of the main entrance to the VVC.
Now their stops were moved to the opposite side of Yaroslavl on Kosmonautov Street.
Farther from the metro, farther from the monorail, but closer to residential houses.
It was a gift that the residents absolutely did not want a bus station under the windows and complained in all possible instances.
With capital TPUs in Moscow somehow did not immediately set.
The first of them began to be built five years ago at the metro "Planernaya".
The project was designed to be exemplary.
And it really turned out to be a sample of how the transfer node, given to buy back investors, turns into a banal shopping mall.
No, there are platforms for buses, a vault not to walk from the subway in the rain, and three floors of parking.
However, the chemical trolleybuses No. 202 and No. 203 in the Moscow TPU did not give place in principle.
They were driven away from the subway like strangers.
There is more space for trade.
Only 32 stores of clothing, and in general there is almost everything - from pet stores to the auto show.
Well, in fact, suddenly which of the passengers of the bus will need to buy a new car on the road?
When we build a capital TPU, there is always a shopping center for some reason.
Recently, the situation has reached its logical conclusion when a part of the parking lot was decided to be put on the market.
Now on the third floor of the TPU "Planernaya" among the marked on the floor of parking spaces there is a fighting trade.
Vegetables, spices, Chinese jeans, non-Russian speech and security guards looking evil at our photographer.
The transfer node has finally turned into a bazaar.
The fact is that before there was a market at the metro "Planernaya", but it was demolished.
And in the prefecture of the merchants regretted and let on the intercepting parking of the transfer node.
Due to the high prices, it is always empty.
The funny thing is that the market was demolished in order to build a new flat TPU in its place.
That's rocking.
In the metro "Kaluzhskaya" the distance from the entrance hall of the metro to the bus was 50 meters, - says Alexander Morozov.
After the construction of the shopping center, supposedly TPU, the distance increased to 170 meters.
To get on the bus, you have to go through the entire shopping mall.
After 22 hours, when it is closed, you have to bypass it under the open sky.
However, the designs on "Planerna" and "Kaluzhskaya" will soon appear as flowers.
In mid-September, the Town Hall’s Urban Planning and Land Commission approved planning solutions for the first eight capital TPUs.
Four of them will be 25-story, not counting two or three underground levels.
The main monster will grow near the Tushino metro, it will have 418.7 thousand square meters of area.
Representatives of the direction of the railway stations of the RZD, responsible for the construction of the TPU near the subway, have already told journalists: in the future multi-storeys there will be shops, hotels and apartments.
At the same time, officials assure that multi-storey parking lots are mute from one-third to half of the area.
Take, for example, the “people’s” garages.
For example, the garage for 258 cars, which was recently built on the International Street, has an area of 8015 square meters. meters.
So, for parking for 2.6 thousand cars in "Petrovsko-Razumovskaya" will need about 80,000 "squares".
That's less than a third of the machine that's going to be built there.
Let one or two floors go to any bus platforms.
There are at least 150,000 square meters of commercial real estate.
And that's, for a minute, almost two gums.
If the capital TPUs at the stations and stations are built by railways, then the rest of the sites will be mastered by metropolitans.
They also promised that there would be many "functional facilities", including hotels, offices and even gyms.
By the way, in the property department of the city of Moscow recently told journalists that they are developing a draft decree, according to which investors will be able to apply for a plot for TPU directly to officials.
Without any competitions.
He said transport issues are a priority for the city.
The ideal TPU is, for example, the station "Harvard" in Boston or "Spadina" in Toronto, - Alexander Morozov is sure.
There, trolleybuses and trams go underground to the metro level and the distance from the metro wagon to the tram is only 50 meters without access to the street.
There is no unnecessary trade around.
But Moscow officials are throwing in the extreme.
Either we will not build anything, or we will knock down 25 floors with offices and apartments.
Eser proposes to equate to extremism the insult of patriotic feelings
For the legislative protection of patriotic feelings of citizens from provocations and insults directed against Russia, Fair Russia proposes to equate the insult of patriotic feelings with extremist activities and to punish for this five years in prison.
As reported by the newspaper "Izvestia", such amendments to the legislation, prepared by the deputy of the Duma Committee on Energy Oleg Mikheev, have already been sent for a ruling to the Supreme Court and the government.
Under the patriotic feelings of citizens, the author of the amendments proposes to understand the emotional connection of a person with the country of which he is a citizen, characterized by love for that country, a responsible attitude to its destiny, respect for its history and culture.
As Mikheev points out, in the domestic legislation there are sanctions for abuse of formal signs of state power - the flag and coat of arms.
At the same time, according to the parliamentarian, the protection of Russians, whose feelings can be affected by insulting state symbols and other manifestations of disrespect for our country, is not sufficiently developed in Russian legislation.
As an example, he cites annual debates on the eve of Victory Day, when some media figures allow themselves to question the heroic feat of the people of the USSR in the fight against the fascists.
On the eve of the main national holiday - Victory Day on May 9 - a real bakhanalia is held annually.
Exercising in wit and an "alternative view" of history, some journalists come to the conclusion that, to say the least, how unfortunate that the cultural Germans did not conquer the wild Soviet Union!
I consider this absolutely unacceptable in a country where pride in history remains the main “spiritual bond” of the nation,” Oleg Mikheev said.
In addition, according to Mikheev, patriotic people in Russia are much more than religious, but the law punishes for insulting the feelings of believers, and insulting patriotic feelings can be almost impunity.
In the opinion of the people's electorate, it is necessary to equate the insult of patriotic feelings with extremist activities and to prescribe in article 282 of the Criminal Code the corresponding punishment.
The bill provides for punishment for insulting patriotic feelings: from a 100,000 fine to 5 years in prison.
An earthquake of magnitude 6.6 occurred on Thursday, October 31, in the area of the city of Coquimbo in central Chile, Reuters reported.
The quake was located in the ocean at a depth of 10.7 kilometers and at a distance of 54 kilometers south-west of the city, according to the website of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS).
The thrusts were recorded at 20:03 local time (3:03 on November 1st in Moscow).
There are no reports of casualties or destruction caused by subterranean thrusts.
Chile is located in one of the most seismic areas on Earth, so earthquakes of varying magnitude are not uncommon.
One of the most serious incidents occurred in 2010.
The magnitude 8.8 earthquake and tsunami caused more than 550 people to die in Chile and 220,000 buildings were destroyed.
In addition, Chile experienced the most powerful earthquake in recent history: in 1960, it recorded a magnitude of 9.5.
More than 5,000 people were killed as a result of the natural disaster.
Dmitry Medvedev: Greenpeace will be treated fairly
Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said on Friday that the case of Greenpeace activists will be considered in strict accordance with Russian legislation.
France may not doubt that the case will be dealt with in compliance with the law, we hear all the concerns.
"We can guarantee compliance with the laws," Dmitry Medvedev said at a meeting with French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ero.
Among the detained Greenpeace activists is a French citizen.
Pierre Pisani, like other activists, has been charged with hooliganism.
"I asked if we can expect a humanitarian gesture towards the detained citizen," Mr Ero told RIA Novosti.
"Our country cannot support activities that can harm the environment, no one has the right to violate the laws," Medvedev said.
According to him, the activities of any structures that try to influence technologically complex and unsafe processes, including energy production, are dangerous.
He stressed that these objects "like a powder barrel", and reminded about what was happening in the Gulf of Mexico, reports RIA Novosti.
The UN announces new goals for overcoming poverty
The United Nations must immediately begin work on a new set of challenges to replace the Millennium Development Goals formulated 12 years ago to address global poverty.
Australian diplomats have played a key role in advancing the “Sustainable Development Goals” to replace the MDGs that expire in 2015, ahead of the UN Sustainable Development Summit that began in Rio on the eve of last night.
They were included in the final version of the document to be signed by world leaders, including Ms. Gillard, during the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said on the eve of the summit that it was time to “get above national interests.”
“I am pleased that UN member countries have agreed to launch and take control of the process of establishing the Universal Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs),” he said.
These SDGs will build on our progress towards the Millennium Development Goals and become an integral part of the post-2015 development concept.
I will make every effort to use the authority given to me by the member countries to implement our vision of the Sustainable Development Goals, which are based on the successful implementation of the MDGs.
Security Concerns in Mozambique Rising Due to Influential People’s Conflict
Under the statue of Samora Machel, Mozambique’s founding president, thousands of people gathered in the center of Maputo to chant slogans about peace at one of the rare demonstrations here.
“We want peace back; we want stability,” said Vanessa de Susa, executive director of the investment company.
Fearing for her country’s future, she changed her business suit for a T-shirt decorated with the inscription “We Need Security” in Portuguese, and joined the crowd at the capital’s Independence Square on Thursday.
There have been almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo over the past two weeks — some of the most brutal clashes since the ceasefire was concluded more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a well-known rebel movement, which was supported first by the white authorities of Rhodesia and then by the South African government of the apartheid era as part of efforts to destabilize the country's independent government.
After the 1992 ceasefire, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe the country is unlikely to plunge back into a full-scale conflict, but recent developments have made foreign investors and locals nervous.
The rates are high for the fast-growing economy, as the discovery of huge shelf gas and coal reserves in the northwest could attract more than $50 billion as investment in the next few years from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy and Anadarko from the US.
The ruling Frelimo party, the leading political force since 1975, and the Renato party blame each other for the tensions that have arisen.
The Renamo Party claims that the government became the originator of the latest clashes by attacking its members in Sofala province, the traditional Renamo stronghold, on October 17.
Attacks on former rebels then escalated when government forces attacked Renato bases and attempted to kill Afonso Dhlakamu, the group's leader, Fernando Mazanga, a spokesman for Renato, told the Financial Times.
The government blames Renato for initiating clashes, accusing the party of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza tried to dispel concerns about instability.
Hebusa told AFP, the French news agency, on Wednesday that Dhlakama felt "failed" to use "everything left in his power to try to prove that he can impose his own decisions on the government."
Both Frelimo and Renato insist that they want to avoid war.
However, fears grew after reports that Mazanga had announced Renato's resignation from the 1992 peace agreement.
He told the Financial Times that he meant the non-compliance of the agreement by the Frelimo party.
“Our goal is to return to negotiations, but with all seriousness,” Mazanga said.
Previous talks between the parties have done little to ease the tensions aggravated by a series of clashes this year.
“These are two influential people (Gebuz and Dhlakam) who collided with their foreheads,” said Joseph Hanlon, a professor at the Open University and an expert on Mozambique.
Neither of them is a good negotiator and none of them is willing to make the necessary concessions.
The Renamo party, which is trying to achieve electoral reforms, has already announced that it will boycott municipal elections scheduled for November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted this pressure as an attempt by the weakened movement to obtain concessions and financial bonuses from the government.
The proportion of votes for Renamo has been declining since 1992, while the new party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM), which was founded by a former Renamo member, is expected to improve its performance in these elections.
Mr. Mazanga said that Mr. Gebuza, who was due to resign next year when his second term expired, wanted to destroy democracy in the country.
“He doesn’t want multi-party democracy, he doesn’t want transparent elections, he doesn’t want peace because he doesn’t want to leave the presidency,” Mazanga said.
It is unclear what capabilities Renato has, but it has already carried out destructive and rapid attacks on police stations and cars on the key highway leading from north to south.
Most of the clashes took place in the province of Sofia, a few hundred kilometers north of Maputo, but include Beirut, a port that mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, use to export coal.
In June, Rio suspended the use of railroads for about a week after Renato threatened to attack the railroad.
Mazanga was evasive when asked whether Renato would repeat the threat.
The Renamo party wanted to “warn the international community that things are not going very well in Mozambique,” Mazanga said.
Instability has heightened discontent with the government, and many people are also concerned about corruption, the slow pace of development and the recent abductions, says Fernando Lima, head of independent media company Mediacoop.
“People think that the responsibility for the future of the country lies with the government and the president, who should find a solution to these problems,” he says.
Omar Sultan, a participant in the demonstration, said people just want stability.
“No one cares about Renato or Frelimo, they just want peace to be restored, they want free access to the roads,” he said.
The series of premiere movie shows "Art-mainstream" will be held in Moscow
A series of “Art-Mainstream” movie shows, where viewers will be able to see one Russian and four foreign films a few days before their release, will be held at the Rolan cinema from November 1 to 5, RIA Novosti reports with reference to the organizers of the project.
The program "Art-mainstream" will open the French comedy director and actress Reim Kericchi "Paris at any cost".
This is the story of a model working in the French capital, Maye (Same Kerichi), who is deported to Morocco because of visa problems.
In addition to the film Kerichi will also show the viewers the new picture of the famous South Korean director Kim Ki Duk "Mebius", the melodramatic biopic of Oliver Hirschbigel "Diana: a story of love" (Diana) with Naomi Watts in the main role "Kabishi" and the main film of the past
The only Russian participant of "Art-mainstream" will be the winner at the festival "Kinotavr" film of Alexander Veledinsky "Geographer Globe Propil" based on the novel of the same name Alexei Ivanov.
The main role - the charming failure-teacher Victor Sluzhkin - in the film was played by Konstantin Habensky, whose work was also awarded the "Kinotavra" award.
Children should study myths and legends as “models of lifestyle,” the author says.
The stories of the Torah could show that “coarse power cannot overcome sophisticated trickery,” and the legends of King Arthur show how important it is to have a dream.
Saying that many myths will turn out to be “too wild, too scandalous, and in some cases too indecent to teach in schools,” Crossley-Holland advocates “a careful selection” of age-appropriate texts.
“I think it’s wonderful that in America myths and folklore are already part of education,” he said.
I advocated introducing them into a twenty-year curriculum.
He added that the "excessive moralization" of authors and teachers "reflects interest" in children, and the main ideas are "sublimated" into fascinating stories.
Crossley-Holland, who translated "Beowulf" from Anglo-Saxon and also wrote the "Collection of Norwegian Myths" for Penguin Publishing and the "British Folk Tales", said: "You may have intentions, of course, but you'd better keep them with you."
Perhaps the big difference between an adult author writing for adults and an adult author writing for children is the need to feel some kind of hope.
Not that everything should be simplified or lead to a happy ending, but it is necessary that there be an innate understanding of good and evil.
And it must be sublimated; revealed through history, not clearly formulated.
The old principle: to show, not to tell.
In the Voronezh region detained football fan, smashed a window in the waiting room of the station
At nine o’clock in the evening on October 29 at the station of Grazy-Voronezh transport police officers removed from the passenger train two football fans - natives of the Moscow region.
Going to the game of the favorite team, the guys along the way set up a drunk debosch on the train.
The young people were taken to the on-duty part of the linear police station at the Grazy station to draw up a protocol on the administrative offence.
There, the fans regretted their anti-social behavior.
The police issued administrative documents on them and released them.
The young people bought tickets for the next train and at the station began to wait for his arrival.
In the middle of the first night, fans left the railway station building, but one of them, a 22-year-old boy, unexpectedly returned and broke the front door window in the waiting room of the station.
On the bell of the broken glass fell a transport police officer and a security guard of the RZD.
They managed to detain the attacker, who tried to escape from the scene of the incident.
Employees of the South-Eastern LU of the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs are being checked.
The issue of initiating a criminal case is being resolved, the senior referent for the direction of information and public relations of the South-Eastern Ukrainian Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia on transport Sergey Olkhovyk said.
Vitaly Mutko: Watermelons?
I think we came back 15 years ago.
Minister of Sport Vitaly Mutko expressed his opinion about the riots on the stands during the match of the Russian Cup "Shinnik" - "Spartak".
I support the fact that the organizers of sporting events are responsible for all this: clubs, the league, the Russian Federation.
But we can see that they have taken a firm stance.
They're waiting for someone to come by and put order in.
This is a very good position, but not quite right.
You have to organize the fans, the clubs should invite their stewards, not let the business run solo.
We have now drafted a special government decree on the rules of conduct in stadiums.
Once it is adopted, we will take a close look at this problem.
But I will definitely invite all the organizers of the football process.
I read an interview with Leonid Fedoun.
The state, he said, let's speed up the law.
Such a feeling that it is the fans of "Bavaria" in Yaroslavl came and all this arranged.
We are outside observers.
And it's really awful to see a stand being flooded from a brandspot.
And this is in a country that is preparing for the World Cup.
“I feel like we came back 10 or 15 years ago,” Mutko said.
Snowden may be questioned in Russia
Former U.S. intelligence official Edward Snowden is unlikely to travel outside Russia to testify on German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s phone calls.
According to an Interfax source familiar with the situation, the American can answer questions from the German prosecutor’s office in writing or in person in Russia.
Edward Snowden’s departure from Russia is virtually impossible.
"In this case, he will lose refugee status and may be extradited to Washington by U.S. allies," the agency's interlocutor said.
"However, in principle, the German Attorney General's Office could send its representatives to the Russian Federation or send written questions to Snowden," the source added, adding that this issue should be worked out at the interstate level.
Earlier, the deputy of the German Bundestag Hans-Christian Strebele said that Edward Snowden is ready to testify in the case of the U.S. intelligence agencies listening to the negotiations of the German Chancellor.
Snowden is ready to testify to German law enforcement agencies either in Moscow or on German territory.
An ex-CIA employee has made it clear that he knows a lot.
Despite the fact that the U.S. NSA has blocked all his movements, Snowden is ready to come to Germany.
However, for this to happen, it is necessary to clearly define all the conditions of his arrival," Strebele told Euronews.
Snowden's lawyer, Anatoly Kucheren, commenting on a statement from an Interfax source, said his client could cooperate with German investigators, but would decide when and how.
U.S. citizen Edward Snowden, who worked for the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) and the CIA, fled to Hong Kong in May 2013, after which he released information about secret U.S. intelligence operations on the Internet.
Snowden flew through Moscow in transit, but was unable to leave the airport because his passport was cancelled by the U.S. authorities, who outright made serious accusations against him, and remained in the transit zone of Sheremetyevo Airport until the beginning of August.
On August 1, Snowden received a document granting him temporary asylum on the territory of Russia for a period of one year and on the same day left Sheremetyevo.
Yesterday, the lawyer of the American Anatoly Kucheren said that his client has set up a job in a "large Russian company".
The NSA’s surveillance of Angela Merkel last week was reported by the German media.
According to journalists, the Americans began listening to the chancellor's telephone conversations in 2002.
The station was reportedly located at the U.S. Embassy in Berlin.
The German authorities said after the information was published that the surveillance of Merkel violates the laws and sovereignty of Germany.
Ponomarev has left "Just Russia"
The deputy of the State Duma from the party "Just Russia", a member of its branch in Novosibirsk Ilya Ponomarev has filed a statement on leaving the political organization.
As stated by the parliamentarian, he filed a statement to the Novosibirsk regional office of the party.
According to her charter, this automatically means that Ponomarev left the ranks of the "spraedrosov".
We sit down and drink tea.
"Why many want to see the picture "Ilya Ponomarev puts a party ticket on the table", but there is nothing so epochal in it," the MP commented on his decision.
Ponomarev noted that he maintains good relations with the regional office of "esers".
Meanwhile, the mandate of the State Duma deputy Ilya Ponomarev does not intend to give up.
He explained that, despite leaving the party, he remains a member of the faction and cannot legally leave it.
Reports about Ilya Ponomarev’s intention to leave the Fair Russia party appeared on October 30.
It was reported that with him from "SR" will come out Dmitry Gudkov and Valery Zubov, but the latter soon denied this information.
Japan will discuss with Russia the issue of the conclusion of a peace treaty
Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kisida met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov to discuss issues related to the conclusion of a peace treaty between the two countries.
"We would like to openly exchange views on the issues of further development of political dialogue, to discuss issues related to the conclusion of a peace treaty," he said at the meeting of Kisida.
The Japanese Foreign Minister recalled that after Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe visited Russia, relations between the countries became warmer and became bilateral.
The Russian minister, in turn, noted that the Russian Federation will go to Japan in the solution of complex political issues, writes RIA Novosti.
The conclusion of a peace treaty between Japan and Russia implies solutions to the issue of the disputed Northern Territories.
As a result, protests are taking place in Tokyo today demanding the return of land lost after World War II.
In the Japanese capital drive cars, from which the loudspeaker reports: "Return the Northern Territories!".
The police do not stop the protesters, they make sure that the noise level is not exceeded.
Ben Greenman: The Tenth Anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
You can safely say that New York is the birthplace of stand-up comedy in America: almost a hundred years ago, the star artist Frank Fay, who worked as a conference speaker at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began to tell jokes directly to the public in a conversational way.
Faye’s innovation has been picked up by others over time, most recently the New York Comedy Festival.
Created and curated by Caroline Hirsch, founder of the Carolines stand-up club, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year with more than sixty shows in small clubs and large theaters.
“Most of these headliners started at Carolines and then got more success, reached a level where they are already too famous to perform at the club,” said Hersh.
We created this festival as a way to continue working with them.
This year's event includes performances by Wanda Sykes, Katie Griffin and Bill Mara, as well as "Standup for Heroes" - an annual musical and comedy charity concert for military veterans at Cowboys' Madison Square Garden, featuring Stews, Bruce Springsteen, and others.
With the expansion of the festival, the world of comedy expanded.
Several comedians taking part in the festival this year have gained popularity in an unconventional way, for example, thanks to shows on small television channels such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll gained fame through his role in a comedy series on a little-known cable TV channel (particularly the FXX's scavenging "Liga" on the theme of fantasy football), and now runs his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate has appeared in both Saturday Night Live and Parks and Recreation Areas, although she is best known for her viral series, Marcel the Shellfish in Shoes.
Both Kroll and Slate, like other young comedians with an original style (surrealist pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, evil, focused on the racial theme of Kamau Bell), are the result of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the highlights of the festival will be David Steinberg’s interview with Larry David.
Steinberg began as a stand-up comedian, but later became a successful director in television and film, as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he was the host of TV Land's Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg.
The meeting will take place in the Town Hall in downtown Manhattan.
“This city is certainly a central element of Larry’s work,” Steinberg said.
He told me that when he comes here, he sometimes walks down some street between two houses and thinks, “If I don’t have the money, maybe I’ll live here.”
Pakistani authorities begin talks with local Taliban
The Pakistani authorities have begun negotiations with the Taliban.
This was reported by the embassy of this country in the UK, where Pakistan’s Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif is on a visit.
The head of Pakistan’s government made a statement on talks with Islamic extremists during a meeting with British Deputy Prime Minister Nik Klegg, with whom he discussed Pakistan-India relations, the world energy market and economic reforms in Pakistan.
"The Prime Minister has announced that dialogue with the Taliban movement has begun," the Pakistani embassy in London said in a statement.
“He said he hopes and prays that the dialogue will work in accordance with the constitution of Pakistan,” the diplomats added.
The Pakistani Taliban (Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan) are allies of the Afghan movement of the same name, but operate independently in the north-western parts of the country bordering Afghanistan.
The Pakistani Taliban is seeking the creation of an Islamic state.
Previously, the Islamabad government had made attempts to start negotiations with the local Taliban, but the movement refused to dialogue.
It said it would only negotiate if the authorities would take troops deployed in areas where the Taliban operate and free the detained Islamists from prisons.
Nawaz Sharif arrived in London at the World Islamic Economic Forum.
On Tuesday, 29 October, British Prime Minister David Cameron, the head of the Pakistani government and Afghan President Hamid Karzai held a tripartite meeting in London to discuss the prospects of the peace process in Afghanistan.
Oil fell to $96 per barrel.
Oil prices continued to fall on Friday as concerns about large stockpiles eclipsed a message showing China’s energy-intensive manufacturing sector is gaining strength.
The U.S. standard grade of oil in December’s supply dropped by 14 cents, and its price was $96.24 per barrel for the late morning European time in e-bids on the New York Commodity Exchange.
On Thursday, the contract fell by 39 cents, which amounted to a fall in the price for October by 5.8 percent.
Rich oil reserves have impacted its value in recent weeks.
The U.S. Department of Energy said on Wednesday that U.S. stockpiles have increased by 4.1 million barrels over the past week.
In five weeks, stocks have been replenished by more than 25 million barrels.
But on Friday, there was an indication of a possible increase in demand, judging by two reports about Chinese industry, which showed a surge in its activity.
This suggests that China’s economic recovery may continue to gain momentum after growth in the third quarter rose to 7.8 percent after the 20-year low in the previous quarter.
Brent oil — a benchmark of international oil, also used by U.S. oil refineries — has fallen by 26 cents to $108.58 per barrel on the Intercontinental Stock Exchange in London.
Head coach "Colorado" Patrick Rua, explaining the decision to release the goalkeeper Semen Varlamov from the first minutes in Friday's match with "Dallas", expressed confidence that the recent night behind bars did not shake his confidence in the Russian "Shob" from Dahl
And what can we expect, said Rua after the morning roll of Lavin.
Of course, what happened worries us all, but we are confident in him and feel that it will be useful for him to go out on the ice today.
We want him to go out on the ice and show his usual level.
So you're absolutely sure the situation didn't affect the goalkeeper's condition?
That's what we'll see tonight.
“Unquestionably, our players will support Varli by helping him protect the goal, as they did in previous games this season.
The main thing is, no one in the team is going to make any conclusions until the court understands this situation.
In Siberia, you should not be a vegan: a greenhouse tomato will not replace a soup
Why vegetarianism is not suitable for life in Siberia, found the RIA Novosti correspondent.
People who have completely abandoned animal products should not live in Siberia.
Here they do not pass the winter without losing their health, and no greenhouse tomatoes compensate them, according to Novosibirsk dietitians and doctors interviewed on the eve of Vegan Day.
Drinking oil in liters
Strict vegetarianism, when you give up not only meat and fish, but also milk, honey, eggs, becomes a fashionable way of life.
However, dietitians are confident that in Novosibirsk and other cities of Siberia to adhere to such strict norms in nutrition, at least, is not useful for health.
The complete abandonment of animal products is harmful.
Animal proteins contain essential amino acids, which are very difficult to compensate for with vegetables.
It is necessary to include at least milk or eggs in the diet," - said dietitian Marina Bogay.
It gives an example of a fish that contains essential fatty acids Omega-3.
Their richest vegetable oil is flaxseed.
"To consume it in the amounts necessary for a person, you need to drink liters!" - says the dietitian.
Doctors believe that the residents of Siberia should pay special attention to the diet in the winter.
Vegetarianism is particularly questioned this season.
In our realities, there are high demands for food.
In order not to freeze, you need a high calorie.
"If a person restricts himself to animal products, respectively, he does not get this calorie," says the expert.
This is agreed by dietitian Olga Pozniak.
She adds that imported vegetables and fruits are not an option.
It is better for a person to eat mainly foods that are grown in the region of residence or where he was born.
The genetic code is set for the best digestion and digestion of these foods.
And in winter, people do not want to bite a cucumber, but a hot soup or something more satiating," - explains the doctor's position.
According to her, from what can eat vegans, a variety of cereals, cereals, legumes, local vegetables, apples remaining in the winter, frozen berries are really useful.
But this is clearly not enough for a full-fledged diet.
According to the doctor-gastroenterologist Claudia Arifulina, the level of vitamins in Siberians in organisms is sufficient only from mid-August to mid-September.
A complete transition to vegetarianism in our harsh natural conditions, when temperatures can change by 30 degrees per day and snow lies in May, is not advisable.
The body needs energy for life, and this is, above all, fat," the doctor said.
Doctors note that veganism is especially harmful to children and pregnant women.
Children grow up, they need building material, including in the form of amino acids.
And by adhering to vegetarianism, we give them inadequate.
Pregnant women also need an increased content of protein, vitamins and trace elements in the menu.
"Vegans don't get them," God is sure.
Arifulina says that an adult is free to choose anything, “to play the toys he wants.”
He has already formed an organism, a skeleton, organs.
Children need to eat full-fledged.
If parents deprive him of some trace elements or amino acids, choosing for him what he will eat, it is simply a violation of the rights of the child.
"The lack of certain substances for the development of the brain, vision, bones will not be restored tomorrow," she says.
All surveyed medical specialists agree on the low quality of cultivated in winter in greenhouses and imported vegetables and fruits.
What is brought to us and grown in greenhouses contains less microelements we need than (grown) in open ground.
“The quality of food is not that,” God says.
Arifulina also notes that imported and greenhouse vegetables and fruits are far from ideal standards.
Sometimes the desire of producers to harvest more crops is damaging to quality.
“Apples do not turn brown on the cut, cucumbers quickly turn yellow and mold, tomatoes are tasteless and unflavoured,” the doctor cites examples, adding that they are likely to be stuffed with excess fertilizers.
And they become suppliers not of vitamins, but of fiber.
This is not agreed with the laboratory of the Siberian Physical and Technical Institute of Agricultural Problems, candidate of agricultural sciences Vera Petruk.
She says that with the right approach and compliance with all the norms and requirements, it is possible to grow full-fledged vegetables in greenhouses.
If they try to drive more out of a square meter, then, of course, and watering will become more frequent, and overfeed the plants with mineral fertilizers.
For example, when there are too many nitrogen fertilizers, tomatoes grow quickly, they are large, but watery and unsweetened,” she explains, adding that the question of quality, first of all, depends on the conscience of the producer.
The court suspended the execution of the decision on the practice of “stop-and-search” in the New York Police Department
On Thursday, the Federal District Court of Appeals suspended the execution of a court order requiring changes to the New York Police Department's "stop-and-search" program, and dismissed the judge from the case.
The second U.S. District Court of Appeals said that the execution of judge Shira Scheindlin's rulings would be suspended until the city's appeals result.
In August, the judge ruled that the city violated the constitution in how it executed the street detention and interrogation program.
The city filed an appeal against its decision and orders on corrective measures, including an order to appoint a controller to help the police station change its work practices and related training program.
On Thursday, the Court of Appeal heard a debate of the parties on a request for the suspension of the case.
The Court of Appeals said it was necessary to dismiss the judge because she violated the U.S. judges’ code of conduct and did not consider it necessary to avoid showing bias, partly because of a series of media interviews and official statements containing a public response to the court’s criticism.
The judge ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by unreasonably addressing blacks and Latinos under the “stop-and-search” program.
She has appointed an external controller to oversee the major changes that include policy, training and control reforms, and has decided to launch a pilot program to test body-mounted video cameras in those police stations where most detentions take place.
In August, New York decided to stop storing the names and addresses of people on whom cases were terminated after a police inspection.
The city’s appeal debate is scheduled to take place after March 14, 2014.
The “stop and search” tactic has been criticized by many civil rights lawyers.
The “stop search” has been practiced for several decades in one form or another, but the number of documented stops has increased dramatically under the administration of independent mayor Michael Bloomberg, reaching an absolute record in 2011 of 684,330 people, most of them black and Latino.
In 2004, four people, all members of national minorities, filed a class action lawsuit.
Proponents of changes to the Stop-and-Search program in the New York Police Department say these changes will put an end to unfair practices, form a more reliable and effective police service, and may impact how other police departments implement this practice.
Opponents argue that the changes will reduce the fighting spirit of the police, rather than the level of crime, will lead to unnecessary spending of money and will not solve the more global problem of difficult conditions in the police due to the reduction in the number of officers by several thousand over the last decade.
The judge noted that it does not stop the “stop-and-search” practice, which complies with the constitution, but changes the way the New York police stop people.
In the area of the Tretyakov Gallery opened a pedestrian zone
A new pedestrian zone has emerged in Moscow.
It is located in the area of the Tretyakov Gallery and occupies a section two kilometers from the metro station "Novokuznetskaya" to Bolotnay Square.
Street lamps, flowerbeds, benches, urns and toilets have been installed throughout, deaf fences and illegal advertising have been removed.
In addition to the Klimentovsky and Lavrushinsky alleys, which were already pedestrianized, five streets were closed to cars - Ordinsky stop, Big and Small Tolmachevsky alleys, Kadashevskaya embankment and Bolotnaya square.
The traffic on the streets of Marosejka and Petrovka is not limited.
On the section of Friday Street from the lobby of the station "Novokuznetskaya" to Klimentovsky street, conditions for pedestrians were created without removing traffic and cutting the roadway, newsmsk.com reports.
Within the pedestrian zone were the Tretyakov Gallery, the temple of the Holy Martyr Clement of the Pope of Rome, museums, libraries, monuments and other attractions.
Previously, the Tver Passage, Stoleshnikov Alley and Kuznetsky Bridge were completely pedestrianized.
The Greater Dmitrovka, where the pedestrian zone opened in early September, is decided to close for cars on weekends and holidays.
Coulson resorted to phone hacking to check a confidential message
Former News of the World editor Andy Coulson allegedly used “telephone theft, surveillance and confrontation” in an attempt to confirm false information about the novel by Charles Clarke, who was then the interior minister.
Prosecutor, Royal Attorney Andrew Eddis told the Old Bailey Court that in May 2005, News of the World received unreliable news that Clark was dating his “attractive special counsel” Hannah Polby.
The newspaper instructed private detective Glenn Mulcair to hack into Polby's voicemail and watched her at home for an interview, but Coulson also called her and left voicemails, the court heard.
“The prosecution believes that Mr. Coulson, who is now the editor of NotW, is not the kind of person who will stand next to someone’s house hoping to catch someone by surprise, he is the kind of person who likes to offer history to people to see what they say,” Eddy said.
He said News of the World used three ways to investigate stories: phone hacking, surveillance, and confrontation.
The editor is personally involved in the third.
Apparently, he knows about the second, about surveillance, he just has to.
What about the first one?
Does he know about the phone hack?
He says no, we say, “Oh, yes!”
Rumors about Clark’s novel first caught the attention of News of the World when a source sexually interested in Mrs. Polby was told, “Don’t waste your time, she’s with Charles.”
A cassette of voice messages received from her phone at least three times was taken from Mulcair's house in August 2006.
Investigators also found footage on a private investigator’s computer in which Ms. Polby and her sister appeared as “Projects.”
During the time she was under surveillance, Ms. Polby's grandmother and grandfather received anonymous calls asking for information about her, Mr. Edis said.
At that time, former chief reporter Neville Turlbeck and former reporter James Weserup were monitoring Mrs. Polby's movements.
Leaving her a voicemail on June 18, 2005, Coulson said: "I have a story that we plan to publish tomorrow and that I would very much like to discuss with Charles."
Mr. Eddis said that Coulson’s involvement in this story was based on the same scenario as with other influential people, such as former Home Secretary David Blanchett.
The jury heard on Thursday that Coulson had entered into a confrontation with Mr. Blanchett about a romance with a married woman while he himself was dating his correspondent Rebecca Brooks, who was then married.
Coulson and Brooks deny colluding with other people for the purpose of hacking phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcair, Turlbeck and Weserup confessed to hacking phones.
Snowden says he is ready to talk to the German authorities about the wiretapping case
Former CIA officer Edward Snowden expresses his readiness to come to Germany as soon as he has a legal opportunity to do so, and to meet with representatives of the German authorities.
A letter from a former CIA official to the German authorities at a meeting with journalists in Berlin on Friday was presented by Bundestag MP Hans-Christian Strebele, through whom Snowden passed the message to the German authorities.
Sztrebele met Snowden in Moscow on the eve.
As a result of the fire in Tverskaya street injured four people
As a result of the fire in the collector in the center of Moscow, on Tverskaya Street, four passers-by were injured.
According to Interfax, citing a source in the emergency services, one of the victims was hospitalized.
According to the source, the victims were passers-by, who were during the fire in the smoked underground passage.
As RIA Novosti writes with reference to the head of the capital’s Department of Fuel and Energy Economy, Pavel Livinsky, the electricity supply is currently fully restored in all houses on Tverskaya Street.
The fire in the heat collector near the house 15 on Tverskaya Street occurred in the evening of October 31.
From the hatches of the rainwater sewerage went a strong smoke, and in the underground passage, located near the store "Armenia", smoke formed.
As a result of the fire, 11 houses on Tverskaya Street were destroyed.
At 21:45 Moscow time the fire was eliminated.
U.S. cuts food allowance for poor
Food allowance for a family of four is reduced by $36 per month
Since Friday, the financial provision of food stamps, known as food stamps, has been decreasing in the U.S. as the corresponding government program ends.
The food allowance for a family of four will now be $36 less per month than before, officials say.
This will affect the 47 million poorest Americans.
According to Reuters, in the 2012 financial year, the allowance per person was on average $133 per month.
Food aid spending in the U.S. has risen to $80 billion a year due to rising unemployment and food prices.
Approximately 14% of Americans rely on free food aid issued on “food stamps” that bear that name since earlier times when they were in the form of paper coupons.
When the current economic crisis began, the program was expanded to stimulate economic growth and help the poorest Americans.
Republicans in Congress, however, demand further cuts in funding for the program, saying it should be aimed at helping those who need it more than others.
Grocery store owners across America are concerned that cuts will lead to lower consumer spending.
U.S. lawmakers continue to argue about how to further cut government funding.
Blizzard Releases 19-Year-Old Platformer for Free
Blizzard released its platformer Blackthorne in 1994 for free.
This is reported by WoW Insider.
According to him, the game has become available on Battle.net in the classic games section of Blizzard.
However, some gamers note that at the moment it can only be downloaded by users whose accounts belong to the American part of the service.
The game is not yet available to Russian users.
According to the media, the version that Blizzard has now released on the PC is not different from the original version of the game.
The soundtrack to Blackthorne also remained unchanged.
The Blackthorne platformer, which Blizzard released 19 years ago, originally came out on the SNES console.
His events unfolded on the planet Tuul, whose inhabitants were divided into dark and light kingdoms.
Once the dark ruler Sarlak decided to kill the bright king of Vlaros and become the sole ruler of the planet.
The main character of the game is the son of Vlaros Kyle, who was saved from death by sending to Earth.
Twenty years later, he returned to Tul to fight Sarlak's forces and protect the planet's inhabitants from them.
The original Blackthorne was the first game the studio released after renaming it Blizzard Entertainment.
Previously, it was called Silicon & Synapse.
The publisher of Blackthorne was Interplay.
There will be new machines in the Moscow metro.
But selling tickets to passengers they will not be for money, but for seating.
One trip worth 30 rubles will cost a potential passenger in 30 seats.
The number of seats will be calculated by a special device with the help of modern technologies, reports ITAR-TASS with reference to the press service of the Olympic Committee of Russia.
The first device will be installed at the station "Exhibition" on November 8, 2013.
The presentation of the new ticket athletes will be hosted by the President of the Olympic Committee of Russia Alexander Zhukov and Olympic champions gymnasts Alexei Nemov and Elena Zamolodchikova.
National Security Agency’s Acknowledgements Strengthen Corporations’ Paranoia About State Surveillance
On a warm day in late August, a German police helicopter flew low above the US consulate in Frankfurt, Germany’s financial capital.
According to the instructions of the Federal Service for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), the internal intelligence service of Germany, his task was to photograph the roof of the US office building, which is less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
German media say the BfV hoped to detect antennas of eavesdropping devices, and these actions resulted in negotiations between the United States and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin.
In September, James Clapper, the director of U.S. National Intelligence, again assured that the U.S. does not use external intelligence capabilities “to steal the commercial secrets of foreign companies in the interests of U.S. companies in order to increase their international competitiveness or increase their profits.”
But since Edward Snowden, a contract employee who became a whistleblower, began publishing his treasury of U.S. intelligence secrets, European governments and corporate executives are no longer sure whether the director can be trusted.
Reports that the U.S. National Security Agency was tracking Brazilian oil company Petrobras and gaining access to data held by U.S. cloud service providers, including Google and Yahoo, have elevated the paranoia of corporations caused by state surveillance to new heights.
The last drop was the news that Chancellor Angela Merkel’s phone had been auditioned for perhaps ten years.
If the most influential person in Europe can become a target, then, of course, the potential targets are also business leaders.
Snowden made it clear that there was intensive cooperation between the U.S. intelligence services and the companies.
I think it is very likely that these data are being used for mutual benefit.
“Germany needs to wake up,” says Oliver Green, president of BITMi, which represents Germany’s small and medium-sized IT companies.
German companies are convinced that the U.S. now poses almost the same risk as China in the field of industrial espionage and data theft, according to a study published in July by EY.
In all the documents disclosed by Mr. Snowden, however, there was still no evidence that the U.S. was passing on the commercial secrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
Politicians expressed concern that the EU lacks certain information technology and Internet capabilities, and expressed the view that it should try to reduce its dependence on the US.
Businessmen are skeptical about this.
Someone in the German parliament is saying that we should create a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again...
“This is not an option,” says Gasso Plattner, president of a German software company for the SAP business.
If there is a need for a powerful European IT industry, it should not have been allowed to die more than 20 years ago.
Everything is subsidized in Germany: from coal to cars and farmers.
Everything except the IT industry.
Yet the coverage and technical development of U.S. espionage agencies, made known through Snowden’s revelations, has been a shock to some companies that previously thought China posed the greatest risk of surveillance.
A major shift is taking place in cloud technologies, where European company executives are better aware that data stored in the U.S. is in the same jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to a study conducted by the trade association Cloud Security Alliance, about 10 percent of its non-U.S. participants declined plans to use the services of a U.S.-based cloud provider after the disclosure of the U.S. program for the intelligence analysis of data Prism.
Jim Snaeb, one of SAP’s CEOs, said: “We see consumers asking a new question that didn’t arise a year ago, namely, where my data is stored and can you guarantee that they will physically remain in this jurisdiction.”
Many German leaders claim that the latest reports are just confirmation of what they already knew: powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets, and therefore these data must be protected at all costs.
Economic espionage is unsurprising.
He always had a place.
“This has been the subject of discussion for many years and has not changed significantly in the current controversy,” said Kurt Bock, CEO of BASF.
The Americans are spying on us at the commercial and industrial level, and we are spying on them too, because it is in our national interest to protect our commercial enterprises.
Corporate leaders usually do not like to brag about the retaliatory measures they have taken, as this can provide an advantage to the opponent.
In large companies, it has long been the idea that taking a free flash drive at the exhibition or leaving a laptop unattended in a hotel room is, at least, careless.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of Audi’s board of directors, says it has been a standard practice for many years to collect mobile phones before board meetings so they can’t be used as eavesdropping devices.
The Federal Service for the Protection of the Constitution of Germany recommends that company executives consider the use of simple prepaid mobile phones during foreign travel due to the vulnerability of smartphones.
Prepaid mobile phones are later discarded.
However, there are concerns that small and medium-sized companies remain vulnerable to hacking and surveillance.
In Germany, many such companies are leaders in the world market in their particular niche.
“Small and medium-sized companies often lack the experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect corporate secrets from unauthorized access,” the BfV said in a statement.
The U.S. warns its own companies about economic espionage by other countries.
A U.S. national intelligence summary in February placed France, along with Russia and Israel, in the second rank of hackers for economic intelligence, after China, The Washington Post claims.
A member of the board of directors of a prestigious German company confirmed that when it comes to economic espionage, “the French are the worst of all.”
Bernard Scarsini, the former head of the French internal intelligence agency DCRI, reportedly said in an interview this month: “The services know perfectly well that all countries, even when they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, are spying on their allies.”
The parents of a teenager from Georgia, who died of a "crazy accident", believe that their son was killed
The parents of a Georgian teenager whose body was found inside a folded sports mat in his high school gym believe their son was killed, a family lawyer said on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson of the city of Valdosta, Georgia, was found on January 11 in a vertical matte sheltered behind the stands in his high school gym.
Lawndes County Sheriff’s Department investigators have come to the conclusion that Johnson died by tragic accident, but the family of a 17-year-old teenager disputes this.
“They are absolutely sure that their son was killed,” Benjamin Crump, a lawyer representing Kenneth and Jacqueline Johnson, told FoxNews.com.
They never believed that he died as the sheriff said.
“They believe this is contrary to logic, to the laws of physics, and to common sense,” Kramp said.
They think it's a cover-up to protect the person or people responsible for their son's death.
“They sent their son to school with a school bag, and they returned him to them in a body bag,” he said.
U.S. Attorney Michael Moore said on Thursday that he is conducting an official investigation into Johnson's death, noting that several key questions remain unanswered.
What was the cause of death?
Was his death the result of a crime?
Moore made a statement at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I'll study all the facts wherever they lead.
My goal is to know the truth.
"I hold the opinion that there is sufficient grounds" for an official investigation, he said.
Moore told reporters that the initial autopsy showed that Johnson died as a result of “positional asphyxia.”
However, the second autopsy, according to Moore, revealed another cause of death.
“There are a few issues that need to be resolved or clarified,” he said.
Moore added that if he finds enough evidence to demand a criminal or civil investigation into Johnson’s death, he will ask the FBI to conduct it.
A spokesman for the County Sheriff’s Office was not available for comment when he was approached on Thursday.
A South Georgia judge on Wednesday ordered authorities to publish all video footage of surveillance cameras viewed by investigators.
The teen’s parents said they hoped the videos contained the key to unraveling how he died.
"Spartacus": For information about persons who displayed fascist symbols
On the official website "Spartacus" appeared a statement of the Moscow club regarding the appearance on the tribune in Yaroslavl of the fascist flag.
"At the cup match between Shinnik and Spartak on October 30, unknown provocateurs at the stadium in Yaroslavl demonstrated fascist symbolism.
We appeal to all who have reliable information about the persons who committed this criminal offence, with a request to provide it to the <0x3C>security service of FC Spartak-Moskva" at the e-mail address fcsmsec<0x40>spartak.com.
"Reward is guaranteed," the statement said.
We are looking for fans who hung the fascist flag in Yaroslavl
In the match 1/16 final of the Cup of Russia "Shinnik" - "Spartak" was interrupted several times due to riots on the stands.
Also on the fan sector "Spartacus" was demonstrated fascist symbolism.
In the form of punishment "Spartacus" can hold about three matches without spectators.
A committee meeting will be held on Friday.
If you have information about who carried and displayed this symbol, please contact us.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Issued Recommendations for Schools on Allergy in Children
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published a list of recommendations for the control of food allergies in children in schools.
This is the first list of such recommendations issued by the U.S. government as the number of school-age children suffering from food allergies increases.
One in 20 children in the United States has a food allergy.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that the prevalence of food allergies among children increased by 18 percent from 1997 to 2007.
The guide provides information for schools on how to raise awareness among teachers and support staff about food allergies in children and how to provide assistance in the event of an allergic reaction.
It also recommends schools to keep stockpiles of adrenaline—most often used for injections, the EpiPen automatic medical syringe—to help with potentially deadly anaphylaxis.
The state legislatures have recently amended the regulation to allow schools to make adrenaline reserves with less difficulty.
The notification also contains a list of typical symptoms described by children who have had an allergic reaction.
Children may say, “It feels like something is about my tongue,” “It feels like I have hair on my tongue,” or “The tongue pinches.”
Parents of intersex children may choose “uncertain sex”
Germany became the first European country to recognize the third sex in children born with intermediate-type external genitals.
Newborns will no longer necessarily be attributed to male or female gender.
The new law does not require parents to name any gender of such children, allowing parents to indicate gender as “uncertain” or “unspecified” in their birth certificates.
The purpose of the law was to remove pressure from parents who can make hasty decisions about the operation to assign sex to newborns, and to counteract discrimination against intersex people.
An intersex man, according to the BBC, said many years later, “I’m not a man and I’m not a woman.”
I will remain a doctor-created sliver with bruises and scars.
About one in 2,000 children born each year is neither a boy nor a girl.
They have intersexuality, one of about 60 pathological conditions that fall under the diagnosis of “sexual development disorders” – a collective term for people with atypical chromosomes, gonads (ovaries or seminals) or unusually developed external genitals.
Wallis Simpson may have been intersex.
Gender identification has not yet been sufficiently studied, but most experts in the United States say that if the gender cannot be determined, it is better to take advantage of all the available information and assign it than to wait and track the psychological and physical development of the child before performing the operation, if at all.
New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Dresser, who specializes in gender identity issues, said the new German law “sounds like a good idea.”
Intersex children create an ethical dilemma.
“Some people have life-threatening disorders that require surgical intervention, but most children don’t,” he said.
You can assign a gender without surgery and then see how the personality develops.
The science of how a child develops a gender identity is not very accurate.
No one can answer the questions about why this is happening.
It’s like a mystery about why people are gay.
A report sent to the European Commission in 2011 describes intersex people as different from transsexual or transgender people because their condition is not related to gender, but to their biological structure, which does not correspond exclusively to either male or female sex, and is typical for both of them at the same time or insignificantly.
These characteristics may manifest in secondary sexual characteristics such as muscle mass, hair distribution, breast and body composition; primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals, or in the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
The report also provides an overview of the discrimination faced by intersex and transgender people in employment, as well as the level of harassment, cruelty and prejudice-based crime.
Boys with gender discrepancies now have a special camp.
Australia and Nepal are already allowing adults to include a male, female or “third gender” in their official documents.
In June, the 52-year-old resident of Australia, Norrie May-Walby, became the first person in the world to be recognized as "sexless" by defending in court the right to maintain "indefinite" sexual status for life.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, in German passports will be used a third designation in addition to M and F - X, that is, intersex.
In neighbouring France, gender issues are still causing controversy, according to a news release on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of lawmakers from France, this vividly Catholic country, signed a petition to remove “gender theory” from school textbooks.
The American Catholic Online website also expressed its disagreement with German law, writing that “in a situation where the world is drawn into a new state where sex is the subject of choice and sexual activity is not, we are reversing two more pillars of civilization.”
A mother of a newborn child from Maryland also told the Baby Zone website that she would prefer that children be given sex at birth.
“Growing a child is hard enough and without additional restrictions, especially if you don’t know your child’s gender,” she told the parenting website.
Children need stability and confidence.
Historically, children born with male and female genital organs were called hermaphrodites, after a beautiful Greek god who had both genders.
And just a decade ago, the medical community saw gender as a sheet on which everything could be erased and then painted again.
But now many are challenging the ethical grounds for surgical surgery, knowing that gender identity is complicated, and doctors sometimes make the wrong choice, not knowing how the child will perceive the sex assigned to him as he grows up.
“In the mid-20th century, this was called an ‘urgent psychiatric case,’” Drescher said.
When such children were born, you did not call a psychiatrist – you called a surgeon.
The dominant theory of how to treat children with intermediate genitals was proposed by Dr. John Manny of Johns Hopkins University, who believed that gender is easily changeable.
He coined the term “gender identity” and argued that environmental signals, including social signals—the way parents raise a child—interact with the child’s genes and hormones, determining whether a person would consider himself a man or a woman.
But in one case in 1966, known as John/Joan, his theories were questioned.
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis was damaged during negligent circumcision to completely castrate the child, also removing his testicles, and to raise him as a girl.
“Many presented the case as a successful example of a transition, but that was not the case,” Drescher said.
When the boy was about 15 years old, he again became a boy and married a woman.
At the age of 38, he committed suicide.
Dresser said some doctors are still “applying this model.”
But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, people who underwent these gender-change operations declared themselves “dissatisfied with the result.”
This was the case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with male XY chromosomes but intermediate genitalia.
The doctors could not determine with certainty whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis, and were convinced that he would never be able to live a “full life” of a man.
So shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce's external genital organ and testicles were surgically removed, and he was raised as a girl.
He was given female hormones at the age of 12.
“I knew I wasn’t a girl,” he told ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was very difficult to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he was given a vaginoplasty.
But being depressed and realizing that something was wrong, he demanded medical records.
What he learned was awful.
I was sterilized at birth, and no one ever told me about it.
Bruce was born with a sexual development disorder that prevented his body from producing enough testosterone for normal development of the genitals.
Having learned the truth, he again became a man, getting injections of testosterone and removing his breasts.
The operation rendered him infertile.
Today, he advocates for others in an organization called the Interface Project, trying to normalize the perception of people with intersexuality.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, executive director of California’s Advocates for Informed Choice, is concerned that German law “encourages labels and stigma.”
“Many activists are concerned that the German law will prompt parents to make a hasty decision and give the child an ‘uncertain sex’,” she said.
We are afraid that it will facilitate the intervention.
We think it is better to assign a male or female gender, and then wait.
But we have not yet seen how this law will manifest itself, so all we can do is build assumptions.
Tamar-Mattis said her organization supports Australian law because it “allows adults to make choices in favor of the third sex.”
“Adults should be able to make their own decisions about formal sexuality,” she says.
German law implies its appropriation at birth.
This is a battle that young children should not enter at this stage.
When they grow up, they will be able to make decisions about their own body.
But Dr. Arlin Barac, a Pittsburgh-based mammologist and x-rayer who has a daughter with a sexually impaired development and who helps hundreds of other people in the support group, said the German law would “support” both parents and children.
Barac’s daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but she has a sexual development disorder called “complete androgen insensitivity syndrome.”
Because her androgen receptors don’t work properly, Katie has developed female traits.
She has a vagina, but no uterus and ovaries.
At the age of 29, Katie is married and attends the Pediatric Psychiatry Ordinary School at the University of Pennsylvania.
Despite the fact that she is infertile, she hopes to become a parent through adoption or gestational surrogacy.
“The law gives parents time not to make hasty decisions themselves,” Barac said.
It gives them time to do some analysis and understand the situation, as well as a time interval before they write a “male” or “female.”
In this case, you are okay - you raise a child, you love a child.
You have a wonderful baby, and you feel joy.
We don't need to rush into an operation that's irreversible.
“This allows children to participate in the decision and eliminates the excitement that drives parents because they don’t feel they’re doing the right thing,” she said.
In the end, the child will decide which sex he or she is more comfortable with, and that is wonderful.
This gives children the opportunity to make their own decisions.
Chicago goalkeeper Nikolai Habibulin stressed: he understands that he should play better.
According to the 40-year-old Russian, he will continue to work hard at training.
In the last two meetings of the "Hawks" Habibulin first missed six washers from the "Tampa Bay", and then four - from the "Ottawa", and in the second game he was replaced after the fourth washer missed.
We have to play well, and in the last two games I have failed to do so," said Habibulin.
“I need to find confidence in training, it’s probably worth approaching them as games, and try to achieve a better result.
You have to study your past games and work on the shortcomings that have been.
There are a few small components that I need to improve, but at workouts I feel quite decent.
But for some reason, after a few heads, everything turns into some kind of snowball.
Maybe I need to relax a little bit.
The goalkeepers – I don’t think I’m the only one – always try to have the perfect game.
If I miss four, five, six, I'm not thrilled.
It doesn't matter what happens at my door.
I'm still working on myself so I don't miss out on so many washes.
It’s great that my teammates support, but in principle it’s simple: I have to play better.
“Two games are not the whole season, but I wanted to have them a lot better.
But what happened happened.
I have to put it aside.
I’ll just try to play the next game better.
There was a flight bus in Altai.
In the Rubtsovsky district of Altai region, the PAZ flight bus turned.
As a result of the accident, according to the specified data, 13 people were injured, the regional office of the Ministry of Health reported.

Medvedev expects SSJ-100 aircraft to be delivered to Europe
Russia expects that after fixing in the markets of Latin America and Asia, Superjet 100 aircraft will be delivered to Europe.
"We expect that in total we will receive such arrangements for more than 170 copies of aircraft of this type", - quotes "Interfax" the words of the Prime Minister of Russia Dmitry Medvedev, said by him at a press conference with the Prime Minister of France Jean-Marc Eyro.
The head of the Russian government noted that serious cooperation has been established with French colleagues, as this is a joint project.
We discussed some financial issues that are related to insurance today, but we hope that once this aircraft is strengthened in Latin America and the Asia-Pacific markets, it will also be delivered to our partners in Europe.
“I hope that it will someday be delivered to France,” the Russian prime minister said.
The SSJ-100 is an aircraft built by Sukhoi Civil Aircraft in partnership with Alenia Aermacchi.
The liner is designed based on modern technologies and offers high standards of quality and comfort in the segment for 100 passenger seats.
Energetics of Dnipropetrovsk started a unique program to save... nests of ashtrays
In the old days, to lead to the court of the aist, the peasants on a high pole installed a wheel from a cart, and a heavy nest held well on it.
Such special supports have not been put for a long time, so the oaks loved the pillars of power lines - interwoven branches rely on wires, so that the real house is reliable.
Grandmother Anya, near whose house in the village of Ivanovka Petrikovsky district for twenty years lives a real family, began to notice how the nest settles, despite all the efforts of its inhabitants.
Birds lay new branches from above, and the lower layer has already slipped between the wires, it is about to collapse.
Of course, unfortunately, the family of aphists, who every year nestled in the yard, brought out and fed three or four chicks during the summer, but also do not want to stay without light.
As soon as the birds flew to the warm edges, Grandmother Anya called the Tsarichansky REC, which owns the support.
I didn’t expect them to react so quickly.
When our specialists arrived in Ivanovka, they were surprised that the nest still holds, - said the technical director of DTEK "Dneproblenergo" Sergey Berezovsky.
Corrosion began on the wires, which were, in fact, already inside the socket, weighing 150 - 200 kilograms.
At any moment, the birds could die from electrical discharge.
Local residents also risked losing their light due to damage to the wires.
Therefore, the linear mounters began the operation to save the nest, and this is not the first time in our practice.
The scientists-ornithologists from Dnepropetrovsk National University, who developed a scheme for the transfer of the nest, helped.
They also conducted trainings for the employees of the district networks.
The famous Dnipropetrovsk ornithologist Alexander Ponomarenko advised energy engineers at all stages of the reconstruction of the nests.
To begin with, it was estimated that there are more than 50 true "apartments" in the area in a state of emergency.
For their reconstruction, special metal platforms resembling a funnel were welded.
The base was braided with velvet branches, and then the old nest was moved there.
According to experts, it is enough to lay old branches as a basis for the birds to recognize the nest and return to it.
After that, they will build their own homes.
A month ago, the first nest was reconstructed in the village of Peschanka in Novomoskovsky district.
A new reinforced concrete pillar was placed next to the electrical base and a platform with an old, already inhabited nest was placed on it.
The entire operation cost energy workers nine thousand hryvnia.
And the other day the same new settlement took place in the village of Ivanovka Petrikovsky district in the yard of grandmother Ani.
Here the platform was fixed in the same place, just lifted over the wires.
Ornithologists are confident that cautious, conservative birds will not even notice in the spring that their "apartment" has undergone major repairs.
By the end of the year, the same reconstruction awaits four more nests in the Pokrovsk and Tsarichan districts of Dnipropetrovsk.
By the way, while some save rare birds, others mercilessly kill them.
The other day, the whole region flew sad news - in the village of Ust-Kamenka Apostolovsky district, on the day of the opening of the hunt for pheasants, poachers for entertainment shot the swan family, who lived in the local pond.
Noble birds were not afraid of people at all - the locals fed them and did not offend them.
When the villagers heard the gunshots, they rushed to the pond, four beautiful swans were already lying dead on the water.
Now the employees of the Apostolic Rayon of the police find out who shot the birds recorded in the Red Book.
The Russian March is becoming more popular.
On November 4, on the Day of People’s Unity, the “Russian March” will be held in Moscow.
According to the Levada Center survey, support for the Russian marches is growing - 40% of citizens to various degrees approve of the idea of carrying them out.
According to the Levada Center, 40% of citizens to varying degrees approve of the Russian marches: 11% of them are definitely positive and 29% are "rather positive".
The popularity of the idea of "Russian Marches" is gradually increasing - in 2006, these actions welcomed only 14% of Russians, and in December 2010, the holding of such events already supported twice the number of citizens (28%).
"Definitely negative" to "Russian Marches" only 7% of Russians, "preferably negative" - 19%.
Another 35% could not formulate their attitude to this action.
This year, the Moscow City Hall agreed to hold a “Russian March” of up to 15,000 people in Lublin, the head of the security department of the capital, Alexey Mayorov, said today.
Nationalists have been celebrating National Unity Day every year since 2005.
To the question of sociologists "Have you heard that on November 4 in Russia are held "Russian Marches" under the slogans of the protection of the rights of Russians in Russia?" three quarters (75%) of citizens answered in the negative.
Currently, only one in five Russians (20%) are aware of this action.
It is noteworthy that in December 2010 almost a third of the citizens (31%) were heard about the “Russian Marches”.
Recall that three years ago, on December 11, a natural rally of nationalists took place in Manege Square, which turned into mass riots.
Levada-center also asked the Russians about what holiday is celebrated on November 4.
In two years, the number of people who know the correct answer (National Unity Day) has increased from 41% to 49%.
However, only 15% of citizens are going to celebrate this holiday.
Approximately the same (17%) intend to celebrate the October Revolution Day on November 7.
The majority of citizens (62%) are not going to celebrate any of these holidays.
How the Moscow City Hall coordinated the “Russian March” in Lublin
On October 28, the capital authorities agreed to hold the "Russian March" on November 4 in Lublin.
This was reported by the leader of the association "Russian", organizer of the march Dmitry Demushkin.
In addition to the march in Lublin on the Day of People’s Unity, there will be a rally and a rock concert of the group “Kolovrat”, also agreed with the authorities.
How was the "Russian March-2012"
On National Unity Day in 2012, nationalists marched from the Yakimanskaya embankment to the artist’s Central House, where the rally took place.
The organizers estimated the number of participants in 20,000 people, the Ministry of Internal Affairs called the figure of 6,000.
Obama's Pre-election Staff Considered Biden's Exclusion in Favor of Hillary Clinton
According to The New York Times, President Barack Obama’s closest advisers were secretly considering replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton in the 2012 election list.
This discovery is the brightest sensation in all of Mark Galperin’s and John Heilemann’s 2012 campaign Double Bets: The Game Has Changed 2012.
The Times received a copy of the book in preparation and said Thursday evening that the president’s closest aides had conducted “large-scale research into focus groups and public opinion polls at the end of 2011” to assess whether Biden’s exclusion could help raise the waning hopes for re-election.
According to The Times political commentator Jonathan Martin, the book gives a detailed description of the attempts of senior officials of the Pre-election Staff and the White House, namely former White House administration chief Bill Daley, to assess what effect the appointment of the former Vice-Secretary of State will have on the vote.
The possible replacement was a secret, carefully guarded in the Chicago election headquarters and the Oval Office.
Only six of the president’s closest advisers — including Daley, former President Obama’s Chief of Staff Jim Messina, and former White House senior advisers David Axelrod and David Pluff — knew the replacement was under consideration.
The book Double Bets claims that Daley was the initiator of an attempt to replace Biden, despite their "close personal relationship", but eventually abandoned that step when their data showed that adding Clinton to the ballot box would not "significantly improve Obama's chances".
In an interview with Martin Daley, he confirmed that the administration was indeed considering replacing Biden Clinton.
“I actively advocated a lot of things, and that was one of them,” Daley told the newspaper.
You must remember that the president was in terrible shape at the time, so we thought, ‘Oh my God, what are we going to do?’
Although Daley described the study as a “necessary verification,” Martin told CNN spokesman Anderson Cooper that the election staff had invested enough in exploring whether the move would bring dividends to the vote.
“Election staffs don’t spend such amounts of money on polls and focus groups unless they take something seriously,” Martin said in the AK 360 program.
It is unclear, however, whether Obama knew that his team was considering a replacement.
Martin told CNN that he asked Daley if his then boss knew about the possible crossover.
Although Daley said he didn’t think the president “was aware” of a possible replacement, the former head of the administration admitted that “maybe” Obama knew.
Martin added that Double Bets does not give a clear answer to the question of whether the results of the political survey have reached Obama’s table.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously believed that Obama was unaware of the study of the possibility of excluding Biden from the electoral roll.
“Maybe,” Martin said.
Do you want a glow in the dark ice cream?
A British entrepreneur created the world’s first darkly lit ice cream using jellyfish.
Charlie Francis used the fluorescent properties of a marine animal to develop luminous food.
He came up with this idea after reading a scientific paper on jellyfish and convinced scientists in China to chemically recreate the luminous protein.
Ice cream reacts with the tongue of the person who eats it, increasing the pH level of the protein and making it glow.
Chris says that as the ice cream begins to shine when it reacts to the heat of your mouth, it means that the more you lick, the brighter it becomes.
Charlie, founder of the “Lick Me, I’m Tasty” ice cream company, says: “It’s an incredible thing, but still in the very early stages when it comes to manufacturing, so for <0xC2><0xA3>200 you’ll get about 2 grams of substance.”
The protein we use in ice cream reacts with your tongue at a neutral pH.
Therefore, when your mouth warms up the protein, it will raise the pH level and the ice cream will start to shine.
We’ve been testing it for the past few months, and it seemed ideal to introduce it to Halloween because it creates such a wonderful luminous effect.
This is probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever made, because jellyfish fluorescence is four times more expensive than gold.
So each ball costs me about <0xC2><0xA3>140.
But it is quite pleasant to taste.
Charlie's experimental company, based in Bristol, is famous for its unusual flavors, including beer, cheese, beef and the taste of minced gold.
But his next creation should be even more ambitious.
He said, “I really want to develop an invisible ice cream.”
This is by definition not possible because of the breakage caused by the ice crystals that make up the ice cream, but I think we’ll find a way to do it.
Ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of jellyfish synthesized by Chinese scientists
"Avangard" coach Vladimir Chebaturkin, speaking about the preparation of his team for the match of the regular championship of the KHL against "Salavata", noted that Omichi carried out a thorough analysis of the defeat from the Magnetogorsk "Metallurga".
The specialist stressed that "Avangard" needs to pay more attention to the game in defense.
We watched the video of the match against Magnetogorsk "Metallurg", - quotes the official website "Avangard" the words of Chebaturkin.
- We missed a lot of washes, not a very pleasant moment.
They missed because of their mistakes, because of the failure of the game task.
We knew that the opponent had performers.
According to statistics, they had five attacks on the run - three washers scored us.
It's a very good implementation.
Were these mistakes taken into account in the preparation for today’s game?
The boys and I are carefully understanding each match, talking after the game, preparing for a new opponent.
The main thing is that the installation is done.
Everyone saw the first period of the match against the Metallurg.
The game was played and the score was 2:0.
We missed the goal "in the dressing room" - and in the third period began to be wrong.
Given how difficult the game was, there was no point in connecting the defenders.
We need to defend the whole team.
Now "Avantgarde" has a long home series, the matches go in a day - the team has accumulated fatigue?
All teams are in the same conditions.
The main thing now - the realization of their moments and the execution of the game task.
Hockey is an emotional game, if you do the installation - everything is solved not so difficult.
Due to the new rules introduced by Russian customs, hundreds of cars have been in line for almost a week at the border with Russia.
Today, Donetsk officials promised to provide drivers with drinking water and install biotoilets
Hundreds of furs accumulated at the border points at the entrance to Russia.
This situation arose due to changes in the rules of customs clearance of goods.
Ukrainian border guards and customs officers confirm: the turn is created by the Russian side, which has not warned about the innovations in advance.
From October 28, the customs authorities of Russia began to apply additional measures to guarantee the delivery of goods, - said Deputy Chief of Eastern Customs Vladimir Denisov.
The new model document is applicable in countries that have acceded to the Convention on International Carriages.
Passpoints work in a strengthened mode.
The correspondent of "FACTS" visited the border and communicated with truck drivers, who were hostages of the situation.
Prices in the off-road coffee shop at the pass point "Novoazovsk" increase every day, as well as the queue from the cars.
Trucks stand in several rows, stretching for about two kilometers.
The Novoazovsk-Veselo-Voznesenka Customs Terminal provides one of the most important transport destinations from the south of Ukraine on the international highway.
From here, the goods are sent to the Stavropol region of Russia, Kazakhstan, Georgia, Armenia.
On Sunday before midnight, they were still allowed, and after these rules were introduced, complains truck driver Alexey Golovanev (in the photo), who carries cargo from Turkey to Kazakhstan through Russia and has been sleeping in his car for almost a week.
Under the new rules, in order to cross the border, I need an additional package of documents and payment of freight insurance.
The amount depends on the cost of the cargo and the distance to which it is carried.
The minimum insurance is 4.5<0xE2><0x88><0x92>5 thousand rubles (about 1100<0xE2><0x88><0x92>1300 hryvnia).
Those who go nearby (for example, to Georgia, Armenia) with a cargo worth up to $50 thousand, pay somewhere 15 thousand rubles (3800 hryvnia) and pass.
And the rest are stuck - because no one has that much money with them!
You imagine, if the driver carries the cargo in the amount of only four thousand dollars, but even to Moscow, he needs 90 thousand rubles (almost 23 thousand hryvnia) to pay for transit!
Conditions for survival at the border - none, - are lamented by truckers who have arranged to eat near their cars.
In border shops and cafes and so always expensive, but such prices as here, we have not met anywhere!
The sellers oriented and quickly pushed them: 15 hryvnias is worth a stick, seven hryvnias - a cup of coffee, 25 hryvnias - a plate of soup.
And the coffee is one.
And there's no toilet.
We sleep in the steppe, we go to the toilet there.
No washing, no shaving...
I can not get out of the car for a week, my wife on the road prepared everything.
A week long, - comforts another truck driver Viktor Skotarenko.
Will I be able to get to my car in a week?
Why do you have one and a half liters of water? - we are interested in the only border shop.
There are 11 and 15 hryvnia.
What, a glass bottle or water tincture on silver?
We have a cafe, not a shop.
“Take while there’s something else,” said the saleswoman.
After the situation began to be covered in the media, the authorities of the region drew attention to the dire situation of Ukrainian drivers.
The leadership of the Amvrosiyev and Novoazovsky Rajosadministrations was instructed to provide drinking water to all those standing in line on the Ukrainian-Russian border, - said the acting chairman of the Donetsk Regional Administration Sergey Dergunov.
Ambulance brigades are now on duty at the checkpoints.
Also for the convenience of people, biotoilets will be installed.
According to the official, the problem related to the queues will be solved in the coming days.
As reported by the press service of the Donetsk Regional Administration, as of October 31, 32 and 68 cars were stationed at the international pass points "Uspenka" and "Novoazovsk", respectively.
“FACTS” will monitor the development of the situation.
Vilnius suspects Moscow in an attempt to defame the Lithuanian president
Russia intends to carry out information provocations against high-ranking persons of Lithuania and the countries of the Eastern Partnership - such a statement was made to the BNS agency in the Department of State Security of the Republic (DGB).
The information was published on the DELFI portal.
According to the report, in particular, Moscow is going to "discuss" Lithuanian President Dali Grybauskaite and publish falsified documents, allegedly found in the Russian State Archives, that relate to the facts from the biography of the Lithuanian leader.
According to the intelligence service, the preparation of the information attack is carried out by the department of analysis of the social processes of the administration of the President of Russia on interregional and cultural relations with foreign countries.
The structure is headed by Yevgeny Umerenkov, who visited Lithuania several times and participated in the Congress of the Lithuanian People’s Party.
Also a participant of the operation is allegedly an employee of the V. Smirnov department.
According to the intelligence service, Smirnov under the cover of scientific work until the end of 2012 regularly visited Lithuania and contacted local politicians, political scientists and representatives of the media.
Now Smirnov is forbidden to enter the territory of the country.
The previous day, the President of Lithuania, Grybauskaite, said that she knew about the information that was being prepared for her.
According to her, the main reason is the successful presidency of Lithuania in the Council of the European Union and "the country's aspiration for energy independence"
The Lithuanian leader has repeatedly criticized the actions of the Russian authorities.
She said that the Kremlin treats Lithuania "insufficiently respectful".
In addition, Grybauskaite accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of making “only demands” to Lithuania.
In September, Rospotrebnadzor suspended the import of Lithuanian "milk" into Russia.
It was reported that the quality of the products does not comply with sanitary and epidemiological norms.
The Lithuanian leader then said that if Russia does not lift the ban, the country’s government should prepare for an appeal to the WTO.
In the U.S., the school principal shot teenagers.
Directors of one of America’s high schools have literally led teenagers to despair.
The man, he said, was forced to take a gun and start shooting.
The incident took place in the state of Tennessee.
According to the New York Post, juvenile hooligans tossed a man's house with toilet paper.
Because of this, the director of the school opened a shooting at teenagers, which resulted in several injuries to the leg and arm of a 15-year-old boy.
Since the hooligans were not on the property of the director, he was charged with assault under aggravating circumstances.
The man was released from prison on bail of $125 thousand.
The shooting of civilians in the United States is becoming a terrible pattern.
The day before, a man opened fire in downtown Ridgecrest in the U.S. state of California, right on the street.
After that, the criminal took two random passers-by hostage, hid them in the trunk of the car and tried to escape.
Earlier, a shooting was opened at an elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut.
Adam’s mother worked at the school, she was an educator.
Shooting at American school: 14-year-old girl injured
Another shooting incident took place on January 31 at an American school, this time in Anlanta, Georgia.
Two people were injured: a 14-year-old student and a teacher.

Halloween 2013 in the Numbers
When I was a kid, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, it was too late to go to bed and make masquerades for our area.
Now I look more like a squirrel.
I haven’t been asked to give candy in my apartment for the last two years and probably won’t this year.
However, the statistics show that I am a white crow when it comes to Halloween.
According to the National Retail Federation, the majority of Americans — 158 million — will celebrate Halloween this year and spend a total of $6.9 billion on candy, costumes and jewelry.
The only thing I’m looking forward to every Halloween is trends.
The National Retail Federation predicts that costumes will cost $1.2 billion out of the $6.9 billion spent.
This year at the peak of fashion sexy inanimate objects.
Women no longer have to be representatives of sexual professions; they can also be sexual food, such as pizzas, hamburgers or carrots.
As for the men, I think we’ll see a lot of zombies thanks to Walking Dead, and I’m sure Daft Punk-style astronauts will be on our Instagram tapes this year.
According to Google, the most searched costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
There’s nothing wrong with the traditional approach.
We dressed our dogs last year and, to my surprise, we weren’t the only ones.
Moreover, according to the National Retail Federation, Americans will spend $330 million on pet costumes this year.
That means a lot of funny hot dogs.
When it comes to candy, we don’t shy away.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion on them this year, according to Nielsen.
That’s about <0xC2><0xA3>600m of Hershey chocolates, candies, Milk Duds candy, Twizzlers chew candy, and Clark Bar bars.
According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, this is great news for the 41 million children who are demanding candy that are preparing to conquer our areas.
What’s more, we’ll buy and – let’s not fool ourselves – eat 90 million pounds of chocolate during Halloween.
The only thing we don’t want to eat is candy in the form of corn grains; and yet, according to the National Association of Confectioners, nearly <0xC2><0xA3>35 million is sold for Halloween.
That’s about 9 billion individual corn grains.
It's a mystery I still have to solve.
Nothing expresses the essence of Halloween more than ghostly homes.
They have amazing titles, such as "Horror Behind the Walls" (which, by the way, is in a real prison), "Voy and scream" and "House of Shock".
What’s more, according to America Haunts, there are 1,200 officially recognized ghost homes in America that generate about $500 million in revenue, as well as those amazing photos where you almost described what your friend put on Facebook, and you can’t take it off, and then the guy that you’re looking at will take it off.
Finally, let's talk about pumpkins.
Charlie Brown introduced us to the Great Pumpkin when we were kids, and cutting out Jack’s lamp is like decorating a Christmas tree, what we’ve been doing since childhood.
Fortunately for us, baby pumpkin fashion only started last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us grew up cutting these pumpkins rather than sitting in them.
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Americans will spend about $106 million on pumpkins this year.
Jack’s lamp, slowly drying on your porch, probably came from the state of Illinois, which grew 542 million pounds of pumpkin this year.
If you want more difficult tasks, visit Tim and Susan Mathisdon in the city of Napa, California, and try cutting something out of their pumpkins weighing in at <0xC2><0xA3>2032.
Estonian Ministry of Defense website rebuilt after attack by Ukrainian hackers
The site of the Ministry of Defense of Estonia has been restored after the morning cyber attack, according to the press service of the department.
According to the Deputy Chancellor of the Ministry of Defense for Information and Administrative Affairs, Timar Peterkop, it was a primitive attack, the site was simply overloaded with a lot of requests.
Our specialists quickly set everything up, so far the work of the site has been restored.
"The damage to the ministry is minimal," Peterkop told Postimees.
According to Peterkop, it is too early to talk about who organized the attacks.
"We will definitely analyze the causes of the incident and make our own conclusions, but it is completely impossible to prevent such incidents," he said.
On November 1, the group Anonymous Ukraine posted on the Internet an appeal in which it confirmed the hacking attack on the Estonian Ministry of Defense website and opposed the partnership of Ukraine and NATO.
We want the NATO leadership to hear our voice, the voice of the Ukrainian people.
We should not be NATO servants.
Ukrainians do not want to die for the interests of NATO member states.
Ukraine does not need a NATO bloc.
Ukraine does not need the European Union.
Ukraine does not need Russia.
Ukraine should not be a slave to anyone.
We stand for an independent Ukraine.
"Hands away from Ukraine," Anonymous said in a statement.
Earlier, the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine reported that the company of marines of the Feodosiya separate battalion of the Ukrainian marines will take part in the command and staff exercises of the NATO Steadfast Jazz-2013 response forces.
Due to the riots, several schools and a hospital had to be closed.
Four schools in the Zimbabwean province of South Matabeleland had to be closed due to the fact that the students were attacked by... goblins.
As the local elder said, the children panicked, and it was impossible to continue classes.
The tale of the goblins may sound like a child’s invention to a European, but in Africa it is quite a serious argument for shutting down the school.
Adults are also afraid of dirty power.
In the summer, for example, in Zimbabwe, the hospital was closed due to the fact that the medical personnel were also attacked by goblins.
Announced the release of the Land Rover racing series

In addition, you can get upgraded brakes, a service package that provides access to Bowler Works mechanics, logistical support and storage between events.
Drew Bowler, Managing Director of Bowler Motorsport, said: “The rally participants addressing Bowler have changed.”
Some of them are not experienced riders, but people looking for excitement, adventure and access to world-class events.
We are delighted to offer this path in partnership with Land Rover and MSA and believe that this format offers a new way to try different rally disciplines in the UK and abroad, as well as to prepare participants for the harsh conditions and realities of the rally.
We have been delighted to develop the Defender Challenge – it will be a really exciting championship.
In addition, the Defender Challenge provides one day in February for training and testing, as well as the opportunity to take part in desert events in North Africa and the Middle East.
Russian security forces do not know anything about the group "Brothers Circle" - New News
This is written by INTERFAX.RU with reference to an informed source in the law enforcement agencies of the Russian Federation.
“After media reports of the U.S. Treasury Department’s inclusion of Leps in checklists on suspicion of belonging to the Eurasian criminal syndicate Brothers’ Circle, we looked through all the databases, but did not find such a group,” the agency’s interlocutor said.
In his opinion, the dissemination of this information contributes to the maintenance of the myth of the so-called Russian mafia, which allegedly operates abroad.
Yesterday, the U.S. Treasury Department published on its website a list of alleged members of the criminal group "Brothers Circle".
Among them was named the Russian singer Grigory Leps.
He's on the list as "Grisha" the day before.
With the data of the popular Russian performer, they coincide.
The exact name - Grigory Lepsevridze, creative pseudonym, place and date of birth are given.
In addition to Leps, there are five other people mentioned.
Two Russians, a citizen of Israel, a citizen of Uzbekistan and another native of the former USSR, whose citizenship is not indicated.
In the United States, it is believed that Gregory Leps, who lives on the island of Phuket, transported money for bandits on their order.
This message is accompanied by a photo of the singer and all his data that correspond to reality is indicated.
Moreover, Leps really recently bought a house in Phuket.
The ministry noted that they intend to impose sanctions against Leps.
The blacklisting of a person by the U.S. Treasury entails the blocking of his assets in the U.S. and the prohibition of business contacts with him by persons residing in the United States.
Leps assistant Maya Serikova said that no notifications were received to the singer: "It is difficult to answer the question whether this is Gregory, everyone is talking about now in connection with the scandal in the United States."
All Leps knows is the media.
Officially, there were no notifications to him personally, although I do not know if they are in such cases.
"And, of course, it's all, on the one hand, funny, and on the other - surprisingly and unexpectedly," she told RIA Novosti.
According to her, Grigory Leps does not live in Phuket, but, according to the U.S. Treasury, he actually owns a house on a Thai island.
She said that Leps is now on a long tour of the Far East and Siberia, and that news caught him during the flight to the city of Blagoveshchensk.
Run on the field in the match "Shinnick"
It became known some details about the personality of the fan who ran on the field during the match 1/16 final of the Cup of Russia between Yaroslavl "Shinnik" and Moscow "Spartak".
According to the head of the CDC of the Russian Federation Arthur Grigoryantz, referring to the data of the Ministry of the Interior, this fan is a Moscovite.
He is currently in detention.
In addition, Grigoryantz told about how the fan managed to break into the field: "It turns out that the given, let's call him a spectator, went to an ambulance accompanied by two spectators, citing problems with the heart.
He went to the ambulance, the ambulance doctor confirmed.
And then he pushed the two escorts away and ran to the field.
He fled from the corner of the Eastern and Southern Tribune to the corner of the Eastern and Northern Tribune.
He ran all over the field.
The stewards are responsible for that.
Until the entry into force of the law on sports, this is the area of action of stewards - the police can not interfere in what is on the field.
He ran up to the tribune, crossed the Eastern tribune.
And at this time, riots began on the Eastern Tribune and on the treadmills,” the head of the CDC said.
We will remind that by the decision of the CDC, the Moscow Spartak will hold without spectators the upcoming matches of the 15th round of the Russian championship against Lokomotiv and Zenit, and will pay a fine of 600,000 rubles.

The puppy was lucky to escape after fire teams were called to pick him up and take him to a safe place after he was somehow stuck at an altitude of 50 feet on a dangerous slope.
Ruby, a nine-month-old spaniel coker, fled after falling into a car accident on Sunday afternoon and spent three days alone before being rescued from her career on Wednesday.
Its owners, 25-year-old Scott Alderson and his 20-year-old girlfriend Becky Hall, were at Flappy's career in the city of Denholm, West Yorkshire, to reunite with Ruby, and thanked the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They feverishly searched for their missing dog and posted calls on social media sites after she ran into a career after a small accident.
At about 14:15 on Wednesday, a star dog walker spotted Ruby, stuck at an altitude of 50 feet on a leash in her career.
A technical rescue team from the Klekhiton fire station rushed to the scene of the incident, descended on ropes to rescue Ruby, and used a carry-on to lift her up the slope.
Rescue officer Andy Clayton said: “She was in a dangerous position.”
It was right in the middle of a steep slope – 50 feet to the top and to the ground.
She did not move the muscle during the rescue, she was completely frozen.
But she's fine now.
Then she ate cookies.
It was a very unusual challenge.
The fact that the dog was spotted is incredible.
Rescue officer Peter Lau said, “Ruby is very lucky to have been rescued.”
There was a chance that she could have had a very serious injury or worse.
Ruby was taken to the veterinarian for examination, and it was found that she was all right, except for exhaustion and dehydration.
Ms. Hall of Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: “Watching the rescue was terrifying.”
I couldn't believe she was even there.
It was amazing when she was in our hands again.
The veterinarian said that if she had fainted and lost consciousness, she would most likely have fallen.
The firefighters were great.
It was very brave – what they did.
We are so grateful, and each of them was absolutely amazing.
Mr. Alderson from the town of Kitley added: “We were afraid that she might fall, but she stayed there.”
The firefighters were amazing.
I just can't believe she was there.
Mick Jagger Says He Didn't Play With Katy Perry When She Was 18
During an interview on an Australian radio show this week, the pop star said she was the backing vocalist for the 2004 song "Old Habits Die Hard".
Perry said she had dinner with a veteran rocker, and noted, "He played with me when I was 18."
She added: “It was a long time ago and he was very kind.”
In a statement Thursday, a spokesman for seventy-year-old Jagger said he "categorically denies that he has ever beaten Katie Perry."
The spokesman added: “Maybe she confuses him with someone else.”
Perry was among the performers who appeared as guests on the Rolling Stones tour this year.
Her new album, Prism, debuted at number one this week.
George Kerevan: a break with Europe gives the Scottish people a choice
Another day, another fear of independence.
This time we are warned that an independent Scotland will have to join the pan-European free movement zone as a condition of membership in the EU.
There is a series of stories about passport control in Berwick and the border with a barbed wire along Adrian's shaft.
True, the newspaper Strathclyde pointed out the possible economic benefits of freer movements throughout the rest of Europe, although – as predictable – it did not appear in the headlines.
Neither has anyone pointed out that EU member states spend a lot of time turning their formal rules as they like.
Since Scotland is not now part of the Schengen area, continuing non-compliance will be a cheap concession for Brussels in exchange for what it really wanted from the Scots.
This is not a worthy story.
And so old that it became fossilized: for the first time I heard a “duck” saying that “independence means passport control” at least 40 years ago.
And yet there is an interesting moment lost in the narration of an ancient fairy tale.
Why should an independent Scotland obey the orders of Europe?
Why change the yoke of London to the yoke of Brussels, especially now?
Here is the real European news: the great post-war plan to unite Europe has finally stalled.
With the euro crisis, the project “Europe” is officially dead.
Across the European Union, parties opposing the EU or for the abolition of the euro as a single currency are gaining strength.
Even in Germany, the “Alternative for Germany” Eurosceptic party – founded only this year – emerged from nowhere and received almost five million votes in the September federal elections, essentially displacing the “Free Democrats” (the analogue of our “Liberal Democrats”) from the Bundestag.
There has always been internal opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe.
Nevertheless, the current economic crisis has become a turning point.
The austerity measures imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, and the chains imposed on national economies through the preservation of the single currency, have led many people to think that the “Europe” project has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments working with excessive budget deficits – this was true only for Greece.
In fact, the Eurosystem has blocked its members at exchange rates profitable to German exporters, which German politicians want to keep.
Without the possibility of devaluation of the national currency, southern Europe finds itself in a precarious position in terms of production capacity compared to Germany.
The only way to save is to cut wages and public spending, which is actively supported by Berlin.
Behind the current problems of budget and currency lies a deeper problem of Europe’s productive capacities.
As a result of the “green” energy package introduced by Brussels, a cipher that means subsidizing French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers, European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times more for gas than in the US.
These are paralyzingly unfavourable price conditions, as we have already seen in Grangemouth.
No freezing of wages in the world will stop the crushing victory of cheap U.S. shale gas over the European petrochemical industry.
As a result, the rebellion ripens, especially in France, once the most ferocious supporter of the EU.
After the war, the French political elite saw the EU as a way to control Germany and put Paris on par with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a means of gaining political legitimacy, and it has already imposed its own economic policy on Europe, leaving France’s ruined economy in dire straits.
The result is the right-wing anti-EU Marine Le Pen National Front party has just won crucial additional elections, dropping the ruling Socialist Party to third place.
The Front is now the most popular party in France with 24 percent of the vote – a timely warning to British Labourers that one cannot assume that the split between the right will automatically turn in favor of the left.
What does Le Pen do with its newfound popularity among the French white working class?
She wants to use the EU elections next year to create a bloc in the European Parliament against the EU and against the single currency.
If – and this is very likely – anti-EU parties get support in these elections, such a bloc will be able to take the dominant position in the European Parliament for the first time.
Here is my opinion: the soon-to-be growing sentiments against the EU and against the single currency in Europe are merging to destroy the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will once again become something of a flimsy “Europe of (sovereign) nations” liked by General de Gaulle.
Germany and several dependent economies can keep the euro, but France and southern Europe will rebuild their own currencies.
I guess the UK is distancing itself from this project, hoping to get closer to the US.
However, Washington’s growing interest in the Pacific indicates the likelihood that the UK will go unnoticed in the cold Atlantic.
In what way does this leave Scotland?
We can choose to become a region (in fact) of Little England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests, which means, among other things, sending Berlin and Brussels to hell.
I suspect that Scotland will be able to succeed within the framework of a more free European agreement, provided that we preserve our currency.
Cooperation with other like-minded countries will be easier in the non-federal Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should consider repeating Norway's experience and maintaining our economic independence.
The Scottish National Party government in Scotland is – strangely enough – the most successful political movement in Europe, directed against austerity measures, which received an impressive majority in 2011 thanks to objections to the cuts in expenditures proposed (and implemented) by the Labour Party and the Chancellor of the Treasury.
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to now vote for independence only to take the austerity measures imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early sexual maturation: aging earlier
African-American and Latino girls tend to reach sexual maturity earlier than their white peers, research shows.
Physical changes do not mean that sexual maturation is close
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are to blame.
Experts believe that the obesity epidemic may be one of the triggers of early puberty
The tendency towards early sexual maturity is not so pronounced in boys
Former CNN correspondent Pat Etterij is a journalist specializing in child health and family matters.
Should a mother be frightened if her daughter starts to form mammary glands and grow pubic hair at 7 or 8 years of age?
At the annual American Academy of Pediatrics conference this week in Orlando, Florida, pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these early physical changes are quite common among American girls and represent a new norm.
“I spend a lot of time reassuring my parents — it usually doesn’t mean a rapid onset of full sexual maturity,” Kaplowitz said.
Obvious signs of development, such as growing breasts, pubic and armpit hair, and body odor, appear earlier in girls.
But there was only a slight shift in menarche age (first menstruation) over the past four decades.
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years and has fallen from 12.75 in 1970.
“After the breast begins to develop, it goes at least two to three years before the menarche,” said Kaplowitz, who is also the author of the book “Early sexual maturation in girls: how to deal with this common problem.”
Time is the most accurate verification of how sexual maturation will progress.
There is a debate about what constitutes an actual onset of sexual maturity, but is considered “premature” when breast enlargement is accompanied by a sharp increase in growth up to 8 years.
In most cases, the process will slow down or stop – this is something that a pediatrician can monitor closely.
Faster progression can serve as a basis for tests by an endocrinologist to rule out serious problems such as tumors or cysts.
There are procedures to delay early menstruation and prevent another consequence: premature aging of bones, which can eventually lead to slow growth and low growth in adulthood.
Recommendations for drug or hormone therapy are based on the child’s age, developmental level, growth rate and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is cautious with medications, but admits that “suppression of sexual maturation can alleviate the behavioral problems and feelings of girls that they are different from peers.”
Another big problem is clear: parents just don’t want their very young daughters to have menstruation.
“They worry about the risk of pregnancy or even how they will handle hygiene issues,” Kaplowitz said.
“It was a shock,” recalls one woman whose daughter began menstruation at the age of 10.
Although there were signs and we were talking about menstruation, she wasn’t emotionally ready.
She came home from school frightened and upset that she was the first of her friends.
There are many popular theories about the causes of early sexual maturation.
However, there is no consistent evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment, or sexual messages in the media are to blame.
In boys, as in girls, sexual maturation occurs earlier.
Kaplowitz argues that the prerequisite that has the greatest weight is an obesity epidemic.
In 2001, he helped conduct a study of girls between the ages of 6 and 9, which linked the amount of fat in the body to the period of puberty.
Other data support this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.
In this country, African-American and Latino girls tend to reach sexual maturity earlier than their white peers.
There are different explanations.
All over the world, early sexual maturation appears to be influenced by everything from economic conditions and climate to genes.
Another mystery: although boys have facial and pubic hair at a younger age, the tendency towards full early puberty is not as pronounced as in girls.
Other doctors attending the AAP conference confirmed the complexity of the topic.
The appearance of acne and pubic hair occurs even in infants and children of crib age.
“We need to be careful about how we define the true onset of sexual maturity,” said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a paediatric endocrinologist at Gorieb Children’s Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not be shy about receiving instructions from a pediatrician on how to talk to their child.
“This could mean a conversation earlier than expected,” Kaplowitz said.
If you remain calm, your child will usually respond well.
Girls who bloom early need confirmation that even when it happens earlier than usual, this process is a normal part of life.
U.S. Boeing stranded in Chita prepares to take off
The U.S. aircraft that carried out observation flights over the territory of Russia under the Open Skies Treaty and made an unplanned landing in Chite on Friday, November 1, at 8:30 Moscow time will leave the city’s air port.
The management of the airport allowed the departure of the ship, receiving money for fuel.
As reported at the airport, the plane will fly to Ulan-Ude.
According to other reports, he will go to the United States.
According to reports, the plane flying to Ulan-Ude landed in the Trans-Baikal region due to the fog.
Due to unpaid bills, he was not released from Chita airport.
There are 30 people on board the plane, including the crew, and they spent two nights at the airport, Itar-Tass reports.
According to the Russian Foreign Ministry, under the terms of the Open Skies Treaty, people on board the aircraft are not allowed to go outside Chita airport, they can pass border controls only at two airports of Russia - in Cuba and in Ulan-Ude.
The Open Skies Treaty was signed in 1992, with 34 states participating.
Observation flights are carried out over the territories of Russia, the United States, Canada and European countries.
The main objectives of the Treaty are the development of transparency, the facilitation of monitoring of the implementation of arms control agreements, the enhancement of the capacity to prevent crises and to resolve crisis situations within the framework of the OSCE and other international organizations.
How much do the deceased celebrities earn - MK in the U.S. MK
The highest-income live celebrity rating in 2013 was led by Madonna, who earned $125 million.
But she was "spiced" by the late Michael Jackson, whose posthumous income from October 2012 to October 2013 amounted to 160 million.
There are other celebrities who have left their lives behind, who in the past year "earned" several times less.
The second in the list of the most "influential" celebrities left, compiled by Forbes magazine at the end of the year was Elvis Presley - 55 million per year, and the bottom line is Peanuts comic book author Charles Schultz with 37 million.
In addition to them, the top five included Elizabeth Taylor, who was last year the leader (25 million), and musician Bob Marley (18 million).
The list also included Marilyn Monroe, John Lennon and Albert Einstein.
The first boutique of Igor Gulyaev opened in Moscow
On October 23, the opening of the first flagship boutique of Igor Gulyaev in Moscow took place.
Designer Igor Gulyaev is known to the general public for his magnificent luxury fur products.
And now they will be able to appreciate even more fans of fashion - in Moscow finally opened its first boutique, for which the designer and organized a party in the style of dolce vita.

It's not just an office, it's a place where there's really a part of me.
It was with these words that Igor cut the red tape and invited all those who wanted to... try the watched models!
Manufacturers of jets are hostile about the width of the seat when large orders on the cone
A fierce dispute erupted between the leading aircraft manufacturers over the width of tourist-class seats on long-haul flights, setting the tone for the fierce confrontation at the Dubai Air Show this month.
The dispute revolves around the width of seats provided on long-haul flights to economy-class passengers whose interests are not always at the center of the airline’s attention, although the amount of space allocated to them plays a key role in the claims of the S.A.S.
Airbus this week called for an industry standard that would provide a seat width of at least 18 inches (46 cm) in economy class cabins, but its main U.S. competitor Boeing says it should be decided by airlines.
The dispute comes at a time when aircraft manufacturers are competing in sales of ever larger versions of their two-engine long-haul aircraft, and potentially record orders are expected at the event on November 17-21.
The layout of the rear of the aircraft - especially whether 9 or 10 people are seated in a row - is central in the statements about the cost-effectiveness of new mini-aerobus projects.
Boeing claims its updated 777X will accommodate 406 people, based on economy-class seats over 17 inches wide, placed 10 in each row.
Airbus says a competing version of its A350 will carry 350 seats in an economy class with a width of 18 inches, 9 in a row.
Aircraft giants often exchange strikes on technical issues with the help of advertising in the professional press.
Airbus is now addressing the public directly before the Dubai Air Show, where the 777X is expected to become a leader with more than 100 orders.
She recently demonstrated what the beginning of a new advertising war could be by showing financiers a slide depicting three people in a restaurant squeezed together, titled “Would you agree to that?”
“Boeing offers long-haul flights on seats narrower than regional turboprop aircraft,” said John Leigh, Airbus’ chief sales officer.
With a change in diet, people gain weight, but the airplane seats have not changed dramatically.
Between the early 1970s, when the wide-body Boeing 747 set standards for modern long-haul travel, and the turn of the century, the weight of an average American man between the ages of 40 and 49 increased by 10 percent, according to the U.S. Department of Health.
The waist circumference of the average 21st century American man is 39.7 inches, according to statistics from the U.S. Health Service.
Airbus claims that its competitor adheres to the 1950s seat concept, when the average waist circumference of those who have recently been called a “reactive audience” was already there.
Airbus says it has ordered a study showing that an additional inch in the width of the seat improves sleep quality by 53 percent.
Boeing is challenging Airbus’ seat size figures and saying manufacturers shouldn’t interfere with decisions about how airlines find a balance between tariffs and convenience.
According to her, research shows that the comfort of the cabin depends not only on the width of the seat.
“It’s really about giving airlines the choice and the ability to do what they think they need to do to succeed,” said Kent Craver, a Boeing salon specialist.
They do not want us to decide for them what will profit them.
They know their business better than anyone else.
For passengers, the issue is to increase the space on the sides, but for suppliers, this is increasingly becoming a factor that can affect profits.
Behind this controversy is a race for aircraft orders estimated at at least $700 billion at catalog prices in the coming decades – enough to change the ratio of US and European exports.
As Reuters first reported in July, the location of the seats is precisely what warms the rivalry in the battle between the latest jets.
Both Airbus and Boeing are announcing a 20 percent increase in profitability in one place in their latest two-engine long-haul models compared to the market leader in this segment, the 365-seat Boeing 777-300ER.
The stated characteristics of Boeing are partly based on a comparison of the 10-seat 777X series with the original 9-seat layout of the 777 design solution.
Winning at a specific cost decreases when compared to the 10-seat layout currently in use.
“The reason Boeing is doing this is to squeeze in more seats and make its aircraft more competitive compared to our developments,” said Kevin Keniston, head of Airbus passenger comfort in Europe.
On the other hand, analysts say the cabins with full 10-seater rows for the existing 777s indicate that many passengers prefer a dense landing that can go hand-in-hand with lower fares.
“Eighteen-inch-wide seats would be ideal for passengers, but the reality is that from a commercial point of view, the Airbus offer is due to a threat from the 777 model,” said Mary Kirby, interior interior specialist, founder and editor of the Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not supply seats, but offer a catalogue of suppliers from which airlines can choose.
Traveling around the world, jet jet vendors even take their roulette wheels with them to check out competing plans.
Praising comfort, all manufacturers also offer aircraft with a very dense cabin layout for budget airlines and regional flights.
Airbus is offering a 10-seat A350, but says it hasn’t sold it yet.
Until recently, Airbus has emphasized the need for additional modifications to the cabins, offering wider seats at the passage on some of its aircraft.
Without the support of the only other major modern aircraft manufacturer, experts say, its call for a new industry standard is unlikely to “fly,” but can distract attention from the 777X’s sales wave.
A new anti-nicotine vaccine may deprive the process of smoking pleasure
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could deprive the process of smoking cigarettes of pleasure.
A single dose of the vaccine was able to protect mice from lifelong nicotine dependence.
Further tests are needed before human trials begin, which will take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Medical College Wales Cornell in New York said the first results are encouraging.
“We very much hope that such a vaccine strategy can finally help the millions of smokers who have tried to quit by trying all the techniques available on the market today, but have found that their nicotine dependence is strong enough to overcome it with these modern means,” said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that was designed to carry genetic information to produce anti-nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects liver cells, which then begin to produce a steady stream of antibodies.
Antibodies track any nicotine molecules in the blood, neutralizing them before they reach the brain, preventing a smoker from getting a nicotine attack.
In the tests, vaccinated mice, which were subsequently given nicotine, continued their normal activity.
And mice that weren’t given the vaccine “relaxed,” and this is a sign that nicotine was reaching their brains, the researchers say.
These experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines have been unsuccessful because they contain antibodies.
To maintain a high level of antibodies, injections had to be done so often that they were expensive and impractical.
But the cost of a new vaccine is likely to be much lower because it turns liver cells into factories of antibodies.
Professor Crystal said that if the future human vaccine were completely safe, it could be given to children before they have a desire to try a cigarette, preventing nicotine addiction.
But it is more likely that it will be used by smokers to quit smoking.
“They’ll know that if they start smoking again, they won’t get that pleasure from the nicotine vaccine, and it can help them get rid of that habit,” he said.
British scientists said the results were interesting, but warned that further research was needed.
Oleynikov: a third of rural settlements in Moscow are fully subsidized
Yuri Oleynikov, deputy governor of Moscow, said that almost a third of the villages in the Moscow region are fully subsidized.
In total, 187 out of 288 settlements receive grants from the region’s budget.
In 2013, 187 settlements out of 288 receive grants from the regional budget.
The share of subsidies in the income of the budget of 122 rural settlements exceeds 50%, and 83 percent are subsidies.
Within the framework of budgetary security, about 25 billion rubles are sent from the regional budget," Oleynikov said.
The deputy governor also noted that only three urban settlements - Mytisht, Odintsovo and Pushkino - have budget revenues of more than 1 billion rubles for 2013.
The income of rural settlements in many areas is less than 3 million rubles, "this is not enough".
The cost of maintaining the local administrative apparatus in 88 settlements in Moscow is more than 70%, "while there is a decrease in the quality of services," Oleynikov said.
Earlier, he instructed the heads of municipal entities of Sub-Moscow until the end of November to consider which settlements need to be enlarged, merged into urban districts or change the system of administrative management.
These proposals will be finalised by the end of January.
Earlier, the governor of the Moscow region said that as part of the administrative reform in Moscow, it is planned to reduce the number of rural settlements.
Also in Mojais, Kashir, Solnechnogor, Kolomensky districts, Luberts and Kotelniki there is a request for the enlargement of municipalities.
Discussions on this issue in cities and regions of the region will begin in November.
The President of the Mosoblduma, Igor Brynzalov, also said that as part of the upcoming admiral reform, about 30 rural settlements in 12 districts of Moscow are planned to unite everything.
This is due to the fact that of the 178 rural settlements in Moscow, less than a third have an "acceptable" financial base, and 100 - subsidies.
Diana Arbenina celebrates Halloween with her children
Diana Arbenina does not hide the great pleasure she receives from raising her children.
Despite the fact that right now Arbenina gives a lot of time to creativity and social activities, she still finds an opportunity to hang out with Martha and Artema, and not only spends time on their training, but also entertains as much as she can.
Over the past week, Diana has twice reported to her fans about her pedagogical talents.
First, she posted a photo on Facebook that shows how she teaches children to read.
Yesterday, she cheered the fans, showing them how she dressed Artema and Marta on Halloween.
We are ready for the broom races! our first halloween" - this is how Diana called the photo of her children dressed in festive costumes.
Which is unwise, because they, like no other Russian boys and girls, are related to this holiday, since they were born in America.
Germany first in Europe to introduce "uncertain sex" when registering children
Germany will become the first country in Europe to be allowed to indicate "uncertain" when registering children born with hermaphrodites instead of male or female.
The parents of the child will have the right for a time to leave the graph "sex" in the birth certificate unfilled.
Instead of "F" (female) or "M" (male), parents may temporarily write "X" (indefinite).
This decision is aimed at not pushing parents into a rush with the operation to "clarify" the sex.
According to statistics, one in 2,000 newborns in the world is born with hermaphrodite.
Tripod denies being influenced by Obeid
Former New South Wales Labour Minister Joe Tripodi will be a figurehead in the investigation into the state’s anti-corruption oversight body.
Former New South Wales minister Joe Tripodi has denied changes to the leasing of coastal properties at the request of his political adviser, Eddie Obaid, who secretly owned shares in three state-owned properties.
The Independent Anti-Corruption Commission (ICAC) on Friday expanded its investigation into whether Mr. Obaid lobbyed several state ministers to extend the lease agreements on Cerclelar Key, where the Obaid family owns two restaurants and cafes, without passing a tender in August 2005 after their term expired.
She is now investigating allegations that Mr. Tripodi was aware of Mr. Obeid's secret involvement in real estate, following testimony given by Mr. Tripodi's former deputy head of administration, Lynn Ashpool, on Thursday.
In the course of several years of discussions that began in 2005, the Government insisted that the lease be submitted to an open competition.
The tenants were against it, and also wanted longer rental terms.
In 2009, the contracts for the rental of enterprises on Cercular Key, which brought the Obed family about $2.5 million a year, were renewed without being exposed to an open competition.
Mr. Tripodi, who was Minister of Infrastructure and Transport from February 2006 to November 2009, initially advocated open competitions.
But he denied that the changes had been made at the request of Mr. Obeid, who, as Mr. Tripodi admitted, had strongly advised to make changes to the Government ' s lease policy.
The ICAC decryption of telephone calls included conversations in August and September 2007 between Mr. Obaid, Mr. Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who came to the Ministry of Ports after working under Mr. Obaid's leadership in the Fisheries Department.
“Was the issue discussed during these telephone conversations a matter of developing a commercial lease policy?” asked Assistant Commissioner Anthony Willy Tripodi.
“No,” replied Mr. Tripodi.
I can't remember what I was discussing, but it was definitely wrong.
Definitely not between me and Mr. Obaid.
According to a senior official, Israeli military aircraft are attacking targets inside Syria
A senior administration official confirmed in an interview with Fox News that Israeli military aircraft struck a target in the Syrian port city of Latakia on Thursday evening.
The official did not specify what the purpose was, but said there was at least one.
The Associated Press reports that the target was Russian-made SA-125 missiles.
At least twice earlier this year, Israel launched airstrikes on cargo with missiles inside Syria.
Foreign workers on subclass 457 visas can be tested for “authenticity”
The “authenticity” test for foreign workers on Class 457 visas is under consideration by the government as it plans to expand repressive measures.
This test, if accepted, will be applied on criteria aimed at preventing the use of Class 457 visas to fill unskilled positions or as a loophole for moving family and friends to Australia.
The document presented by the government for discussion was released today, while former Labour MP Maxine McKee criticized the government’s rhetoric about foreign workers, saying it could offend Australia’s neighbors.
“The loud statements like ‘foreigners are at the end of the line’ and ‘work for Australians first’ represent a very unpleasant turnaround to the times when trade unions demanded a protected labour market,” she told the Australia-India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that it was white labor that had to be defended – and if some in the region saw the echoes of this historic artifact, I wouldn’t be surprised.
The document outlines 12 measures that were previously considered by former immigration minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday, where he is meeting with officials over the smuggling of people, has already made five of the recommended changes, and the rest are under review.
If the “authenticity” criteria are accepted, the visa applicant will be able to investigate whether the application is “authentic in circumstances where the candidate is a relative or close acquaintance of the owner or a person relevant to the financing of the enterprise.”
Enterprises may also be required to report on the number of holders of subclass 457 visas, as previously enterprises that intended to sponsor a small number of employees then hired hundreds.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker allegedly died of a heart attack after arriving on a boat with refugees on Christmas Island this week.
The man’s nine-year-old son accompanied him on his way to Australia, and since his father’s death on Wednesday, he has been supported by a cousin who was also on board the ship.
Australian authorities rushed the man to a Christmas Island hospital, where he died.
A friend of Semena Varlamov said that the hockey player suffers from alcoholism
A friend of Semena Varlamov's friend Evgeny Vavrinyuk said that he suffers from alcoholism, reports the Russian News Service.
“He has no idea how to stop drinking,” the woman said.
Recall that Vavrynyuk sued for beating the goalkeeper of the Russian national team Semen Varlamov, who is also a member of the club "Colorado".
According to her, the hockey player pulled off her hair, and also beat - after the attack, her arms, chest, abdomen and neck were damaged.
Varlamov himself came with the culprit to the Denver police and confessed to the beating, describing in detail what had happened.
He was arrested, but later released on $5,000 bail.
The court did not restrict the athlete's movements throughout the country, but forbade him to approach Vavrinyuk.
He is also facing up to six years in prison for domestic violence.
The UK government has announced a study aimed at increasing the economic impact for Scotland from the HS2 railway project.
Project HS2 envisages the opening of a high-speed communication with Scotland and the north of England, with the start of the First Stage in 2026
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said the project would “unite the UK”.
Scotland’s Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was “enthusiastic” about the prospect of working on the plan with the UK government.
The first phase will be the construction of a new high-speed rail line between London and the West Midlands.
When the Second Stage is completed, the lines will be laid in Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government revised the estimated cost of building a high-speed line between London and northern England from <0xC2><0xA3>32.7 billion to <0xC2><0xA3>42.6 billion.
The UK government, which is negotiating with Transport Scotland, has instructed HS2 Ltd to consider further improvements in railway capacity and shortening travel times for Northern England and Scotland.
This should include the ability to cross the road from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London in three hours or less.
Baroness Kramer said: “Our goal on HS2 is to create a truly national network that will bring the UK and its cities closer together.”
We are developing HS2 because the benefits it will bring are huge.
Without it, we will face a bandwidth crisis in our rail network.
But it’s also about connecting cities with each other; 18 cities across the UK, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, will get better communication thanks to HS2.
Scottish Secretary of State Alistair Carmichael added: “Today’s announcement is good news for Scotland.”
On behalf of the Scottish government, Keith Brown called on Mr Carmichael to “unambiguously” support Scotland’s inclusion in the HS2 network.
Mr Brown said: “The high-speed railroad has every chance of bringing huge economic benefits to Scotland, but it also adds to Scotland’s economic weight in the overall argument for the high-speed railroad across the UK.”
We are therefore pleased to work in partnership with the UK government to consider options for building a high-speed railway in Scotland, creating benefits for all and continuing the Glasgow-Edinburgh railway line that the Scottish government is already planning.
I look forward to reviewing the results of the study with the British ministers next year and jointly deciding on the next steps.
Is Tory a New Hope for Nuclear Energy?
Governments around the world continue to think about how to meet their energy needs.
The burning of hydrocarbons (where they are) negatively affects the climate.
Renewable energy sources require large areas to be generated.
Atomic energy costs without both, but leaves behind a lot of expensive in waste disposal.
Recently, scientists have paid attention to thorium - another radioactive element of the Mendeleev system.
It is found all over the world and, according to experts, its cleavage does not leave waste that should be stored for centuries.
Rules for the use of electronic devices on airplanes in Australia will remain in force for now
Passengers of Australian airlines will still need to turn off their tablets and smartphones during take-off and landing, despite measures in the United States to soften the rules regarding these devices.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has allowed U.S. carriers to change their procedures so that passengers can read e-books, watch videos, or play games on their devices during take-off and landing, provided they remain in “Flight Mode.”
Passengers can already do this during the main part of the flight, but many are annoyed that they do not have access to their e-books during take-off and landing.
Australian carriers are considering the decision, which required U.S. airlines to carry out huge amounts of work to comply with the new requirements, but indicated that they do not plan to change their procedures in the near future.
The Civil Aviation Flight Safety Authority also noted that they are considering this statement, but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical phases of flight are still in place in Australia.
“Civil aviation flight safety management currently has no special rules governing the use of electronic devices in aircraft,” it said.
This issue is governed by rules that require air carriers to maintain safety at all times, and passengers to comply with the safety rules that are notified to them by crew members.
Virgin, which has already discussed with the Civil Aviation Flight Safety Authority expanding the use of its on-board entertainment system with Wi-Fi, was not opposed to the changes, but said it would follow the regulator’s instructions.
“We would welcome the Civil Aviation Flight Safety Authority’s consideration of authorizing the use of electronic devices, because we really think it will improve the quality of customer service now that it (the onboard wireless entertainment system) is on our planes,” the spokesperson said.
Qantas has said it will abide by the current rules.
“Our current policy is that electronic devices cannot be used during take-off and landing, and we do not plan to change it anytime soon,” she said.
The FAU Regulation applies to U.S. airlines.
Nevertheless, we are always interested in regulatory changes that could benefit passengers, and we will certainly carefully consider the FAU’s decision and the reasons behind it.
For U.S. carriers, the impact of the order will vary from airline to airline and will depend on the age of their fleet.
Carriers will have to prove that their aircraft are resistant to interference from mobile devices, as well as review manuals, training materials, hand luggage rules and passenger instructions.
“After the airline has checked and confirmed the interference resistance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use portable, lightweight electronic devices such as tablets, e-books and smartphones, at any altitude,” the FAU said.
In rare cases of poor visibility, the crew will instruct passengers to turn off their devices during landing.
In addition, according to the group's recommendation, heavier devices should be located under the seats or in the upper luggage compartments during take-off and landing.
The heads of Dagestan can hear in the anthem of Kuban notes of extremism
The football match between Anji and Kubanya resulted in a political clash between the authorities of the Krasnodar region and Dagestan after the fans burned the Dagestan flag, and the Kubanya anthem sounded differently.
The head of Dagestan, Ramazan Abdulatipov, on Thursday proposed to Republican parliamentarians to go to court because the Krasnodar region’s hymn allegedly calls for inter-ethnic dissent, in particular, calls for war with the “basurmans”.
Take the anthem of Krasnodar region, it is in our time in 1995 approved this anthem.
It's a disgrace, and no one's doing it.
"Remembering you here as the mother of the family, the enemy, the basurman, we go to the battle of death" - why such words to write in the hymn, poison some believers on other believers," - expressed solidarity with the President of the Parliament, Hizri Shihsaid.
Putin has achieved impunity for his friend Assad
And now - news from beyond the ocean, namely - from Syria, where, as we know today, Israel has struck missiles of Russian production, which are reportedly intended "Hezbollah".
Today, Syria has fulfilled an important condition - to destroy its production of chemical weapons by 1 November.
This was done within the framework of an agreement reached with the mediation of Russia and allowing the US not to conduct a military operation, which they approached closely this summer.
More about the weapons and what it all means for the Syrian president, will tell our main international correspondent Richard Engel.
Washington said the Assad regime would be punished for this.
More than 1,400 civilians, including hundreds of children, died in August from poison gas.
And the punishment has come.
But not in the form of American bombing, but in the form of a deal made by a friend of Assad - Vladimir Putin.
Syria will give up its chemical weapons by the middle of next year.
Today is an important milestone.
The group of international experts reported that Syria had decommissioned the alleged chemical weapons factories.
A more long-term and difficult task is the destruction of tons of chemical weapons and their components.
As we understand it is about a thousand tons.
Previously, Washington had said that Assad’s days were numbered.
I think Assad should leave.
The question is not whether it will happen, but when it will happen.
He is no longer legitimate and must leave.
But Assad remains.
And he feels even more confident.
His troops continue to use artillery, missiles and napalm.
His opponents are divided and poorly armed.
His people are forced to leave their homes, many are starving.
Some have to eat leaves and cats.
Many believe that Bashar Assad escaped punishment for mass murder.
The chemical weapons agreement is called the success of diplomacy, the inspectors were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, and Assad himself gave the impression of a man willing to cooperate.
Today in Washington, the U.S. ambassador to Syria had to answer difficult questions.
When a child dies of starvation, its mother is unlikely to be easier than not being killed with a chemical weapon.
Assad is still standing.
It changes weapons to power.
The President of the Russian Federation has created a separate Ministry of construction and housing
Russian President Vladimir Putin has created a new ministry that oversees construction and housing issues and proposed to head it to the former governor of the Ivanovo region, Mikhail Menu, in the process of a personal meeting.
The President met with Mikhail Men in the residence in Novo Ogarevo, and Men did not refuse to head the new department.
Russian President’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov explained that all functions related to construction and housing are being transferred to the new ministry from the Ministry of Regions.
Mikhail Men - the son of a well-known Orthodox priest of the priest Alexander Men, graduated from the Moscow Institute of Petrochemistry named after Gubkin.
Since 1995, his political career began - he was elected to the Moscow Regional Duma from the Sergeyev-Posadsky district, was a deputy of the State Duma, the first deputy prime minister of the government of the Moscow region, the deputy prime minister of the government of Moscow.
From 2005 to October 16, 2013, Mikhail Men was governor of the Ivanovo region.
The owners of the Lombards in Singapore are doing well, while the middle class is experiencing difficulties
At a barn in the Bendemir shopping mall in Singapore, Gianni Amirthalinga puts on a gold bracelet, ring and earrings to pay for his daughter’s schooling.
“My husband and I just bought a house, so all my money is invested there,” says Ms. Amirthalinga.
Although she earns S$3000 ($2400) a month as an administrator and her husband also works, the monthly income of the family is not enough, she says.
Indeed, demand in various parts of Southeast Asia — where household debt is growing — is such that ValueMax, where it conducts its transaction, this week became the third smuggler to be listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange.
A jewelry bond loan is not just a quick way to get money (S$1,300 in Mrs. Amirthaling’s case), but it’s almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
Typically, Singapore lobbies charge an effective annual interest rate of 17%, slightly above the 15.4 percent offered at the United Overseas Bank branch, a local lender with a branch in the same mall.
However, the advantage is that they do not require credit checks or proof of salary and can issue loans faster than banks.
As a result, millions of people across the region are turning to lobster farms as families feel pressured by the rising cost of living and the rapid rise in household debt and consumer debt.
After five years of sustained growth following the global financial crisis and cheap loans fueled by free monetary policy in developed economies, low- and middle-income families are turning to lobster to compensate for their declining economies as they grow.
This week, Standard & Poor’s, the rating agency, cited an increase in the family’s lending arm, largely due to the rise in mortgages, as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
It said Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore had the highest ratio of household debt to gross domestic product in Asia.
Malaysia led the list with 80 per cent of GDP compared to 60 per cent in 2008.
Economists are also concerned about the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which has barely emerged from the technical recession this week.
On Thursday, the data showed a continued decline in exports and a weakening of consumer demand.
“The bottom line is that with rising prices, people in the middle and lower [income scales] will be looking for ways to replenish their income where they can,” says Song Seng Won, an economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Record-high gold prices over the past two years have fueled the rush with which people lay down their personal belongings as they take advantage of the opportunity to get money for their family jewelry.
In Singapore, about 70 per cent of the items placed in the city-state’s 200 lombariums are gold products.
People say, “The price of gold looks good, let’s put on Grandma’s gold chain and get it back next month.”
In Thailand, EasyMoney, the largest retailer, has seen a rise in the number of customers using its offices in recent months, up to 20%.
ValueMax, a branch operator in Bendemir and 15 others in Singapore, plans to expand not only in neighboring Malaysia, where it has four stores, but also outside Asia, says ValueMax CEO Yeah Lee Ching.
The company will fund the expansion using 60 percent of the S$66 million raised this week as a result of the listing of shares on the Singapore Stock Exchange.
While some lenders have sparked criticism due to high interest rates, Ms. Yeah says that the Lombard not only offers cheaper tariffs than other lenders, it also does not increase debt directly.
“Customers lay items they already own, and personal asset monetization does not increase household debt,” she says.
The institution is gaining increasing public recognition as a means of obtaining short-term, secured funding.
And at the same time, it is not only those categories of people who are in a difficult financial situation that use the lombards.
Rich people in Singapore also use ValueMax offices, laying gold bars or Rolex watches that can give up to 60 percent of their purchase value in cash.
We see clients from all walks of life.
“They include wealthy individuals who need to borrow short-term money for commercial projects or investments, or small businesses who need to overcome temporary monetary hardships,” says Ms. Jeah.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
Today, it is not the number of medical facilities and their status that matters to the population, but the quality of the medical care provided.
Implementation of the program "Modernization of health care of the Tula region for 2011 - 2013", the reorganization of the medical institutions of our city will allow to create an optimal structure for providing medical care to the population, including gynecological patients, pregnant women and midwives.
Thus, after the association with the hospital, there was an even greater opportunity to attract narrow specialists from the UGZ "NGKB" for consultations of pregnant women with various pathologies, to conduct additional examinations on the basis of the hospital.
During the implementation of the modernization program, the logistical and technical base of the maternity home was significantly improved, modern equipment corresponding to world standards appeared.
Over these years, about 8 million rubles have been allocated for the capital repair of premises, 112 units of equipment have been purchased in the amount of 42 million rubles.
The most modern equipment is equipped with an intensive post for newborns.
In the operating room during the cesarean section, the cell-saver apparatus is used, which allows you to collect blood from the operating wound and, after special treatment, return it to the woman of birth, avoiding the transfusion of foreign blood.
Modern equipment is also equipped with a department of clinical and laboratory diagnostics.
In the women's consultation, there is an electronic registration, and the introduction of electronic cards and patient histories is planned in the near future.
Thanks to the development of telemedicine, it was possible to consult gynecological patients, pregnant women, midwives and newborns with regional specialists.
Chechens beaten and robbed 60 prostitutes in Strasbourg
Chechens have been arrested by the French police on suspicion of serial attacks on prostitutes.
The investigation has been ongoing since March of this year.
About 60 women complained about the Caucasian actions.
It is reported that bandits ordered prostitutes to one of the hotels in Strasbourg, and then beaten and robbed them.
The head of the gang was a 27-year-old former Chechen convicted.
The defender of "Bavaria" David Alaba became the best athlete of Austria in 2013, reports the official website of the Bundesliga.
In this dispute, he surpassed representatives of winter sports, which traditionally become the best in the country.
The second place was taken by skier Marcel Hirscher, and the third - ski jumper from the trampoline Gregor Schlirentsauer.
Last season, a 21-year-old Austrian of Filipino-Nigerian descent helped his team win the Champions League, the Championship and the German Cup, as well as the UEFA Super Cup.
The ex-wife of Arshavin is resting with the actor Andrei Chadov
The former civil wife of the footballer of Peter "Zenit" Andrei Arshavin Yulia Baranovskaya spends the holiday together with the actor Andrei Chadov.
Yulia is resting in Italy in the company of actress Anastasia Zadorozhna, her fiancé - figure skater Sergey Slavnov, and actor Andrei Chadov.
Pictures of the couple’s joint walks are posted on Instagram by Anastasia Zadrozhna.
This is not the first photo of Andrew and Julia.
On October 5, Zadrozhnaya published a picture of a couple standing on the shore of the Gulf of Finland in Komarovo.
In mid-October, halfback "Zenita" Andrei Arshavin admitted that he lives separately from his civil wife Yulia.
Yulia Baranovskaya and Andrey Arshavin have been together since 2003, they have three children.
Recently, it became known that Arshavin is dating ex-model Alice Kazmina.
A new friend of Arshavin was married to the top manager of the corporation.
Rescue package of $325 million for Tasmania’s health
The federal government insists that a $325 million bailout package for Tasmania’s weakened health care system will be complemented by harsh conditions that ensure the state government does not waste funds.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth is taking “urgent measures” to prevent a crisis caused by the aging population of this island state, higher levels of chronic diseases and system constraints.
The decision on funding for four years was made after consultations of the government with the independent Tasmanian MP Andrew Wilkie.
“The government has proposed an emergency bailout package that we believe will solve the specific problems facing the state,” she said.
The $325 million package includes $31 million for a flash campaign on planned operations.
Another 2,600 surgeries, including orthopedic and cataract removal operations, will help overcome the lag.
There is also money for hospitals receiving patients without pre-registration in Hobart and Lonseston to improve post-hospital care, train medical professionals, mental health services, and implement personal electronic health card systems in local hospitals.
“These investments will go to the implementation of ideas expressed by advanced doctors on how best to help Tasmania’s health care system,” Plibersek said.
The Minister insisted that the Government of Tasmania will work in a mode of strict accountability and responsibility.
The staff will need to maintain current levels of funding in order to receive Commonwealth funds and report monthly on where it is spending those additional funds.
A three-person commission will be set up to ensure that the staff provides services as efficiently and efficiently as possible.
Mr. Wilkie said today that $325 million would not resolve anything “unless they are followed by a genuine reform that will put Tasmania’s health care system on a more sustainable footing.”
Nevertheless, he commended the Government for its response to its urgent request for assistance, which he first addressed to the Prime Minister in early May.
“I hope that the federal aid package will significantly contribute to bringing the state’s health care system out of critical condition,” Wilkie said.
According to the state government, these additional sampling procedures largely offset recent cuts.
But federal opposition health representative Peter Dutton believes today’s statement is a “solution similar to leukoplasty.”
“The reason we’re here is because the Labour government of the state has ripped $430 million out of the health care system,” he told ABC TV.
When the state government takes out nearly half a billion dollars and the Commonwealth invests 300 million, you can’t pretend it’s good news.
Mr. Dutton asked Ms. Plibersec to ensure that no dollar from the bailout would be spent on additional bureaucracy.
Guillaume Nichols’ film adaptation of Denis Diderot boasts exceptional production and historical details, but it is also harder to perceive than it should have been.
The film, set in France in the 1760s, tells the dark story of Susanna, a young aristocrat sent to the monastery by her family.
When she starts to rebel, she experiences extreme cruelty at the hands of a sadist guardian and becomes the object of erotic fantasies for others.
The film never goes down to messiness or sensation — and that’s the problem.
Due to its serious solemnity, the storytelling risks becoming a test for the audience as well.
Syria Has Destroyed Its Chemical Weapons, Says Monitoring Group
Syria has destroyed basic equipment for the production of chemical weapons and ammunition with poisonous gas, an international observation team said on Thursday, as fierce clashes raged in the north of the country, near one of the facilities where toxic substances are believed to be stored.
Also on Thursday, a group of Syrian activists said more than 120,000 people had been killed since the start of the civil war in the country almost three years ago.
The statement of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons was made one day before the
The deadline of 1 November is set by the Hague-based organization for Damascus to destroy or “make inoperable” all means of producing chemical weapons and mechanisms for mixing chemicals with the production of poisonous gas and replenishing them with ammunition.
The completion of what is essentially the initial stage of destruction is an important milestone in an ambitious schedule that aims to destroy all Damascus’ chemical weapons by mid-2014.
The destruction of equipment means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
Nonetheless, Damascus has yet to begin the destruction of existing weapons and stockpiles.
The country is believed to have about 1,000 metric tons of chemicals and weapons, including mustard gas and nerve gas sarin.
The statement was made during fierce fighting on Thursday in the city of Safira, which experts say is home to a chemical weapons facility as well as its location, the UK-based Syrian Centre for Human Rights said.
A group of activists who tracked the losses through a network of activists in Syria said on Thursday that 120,296 people were killed.
Of those, 61,067 were civilians, including 6,365 children.
The group said 29,954 people were members of President Bashar al-Assad's armed forces, 18,678 were pro-government militants and 187 were Lebanese Hezbollah militants.
Also among the dead, as stated in the statement, were 2,202 army fugitives and about 5,375 opposition fighters, many of them foreigners.
According to the United Nations estimate of July 25, 100,000 have died in the conflict since March 2011.
Since then, this number has not been updated.
The conflict forced about 2 million people to flee the country.
Assad’s troops fought rebels in Safira for several weeks, many of whom are linked to al-Qaeda groups.
The center said there were casualties on both sides on Thursday, but did not provide specific data.
The fighting highlighted the danger faced by the chemical weapons inspectors, adapted by the short deadlines of their mission to rid Syria of the toxic arsenal, in the midst of an ongoing civil war.
In a statement, the OPCW, which works in close cooperation with the United Nations, said its team was “now satisfied that it has checked and destroyed all critical production facilities and mixing/refilling equipment declared by Syria.”
She added that “no additional inspection activities are currently planned.”
Earlier this week, the inspectors said they had completed the first round of verification work by visiting 21 of the 23 sites declared by Damascus.
They were unable to visit the two sites for security reasons, the inspectors said.
On Thursday, the OPCW said both sites were, according to a statement from Syria, “abandoned and ... the items of the chemical weapons program contained in them were moved to other claimed sites that were checked.”
It was not immediately possible to determine whether the site in Safira was one of the two places that OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria has presented a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which is due to be approved by the OPCW Executive Committee next month.
“I welcome the courage and courage that you have all demonstrated in carrying out the most difficult mission ever undertaken by this organization,” said the Director General of the Observatory, Ahmet Uzumju, in a commentary published by the OPCW.
For the third year a civil war has confronted rebels, mostly Sunni Muslims, with the Assad government and its security forces, which consist of members of its Alawite sect, branches of Shia Islam.
Regarding other events, the head of the center Rami Abdurrahman said there was a strong explosion on Wednesday at an air defense facility in Syria's coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion is unknown, he said.
Anger over condemnation of the organizers of the terrorist attack in Bali
The survivors and relatives of the 202 killed in the 2002 Bali bombing reacted furiously to the verdict of the last of the conspirators who appeared in court and said Umar Pathek should be shot.
Patek, who has spent nearly 10 years on the run as one of Southeast Asia’s most wanted people, was sentenced to 20 years in prison for his role in building explosive devices used during the attack.
He may be released for 15 years if he receives parole.
The 45-year-old defendant was convicted of mass killings as a result of an attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, during which 202 people died, including 88 Australians, and dozens more were injured.
He was also convicted of a number of other terrorism-related charges, including a wave of church explosions across Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
Prosecutors have demanded life imprisonment, although they could insist that a person dubbed a “subversive” for his reputation as a master explosives maker should be sentenced to death.
This decision exacerbated the painful memories of Perth’s mother, June Cortin, who lost her 39-year-old twin daughters Jane and Jenny in a terrorist attack carried out by Patek and his accomplices nearly a decade ago.
Barely holding back her tears, she said that Patek was to be sentenced to death.
“I really think he should follow in the footsteps of other guys.
He must appear before the firing team,” Mrs. Cortin told AAP.
“I have to live every day knowing that I won’t have grandchildren anymore and I won’t see my daughters.”
The Sari Club was destroyed when a massive explosive device was detonated, placed in a parked van outside, immediately after 11 p.m. on October 12, 2002.
Peter Hughes was at the Paddy Bar, where a suicide bomber blew up a backpack filled with explosives just 20 seconds earlier.
After the attack, he fell into a coma for a month and "died" three times, being connected to a life support system.
Mr. Hughes said Pathek should share the fate of three other members of the Jemaa Islami terror cell responsible for the bloody massacre, Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra, who were executed four years ago.
Indeed, this guy deserves the death penalty the most.
To save his life, well, there's no reason to save his life.
Getting 20 years after killing 202 people and injuring hundreds is not so much.
Patek is the last of the terrorists in Bali to appear in court.
He hid for nearly a decade, but was eventually detained in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where U.S. troops killed former al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden less than four months later.
In the course of the trial, an FBI agent showed that the intelligence data testified: Patek was in Pakistan to meet with bin Laden in an attempt to restore ties between terrorist groups in Southeast Asia and Al-Qaeda.
“He didn’t give up,” said Mrs. Cortin.
Until recently, he had no regrets at all about how much grief he had caused to other people.
The sentence comes on the eve of the 10th anniversary of the terrorist attack, which will be celebrated later this year in Bali and Australia.
“There will be a lot of tears this year,” says Mrs. Cortin.
Patek can still appeal his sentence.
FAU: “Air passengers can now use gadgets on planes (but not call from a mobile phone)”
Passengers will be able to use their electronic devices throughout the flight to read, work, play games, watch movies and listen to music, but not to talk on mobile phones, according to the long-awaited new guidelines released Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration.
But passengers shouldn’t expect the change to happen immediately.
How quickly such a change is realized will vary depending on the airline, FAU administrator Michael Huerta said at a press conference.
Airlines will have to show the FAU how their aircraft comply with the new guidelines and that they are updating their training manuals for flight crew members and setup rules to comply with the new guidelines.
The FAU said it had already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices on planes.
Delta and JetBlue were among the airlines that have already introduced plans.
“Depending on the state of the plan, we could approve the expansion of the use of electronic devices very soon,” the FAU said.
Currently, passengers are required to turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the plane door closes.
They should not restart them until the plane reaches a height of 10,000 feet and the captain gives "good".
Passengers should turn off their devices again when the plane is down for landing, and not turn them on until the plane is on the ground.
Under the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are properly protected from electronic interference may allow passengers to use these devices during take-off, landing and steering, the FAU said.
Most new airliners and other aircraft modified so that passengers can use Wi-Fi at high altitudes are expected to meet these criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Association of Professional Boarders, welcomed these changes.
“After the new policy is implemented safely (and we are going to work closely with the carrier to achieve this), it will be a win-win option,” Glading said.
We are frankly tired of feeling “school duty” when it comes to this issue.
But internet connection for surfing, sharing emails, texting or downloading data will still be banned at a height of less than 10,000 feet, the agency said.
Passengers will be asked to switch their smartphones, tablets and other devices to airplane mode.
Thus, there is still no "Words with Friends" - an intelligent internet game that actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011, when there was a crazy case: the actor was taken off an American Airlines plane for refusing to turn off the device at the time the plane was on.
And heavier devices, such as laptops, will still need to be put in the trunk, as they can hurt someone if they fly around the cabin.
Calls from a mobile phone in flight will also continue to be banned.
Regulatory powers on telephone calls belong to the Federal Communications Commission, not the FAU.
The FAU may lift the ban on some electronic devices during take-off and landing
Last month, Mark Rosencker of the National Transportation Safety Council, a national transport safety expert at CBS News, said cell phones were still considered a risk.
“Mobile phones are really a problem, not only because they can potentially create interference for navigation devices, but we know from the FCC that they can create interference for cell towers when the plane is in the air,” Rosenker said.
An industry advisory committee set up by the FAU to study the issue recommended last month that the government allow more use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years, there has been increased pressure on the FAU to ease restrictions on their use.
Critics, such as Missouri Democratic Senator Claire McKaskill, argue that there are no solid reasons for bans related to security.
Compliance with restrictions is also becoming increasingly difficult to ensure as the application of devices has become ubiquitous.
Some studies show that up to a third of passengers forget or ignore instructions to turn off their devices.
The FAU began restricting the use of electronic devices by passengers in 1966 in response to reports of interference to navigation and communication equipment when passengers began carrying FM radio receivers - high-tech gadgets of the time.
New aircraft are much more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also developed and approved by the FAU as resistant to electronic interference.
Airlines have been offering passengers the use of Wi-Fi at cruising altitude for several years.
Aircraft modified for Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to interference.
The vast majority of the liners are adapted for wider use of electronic devices according to the new guidelines, Huerta said.
Today’s electronic devices typically emit radio signals of much lower power than previous generations of devices.
E-book reading devices, for example, emit only minimal signals when scrolling pages.
But signals become more powerful when devices load or send data.
Among those seeking to mitigate restrictions on the use of electronic devices by passengers was Amazon.com.
In 2011, representatives of the company downloaded an entire airliner with their Kindle e-book readers and flew on it to check for problems, but never detected them.
The members of the FAU Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings as to whether the use of devices presents a risk.
Douglas Kidd of the National Air Passenger Association said he believes interference from devices is real, even if the risk is minimal.
Other members of the committee said there were only individual reports from pilots confirming that the devices could cause interference to aviation systems, and most of these reports are very old.
However, the committee recommended that the FAU allow pilots to require passengers to turn off the devices during landings on the instruments in limited visibility.
A group of representatives of the tourism industry welcomed these changes, calling them a sensible step towards passengers who are now using many technological devices.
“We are delighted that the FAU recognizes that passenger comfort is not incompatible with safety and security,” said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Tourism Association.
Driving schools will be able to conduct exams for obtaining a driver's license
Exams for driving licenses will be accepted by private companies with their own computerized autodrome.
"Kommersant" writes about this with reference to the draft government decree "On admission to driving vehicles".
According to the newspaper, there are currently only about 30 such highways in Russia.
It is assumed that students of such "privileged" car schools will count the results of internal testing.
At the same time, the State Inspectorate will monitor the passing of exams every six months.
If it turns out that more than 30% of the theoretical exams and more than 20% of the course students do not pass from the first time, such a school will be deprived of privileges for six months.
The technical requirements for autodromes contained in the draft government decree shall enter into force on 5 November 2014.
The project also contains requirements for training in driving two-wheeled vehicles.
From January 1, 2015, motorcycle owners will be required to pass the exam in urban traffic to obtain category A rights.
In addition, from May 5, 2014, companies will not be able to hire foreign drivers with foreign rights.
Such workers will have to receive Russian rights after passing the exam.
A bird, airborne to a safe place from a drilling facility in the North Sea, released back into the wild
The bird, which was airborne to the shore after being found in a depleted state on an oil tower in the North Sea, was released back into the wild.
This water shepherd was put in a helicopter heading to Aberdeen last month, and then it was released by the Scottish division of the Society for the Prevention of Animal Abuse (SPCA) at a rescue center in Alloa.
Center manager Colin Seddon said: “This water shepherd is most likely a winter migrant from Northern Europe who has fallen into a zone of strong winds over the North Sea.”
It seems that the bird was exhausted and was able to find shelter on the oil tower.
He added: “She was unable to take off again, so we were asked for help.”
The water shepherd was healthy and in good condition by the time he was released.
Is the European elite ready to do business with England?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with a commitment to bring together business representatives and determine what changes UK welfare and jobs creators want to see in their relationship with the EU.
To this end, we ordered the largest and most comprehensive survey of British business leaders, asking them to express their views on the UK, business and the EU.
YouGov surveyed more than 1,000 business leaders representing a wide range of businesses in the UK by size, sectors and regions.
The results of the survey will be surprising to many.
We found that the vast majority of enterprises are currently looking for export opportunities outside Europe, paying special attention to countries that are upgrading and growing while EU countries are stagnating.
They want the government to give priority to new trade ties with countries like China, India and Brazil, rather than wasting time on the long and difficult process of reforming the EU’s confusing institutions.
When asked about their views on specific political issues, from antitrust regulation to product laws, most business leaders felt that control of these key areas of competence should be returned to Westminster.
There was a general dissatisfaction with the single market, with business representatives saying that the costs of regulation from Brussels now outweigh the benefits of being in the European shopping area, even 40 percent of large companies, traditionally the most pro-European of all companies, agreed.
Last but not least, our survey of business leaders revealed that a clear majority wants the UK to take a course on treaty change and on trade-based relations with the EU rather than politics.
This result, which has been observed among enterprises of all sizes and major business groups, shows that the business is insisting on a “significant change” that will bring power back to the UK.
The rates are high – achieving changes to the treaty and more favourable conditions for the UK will provide a 16 percent shift in the vote to stay in the EU.
The prime minister should have no doubts: this survey shows that British business supports his plan to revise the terms of Britain’s EU membership.
It also shows that the business expects the review to lead to a significant shift in the current balance of power back to the UK.
The best conditions for British business are possible and increasingly necessary as the eurozone enters the path of closer economic and financial union.
Priority should be given to jobs and economic growth in the UK, and, as the results of our survey show, for business this means a stronger focus on trade and fundamental changes in Brussels’ regulatory activities.
U.S. intelligence is listening to the Pope’s personal phone
The Vatican’s activities are under the watchful eye of U.S. intelligence agencies.
New documents from Edward Snowden’s collection show that U.S. intelligence conducted an audition for all of Pope Benedict’s previous talks, and now closely cares for Pope Francis.
His phone began to ring before he became the head of the Vatican.
The process of electing a new pope was also under observation.
What was of particular importance in the United States.
The intelligence service connected to the cardinals’ cell phones, who gathered in Rome to choose the next pope.
The telephones of the residence, where the participants of the conclave lived, were also auditioned.
American spies listened to all the main contenders for the papal throne to prevent the appearance of an undesirable figure for Washington.
Panorama magazine reports that the “big ear of the United States” continued to intercept prelate conversations until the very end of the conclave on March 12.
It is claimed that in the United States since 2005 the Argentine Archbishop Bergoglio has been selected as the future Pope of Rome.
U.S. intelligence has also honored negotiations related to the election of the new President of the Vatican Bank.
The Italian magazine writes that a secret group of CIA and NSA operatives continues to work at the U.S. embassy in Rome, obtaining information about policies and financial flows.
In turn, the Vatican has reconciliatoryly announced that it does not care about the American "pro-scouting", even if it is happening.
The Holy Fathers have no secrets from the U.S. leadership.
The snowboarder for the Olympic banknote was specially photographed
On Wednesday, the Bank of Russia issued a commemorative banknote dedicated to the city of Sochi, where the Olympic Games will be held this winter.
The denomination of the banknote is 100 rubles.
But in the network, bloggers are already actively ironizing about the commemorative banknote.
After the presentation of the Olympic banknote on October 30, they pointed out that the image of the snowboarder from the banknote can be found in photobanks.
In particular - in the free StockExchange photo repository, where this photo is dated 2005.
The same photo is used in a Photoshop tutorial published on the Russian website Megabzor on January 18, 2011.
In addition, it has already been used in the advertising of RugGear smartphones.
The Olympic banknote is made in a blue-blue gamut.
On one side there is a snowboarder flying over Sochi, on the other there is a view of the Olympic Stadium and the Jar Bird.
The author of the design of the banknote is Pavel Bushuev, who won the competition among students of the St. Petersburg Academy of Arts named Repin.
The presentation noted that several sports were considered - skiing, freestyle and jumping from the trampoline, but eventually chose snowboarding, as it is a relatively young sport.
According to a source close to the Central Bank, the regulator is not indifferent to the opinion of the public about the widespread dissemination of the image of a snowboarder from the Olympic banknote and is now studying the situation.
But in Goznak are not too worried about the noise around the Olympic banknote.
The head of the press service of the state mark Natalia Nikiforova told "Izvestia" that all the arguments about plagiarism are ridiculous.
Snowboarder on the banknote will turn to the right, on the photos in the network - to the left, - Nikiforova said.
A person in a photo session to create a banknote was shot from different points, then the final image was selected, on it - a characteristic posture of a snowboarder.
She also noted that copyright laws do not apply to the Olympic banknote, as the artist was paid for his work.
According to experts, the discussion around the image on the Olympic banknote is positive at all.
Recognition of the image on the banknote - plus for its promotion, - says the Executive Director of NP "RusBrand" Alexey Popovichev.
Proving the 100% similarity of the images on the banknote and in photobanks is quite difficult, so claims to challenge intellectual property on this image are unlikely to come.
The first Olympic banknote appeared in China - a commemorative 10 yuan banknote was issued before the 2008 Beijing Olympics.
Russia has decided to support this tradition.
Russians are forced to drink less beer
Russian brewers are in a bad mood.
According to them, the consumption of beer in the country next year will remain at the same level, and this is at best.
At the beginning, businessmen were hoping for growth.
After all, this year is a failure for them: sales fell by 7 percent.
The head of one of the country’s largest brewery companies, Chairman of the Council of the Union of Russian Brewers Isaac Sheps, told about this at the III annual conference of the Adam Smith Institute “Daily Demand Goods in Russia”, which has just ended in Moscow.
It discussed the state regulation of the market.
Between 2008 and 2012, the Russian beer market has already shrunk by 18 percent, as in recent years the country has seen a significant increase in the regulation of the brewing industry in the production and turnover of beer - a drink with a low alcohol content, - Sheps told the audience.
No country in the world has such a strict restriction of the beer market, the unpredictable introduction of new and new illogical prohibitions, which are justified by the alleged fight against alcohol abuse.
The brewer said that many legislative prohibitions designed to reduce the level of alcohol abuse do not have much effect, yet new initiatives are constantly appearing.
Most of all by beer makers hit the ban imposed since this year to sell alcohol in kiosks.
“We have lost 35,000 consumers right away,” said Isaac Sheps.
The brewers have two forecasts for next year.
Optimistic is the one Sheppard said: the sales of a foam drink will remain at the same level.
Pessimistic - will fall by another 2-3 percent.
To preserve their profits, businessmen are forced to move from varieties intended for the mass consumer to the "premium" class: beer will become smaller, but it will cost more.
Meanwhile, the radical consequences of the drop in sales with a small amount of alcohol are not yet visible.
“According to my observations, the level of alcoholism remains at about the same level,” said Dr. Alexey Sotnikov.
True, the proportion of patients who consume surrogates of strong drinks, as well as those who "submitted" to alcohol-containing tonic drinks such as "Jaguar", while ten years ago, it was "beer" alcoholism that prevailed.
In September, 600 people were fired from the Ford automobile plant in Vsevolozhsk.
According to the unions, all fired workers were compensated.
However, much more acute than the problems of workers, the question of reducing production in the region arises.
Deputy of the ZakS region Alexei Etmanov at the meeting said that at the plant of the company "Ford" in Vsevolozhsk reduced about 600 people.
According to him, this happened in September: then under the voluntary dismissal program, which was developed together with the union of the organization, about 600 people left the factory.
Workers who decided to resign on their own, were offered "golden parachutes" in the amount of several salaries.
As a result, the overwhelming majority left their jobs on their own.
However, according to Etmanov, such a number of people is a whole night shift.
I don't think that's going to be limited.
However, the authorities do not plan to adopt any programs to support regional enterprises in a difficult situation in the next two years," he explained, adding that when adopting the budget, the government does not take into account the stagnation of production in the region and the large reduction of jobs.
At Ford, this information is not refuted or confirmed.
We are waiting for a response from the company, and as soon as it appears, we will be sure to publish it.
Talks about reducing workers at the Ford plant in Vsevolozhsk have been going on for a long time.
For example, the company’s plans to fire 600 people became known in September.
Earlier, the plant announced the suspension of production of cars.
As a reason at the plant called the drop in demand for cars "Ford" in Russia.
According to Petrostat, after nine months of 2013, the volume of industrial production in Lenoblasti decreased by 5.4%.
The production of vehicles and equipment decreased by 11.5%.
In the United States, you can use mobile phones during take-off and landing of the aircraft.
The new rules for the safe use of mobile devices during take-off and landing of the airliner have been approved in the United States, reports the BBC.
American airlines are expected to allow passengers to use smartphones and tablets throughout the flight, the new rules will come into effect by the end of 2013.
However, connection to the Internet for receiving and sending emails will be prohibited during flights at altitudes below 3 kilometers.
Due to the danger of interference with aircraft radio equipment, cellular voice communications will still be banned.
Thus, air passengers will be allowed to read e-books, play games on tablets and other gadgets, and watch videos during domestic and international flights.
Before the rules are adopted, airlines will be required to check the safety of the use of electronic devices during the flight.
In addition, airlines will have to convince the U.S. Federal Civil Aviation Administration that they will be able to cope with the alleged impact of mobile devices on aircraft engineering and aircraft control devices.
According to the source, following the example of the United States, it is also possible that the current rules for the use of electronic devices in flights will be revised in the UK.
Behind the "Russian Mafia" in the US has finally established a new name - "Brothers Circle"
This week, the blacklist of the “Russian Mafia” in America was replenished with new names and four companies.
The U.S. Treasury Department has included three representatives of Russia, two citizens of Uzbekistan and an Israeli in the "Brothers' Circle".
One of the Russians was the famous singer Grigory Leps, who is suspected by the United States of transporting money for members of the group.
A total of 22 people on the U.S. blacklist are members of the Brotherhood Circle and six affiliated organizations.
However, many experts express doubts that such an organization actually exists.
“The ‘Brothers’ Circle’ statement is more like an attempt to unite divided criminal groups,” said Mark Galeotti, an expert on organized crime and a professor at the University of New York.
According to him, the “Brothers’ Circle” reflects the popular perception of the “Russian Mafia”.
“I have not met anyone in the Russian law enforcement agencies or anywhere else who would confirm the existence of such a criminal organization,” the US Center for the Study of Corruption and Organized Crime quoted Galeotti as saying.
With Mr. Galeotti, George Mason University professor Liz Shelley also agreed.
“If they act together, it is more like a criminal network than an organization,” the Center for the Study of Corruption and Organized Crime said.
In the middle of last year, Mark Galeotti made the assumption that the Brotherhood Circle unites more closely the Russian thief in the law of Aslan Ousoyan, known as Dad Hassan.
The criminal authority was killed in January of this year.
Thus, the activities of Lasha Shushanashvili and Zachary Kalashov, who supplemented the list in 2012, were closely related to Grandfather Hasan, and another member of the list, Temuri Mirzoev, was Grandfather Hasan's nephew.
Nonetheless, Mr. Galeotti noted that some individuals had nothing to do with Ousoyan.
In his view, they were all united by common financial and criminal interests, such as the supply of drugs from Afghanistan.
Meanwhile, the scandal surrounding the inclusion in the "Brothers' Circle" of Gregory Leps - the favorite singer of the Russian President Vladimir Putin - attracted the Kremlin's attention.
Naturally, we expect to receive more detailed information from our American counterparts, in connection with which it was made such a decision, why it was included in such lists, - said the spokesman of the head of state Dmitry Peskov.
In any case, he (Leps) is a citizen of the Russian Federation.
As well as the interests of all Russian citizens, his interests will be protected.
Head of Gazprom Alexey Miller says the pipeline in Bulgaria marks a new era in the gas sphere
The start of the construction of the South Stream gas pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of the largest energy projects in Europe, the head of Gazprom said.
“Today, a landmark event took place: the construction of the Bulgarian section of the South Stream gas pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe, began,” Gazprom President Alexei Miller said in a statement Thursday.
This project is a key element of the energy security of the entire European continent.
South Stream is designed to diversify Russia’s export routes through Europe.
The dispute over the contract between Gazprom and its partners in Ukraine, in which most of Russia’s gas destined for Europe is located, increases the level of risk for conventional routes, officials say.
Miller said that a direct connection with Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are eliminated “forever”.
Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from South Stream at a reduced price as soon as the entire project starts operating in 2015.
Gazprom said construction should begin in other countries located further along the pipeline route by the end of the year.
The annual design capacity of the pipeline is 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.

Two YMCA employees charged with sexual offences even before charges against Jonathan Lord, the Royal Commission has learned
Two YMCA NSW employees were charged with sexual offences against children before charges were filed in 2011 against a Caringbah childcare worker Jonathan Lord, the Royal Commission on Sexual Violence against Children said.
But the commission’s opening statement said it had “never dealt with cases of sexual abuse of children within its organization.”
Chief Executive Philip Heir was asked about one case when a YMCA employee was charged with child pornography offences and another case when a gym instructor at YMCA Caringbah Hall was convicted of sexual crimes against children under his supervision in 1991.
Mr. Hayr told Gail Ferness, a lawyer assisting the commission, that he knew about the first case but did not know about the second.
He acknowledged that the YMCA also admitted inaccuracy in its introductory speech to the commission, arguing that “there were external audits by the YMCA that recognized that the YMCA is at the forefront of ensuring children’s safety.”
The Evidence Commission said the YMCA was notified that it received the second of four possible evaluations from the end of the quality audit conducted by the Department of Education and Communities in August of this year.
Mr. Hair, who joined the YMCA when he was 21, acknowledged that he and the management below had made a mistake in hiring Lord and had not been able to ensure a clear understanding by staff of their obligations in relation to reporting violations of children's safety policy.
Earlier this year, Lord was convicted of sexual offences against 12 boys for two years of his work at the YMCA.
He was imprisoned for at least six years.
But Mr. Hayer rejected the suggestion that YMCA’s corporate ethics prevented employees from reporting Lord’s violations of children’s safety.
Employees testified that they observed violations, including that Lord was alone with the children, personally cared for them, kneeled them to himself, said he loved one of them and allowed them to play with their mobile phone.
Danielle Oxwell, who was under Lord's guidance and asked her to teach her how to protect children because she was concerned about his behavior, testified that she had found Jackie Barnat, the child care manager at YMCA's office in Karingbah, who was Lord's head of staff, "very frightening and often difficult".
The Executive Director said that he did not accept employees' explanations that they were embarrassed to report the situation to their senior managers.
Rather, according to him, their friendship with the Lord diverted them from the thought of the need to report him.
Mr. Hayer said he had submitted his opinion to the YMCA Council of New South Wales that the lesson for the organization from the “Jonathan Lord incident” was not “concerning the provision of information” by employees, and the council agreed with him.
Mr. Hayer said the decision to force employees to sign confidentiality agreements shortly after the indictment was made by YMCA’s Director General of Child Custody, Liam Whitley.
He said it was meant to prevent the corruption of the evidence, but at the same time, it was “overdoed” and the decision was poorly implemented.
The New South Wales YMCA was not a child-safe organization during Jonathan Lord’s 2009-2011 tenure, Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University told the committee.
He said there were “serious problems” with recruiting, selecting, instructing, training and monitoring staff.
Hearings are postponed until December 20.
Fashion Week in Sao Paulo.
In her homeland, she is considered not only a model, but a real star.
Despite Giselle Bundschen leaving her job for a while, distracted by motherhood, on these days and this week she came specially.
A long absence did not prevent her from retaining her place on the podium and on the pedestal.
Giselle remains the highest-paid supermodel in the world.
This time she participated in the defile of the brand "Kolchchi".
The finale of the fashion week is usually the most interesting shows.
Like the one organized by stylist Lino Villaventura.
For more than 30 years, in parallel with the production of ready-to-wear luxury, the designer has been actively working in the theater and cinema, designing performances and developing costumes for many famous paintings.
In total, more than 30,000 companies and companies that are relevant to the textile industry and the fashion world participated in the final fashion week in São Paulo.
It is one of the most dynamically developing sectors of production, employing more than 2 million Brazilians, and annual turnover reaches $ 50 billion.
Tony Blair said he would take the chance to return as Britain's prime minister, but acknowledged that the return is unlikely.
In an interview on the eve of the fifth anniversary of his resignation, the 59-year-old politician outlined his views on various aspects of domestic policy.
Since his resignation in June 2007, after ten years in leadership, Blair has largely avoided discussing British politics, limiting most of his comments to foreign affairs and his role as ambassador in the Middle East peacekeepers' quarter.
Asked if he would return to the post of Prime Minister, Blair said, according to the London Evening Standard, “Yes, of course, but it’s unlikely to happen, so....”
Milan head coach Massimiliano Allegri expressed regret over the no-score in the match of the 10th round of the Italian championship with Lazio.
The specialist also noted that the failures at the start are due to a series of injuries of leading players.
I am very sorry that we have not been able to win," Tmw quoted Allegri as saying.
The team played a good match, creating 3-4 good opportunities.
In the first half, we did not allow anything for Lazio.
In the second Roman added, but in general I can not say that we lost concentration.
We had to win.
Last season, we did the task of getting into the Champions League.
We are now behind schedule, but this is due to a series of injuries of key players.
Rami and Honda?
They are very good players, with character.
But our team is still good.
Take a look at Kaka, who held a high-level meeting.
Experts in equestrian events, who are going to Cardiff to fight for the Horse of the Year award, knew that the competition would be very high.
But no one was ready for the appearance of three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
Not even a schoolboy, just a few months before that, this kid with his pet Shetland pony Toffy rice ran through three rounds to easily take the main prize, leaving 30 adult rivals far behind.
This inseparable couple – of the same height – received high marks for appearance, behavior and style at the annual competition, which is held by the equestrian center Sunnybank in the town of Radry near Cardiff.
Going to the general view against the backdrop of men and women in elegant hats, he moved his hat and proudly spent around two-year-old Toffi.
The judges praised Fenton for his not at all developed innate ability to handle horses.
And Toffy received the highest rating for appearance and character.
Fenton was gifted to Toffy on his third birthday in March last year, and since then he has been practicing Shetland pony every day.
His 30-year-old mother, Donna, said: “Fenton and Toffy are a wonderful duo.”
They had a lot of rivals, but these two left with a gold cup and rose.
It was just his second appearance with Toffy, and we were all thrilled when he won.
Unknown people in the arena considered him so phenomenal that they wanted to take a photo with him.
This boy from the village of Nantigo, near Abbey Vale in South Wales, follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been exhibiting horses for more than 10 years.
Ms Howells said: “The whole audience was shocked, and everyone shouted approving shouts and knocked.”
He ran through the sand along the length of the arena and, although he looked so tiny, did his job perfectly.
Fenton is crazy about animals - he loves horses, tractors and farms, and he has two chickens he takes care of.
Judging by how he started, he will soon be taking part in Horse of the Year — and I’m sure he’ll do well.
A spokesman for the annual horse show said: “Fenton is only three years old, but he knows how to handle his pony.”
Together they are a great team.
The judges noted Fenton and Toffy for their appearance and how they presented themselves on the show ring.
They rate the consistency of the pony and breeder's performance - Fenton and Toffy were the best in the ring.
I’m sure Fenton helped with his attractive outfit, he really looked good in his role.
The Chinese newspaper that published the appeal "is subject to reorganization"
The Chinese newspaper, which issued a first-line call for the release of the reporter accused of defamation, needs to be reorganized, the press regulator said.
The Guangzhou-based newspaper New Express made an unexpected public statement requesting the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Chen later admitted on television that he took bribes for writing false articles about a state-owned company.
Now, the “New Express” must go through the “complete error correction process,” as the regulator reports.
The order for “correction of errors” came from the Guangdong Administration in the sphere of press and publications, radio, film and television.
A preliminary investigation revealed that Yangcheng Evening News Group, which owns New Express, published several false reports about Zoomlion’s listing between September 2012 and August 2013.
“The editorial board of the New Express has been disoriented,” the regulator said in a statement.
He reports that the decision has been made to “impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou in the form of revocation of his reporter license.”
He also instructed Yangcheng Evening News Group to conduct a full correction of the errors in the New Express and recommended it to conduct an investigation into the situation-related officials of the newspaper and to immediately make changes to the leadership of the New Express.
Mr. Chen wrote several articles for the New Express in which he claimed financial violations in a construction equipment company called Zoomlion.
After he was detained, his newspaper published two calls for his release on the front line, stating that it supported his journalistic activity.
But Mr. Chen then appeared on state television with an admission that he was publishing fake articles for money.
“In this case, I hurt Zoomlion, as well as the entire news media industry and its ability to earn public trust,” he told state broadcaster CCTV.
I did it mainly because I was thirsty for money and fame.
I realized my guilt.
After Chen's confessions, the New Express posted an apology on the front page, saying the newspaper had failed to properly check his reports.
Recently, several high-ranking suspects made confessions on television.
Experts say the practice of beating confessions in China remains widespread despite recent amendments to laws prohibiting authorities from forcing anyone to self-determination.
Discovered U.S.-Mexico Tunnel for Trafficking Drugs Equipped with Own Railway
One of the most complex tunnels for drug smuggling between the United States and Mexico has been found, equipped with its own lighting, ventilation and electric rail system.
The U.S. authorities have described this four-by-three-foot-wide tunnel as one of the most complex secret moves they have ever discovered.
The zigzag tunnel, which spans nearly six football fields, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, USA.
This area is filled with inconspicuous warehouses, which facilitates the hidden loading of drugs into trucks.
The tunnel was closed before any drugs were passed through it indiscriminately, authorities said.
According to court documents, law enforcement officers confiscated eight and a half tons of marijuana and 327 pounds of cocaine when the tunnel was discovered.
Three men, who were alleged to have worked as drivers, were charged with storing marijuana and cocaine for distribution purposes.
In case of conviction, they are threatened with prison terms of 10 years to life imprisonment.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers use extensive underground drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth major passageway discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Several of the largest tunnels were discovered in central Mexico after harvesting marijuana in October, which put the drug cartels on a difficult task of delivering their product quickly to consumers.
In 2010, authorities found a 700-yard-long passageway equipped with railroad tracks that ran from the kitchen of one of Tijuana’s homes to two San Diego warehouses.
Pensions have been rising in Belarus since November
Pensions have been rising in Belarus since November of this year, according to the BELTA correspondent in the main pension department of the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection.
From 1 November of this year, the adjustment of the average wage of employees in the Republic, applied in the previous recalculation of pensions, will be carried out, with an increase of its amount by 5.4%, and the corresponding recalculation of labor pensions will be carried out in accordance with the decree of October 21, 2013 No. 4 of the year.
As a result of the recalculation from November, the working age pensions will increase, on average, by 5.3%.
The average pension by age will be Br2 million 295,000.
The increase in pensions will affect 2.4 million residents of the republic.
The expenditures of the Social Security Fund of the Ministry of Labour and Social Protection of Belarus on the payment of pensions in increased amounts from November this year will increase by Br274.3 billion per month.
Simultaneously with the recalculation of labour pensions in November of this year, minimum and social pensions, allowances, increases and supplements to pensions will be recalculated due to the increase in the budget of the minimum livelihood on average per capita.
The BPM for the period from 1 November 2013 to 31 January 2014 was approved by the Government in the amount of Br1 47 thousand 530 - 2.1% higher than the one in force from 1 August to 31 October.
Accordingly, from November 1, the amounts of minimum labour pensions, social pensions and allowances, increases and supplements to pensions will be increased by 2.1%.
In Belarus for the payment of pensions, taking into account the increases in 2013, more than Br53 trillion.-0-
British police hand Assange notice of extradition
British police today handed over a notice of extradition to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who took refuge at the Ecuadorian embassy in London and applied for asylum.
Scotland Yard said they had given the 40-year-old Australian a “official request to surrender” with a request to appear at the police station, adding that if this requirement was not met, he would continue to be arrested.
Assange is threatened with extradition to Sweden on charges of sexual offences after he exhausted his powers under British law when the Supreme Court dismissed his appeal for extradition earlier this month.
Fearing that Stockholm would hand him over to the U.S., he fled to the Ecuadorian embassy in London on 19 June, seeking political asylum from that South American country.
Scotland Yard “given a 40-year-old man a formal surrender requirement that obliges him to arrive at the police station on the day and time of our choice,” a spokesman said.
It continues to violate the terms of the bail.
The embassy refused to comment on the notification to the police.
Assange fears he will be extradited from Sweden to the U.S. to face possible charges of espionage following the publication of more than 250,000 U.S. diplomatic depositions on the anti-secret website WikiLeaks.
A driver who drove 130 miles per hour with a hot drink between his legs was fined <0xC2><0xA3>1,000.
The driver was fined <0xC2><0xA3>1,000 for driving at speeds of up to 130 mph (210 km/h) with a hot drink held between his legs.
The 35-year-old Andrew Howey of Tippry, Essex, was spotted driving his Mercedes Benz on the A120 track in Braintree on May 27.
When the police stopped him, they found a drink to carry between his legs.
In the Colchester World Court, Howie admitted the charge of driving without due diligence and attention.
The addition of seven penalty points to his driver's license led to his being given a six-month driving ban.
Hoey also required to pay the costs of <0xC2><0xA3>90 and an additional fee of <0xC2><0xA3>100 to help victims of crime.
A tax for foreign property owners will cause the London bubble to burst
The Treasury has carried out a preliminary assessment of the capital gains tax measure, but is awaiting a final decision from Mr. Osborne, who introduced in the 2012 budget a state duty rate of 7% for homes worth more than <0xC2><0xA3>2 million and annual payments for buyers who choose to own homes.
At the moment, the state tax on residential properties in the Westminster, Kensington and Chelsea areas, which amounted to <0xC2><0xA3>708 million in the 2012/13 financial year, already exceeds the total for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the northeast, northwest, and York.
Mr. Cook said: “After the increase in the state tax on expensive homes and the introduction of related anti-avoidance legislation, it is very difficult to argue that the taxation of expensive real estate is low regardless of the influence of the outdated municipal tax system.”
“But this move could result in some foreign investors reluctant to buy a property in London or current owners not wanting to sell it,” he added.
The value of first-class real estate — the top 5-10% of the housing market at the price — in London’s rich south-western belt, which stretches from Fulham to Wimbledon, rose by a record 11.8% over the past year.
According to a study by Savills, prices in central London continued to show steady growth of 5.6 per cent year-on-year, but they were overshadowed by an actively developing “home market” with price spikes in the southwest, north (7.4 per cent) and east (6.5 per cent) of the city.
Scientists have shed light on how the movements of the dog's tail are related to her mood.
Earlier studies have shown that happy dogs twist their tails to the right (from a dog’s point of view), while anxious dogs swing their tails predominantly to the left.
But now scientists say that other members of the dog family may notice these subtle differences in tailing and react to them.
Professor Giorgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at Trent University, says: “It is well known that people on the left and right sides of the brain are differently involved in the formation of stimuli that cause positive or negative emotions.”
Here we have tried to look at this and other species.
He added that just like humans, the right part of the brain controls the left side of the body and vice versa, and the two hemispheres play different roles in emotions.
To find out more about how dogs respond to the diverse tailings of other dogs, researchers watched the animals as they watched movies about other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of the animals and analyzed their behavior.
Probably soon we will understand why their tails are sometimes pointed in one direction and sometimes in the other.
Professor Vallortigara said: “We showed dogs videos with dogs – either naturalistic versions or a silhouette to get rid of any other distorting factors, and we could manipulate the movement of the tail and direct the tail more to the left or right.”
When the animals saw that in the rest, a non-expressive dog was moving its tail to the right (from the point of view of a waving-tailed dog), they remained completely relaxed.
But when they noticed that the tail was tilting predominantly to the left (again from the point of view of the dog’s tilting tail), their heartbeat increased and they looked anxious.
Professor Vallortigara said he did not think that the dogs deliberately communicated with each other through these movements.
In fact, he believes that dogs have learned from their experience what movements they should worry about and what they shouldn’t.
He notes: “If there are several encounters with other dogs, and their tails are often twisted in one direction to be more friendly, and the right side gives less friendly behavior, the dog reacts based on this experience.”
The researchers say these findings can give owners, veterinarians and trainers a deeper understanding of their pet’s emotions.
Dog behavior expert John Bradshaw, a guest scientist at the University of Bristol’s veterinary school, said this was not the first study to check whether left and right sides matter to dogs.
Last year, a team of scientists from Lincoln University found that dogs turn their heads to the left if they look at an aggressive dog, and to the right if they look at a happy dog.
And in another scientific paper from the University of Victoria in Canada, he reported: “Dogs were more likely to approach a robot dog when the forking of its tail was directed to the left rather than the right, rather than becoming alarmed, the opposite behavior to the Italian study.”
He said the differences could be due to the fact that dogs in various studies did not fully perceive animals in movies or robot dogs as dogs.
It could be a useful study of how dogs react to real dogs, he explained.
“While there is enough evidence from different mammals that the two hemispheres of the brain are used for different purposes, many details are yet to be clarified, and dogs are no exception,” he said.
However, given the ease with which their behavior can be recorded, we will probably soon understand why their tails are sometimes pointed in one direction and sometimes in the other.
Arctic Monkeys postponed concert in Glasgow due to Alex Turner's illness
The rock band Arctic Monkeys postponed their concert in Glasgow after its vocalist was diagnosed with laryngitis.
This Sheffield band was scheduled to perform at the city’s Hydro concert venue on Friday.
However, the illness of vocalist Alex Turner forced them to postpone the show.
The band’s statement came after she was forced to postpone the concert at the LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on its official website, Arctic Monkeys said: “After the decision to move the show to the Birmingham LG Arena tonight and after seeking medical attention, Arctic Monkeys should also postpone the show at the Hydro venue in Glasgow on Friday, November 1.
“Alex Turner was diagnosed with laryngitis, and unfortunately, he is unable to speak.”
The show at the LG Arena in Birmingham will now take place on November 20, and the show in Glasgow at the Hydro venue will take place on November 21.
All tickets for these shows remain valid.
We would like to apologize to all ticket holders for any inconvenience this has caused them.

Pope Francis to name first cardinals in February
Pope Francis will inaugurate the new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time in his term of office on February 22, the Vatican announced on Thursday.
Cardinals are the supreme clergy in the Catholic Church after the pope, and it is they who elect the pope, so Francis will appoint his first group of people who will ultimately participate in the election of his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, after reaching the age of 80, he can no longer participate in the election of the pope - this is the prerogative of the group of 120 "cardinal electors".
Announcing this news, Vatican spokesman Father Federico Lombardi said that before the inauguration ceremony, a meeting of all current cardinals, known as the consistory, will be held.
“Pope Francis has decided to announce in advance his decision to convene a consistory in February in order to facilitate the planning of other meetings with the participation of cardinals from different parts of the world,” Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said the number of cardinal-electors is likely to fall by February.
He said that the pope usually calls as many cardinals as necessary to bring the number of cardinal electors back to 120, as well as as many cardinals over the age of 80 as he wishes.
The Consistory next year will be of great importance because it will be the first since Francis was elected in March this year, Valero said.
At the moment, there is some kind of bias in favour of Europe and especially in favour of Italy.
“It will be interesting to see if the new pope will appoint cardinals from other regions of the world to restore balance,” he said.
Forty percent of Catholics live in South America, but they are represented by a small number of cardinals.
They will also be the first elected cardinals since the formation of the Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from around the world tasked with looking for ways to reform the church.
In the past, my dad decided everything on his own.
“Now Francis has chosen eight cardinals to help him,” Valero said.
He said it was "quite possible" that Francis would turn to the cardinals for advice.
We haven’t been in this situation before, for the first time.
Valero said that the popes usually erected bishops from large parishes, but Francis was "full of surprises - so we don't know who he will name."
GM recalls a number of new pickups in the US to refine the back of the seats
General Motors Co is recalling nearly 19,000 brand-new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra 2014 pickups to address the backrest tilt adjustment problems, according to a notification from U.S. automotive safety regulators on Friday.
On some of the pickups, the front seats may have a defect in the mechanism of the back tilt.
As a result, the seat backs do not comply with federal safety standards for motor vehicles on headrests.
“In the event of a car hit in the back, the head restraint may not adequately protect the driver and passengers, increasing the risk of injury,” the National Road Traffic Safety Administration said in a statement posted on its website.
The recalled models were manufactured between August 1 and September 10.
The launch of the GM pickups began in June and represents the most important launch of the car into series production for the leading American automaker since its restructuring due to bankruptcy in 2009.
GM informed pickup owners of the defect in the first half of October.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration could not consider notifying owners of the government's 16-day shutdown, which slowed car sales growth in October.
Sales of the Silverado and Sierra pickups, which were upgraded for the 2014 model range, grew by about 20 percent in the first 10 months of this year, GM said on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado pickups and 16,503 Sierra pickups.
GM’s shares on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday afternoon rose 1.4 percent to $37.47.
The cry of desperation of Obama's electorate
I voted for President Obama twice, sharing the hope of a change.
He says Obama has allowed Republican obstructionism to nullify praise efforts.
Obstructionism cannot serve as a justification for problems with the Obama-reformed health system website, drone attacks
The memoirs of the Obama campaign of 2008 are a sad reminder of what could have been
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second-year student at Harvard Medical School.
I am reading a very sad book these days.
I thought this book would inspire me in times of disappointment in the second year of medical school and revive in me a sense of hope.
It’s called Courage for Victory, and it’s memoirs of Barack Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign.
When I finish writing reports on my patients in the evening and go to bed, this book brings me back to a time when politics inspired millions of people and speeches could take a breather.
The victory in the election was impressive, and news leaders paused to make sense of this historic moment.
My classmates wept with joy, and my parents kept all the newspapers they could find.
A young team of strategists had to come to the White House, and the people were ready for change.
At the time of Obama’s accession to office in 2008, his support was 82%.
Then I close the book.
Returning to the present is a rude awakening, like pulling out of a dream.
It is difficult to remember those days of optimism – they seem a distant memory, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
Over the years since I dropped my first ballot, the changes have really happened.
It was something I couldn't even imagine.
I pay tribute to Obama for his great and varied achievements, from the adoption of the Affordable Care Act to the withdrawal of our military from Iraq, the repeal of the “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” rule, and the assassination of Osama bin Laden.
Moreover, I believe that party obstructionism has blocked too many attempts to advance our country forward: immigration reform, the possibility of choosing public health and the closure of the Guantanamo base among others.
But after countless times when I was on the side of the Obama administration, defending it from colleagues and peers, I’ve run out of explanations that I can provide.
I have reached a point of political despair.
The obstructionism of Republicans cannot explain the authorization of foreign leaders to intercept or strike innocent children in other countries by drones.
It cannot explain the collection of data on Americans’ privacy by the National Security Agency or the prosecution of whistleblowers who reveal wrongdoing by the government.
It cannot explain the murder of American citizen Anwar al-Awlaki without trial and investigation or non-compliance with the limits of state funding and spending during the presidential campaigns.
He cannot justify the report’s findings that the White House’s efforts to silence the media are “the most aggressive ... since the Nixon administration.”
And lately, he can’t justify the fact that he can’t develop a simple website for more than three years after signing the Affordable Care Act.
I don't know if I should have expected that.
Should I have understood at the age of 18 that the leadership can contradict the political campaigns that precede it?
It is obvious that working in an elected position is not a predictable programme of action, as our public dialogue will be shaped by an opposition political party and by accidental events such as the massacre in Newtown.
Nonetheless, all of the examples I have mentioned above show that they were largely the administration's own choice.
And that's what worries me the most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was full of enthusiasm about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney was an incomprehensible and rude alternative, it seemed that he was unable to make a decision on his own policy or views.
I thought that in his second term, Obama, freed from the pressure of future elections, would justify the hopes we have heard of for so long.
However, when this week’s Obama rating fell below 45%, it became much harder to go back to 2008 through this book.
This makes me anxious about the many promises that have fled.
This week, I read the part of the book that describes how Clinton defeated Obama in the primary elections in Pennsylvania.
At a meeting to analyze the reasons for the failure, he told his employees that they should return to normal and stay true to their goal.
“I want us to regain our attractiveness,” he said.
We need to remember who we are.”
Five years have passed, Mr. President, and I completely agree with you.
The views expressed in this commentary belong exclusively to Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer claims MP Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest in childcare leave.
Billionaire MP Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest in childcare leave because his daughters can get pregnant and benefit from it.
This mining tycoon, who has an unresolved $6 million carbon tax dispute, made this statement at a time when he was trying to evade questions about whether he had a conflict.
The Palmer United Party can control up to four votes in the Senate, which may be crucial in deciding whether to abolish carbon taxes and mining.
But Mr. Palmer argued that the conflict of interest could only be with the ministers, and said that Mr. Abbott’s daughters would personally benefit from political measures.
“He has a major conflict of interest when it comes to paid childcare leave, because if any of these daughters get pregnant, he will have a direct interest in whether they will get leave or not,” Palmer said.
Two months after the election, the electoral commission officially declared Mr. Palmer a winner in the battle for a seat from the Sunshine Coast constituency of Fairfax with a 53-vote margin after the recount of votes.
Mr. Palmer called for a review of the electoral counting procedure in order to speed up the process.
The daughters of Tony Abbott Francis and Bridget.
Should a decision on these elections be taken two months after we voted?
“We need to have a better system,” he said.
Why shouldn’t we have such a system so that we can come in, enter our data into the computer, vote immediately, and get the result at 6:30 p.m. that same evening?
Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of pencils for bulletins.
Is it because they can erase the result if someone doesn't like it?
Using a pencil nowadays seems strange.
The Electoral Commission is exploring the possibilities for electronic voting and has recently published a joint discussion paper with New Zealand.
Palmer, 59, said his program includes an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and he will take his new job “very seriously.”
A public office involves service to society.
“We are not pursuing any awards other than the gratitude of history for being able to serve this district at a critical moment,” he said.
RBS Removes Two Foreign Exchange Traders
The Royal Bank of Scotland has temporarily suspended two traders in its foreign exchange operations division, according to two people familiar with the situation, which is another confirmation that the global scrutiny by regulators of alleged manipulations in the foreign exchange market is rapidly gaining momentum.
Some of the world’s largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are cooperating with regulators in investigations into the world’s largest financial market, with daily turnover of $5.3 trillion.
These two traders will be the first RBS employees to be suspended in the course of an ongoing investigation that evokes a scandal related to manipulations of the interbank LIBOR rate.
Refusing to comment on the suspensions, the bank confirmed that this month it received requests for information from regulators.
“Our ongoing investigation into this issue is ongoing and we are fully cooperating with FCA and our other regulators,” the bank said in a statement.
Last month, senior officials said RBS had passed the email records and instant messages it received and sent to its former trader, the UK’s regulatory body, the Financial Activity Control Authority (FCA).
This trader, Richard Asher, left RBS in 2010 and is known to have been given a leave of absence for his current position as the head of European spot currency trading at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, the head of European spot trading at Citi, went on vacation this week, while Matt Gardiner, a former senior currency trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended from work by Standard Chartered Bank this week.
None of these traders have been charged with any violations.
Mr. Asher’s instant messaging contact group included bankers from Barclays and Citigroup, according to informed persons.
UBS reported this week that it had taken action against some of its employees after Swiss regulator Finma said it was investigating alleged currency market manipulations in a number of Swiss banks.
At least six regulators in the world – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss antitrust body Weko, the FCA, the U.S. Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are considering allegations that bankers have conspired to impact the foreign exchange market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also started internal checks or received requests for information from regulators, people familiar with the situation said.
Banks have been looking at instant messaging and emails for several years in search of criminal cases.
News of the verifications has swirled traders in the area of activity, which in recent years has been one of the largest sources of income of trading units of investment banks, which this year, however, has faced difficulties due to the fact that low currency volatility reduces favorable opportunities for merchants.
Some bankers have tried to mitigate the seriousness of the situation, saying that a large and highly liquid foreign exchange market is virtually impossible to manipulate, but senior traders say this is not always true.
According to the senior trader, despite the huge volume of daily trading on the foreign exchange market, the fragmentation of liquidity between different trading platforms and the wider use by banks of their internal platforms means that “you can start to influence the market at a very small price.”
The news came on the same day that Credit Suisse announced it had fired one of the traders in its London Stock Exchange trading division this week after it caused losses of nearly $6 million at the end of last year.
The Bank has immediately notified the relevant authorities and is cooperating with its regulators.
“We are confident that the trader acted alone and that this issue was localized,” Credit Suisse said.
Supreme Court upholds Obama’s health care law
The U.S. Supreme Court today ruled that Barack Obama’s landmark health law is constitutional, a major victory for the Obama administration.
Voting 5 to 4, the judges ruled that individual orders under the Patient Protection and Affordable Healthcare Act requiring citizens to purchase health insurance before 2014 or pay a fine are constitutional in accordance with the government’s tax powers.
The president of the Supreme Court, John Roberts, joined four more liberal members of the court, while judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy were against.
The court also left the remaining sections of the 2,700-page law in force and further ruled that the requirement of the Health Act that states increase Medicaid compliance, otherwise they would lose all federal funding for Medicaid, is not unconstitutionally enforceable.
26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business have filed a lawsuit to block the bill.
The law was strongly opposed by each of the main Republican presidential candidates during the 2012 primary election season, including alleged candidate Mitt Romney.
Soccer - the reason for the difference?
In the State Duma, as part of the "Open Tribune", politicians and experts talked about how to preserve the national peace in Russia.
Among the proposals was to ban football in the North Caucasus, because from this game - only scandals and dissension.
Speaker Sergey Naryshkin recalled recent events in Biryulev and said that in order to reduce the "degree of tension in society", policies and the media must be correct in their statements.
Probably, he meant the recent scandal with Vladimir Zhirinovsky, who in one of the TV shows threatened to surround the Caucasus with barbed wire, if they do not want to limit the fertility ...
All speakers also spoke about the measures to regulate migration from the CIS countries, and about the measures to harmonize relations between the peoples inhabiting Russia, which gave the discussion a nuisance.
Maxim Grigoriev said that the events in Birulev - "a model conflict that could have been predicted", but "too many people and authorities answer these questions", and seven nanny child without an eye.
The concept of multiculturalism, which Europe has long practiced with regard to migrants, in the opinion of the public, has failed, and it is necessary to find its way.
The historian Yuri Petrov placed great hopes on a new single textbook of history.
"There is still a need to create a guide to the history of the culture of the peoples of the country, so that schoolchildren in Tatarstan know what kind of people live in Dagestan, and vice versa," he said.
Gennady Zyuganov proposed criminal responsibility for "calls for the dismemberment of Russia": "If the United States says on the radio that you should give Alaska to Russia, then you will be arrested and given 20 years in prison!"
Vladimir Zhirinovsky tried very hard not to "inflame".
As usual, he blamed journalists who bring sick and acute national problems to public discussion: "In the dust of controversy, there is little to say!"
The leader of the faction "United Russia" Vladimir Vasilyev immediately advised journalists to conclude a "charter" and agree to talk about this topic carefully, and then the same commitments can be taken by politicians.
We have passed about 30 laws that regulate migration, and the order in general is established, Mr. Vasilyev said.
As an example, he cited a law that entrusts regional and municipal authorities with the responsibility for inter-ethnic peace on their territory.
But Lyudmila Andrichenko did not share the enthusiasm about this law: there is no "clear idea of what is the adaptation of migrants, about its mechanisms and limits.
Therefore, the subjects will interpret the scope of these powers differently.
In addition, the municipalities do not have the personnel necessary to deal with such complex issues, there are no funds, and the methodological recommendations that they could use, the center does not give them.
The head of the Duma Committee on Nationalities, Gajimet Safaraliev, proposed the creation of a special department with the scary name "Ministry of National Security", which would deal with national policy issues.
But Valery Tishkov, who headed a similar department in the 1990s, which was subsequently abolished, opposed it.
It is enough to have at the federal level a special person, a "minister without a portfolio", to whom you could turn if anything.
"We are going around the border, the shells are firing, it is very important for representatives of different ethnicities and religions to oppose provocations together, and this work should receive decent information support," said Vsevolod Chaplin, a representative of the RPC for social relations.
No neutrality of the state with regard to dangerous ideologies, including religious ones, should, in his opinion, be.
Here, Oleg Nilov led the discussion in an unexpected direction: "More talented people than in Chechnya or Dagestan still need to be searched, but they are pushed in the wrong direction, in the wrong way," he said.
"The wrong way" is the development of football: "The footballer is beaten by the whole crowd, then the flags burn, then the comrades throw stones at each other...
Maybe we don't need that kind of football?
There is another sport called rugby.
"They will not be equal in the world in this kind of sport!" - said hotly.
No one will play rugby in the Caucasus! - Mr. Zhirinovsky immediately intervened.
You're gonna offer them more curling!
You need to know the national characteristics, it's like Georgian "Zaporozhets" to offer"...
In Yaroslavl, representatives of the Moscow club were distinguished by wild behavior on the stands - during the game with the local club.
Football will have to be banned all over the country.
The head of the control and disciplinary committee of the Russian Federation, Arthur Grigoryantz, said that "Kuban" was fined 500,000 rubles, reports the correspondent of "SE" Philip PAPENKOV from the House of Football.
Such sanctions against the Krasnodar club were applied for burning the flag of Dagestan by fans on the stands during the home game of the 14th round against Anji.
The meeting was attended by representatives of both clubs, a person from the RFPL.
We looked at all the available materials.
For the wrongful behavior of spectators "Kuban" is fined 500,000 rubles.
Google, Samsung and Huawei filed patent lawsuits against Nortel
The group, which owns thousands of former Nortel patents, filed a series of patent claims on Thursday against mobile phone manufacturers, including Google, which it broke at a Nortel bankruptcy auction.
The Rockstar consortium, which bought Nortel’s $4.5 billion patents, filed a patent infringement lawsuit in a U.S. District Court in Texas against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of violating seven patents.
These patents cover technologies that help match the search keywords on the Internet with the relevant ads, the lawsuit says, which is the foundation of Google’s search business.
Representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were unavailable and did not comment.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC are making phones running the Android operating system from Google, which fiercely competes with mobile products from Apple and Microsoft.
In 2011, Google offered an initial price of $900 million for Nortel patents.
Google has raised the price several times, eventually offering a total of $4.4 billion.
After losing the patent case to the Nortel consortium Rockstar, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, in part the Motorola patent library was the determining factor in this transaction.
“Despite a failed attempt to acquire patents at auction that are the subject of a lawsuit, Google has violated and continues to violate them,” the lawsuit said.
Rockstar demands increased compensation from Google because it claims that Google’s patent infringement is intentional, according to the claim.
Egypt's first freely elected president takes oath
Mohammed Mursi takes the oath, but the day of his celebration is unlikely to mark the end of the political struggle in Egypt.
ISLAMIST Mohammed Mursi promised a “new Egypt” when he took the oath, becoming the country’s first freely elected president, replacing Hosni Mubarak, who was ousted 16 months ago.
At his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Mursi also became the first freely elected Islamist president of the Arab world and the fifth head of state in Egypt since the overthrow of the monarchy about 60 years ago.
He took an oath in front of 18 judges in black robes in a court building on the Nile, built in the style of an ancient Egyptian temple.
“We are striving for a better future, for a new Egypt and for a second republic,” Mursi said during a ceremony broadcast live on state television.
“Today, the Egyptian people have laid the foundations for a new life – absolute freedom, genuine democracy and stability,” said Morsi, a 60-year-old engineer with an American background from the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that has served most of its 84 years of existence as a misfit organization.
The building was guarded by hundreds of soldiers and policemen when Mursi arrived with a small courtyard shortly after 11 a.m. local time.
Only a few hundred supporters gathered at the courthouse to greet the new president, and, unlike the presidential pump of Mubarak’s time, the movement was halted only for a short time to pass his convoy along the usually busy road connecting the city center with the southern suburbs.
Although Mursi was ridiculed as a non-charismatic “replacement wheel” of the Brothers, his personal prestige has grown sharply since his victory and Friday speech in which he tried to present himself as a candidate not only for Islamists, but also for all those who want to bring to an end the 2011 Mubarak uprising against the authoritarian.
“Egypt today is a civil, national, constitutional and modern state,” Morsi, dressed in a blue business suit with a red tie, told judges in a wooden panelled hall where he took his oath.
Mursi later went to Cairo University, where he was to deliver his inaugural speech.
He was given an official reception with the army orchestra, performing the state anthem, during which he stood on the stand "smyrno".
Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi was present.
His arrival was greeted by the slogan “Army and the people are one hand”, which was chanted by hundreds of people gathered in the main lecture hall of the university.
Founded in 1908 as a fortress of secular education, Cairo University in the 1970s became a fortress of Islamist student groups.
Mursi took a symbolic oath on Friday in Tahrir Square, where an uprising broke out that ended Mubarak’s authoritarian rule last year, and vowed to return the powers of the president, who was stripped of his post by the military council, which took action from the ousted leader.
But by agreeing to take the official oath before the court, and not before the parliament, as is accepted, he does the will of the military, and this is a sign that the struggle for power will continue.
Mursi's speech in Tahrir Square was filled with theatrical populist gestures.
The next meeting of the Association of Engineers of the Tyumen region was held on the basis of the Yalutorov Automobile Plant.
As part of the event, a new line for the production of electrically welded steel pipes was presented.
According to the commercial director of the company Denis Gribanov, in 2011 with the appearance of a new owner, a marketing study was conducted on the market of steel structures in the Tyumen region.
It turned out that the region consumes more than 50,000 tons of electrically welded pipes per month.
After that, it was decided to change the profile of the plant and install equipment for its production.
Already this year, more than 7,000 tons of manufactured products have been shipped.
Investments in the plant amounted to more than 120 million rubles, - Denis Gribanov said.
In October, a new state was launched, which allows to increase the assortment.
The plant produces both a small pipe profile, which is used for tep-personal farming, small forms of construction and in the furniture industry, and a large - for the construction industry.
We plan to reach the level of production of 50,000 tons of products per year, which will account for about 10 percent of its consumption in the Tyumen region.
Despite the transition to another type of activity, the number of employees at the enterprise has not decreased - now it is 157 people, in the plans for the purchase of new equipment - an increase in staff by more than 50 employees.
The company is undergoing retraining, and the necessary specialists are selected from the existing ones.
Next year, it is planned to introduce a new steel longitudinal cutting unit with a thickness of up to five millimeters, which will reduce the cost of production, as well as another condition, with a pipe production speed of up to 47 meters per minute.
By the end of 2014, the enterprise is going to master the production of pipes, which are used in housing and utility.
The management of the company aims to close up to 70 percent of the needs of the Tyumen region for this product.
Deputy Director of the Department of Investment Policy Leonid Ostroumov, addressing the heads of production, advised to pay more attention to the modernization of mechanical engineering enterprises.
This is also addressed by forms of state support to the industry, which include the reimbursement of interest rates on loans for the purchase of new equipment and the costs of its leasing.
This year, 150 million rubles are allocated for these purposes, two-thirds of this amount has already been spent.
The last commission, which will consider subsidy agreements, will accept documents from enterprises until November 15.
In addition, the budget reimburses the costs of participation of local producers in international fairs.
For the next year, the budget provides funds in the amount of 150 million rubles, which can be used to compensate for leasing payments and loans for the purchase of new equipment.
5 million will be allocated for participation in fairs, 3 million - for energy saving programs.
Reduced to 72 million rubles of funds for the reimbursement of ordered and paid equipment, which is produced in the south of the Tyumen region for the oil and gas complex.
According to Leonid Ostroumov, in the future, this form of support will cease, as the reason for its introduction was the compensation of the mineral extraction tax, which oil companies paid to the regional budget.
At present, they are not doing so and subsidies are becoming direct spending commitments for the region.
In view of this, the Government of the region considers direct support to industrial enterprises as a priority, rather than financing the oil industry through them.
Budget support will be linked to investment projects that will be implemented on the production.
Many managers of enterprises expressed concern about the evolving situation in their relations with oil producers.
The subsidy for the equipment purchased by them is a competitive advantage of the industry of the southern Tyumen region, and with its abolition it will be difficult to compete at the price with the middle band of Russia, where the labor force is cheaper.
In addition, the question of the continuity of the new owner of TNK-VR - the company "Rosneft", which has not yet placed its orders at Tyumen enterprises, is unclear.
The agreement for the implementation of the Uvatsky project expires in 2013, and no applications for its extension have been received.
At present, the enterprises of the southern region, which specialize in equipment for the oil and gas sector, cannot form a portfolio of orders for the coming year.
The question remains whether taxes on oil produced in the Uvatsky region will be paid to the region’s budget or will be paid at the place of registration of the new owner of the fields.
Tomich to work 240 hours for extremist video on social media
The Lenin district court of Tomsk sentenced a resident of the city to 240 hours of compulsory work, who posted a video of extremist orientation on the social network, a spokesman for the regional court’s press service told RIA Novosti on Friday.
According to the court, in March 2013, the man posted a video on his page in the popular social network, which is included in the federal list of extremist materials.
In relation to him, a criminal case was initiated under the article of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation "Acts aimed at inciting hatred and enmity, as well as at degrading human dignity committed in public".
“The Leninsky District Court examined the case in a special way and found the man guilty of committing the above-mentioned crime by imposing a penalty in the form of 240 hours of compulsory labor,” the agency’s interlocutor said.
She added that the man fully admitted his guilt.
Azarov promised Ukrainians a collapse in the price of goods after the signing of an association with the European Union
Ukrainian Prime Minister Nikolai Azarov is convinced that prices in the country will drop significantly after the country signs an association agreement with the European Union.
He said this during a conversation with the readers of his page on Facebook.
I can definitely say that prices are determined by a large number of factors, including customs payments.
Thus, after the signing of the agreement and the entry into force of the provision on the Free Trade Area, the level of customs duties on imports of goods from the EU will decrease significantly.
This means that prices will also have to go down.
“This is about goods that come from EU countries,” Azarov wrote.
As for other commodities, the effect of the agreement on prices will not be so direct, it will be indirect.
But there shouldn’t be a price increase either.
Therefore, the messages on billboards, which have appeared quite a lot in our country recently, that association with the EU is an increase in prices, it is not quite so, or to be more precise, it is not so", - summed up Azarov.
Investigators check information about child abuse in Biysk
On 29 October, the media reported that a nurse in a kindergarten in Biysk had locked a child in the basement for educational purposes.
The investigators are currently investigating all the circumstances and are also giving a legal assessment of the actions of the kindergarten staff.
After the accusation of stupidity, Yevgeny Vasilyeva spoke
Yevgeny Vasilyeva, to whom almost a year of close attention of the media, has not yet commented on numerous publications in the press both about thefts in the Ministry of Defense, and about her personally - relations with the former Minister of Defense Anatoly Serdyukov, and her poetry.
However, on November 1, the figure of the case "Obaronservis" broke the silence.
In an interview with Life News, Vasilyeva said: “Initially, of course, the task was exactly one: to extract from me any negative information regarding the former Minister of Defense.”
There was a blackmail that I had to testify or I would be put in jail.
To date, these threats have ceased.
We will go to court and prove our innocence.
We are 100% confident in the victory.
At the same time, from the interview, it can be concluded that, perhaps, Vasilyev was most told the words about the fact that she does not care about the taste.
Probably, I mean the statement of the official representative of the Russian Federation, Vladimir Markin, that in the collection of paintings, which was collected by the figure of the case "DefenseService", were found fakes.
Among the arrested property there are a number of paintings that the owner, confident in her deep knowledge of art, acquired as masterpieces of world painting.
However, the artistic expertise appointed by the investigators after the arrest of these paintings found that they have no artistic value and, to put it simply, are cheap counterfeits,” Markin said in early October.
Some paintings stolen from the Department of Defense...
Then they admitted that they weren’t stolen from the Ministry of Defense, but they said that I had a bad taste.
Who has the right to discuss my taste, to discuss some personal moments?
I think it’s just infinity,” Vasilyeva says.
Asked if she admits her guilt in at least one of the 12 alleged criminal episodes, Vasilyeva said: “Of course not.
There's nothing to admit.
Moreover, there is no damage to the Russian Federation in question.
They just mislead people, that's all.
In addition, in response to today's statement that Vasilyeva is evading the examination of the criminal case materials, the lawyer of the figure said that he and his client "the investigator does not allow to get acquainted with the materials of the case".
What was the reason for the revelations of Vasilyeva under house arrest, who has not yet communicated with the press?
Perhaps as a woman she could not fail to answer the accusation of bad taste?
Or are the journalists of Komsomolka right, who claimed a few days ago that she “fell into an even greater trance under house arrest” because of the news of Anatoly Serdyukov’s reconciliation with his wife and his return to the family?
Famous military reviewer "KP" Viktor Baranets in his article "Serdyukov returned to his wife?" wrote: "The followers do not exclude that after such a shock she can become more talkative on interrogations."
Previously, Vasilyeva took on some accusations of illegal sale of real estate by the Ministry of Defense.

Do you think travel agents have gone to the past thanks to the Internet?
In the company Flight Centre, there seems to be a reverse trend.
The company has updated its full-year earnings forecast and expects record earnings from vacationers in Australia and the UK.
The travel firm now expects its main full-year earnings before tax to be between $325 and $340 million, compared to the previous forecast in the range of $305 to $315 million.
If the current benchmarks are reached, this will be a 12-17 percent increase compared to the record profit of $290.4 million in 2011/2012.
Managing Director Graham Turner said Flight Centre received 8 percent of profits in the first half and started the second half with good performance, especially on weekly trips to Australia and the UK.
“For the period since the beginning of the year, we have been working with profits across our 10 countries, and for some of them a record high profit is expected for the full year before interest and tax contributions are deducted,” he said.
“This includes Australia and the UK, which usually bring us the biggest profits.”
In Australia, the leisure business recovered in the second half of the year, offsetting a slightly weaker domestic corporate travel market.
Similarly, in the UK, the business of the Flight Centre in the field of leisure went well, while corporate customers spent less.
Her U.S. business has offset losses incurred during the seasonally weak first half of the year, and earnings are expected for the third full year in a row.
Yesterday, Flight Centre shares rose by 3 cents to $38.20.

In Yekaterinburg, a criminal killed two sisters and burned their bodies
In Yekaterinburg, police are searching for a criminal who has been brutally assaulted by two sisters.
After the murder, their bodies were burned.
As reported to the "New Region" in the press service of the GU of the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs in the Sverdlovsk region, the day before in the Kirovsk district of the Ural capital after the extinguishing fire in a three-room apartment located in a residential house on Uralskaya street, the bodies of two women with signs of death were found.
Soon, the identity of the dead was established.
It turned out that these sisters, one of them - a resident of Yekaterinburg 44 years old, the second - a 33-year-old resident of the Orenburg region.
The apartment burned down a few days ago.
His investigation was taken under personal control by the chief police officer of the region, Mikhail Borodin.
Internal authorities work out various versions of the murder, verify the alibi of previously convicted citizens and persons prone to such acts.
In addition, it establishes the purpose for which the women rented the apartment, and where they lived before, what they did, with whom they maintained a relationship.
Schools urged to pay more attention to mathematics, spelling and grammar
School courses in English literature will require students to study at least one Shakespeare play, a nineteenth-century novel, romantic poetry, and contemporary British art literature from 1914 onwards.
The exam will also feature “non-program texts” to encourage more extensive reading.
The combined course of English literature and language will be cancelled.
As of 2015, students will be required to pass a separate graduation exam in the language, with insistent recommendations of choosing English literature as a separate exam.
The Department of Education is expected to release new curricula in English and mathematics tomorrow, the first subjects to be radically revised.
It will make changes to other major subjects next year.
Separately, the regulatory body in the field of exams OFQUAL will present a revised structure of secondary school graduation exams, with a new system of assessments and less volume of coursework.
Speaking in the summer, Education Minister Michael Gove said that “a broad consensus has been reached that we need to reform our exam system in order to regain public confidence,” insisting that school graduation exams will be “more complex, more ambitious and more rigorous.”
Studies show that English schools devote less time to mathematics (116 hours a year, or three hours a week for a quarter) than in most countries.
For comparison, Australian schools give an average of 143 hours a year, while in Singapore students take about 138 hours.
Although there will be no formal requirement to allocate more time in the math schedule, sources in the coalition said that large-scale school graduation exams in mathematics combined with an increased ratio in the ranking table would likely serve as an incentive for schools to provide additional learning on this subject.
In the curriculum, more attention will be paid to “real-life tasks”, including financial mathematics.
Tickets to Heihe will cost tourists 2,200 rubles
From tomorrow from Blagoveschensk to Heihe tourists will start to carry ships on an airbag.
For those who want to travel to China, this means additional expenses.
A ticket for a puma is traditionally much more expensive than a boat.
As reported in the reference service of the company "AmurASSO", the cost of the usual ticket will be 2,200 rubles.
Passing through the hall of increased comfort will cost 2,800 rubles.
By the way, this season tickets did not rise: at the same price the pumas were driven by tourists in the spring and a year ago - in the autumn.
Dmitry Medvedev: the growth rate of GDP of the Russian Federation is not enough for the development of the state
Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev considers the growth rate of its GDP to be insufficient for Russia and is confident that the situation can be improved by simplifying the conditions for lending business and changing the structure of the Russian economy, focusing on innovation, Reuters reports.
We planned a GDP growth of around 3% this year, maybe even a little more.
It will be a little less than 2%.
Against the backdrop of the recession in a number of European countries as a whole, it would seem not very bad, but for us it is not enough, because the economic base is not as powerful as in a number of countries as a whole, and in general, in order to develop, there must be higher rates.
Now it is very important that Russian companies, Russian business receive normal loans at a normal price - this is the first thing that must be done," the head of government stressed.

Travel through dirt, rivers and jungles for free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free medical care in rural Cameroon
Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend taking hundreds of patients
In this West African country, there are not so many doctors – only one in 5,000 people.
Vote here or through your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of CNN's top 10 heroes of 2013.
You can vote for him or any of the other 10 main characters to make him CNN Hero of the Year.
This person will receive $250,000 to continue his outstanding work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle saw his father come back to life and fall unconscious again, wandering around hospitals that were not properly equipped to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a 1981 car accident near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.
At first, he had only a broken arm, but the resulting infection spread to the brain and caused hematoma, which resembled itself for the rest of his life.
“There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon,” said Georges Bwelle.
If we had the money, we would have taken him out of Cameroon.
Instead, Bwelle accompanied his father for years in crowded clinics and hospitals, receiving any treatment they could get.
“It’s not easy,” Bwelle said.
“You can leave the house at 5 a.m., run to the hospital to be the first, but you’re not the first.
There are a lot of patients.
Some may die because of what they have to wait for.
The situation hasn’t changed much since Bwell’s father died in 2002.
According to the World Health Organization, there is only one doctor per 5,000 people in Cameroon.
For comparison, the ratio in the United States is one doctor per 413 people.
And even if Cameroonians could go to the doctor, many of them would not be in their pockets.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and nearly three-quarters of healthcare spending in the country is private.
“Their only problem is poverty,” Bwelle said.
“Because of poverty, they can’t enjoy their lives.”
Seeing the suffering of his father and many of his compatriots, Bwelle was determined to do something about it.
Last year, Dr. Georges Bwellet and his team of volunteers performed 700 free surgeries.
He became a doctor himself and works as a vascular surgeon at Yaoundé Central Hospital.
He also founded the non-profit organization ASCOVIME, which organizes trips to the countryside on weekends to provide free medical care.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have assisted nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 other people are loaded into vans, tied to the roofs of medical supplies and drive across the intersection to visit the villagers in need of help.
They don't always get lucky.
Many times they had to push cars through rivers and dirt.
But when they arrive, they are met as real heroes: it’s a holiday with songs and dances and the best rooms that only the locals can offer.
The free medical care in these villages is indeed an occasion for celebration, and Bwelle with his broad smile and boundless energy is more than happy to join in the fun.
The next morning, the brigade began to receive hundreds of patients.
“We take 500 people on each trip,” Bwelle said.
They come from all over the county within a 60-kilometre radius of the village, and they come on foot.
Each of these weekend clinics provides a variety of medical services.
Many people receive treatment for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others may get cribs, donated glasses, or free birth certificates—documents needed for school that many poor families simply can’t afford.
In the evenings, the brigade performs simple operations under local anesthesia.
Operations are usually performed in a school building, municipality or in a house; after the procedure, patients get up and go to the postoperative area to make room for the next person.
Using a generator to illuminate the operating and sanitary equipment, Bwelle and his volunteers work until early Sunday morning.
It’s an unstoppable pace, but the team’s determination usually helps support the village musicians.
“They’ve been knocking drums all night so we can stay awake and keep working,” Bwelle said.
On Sunday, the crew members go back to the city, tired but proud of their work.
This group, made up of Cameroonian doctors and international medical students, has conducted 700 free surgeries over the past year, and they know that their help can be of tremendous importance to those they help.
One person explained that the free hernia surgery he received would allow him to work again.
“It will change the future for me and my family,” he said.
In addition to these clinical admissions on weekends and work at the hospital, the surgeon Bwell also works overnight in private medical clinics around Yaoundé.
It is this second work, he said, that provides 60% of the funding for his non-profit organization; the rest of the funds are covered by private donations.
“I don’t even know when he’s sleeping,” said Katie O’Malley, a second-year medical student at Drexel University in Philadelphia, a Bwell group volunteer.
He is either always in the hospital or trying to make money for the organization so that these campaigns can continue.
For future doctors and nurses, such as O’Malley, who come from the US and Europe to join Bwell in carrying out his tasks, this is an opportunity of practice that they would never get at home.
“We had the opportunity to assist in operations where we helped remove blood stains or hold tools for Dr. Bwelle,” O’Malley said.
As a second-year student, you would never get such an opportunity in America.
Volunteer students usually pay for their trip to Cameroon themselves, often arriving with donated medicines.
But upon arriving at Yaoundé, their food, transportation and training pay Bwell.
“He’s a hero, no doubt,” O’Malley said.
He gives his life to this organization, and his desire to help the people of Cameroon is endless.
For Bwell, nearly constant workload is not a difficult test.
Helping others live a happy life, fulfilling their father’s promise is what brings him great joy.
“I’m so happy when I do this job,” Bwelle said.
And I think of my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
I do this to make people laugh to lessen their pain.
Go to the ASCOVIME website and see how you can help.
Snowden agrees to testify on Merkel's wiretapping
Hans-Christian Strebele, a member of the Bundestag, met with Edward Snowden in Moscow.
During the interview, the question was discussed whether Snowden could be questioned as a witness by the German Attorney General’s Office in the case of a possible wiretapping of the German Chancellor’s phone by US special services.
Snowden expressed his willingness to give the necessary testimony.
The meeting could take place either in Moscow or in Germany.
He made it clear, said Hans-Christian Strebele, that he knows a lot.
And despite the fact that the National Security Agency led by Keith Alexander blocked all his movements, Snowden is ready to come to Germany.
However, first you need to clearly define all the conditions of his arrival. .
Meanwhile, U.S. lawmakers are beginning to take action in response to the scandal surrounding U.S. spy programs.
The Senate Intelligence Committee approved a bill yesterday introducing additional restrictions on the activities of the U.S. Electronic Intelligence Agency.
Belarus and Turkey are interested in developing and deepening relations in all spheres and areas.
This was stated to journalists by Belarusian Foreign Minister Vladimir Makei at a press conference following a meeting with Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu, reports Belta correspondent.
We are very pleased that our Turkish colleagues and partners at all levels are interested in developing and deepening Belarusian-Turkish relations in all spheres and areas.
Belarus, for its part, is also interested in this, so we have agreed that the governmental bodies of the two countries will provide universal assistance and support to entrepreneurs who establish direct trade and economic contacts between them,” said Vladimir Makey.
He stressed that the Government of Belarus would create all the necessary conditions for this and provide the maximum assistance.
The Minister also said that the 8th meeting of the Belarusian-Turkish Joint Intergovernmental Economic Commission was held in Ankara, following which a protocol was signed.
The parties have developed a road map of Belarusian-Turkish cooperation, which, according to the head of the Belarusian foreign policy department, aims at deepening bilateral cooperation in trade, economic and investment areas, in the spheres of industrial cooperation, transport, agriculture.
"The minutes of the last meeting have been fully implemented, and I am convinced that the current protocol will also be implemented because Belarus and Turkey consider each other as reliable partners," he said.
Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu, in turn, said that at the negotiations, the heads of the foreign departments of the two countries decided to further develop mutually beneficial cooperation and implement various projects.
Trade between Belarus and Turkey, in the opinion of the Minister, should be increased and brought to the figure of $1 billion.
Turkey is also an important partner in the area of investment cooperation, which needs to be further developed, as there is untapped potential in this area, he believes.
There has always been a very warm relationship between our countries, and we hope that in the future they will be further strengthened and expanded.
And all necessary conditions will be created for trade and economic ties and for the successful work of Turkish companies on the territory of Belarus and Belarusian enterprises and organizations in Turkey," Ahmet Davutoglu said.
Obama Rejects His Words About Healthcare
In the midst of a storm of criticism, President Obama went to the brink of his often-repeated, unambiguous promise that “if you like your health insurance plan, you can keep it.”
Seeing hundreds of thousands of people receiving notifications of termination from their providers, Republicans in recent days have criticized the president for misleading American society.
Yesterday, Obama made a little bit of a public promise.
“Most people who have health insurance that works can keep it,” he said in a speech in Boston.
Speaking of what he called a “revival in the news” over the termination of services, Obama urged Americans receiving these notifications to look for other options in the market.
Most people will be able to get better, comprehensive health insurance plans at the same price or even cheaper than predicted.
“You will get more favorable conditions,” he said.
The administration said it should come as no surprise that 5% of the population who buy insurance on their own may be forced to change plans because their coverage does not meet the new standards required under the Affordable Care Act.
“Let me tell these Americans directly: you deserve the best,” Sibelius said in a speech to the House Energy and Trade Committee in Washington.
Sibelius, who oversees the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said the launch of the online sales platform has been going “horribly bad” since October.
“I’m upset and angry just like everyone else,” she said.
“I really want to regain your trust.”
Annoyed, Sibelius slammed the phrase, which was captured by the included microphone, sitting behind her assistant at yesterday’s hearings in the chamber after a heated debate with House member Billy Long, a Republican from the state of Missouri, about whether she owes the program to the program itself.
After more than three hours of hearings, Long once again urged Sibelius to explain why the “architect” of the Affordable Care Act had not voluntarily waived government-sponsored insurance to purchase the plan through HealthCare.gov, which she now imposes on millions of Americans.
The agency "Rosbalt" deprived of the status of the media for the obscene fight
On October 31, the Moscow court decided to invalidate the license on the registration of the Rosbalt agency, - writes "Lenta".
Roskomnadzor insisted on depriving the agency of media status - for systematic and gross violations of the law on media.
During the process, an unpleasant precedent was created: the court considered it possible to close the media, in fact denying the publication the right to put forward counterarguments.
What is "Rosbalt"
ZAO "Rosbalt Information Agency" was established in St. Petersburg in 2000.
In the following years, the agency opened a second head office in Moscow and a number of regional units.
The agency also has representations in the countries of the former USSR.
Since 2001, Rosbalt has developed and functioned as a federal information and analytics agency.
By the mid-2000s, the agency was included in the list of the most recognizable private Internet media in Russia.
At the same time, Rosbalt has always occupied a rather specific niche: the core of the agency's exclusive publications were (and still are) notes with reference to sources in law enforcement agencies.
Talks about the closeness of the publication to the force structures continued throughout the agency's existence.
Besides the fact that "Rosbalt" had an extensive database of sources in various departments, in favor of such assumptions it was said that the project was led by Natalia Chaplin - the wife of Victor Cherkesov.
At the same time, Chaplin’s role in the leadership of Rosbalt is not completely clear: she is most often called the “project manager”.
The director general of the agency is Larisa Afonina, the editor-in-chief is Nikolai Ulyanov.
Recently, "Rosbalt" did not appear in the ratings of the federal media - neither in terms of citation, nor in terms of audience.
In October, the agency ranked 25th in the ranking of visits to Russian media sites according to the LiveInternet version.
According to LiveInternet, the average daily audience of the site rosbalt.ru is about 150 thousand unique visitors (and up to 500,000 views), monthly - about three million unique visitors.
Among the most popular materials in the last five months are notes on the helplessness of the Kremlin in its relations with Ukraine, the death of the soloist of the group "King and Joke", pogroms in the capital, Biryulevo.
Rosbalt’s conflict with Roskomnadzor began in July 2013, when amendments to the media law came into force, prohibiting journalists from engaging in obscene fighting.
The agency found a banned vocabulary in two videos published on the agency's website ("Jigit from Krasnodar" and "Pussy Riot polluted oil towers").
The other sides describe it differently.
Roskomnadzor accused Rosbalt of gross and systematic violation of the media law on the basis of the video footage found and appealed to the court with the requirement to withdraw a license from the agency.
Rosbalt stated that the agency's claims were wrong: first, the videos were not editorial materials, second, the mother words in them were disguised, and, third, immediately after warning the videos were removed from the site.
The agency’s representatives appealed Roskomnadzor’s claims to the World Court – and when the Moscow Court accepted Roskomnadzor’s lawsuit on October 22, 2013, the examination of these complaints was still ongoing.
However, already on the 25th the world judge made a decision not in favor of "Rosbalt": the editor-in-chief Nikolay Ulyanov was found guilty of violating the code on administrative offences and fined 20,000 rubles - 10 thousand for each roll.
Apparently, this predetermined the outcome of the hearing in the Mosgorsud - if you give up the thought that the outcome could have been predetermined even earlier.
On October 31, the court decided to invalidate the certificate of registration of Rosbalt, effectively depriving the agency of media status.
It is not possible to say that Rosbalt remained alone during this confrontation.
The agency was supported by deputies of the State Duma (a statement on behalf of the head of the Roskomnadzor Alexander Zharov on October 10 was signed by 26 deputies; the document itself was submitted on the initiative of the KPRF).
Vsevolod Bogdanov, head of the Union of Journalists of Russia, Pavel Gusev, chairman of the Moscow Union of Journalists, and Mikhail Fedotov, head of the Presidential Council on Human Rights, declared the illegality of the closure of the publication.
Moreover, according to Bogdanov, the leadership of Roskomnadzor even gave him some guarantees that the issue will not come before the withdrawal of the license.
The court over Rosbalt showed: under whose jurisdiction it is safer to be in the media in Russia today is a big question.
Syria Destroys Chemical Weapons Equipment
Syria has destroyed all alleged chemical weapons production facilities, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) has acknowledged.
This first phase of disarmament was completed by Damascus a day before the deadline.
By 1 November, Syria was to destroy production and other auxiliary facilities intended for the preparation of combat poisons for use, reports the BBC.
The destruction of the stockpiles of toxic substances or their chemical components should be completed by mid-2014.
According to the representative of the OPCW, the toxic substances are currently in sealed storage facilities.
International inspectors went to Syria after more than 1,400 people were killed in a chemical attack on the outskirts of Damascus on August 21, according to the US.
The main task of the inspectors was not to waste time - to prevent the Syrian authorities from producing more chemical weapons - and to destroy the infrastructure for mixing chemicals and ammunition equipment.
These production facilities will now be closely monitored to prevent their repairs.
The next milestone is mid-November: by this time, the OPCW and the Syrians must agree on a detailed plan to destroy existing stockpiles of toxic substances.
There are a lot of questions here.
Where will they be destroyed?
Who will provide the equipment for this?
All Syrian statements will be carefully checked by Western intelligence.
They would be willing to advise the inspectors on new facilities for inspection if there are grounds to suspect that Damascus is not completely open.
The U.S. believes that the shelling was carried out by regular troops.
Syria and Russia insist that this is a matter for the Syrian rebels.
The world community demanded that the Syrian leadership - in accordance with the agreement reached with Russia's mediation - destroy or decommission all facilities for the production of shells, poisoning gases and liquids and for the filling of shells with these substances.
Now that this stage has passed, the next step should be the destruction of the chemical weapons already available to the Syrian army.
It is assumed that this arsenal may contain more than 1,000 tons of neuro-paralytic poisons, skin-infecting mustard gas and other prohibited chemicals stored in several dozen different locations.
For its destruction, it is necessary for the OPCW and the Syrian authorities to first agree on a timetable for action - this is given two weeks.
OPCW Field Operations Chief Jerry Smith told the BBC that his inspectors “personally monitored the destruction of equipment.”
"They now have no possibility of further production or mixing of chemical weapons," he said.
The OPCW said the inspectors visited 21 of the 23 sites in Syria and made sure that the plants for the production of shells and poisons were either destroyed or rendered unfit.
The remaining two sites are too dangerous to be inspected, the document said, but the equipment was transported from there and inspected by OPCW experts.
According to Smith, the process of destroying the chemical weapons infrastructure was "particularly difficult" because it was necessary to work in the conditions of the ongoing conflict.
At the beginning of October, the OPCW received the Nobel Peace Prize, but, according to Smith, the inspectors had not yet found time to celebrate it - they were too busy working.
John Kerry says in his unprecedented confession that U.S. espionage “has gone inappropriately far”
John Kerry demonstrated a softening of the tactics of protecting U.S. surveillance programs, making an unprecedented admission that in some cases U.S. espionage “has gone inappropriately far.”
The secretary of state also admitted that he was guilty, along with Barack Obama, of being “on autopilot” at the time of Edward Snowden’s outspoken revelations about NSA spying.
These leaks put the U.S. government at the center of a diplomatic scandal with its allies.
Speaking on video at an open government conference in London, Mr. Kerry said: “There is no doubt that the President and I, as well as other members of the government, actually perceived some of the things that were happening on autopilot, because such an opportunity already existed – both during the Second World War, and in the very difficult years of the Cold War.”
He then became the first high-ranking member of the U.S. government to acknowledge that U.S. espionage had gone too far, but stressed that no one’s rights had been violated.
He said: “In some cases, it has gone inappropriately far.
And the president is determined to shed light on the issue and explain himself to the people, and is now conducting a thorough analysis to ensure that no one has a sense of abuse.
I assure you, there is no abuse of innocent people in this process.”
Mr. Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA acted on good grounds and that his surveillance operations saved many lives.
He added: “We are working in a new world where people are ready to blow themselves up.
There is radical extremism in the world, reckless and determined to kill people, blow people up and attack governments.
What if you were able to intercept it, stop it before it happens?
We actually prevented plane crashes, building explosions and killing people because we were able to find out about these plans in advance.”
Meanwhile, U.S. lawmakers will travel to Europe to help resolve issues related to alleged U.S. espionage abroad and convince Europeans of the need to continue joint counter-terrorism activities with the U.S., the chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs said on Thursday.
Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy said he had spoken to members of the European Parliament and others this week and was concerned about their threats to stop participating in anti-terrorism organizations due to frustration over surveillance by the National Security Agency.
“It is really important in the interests of U.S. national security that Europeans remain our supporters of our common counter-terrorism efforts,” Murphy, a Democrat serving in the first term and chairman of the Senate’s subcommittee on international relations on European affairs, said in an interview from Washington.
“And I am going to Europe to let them know that we must continue to cooperate in the fight against terrorism, despite their anger at these NSA programs.”
News that the NSA has collected millions of phone records in Europe has worsened relations with some U.S. allies, although the head of the agency said this week that they were inaccurate and reflected misunderstandings of metadata collected by NATO allies and shared with the U.S.
Other revelations cited Snowden-released documents suggesting that the NSA was monitoring German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s mobile phone, as well as the phones of some 34 other world leaders.
National Intelligence Director James Clapper defended espionage activities against the Allies as necessary and said it was an ordinary matter on both sides.
Against this backdrop, Murphy said his office was organizing a visit from members of Congress expected to take place this year, and that he hoped the delegation would include members of both parties and both chambers.
The names of other lawmakers will be announced in the coming days.
According to him, the program of the trip is still in the development stage.
Although Murphy stated that the purpose of the trip was to promote better relations, he said that some degree of “hardness from the best motivations” would also be manifested.
He said that European leaders should be honest with their people in what spy programs they themselves have used for years.
“While we can change our surveillance programs to better protect the rights of Europeans, they also have to agree with the fact that we are not the only ones engaged in intelligence activities,” Murphy said.
Meanwhile, Mr. Kerry should travel this weekend to the Middle East and Poland to address the problems of hostility towards the US strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as U.S. intelligence activities.
In the new compositions of public observation commissions will increase the influence of prisoners
Today, the Council of the Public Chamber (OP) can approve the new compositions of the public observation commissions (ONC) in 43 regions of Russia.
If the option put to the vote is adopted, the lobbyists of the security forces will increase their influence.
ONC - public structures controlling the conditions of detention in places of deprivation of liberty.
The cases of Sergei Magnitsky and Leonid Razvozhaev, the riots in the Copian colony - it is through the ONC that most resonant incidents are revealed behind bars.
The fight between human rights defenders and law enforcement lobbyists is under control of the ONC.
At the meeting of the OP working group on the formation of the UNC, I proposed that human rights experience be the criterion of selection.
"He was not accepted, and they formed lists without establishing criteria," - says Valery Borshchev.
Borshchev is the current chairman of the Moscow Monitoring Commission and the Association of Independent Observers, an all-Russian structure of human rights defenders dealing with prison issues.
As a deputy of the State Duma from "Apple" he developed a law regulating the activities of the ONC.
The OP Council must vote for the compositions of the OPC in 43 regions of the country.
Fewer than a thousand candidates are eligible for 1,800 vacancies, and in Ingushetia and Kabardino-Balkaria competitions could not be organized due to the absence of candidates.
OP promises to arrange donation for vacancies.
The Moscow Olympic Committee is one of the few commissions with a competition, despite the fact that the new composition will have 40 participants instead of 20.
According to Borshchev, in the current composition of the capital commission 11 human rights defenders and 9 security forces, and in the version that is on the vote in the OP, the ratio changes by 17 to 23.
At the same time, 30 human rights defenders wanted to get into the capital commission.
But the representative of the "Boy Brotherhood" Vyacheslav Kalinin can re-enter the new composition.
He was a member of the ONC for three years, but never visited prisoners.
Borshev believes that the security forces, by appointing their chairman, will be able to make the work of human rights defenders intolerable, so human rights defenders do not exclude a collective exit from the commission.
According to them, the promotion of the security forces is coordinated by Anton Tsvetkov, a member of the OPC, who heads the "Officials of Russia" - an organization that defends the interests of the security forces.
"I don't eat babies on the street," Anton Tsvetkov told RBC daily.
He denies lobbying for the promotion of any lists and says he is not going to prevent human rights defenders from visiting the arrested opposition.
According to Tsvetkov, he was not even interested in what list is now voted for in the OP.
He considers the disclosure of Borshevym information a form of pressure.
Possible success of human rights defenders is the planned change of the leadership of the Chelyabinsk NGO.
Her former heads will be removed due to last year’s Coptic unrest.
The Public Chamber concluded that the leadership of the local commission ignored the problems of the prisoners.
But the ONC of Rostov-on-Don can move from human rights defenders to law enforcement.
From the new lists "missing" the human rights defender-chairman of the local commission, but turned out to be one of his opponents, despite the fact that in May 2013 the Federal Public Chamber excluded him for unethical behavior.
The lists of the Moscow and Rostov commissions Borshev considers "a place for Kopeisk".
The revelations of Tolokonnikova’s hope did not affect Mordovia’s ONC, which is considered “forceful”: only one human rights defender wanted to join the new composition, and she did not even accept documents for the competition.
OP board member Nikolay Svanidze told RBC daily that he voted against the proposed list, as he is upset by the situation in Moscow and Rostov-on-Don.
He sent his position to the other members of the council.
His OP colleague Pavel Gusev says he voted for because he likes the proposed Moscow list.
The Deputy Secretary of OP Vladislav Grib, who is also an employee of the Research Institute of FSIN, coordinated the compilation of the lists of ONCs.
Pilz told RBC daily that he does not consider it right to divide candidates into human rights defenders and law enforcement officers and does not agree that the chairmen of the commissions have sufficient powers to hinder the work of its members.
Mushroom does not have to predict the results of the vote of the OP Council.
If the proposed list is rejected today, an amended version will be put to the vote in the coming days.
Australian Woman Appeals Against Imprisonment in Thailand
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney, sentenced to 15 days in prison on Phuket Island for falsely claiming that she had been assaulted by a taxi driver, appealed the sentence and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was initially found guilty on June 15 by the Phuket provincial court of filing a false lawsuit after Thailand police reported that a local taxi driver had carried out the attack on the night of Sunday, June 10, while two other men were holding her.
However, video surveillance footage later revealed that she had returned safely to her hotel after breaking up with her Australian boyfriend.
Phuket police interrogated Bamford for two days before admitting to having fabricated the story.
Prior to her trial, she had been held in local police cells.
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-day prison sentence in a general regime detention facility on the outskirts of Phuket, rather than a female adult prison.
She is the daughter of former Australian League player Peter Tanks, who turned to the Canberra Foreign Ministry for help for her daughter.
Tanks told the Sydney Sunday Telegraph that the whole family was “extremely concerned” about his daughter’s well-being and was waiting for her to return to Australia.
“Obviously, it was an alarming time, but we hope that she will return home safely as soon as possible,” Tanks said.
Bamford appealed her sentence and was released on bail of 50,000 baht.
According to reports in Australia, she is currently spending her vacation in the Krabi resort area in southern Thailand.
Thailand-based legal sources said Bamford is currently representing a local lawyer in Phuket, but warned that the appeal could result in the court increasing her sentence to up to two years and forcing her to serve an adult prison term.
However, after the recent murder of Australian travel agent Michel Smith in Phuket, Thailand may also seek to restore its undermined tourist image, leading to an acquittal.
Now Roman Senchin is in Paris for the presentation of his novel "Eltysheva", translated into French.
Recall, this is his novel became the finalist of four awards: "Jasnay Polyanna", "Russian Booker", "National bestseller" and "Big Book".
And last year, the writer for this book was awarded the award of the Government of the Russian Federation in the field of culture.
Roman Senchin is an undoubted leader in the generation of current thirty- and forty-year-old prose writers.
Practically every publication of his hard, built on modern life material stories and stories provokes heated controversy among critics of a variety of directions.
It can be argued that the articles collected together on the prose and journalism of Senchine, reviews of his books and journal publications create a curious and unexpected landscape of Russian literature from the late 1990s to the early 2010s.
In discussions about the works of "one of the most controversial contemporary writers", according to critic Sergei Chuprinin, it is mostly about what its participants understand by the word "literature", as they see the present and future not only of our literary, but also of life.
Unfortunately, the volume of the book did not allow it to include most articles and reviews from the regional media and blogosphere.
Analytical and review articles are usually given in abbreviations in the "Paragraphs..." sections.
