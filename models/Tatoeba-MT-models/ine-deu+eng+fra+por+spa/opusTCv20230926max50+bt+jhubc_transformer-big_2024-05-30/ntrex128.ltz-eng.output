Welsh politicians are like idiots, they're like idiots.
A number of members of parliament have been affected by a proposal that their title should be changed to a member of the Welsh Parliament.
It was created due to plans to change the name of the Assembly in the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the political spectrum have been dismissed as disgraceful.
One member of the Labour Party was concerned that it would ripple on Twp and PwP.
For readers outside of Wales: in Welsh, twp means domm and pwp Kaka.
A member of the Plaid Party said the group as a whole was "not happy" and suggested alternatives.
A Welsh conservative said his group would be joined over the name change, but stated that MWP and Muppet were not far from one.
In this context, the Welsh spelling "w" is the same as the spelling "u" in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly's commission, which is currently drafting laws to induce the change of name, said: "The remuneration decision on the appointment of the deputies lies, of course, with the deputies themselves."
The government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change the name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public meeting on the proposal, which received a lot of support.
The Commission favored "Members of the Welsh Parliament" or "WMPs," but the MWP option received more support in a public meeting on the question of the MPs' title.
MEPs seem to suggest other options, but the fight to reach a consensus could cause headlines for the incumbent official, Elin Jones, who is expected to review the bill on the changes within two weeks.
Legislation on reforms includes other amendments, such as how the assembly works, as well as rules on the disqualification of deputies and the drafting of the committee system.
Members of Parliament will be given the last word on the question as to what they should be called when discussing the legislation.
Macedonians are very much in favor of the referendum on the change of the country's name.
On Sunday, voters will choose whether to change the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia."
The popular voth was set up in a proposal to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province, called Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that the name of its northern neighbor made a statement on its territory and has repeatedly voted against its attempts to join the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the vote on the change of name, said he did not want to recognize the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claimed that the change of name is the price to be paid for the EU's accession to NATO.
St. Martin's Church is as quiet as the churches during the Battle of Harlem.
"Once upon a time, the ancients said that there was a cafe in every corner and a church," said Lord Adams.
"There's nothing more today."
He said the disappearance of coffee was understandable.
“People are socializing,” he said.
"There's no longer a place for people to go to the cafes."
As for the churches, he worries that the money of the sale of assets will not last as long, as the responsible ones imagine, "sooner or later they will return to where they started."
Churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment buildings with residential properties and filled with people who do not help the remaining shelters in the neighborhood.
"The overwhelming majority of people who buy property in these buildings are white," he said, "and therefore want to close these churches quickly, because it is unlikely that most of these people will become members of these churches.
Both churches were built by white communities before Harlem became a black capital – Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin’s a decade later.
The original White Methodist Community was founded in the 1930s and is now known as the White Methodist Community.
A black community of not far away has taken over the building.
St. Martin's has been taken over by a black community under Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of merchants on 125th Street, a main street for trade in Harlem that did not want to hire blacks.
The building was severely damaged by a fire in 1939, but when the members of Father Johnson's community made plans for the reconstruction, they ordered the clapping game.
Rev. David Johnson, the father of Johnson and successor of St. Martin's, proudly called the clapping game "The clapping of the poor."
The expert, who played the claquette game in July, called it another "cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument."
Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan also noted that it was the world's first bell toy played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who switched to the largest bell toy in the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Lord Merriweather said that St. Martin's did not replace him.
What took place in St. Martin in the last month was a complicated history of architects and entrepreneurs, some of whom were introduced by the lay leaders, others by the bishopric dioceses.
The sacristy - the pore is the leading organ, with laymen responsible - wrote to the dioceses in July, with the concern that the dioceses "would try to pass on the costs to the sacristy", although the sacristy was not involved in the removal of the architects.
Some pastors have complained about a lack of transparency of the Diocese's pages.
A 13-year-old shark was injured in a lobster dive in California.
A shark attacked a 13-year-old boy on Saturday, when he was drowning after lobster in California, and wounded him on the day of the opening of the lobster season, according to officials.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m., not far from Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving a Saturday afternoon with friends for half an hour when he heard the boy calling for help and you were paddling with a group of people to pull him out of the water.
Hammel said he had thought at the beginning that it would be simply the joy of catching a lobster, but then "realized that he was "bashed!"
I've given them away!"
"He's got all his hands on his head," he said as he approached the boy.
"I told everyone to come out of the water, 'There's a shark in the water!'" added the hammer.
The boy was taken to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was admitted to a critical condition.
The species of shark that attacked is unknown.
SpongeBob Captain Larry Giles said at a press conference that a shark had been seen a few weeks earlier, but this was considered a non-hazardous shark species.
Giles also said that the victim was suffering from traumatic injuries in the workforce.
Officials closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casabland to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigations and security purposes.
Giles stressed that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, most of which are considered non-hazardous.
Sainsbury's is now in the UK's beauty market.
Sainsbury's picks up boots, superdrugs and Debenhams, with beauty departments in the cafe-style with specialized assistants.
As part of a significant announcement in the <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion British beauty market, which continues to grow steadily as fashion and households return, these larger beauty departments and 11 stores will have some sizeable stores across the country, and the
The supermarkets are investing in beauty, because they want to replenish the shelves that were otherwise reserved for televisions, microwaves and other household appliances.
Sainsbury's has said that they will offer the size of its beauty offerings up to 3,000 products including for the first time with brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The assortments of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees, which are already available, will also get more space with exclusive brand areas, similar to those in the boats stores.
The supermarket is also re-launching its boutique makeup range, so that the majority of products are vegan-friendly, which is increasingly being demanded by young consumers.
The fragrance retailer The Fragrance Shop will test concessions in two Sainsbury's stores, with the first opening last week in Croydon, south of London, and the second opening later this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
Buying online and buying small amounts of everyday food and small shops means that supermarkets need to make more efforts to get people to buy from them.
Mike Coupe, the manager of Sainsbury's, said the outlets would increasingly look like department store stores, as the supermarket chain tries to fight more services and non-food products against discounters Aldi and Lidl.
ainsbury' opened Argos outlets and hundreds of aftermarkets and also bought some habitats stores since the supermarket bought both chains two years ago. This strengthened the sales of food and made acquisitions more profitable.
The supermarket's first attempt at overhauling the cosmetics and addiction department has come to fruition.
In the early 2000s, Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with boats, but after a dispute over the share of revenue from drug stores and supermarkets, the cooperation was rapidly gaining momentum.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its 281Drugs to Celesio, the owner of Lloyd's Pharmacy Chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million, three years ago.
Llodys is expected to play a role in the plan by launching a wide range of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, said: "We have changed the look and feel of our beauty areas to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained employees who can ask the customer for advice.
Our range of brands is tailored to every need. Through a friendly environment and advantageous locations, we are now an attractive beauty destination that puts the old way of shopping in the spotlight."
Peter Jones "spoiled" about a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal, by Holly Willoughby.
Peter Jones, the star of Dragons Den, has become "sweetheart" after television host Holly Willoughby signed a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million contract with her lifestyle brand business to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for her homewear and accessories brand Truly.
The couple's business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Mark Goop.
This morning, the 37-year-old host announced on her Instagram account that she was leaving.
Holly Willoughby pushed Peter Jones, the star of Dragons Den, out of her lucrative lifestyle brand business at the last minute to focus on her new contracts Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say that the Jones was "sweetheart" like the TV star during a spooky meeting a Tuesday in the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, has admitted that her new contracts - worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million - did not mean access me home.
The company was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Mark Goop and doubled Willpughby's estimated assets of <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones fled the UK and went to one of his vacation homes.
A source said: "Truly was Holly's top priority at a distance.
It would be their long-term future, which would accompany them through the next century.
The decision to leave the house surprised all the people involved.
No one could believe what was going on at the beginning of the story.
There's a store in Marlow's headquarters with goods ready for sale.
Experts believe that the departure of the this-morning moderator, who is one of the bankable stars from the UK, could cost the company millions because they are investing in a lot of products, from cushions and candles to clothes and homewear, and it will now potentially delay the launch.
It could also mean the end of a long-standing friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin were married to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby brought Truly to the bee with the 2016 cap, and Jones, 52, climbed into the market as president.
The couple joined forces and the vacancy and Jones is 40 percent involved in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby becomes brand ambassador for M&S and replaces Ant McPartlin as moderator of I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
A source with information about Jones said last night, "We won't comment on his business."
We had a lot of fun and then we fell in love.
He joked about the criticism he would receive from the media because of a comment some people would consider "not presidential," and because he is so positive about the North Korean president.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Today, Trump is in the midst of his "television moderator voice."
"I didn't give up anything."
He noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting after the first meeting in Singapore in June was welcomed by Trump as a major step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
Negotiations on denuclearization, however, do not take place.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told leading politicians during the UN General Assembly a joint statement that the North did not have a "relevant response" from the United States to North Korea's earlier disarmament steps.
The U.S. will continue to impose sanctions in order to continue to push.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech.
"I'm good with North Korea," he said.
"We went to war with North Korea.
Millions of people have been killed.
Now we have a great relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim would have led to positive results – no more rocket tests, help to free hostages and the repatriation of American soldiers who have fallen in battle from deadly shells to surviving missiles.
And he defended his unusual manner and manner in which he spoke about relations with Kim.
It's so easy to be president, but instead of 10,000 people out there trying to get into this crowded arena, we'd only have 200 people here," Trump said, pointing to the people right in front of him.
A tsunami and an earthquake in Indonesia devastated an island, killing hundreds of people.
After the earthquake in Lombok, for example, foreigners were told that they would not be used.
Although more than 10 percent of the population of Lombok has been delocalized, no national disaster has been declared, a prerequisite for the catalysis of international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they made it very clear that they did not seek international aid, so it is a challenge," Ms. Sumbung said.
While Save the Children assembles a team to travel to Palu, it is still not safe to work on foreign personnel on the spot.
Mr Sutopo, the spokesman for the National Disaster Protection Administration, said that Indonesian officials would be evaluating the situation to see if international agencies could participate in the aid measure.
With regard to the constant earthquakes in Indonesia, unfortunately, the country is not sufficiently prepared for the will of nature.
Even though tsunami shelters were built in Aceh, there are not those everywhere on the coast.
The apparent lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palu, even though there was a warning, may have cost many lives.
Travelling between the different Indonesian islands is often a challenge.
Natural disasters make the logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is making its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new accident.
President Joko Widodo has made improvements to Indonesia's infrastructure the main theme of his election campaign and donated money to the streets and railways.
But Joko's government was also plagued by a shortage of funding, where he set himself up again next year.
Joko is also exposed to the pressure of partisan tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority advocate a more conservative form of belief.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands evicted from their homes as Christian and Muslim groups fought on the street with knives, bees and fistfighters and other brutal weapons.
Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge faces a draw against Chelsea.
Daniel Sturridge scored a goal in the 89th minute a Samsden at Stamford Bridge in London against Chelsea in the Premier League.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri as he was about 30 meters ahead of goal from Chelsea in his team's 1-0 han loung.
He took the ball with his left foot and shot in the direction of the goal.
The test is high over the box, and in the direction of the right corner of the net.
The ball is flown over a jumping Arrizabalaga and then into the net.
"Just going to get into this position to get the ball and players like Shaq are always playing as much as possible before, so I tried to make as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw the edge coming and I touched it suddenly, and I didn't think about it and just shot."
Chelsea were 1-0 after the break for a goal in the 25th minute of Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The Blues Stormer made a pass back to Mateo Kovacic in this game, before sprinting one direction in Liverpool halfway.
Kovavic made a quick double pass in the midfield.
He then fired a beautiful ball through it, which sent the hazard and the box.
Hazard runs along the defense and ends up in a long pot with a left-footed shot at Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will play against Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League at 15:00 a.m. on Wednesday at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will play against videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 15:00 a.m. in London.

The Cromwell Statue of Parliament will be the new memorial that concerns the series "Rewriting History."
His ban would be a poetic justice for the destruction of so many cultural and religious artefacts in England by the fanatic and puritanical followers of the Taliban.
But the Cromwell Society describes Lord Crick's suggestion as "unsense" and "an attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldmsith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "In the discussion of the altercation of statues, it was inevitable that the gesture around Oliver Cromwell in front of the Palace of Westminster was the target.
The symbolism of the English Civil War was not ordained by Cromwell and was not executed.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would have been sacrificed for the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the last century.
Sir William Hama Thorneycroftseng's great representation of Cromwell is proof of the opinion of the 19th century and is part of the storytelling of a character, of which many people still believe it will be celebrated.
Mr Goldsmith said in the Sunday Telegraph: "The Cromwell is seen by many, perhaps first in the late 19th century as a defender of Parliament against external pressure, and in his case, of course, the monarchy.
Whether it is an accurate representation is still a matter of concern.
What is certain is that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century shaped the development of our nation, and the Cromwell is an individually recognizable figure representing one side of this division.
His services as Lord Protector are to be celebrated and remembered.
The pig is a farmer's
According to local media, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest China.
The man, identified only by his family name "Yuan", was found dead with a diaphragm artery near a stall at a market in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
On May 30, 2005, a pig farm in Xining, Qinghai Province, China, prepared for an injection of immunosuppressants for pigs in a hoppery.
According to reports, he and his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province were hired on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs in the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead, and discovered an open door to a nearby swamp.
He said that in the stable there was a large male pig with blood on it.
A forensic investigation has confirmed that the 550-pound pig killed the farmer, according to reporters.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and tender," the cousin with the family name "Wu" said, citing Guiyang Evening News.
The pictures of surveillance cameras show the Yuan Donneschdes Mois going to the market at 4:40 to feed the pigs.
Her body was rinsed an hour later.
The animal that the man killed is not a pig of the yuan or his cousin.
A manager of the market explained to the Evening News that the pig was separated to prevent it from attacking other people while police were gathering evidence at the scene.
According to reporters, the yuan is likely to be negotiating with his family and the market authorities about decisions for his death.
However, there have been cases in which pigs have been attacked by humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband in her yard in Massachusetts. The man was badly wounded.
In 2006, a 650-pound pig pushed a Welsh farmer against his tractor until his wife was able to move the animal.
After a farmer was frozen in Oregon in 2012 by his pig, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a "trigger."
You're just a gamer.
They're just trying to get you, they don't want you.
"You just have to be respectful," he said.
Heavy rains in the southwest of the United States caused by Hurricane Rosa
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa weakens as it moves across the cool waters of the north coast of Mexico.
However, the rose will bring flooding in the north of Mexico and in the southwest of the United States in the coming days.
The rose has been located 85 mph, a Category 1 hurricane from 5:00 am on a Sunday, and was located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugeni, Mexico.
It is expected that the rose will be a sunset in the north.
Meanwhile, a canal is forming over the Pacific Ocean, and stretches towards the west coast of the United States, and the rose can reach an increasingly close to the Baja California Peninsula as a tropical storm, it will begin deep tropical fever from the northwest.
Rose will bring a median of up to 10 inches of rain to parts of Mexico.
Then, tropical humidity, which interacts with the nearest canal, will form widely distributed heavy clues in the southwest over the next few days.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of reed causes dangerous overcrowding, mudflows and possible earthquakes in the desert.
Thieving tropical humidity causes locks of 2 to 3 inches per hour at various locations, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
As many as 2 to 4 centimeters of rainfall is expected in parts of the southwest, especially across Arizona.
Floods are possible, with weather conditions that are getting worse due to the destructive nature of tropical rain.
It would be extremely light-sensitive to walk in the desert with the risk of tropical closures.
Thick ree can cause canyons to quickly become liquid and thunderstorms will bring locally rough air and dust with them.
The nearest canal will bring deciduous local ree to the portion of the southern California coast.
Conclusions of over half an inch are possible, which can lead to small mud flow and smooth roads.
This would be the first time in the region of the travel season.
Some distributed tropical travel tips are starting to get you closer to Arizona, late Sundays and early weekends, before the ree continues to be distributed, late weekends and Tuesdays.
There will be a four-square windfall and a four-square windfall.
In October, there may be some intense temperature fluctuations across the U.S. as the Arctic gets colder, but the tropes remain quite warm.
Heiansdo leads to dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
A good example of dramatic temperature fluctuations is a sunset in the center of the United States.
There is almost a temperature difference of 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the next few days, the summer heat will try to build up and expand.
In many central and eastern U.S. states, a warm start in October is expected with widespread 80 degrees from the southern plains to parts of the northwest.
New York City was able to reach the average of 80 degrees, which is about 10 degrees higher than the average.
Our long-term climate forecast is high odds of over-average temperatures for the east of the United States through the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched the trial of Brett Kavanaugh.
More than 20 million people have watched a thunderous statement at the Supreme Court by Brett Kavanaugh and his wife, Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexually raping him in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political baggage continues, and broadcasters have interrupted regular broadcasts for the last-minute twist of a joy: an agreement signed by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake with the FBI to conduct investigations during a week of the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she is 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh's full-bodied and tried to disguise her at a high-school party.
Kavanaugh, in a pathetic statement, said he was 100% sure that it didn't happen.
According to Nielsen, over 20.4 million people have watched the trial.
The company has estimated an average audience on CBS, ABC, NBC, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Numbers of other networks that transmitted the process, including PBS, C-Span, and Fox Business Network, were not directly available.
And Nielsen often has some difficulties, counting the people who look at offices.
To illustrate the whole thing: The spectator number corresponds to that of a playoff football match or the Oscar oversight.
Fox News Channel, whose moderators backed Kavanaugh's appointment, led all the networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the process over the day, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS has 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million viewers, according to Nielsen.
Interest remains high in the process.
The flake was the central figure in the drama of the feast.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement stating that it would be for the Kavanaugh to be elected, he was delighted to be given a lift for a trial in the Judiciary Committee.
He stood with his eyes down for a few minutes while he was shot and was live on CNN.
"I'm right in front of you," said a woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth?"
He said, "You have power, while so many women do not have power."
The flake announced that his office had given up a position and, before the elevator approached, he would have said more after the committee's hearing.
The cable and broadcasting networks later reported live on how the Justice Committee should vote to bring Kavanaugh's nomination to the Senate for the vote.
But Flake said he would only do so with the understanding that the FBI's allegations against the nominee for next week underscored what the Democrat minority wanted.
Flake was partly convinced by the conversations with his friend, Democratic Sen. Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and a few senators later, the flake made its decision.
His choice had power because it was obvious that the Republicans would not have the choice to vote for Kavanaugh without the mediation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May has accused critics of "playing politics" about Brexit.
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "playing politics" with the UK's future and weakening national interests, in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Theresa May will attend the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview, alongside her on the front page of the newspaper, her former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson underscored her attack on her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, saying it was a proposal that Britain and the EU should "confront their taxes."
Wayde-Sims assassination: Police have arrested the suspect Dyteon Simpson for the death of the LSU player.
Police have arrested a suspect in connection with the murder of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested for second-degree murder and taken to prison, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Officials released a video of the confrontation between the Sims and the Simpsons and the police said the Sims lost their breasts during the fight.
Police found the glasses at the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA there, CBS partner WAFB reported.
After Simpson's death, the police said he confessed to having shot Wayde.
His bail has been fixed at $350,000, the prosecutor reported.
The office of East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner has released a provisional report on Friday, stating that the cause of death is a gunshot wound from the head and around the neck.
The department advises the Louisiana State Police's Refugee Officers, the State Poice Crime Lab, the Southern University Police and local residents for the assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU Sports Director Joe Alleva thanked the local police for their "smoothness and search for justice."
The Sims were 20 years old.
He grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He scored an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday, De Moien told LSU basketball coach that his team had been "destroyed" and "in shock" after Wayde's death.
"That's why you're always worrying," said Wade.
Volcanoes in the city of Mexico
The popocatepetl volcano has reached southern neighbors of the Mexican capital.
The National Center for Disaster Protection has warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after it became active in the crater, and has recorded 183 gas and ash deposits in the last 24 hours.
The center of the room had a few bells and whistles.
Images on social networks show thin ash layers on cars and neighborhoods of Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed a zone of volcanic activity that shook 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital from a 7.1-magnitude earthquake in Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police conflict with Catalan separatists ahead of the anniversary of the independence elections.
Six people have been detained in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protests with the police were uneven, and as thousands took part in rival demonstrations for the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarizing election for separation.
A group of masked pro-separatists were held back at Oprou against the police with egg and powder paint, forming dark clouds in the streets, which are usually filled with tourists.
In the morning, the guards came out and the police took out their knobs to check the fighting.
Over a few hours, the pro-independence group called "No Forgiveness, No Forgiveness" against unionists who called "long-lived Spain."
Fourteen people have been injured in the protests, according to local media.
Tensions remain high in the independence region a year after the October 1 referendum in Madrid was considered illegal, but celebrated by Catalan separatists.
Voters voted by a majority to become independent, however, the result was downplayed against the separation by the boycott of the election.
Catalan authorities say nearly 1,000 people have been blessed last year after Polce tried to halt the election in the polling stations through the region's violent conflicts.
Pro-independence groups camped outside on Friday overnight to prevent a demonstration on the support of the national police.
The show went on, but it's going to have to go another way.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who participated with his wife in the separatist protest, says he no longer has any hope as far as the prospect of an independent Catalonia is concerned.
“Last year, we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents screaming of joy because they could go a lot, but now hang on to me," he said.
Despite a decisive, albeit scarce, victory in the regional elections in December last year, it was difficult for the Catalan independence parties to remain in power this year. Most of the most well-known leaders were in exile or in prison and were relegated to their respective roles in the organization.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who picked up the phone protests as support for the police, said the conflict had been heated by politicians from the two sides.
"It's getting more and more complicated," he said.
Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in the preventive prison since the end of last year, announced on Saturday that he would participate in next year's European elections.
"As a candidate for the European elections, the best way to condemn the regression in democratic values and the repression we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after car runs home
Three men, 33, 34 and 39 years old, were arrested after a car again ran into a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent in Doneshden around 19:30 BST.
Insp Bob Blemmings said there is damage to the gate and to the building itself.
It's also possible that at some point a gunshot was fired at the car.
Livingston won 1-0 against the Rangers by his goal.
Dolly Menga's first goal secured the win.
Promoted Livingston beat the Rangers for Steven Gerrard's only second victory in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox Club.
Dolly Menge's storm proved the difference as Gary Holt switched sides with Hibernian in the second half.
Gerrard's side remains unqualified in the Premiership this season and will play against the Leaders Hearts on Sunday, which is eight points ahead of them.
The runners-up of Rapid Vienna have won the Europa League in the first round.
Livingston, meanwhile, extend their run in the division to six games, with coach Holt still scoring the victory since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston is trying to reduce the chances of open visitors.
The team should have had the news long before the hit because their directness caused the ranger problems.
Scott Robinson has penetrated but carried his effort to the goal ahead, then Alan Lithgow could only share his effort ahead and Craig Halkett hit the goal ahead.
The hosts were happy to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could cause misery to the visitors.
And that's how the defeat went down.
The Rangers got a free kick and Livingston stood up, combining Declan Gallagher and Robinson to play the manga, which once touched and hit the center of the box.
At this point, the Rangers dominated the possession but found the home defense inpenetrable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was mostly calm.
The pattern continued in the second half, but Alfredo Morelos forced a parade by Kelly.
Scott Pittman was rejected by the feet of Rangers Golkipp Allen McGregor and Lithgow shot broadly from another bout of Livingston.
Crusaders have always come back to the box of Livingston and have always been beaten up, while two elfmeters have been demanded - after the necklace has been challenged to replace Glenn Middleton, and one for handball - have been defeated.
"Wonderful" by Livingston - Analysis
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont at the Tony Macaroni Arena.
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
To a man, they were excellent, continuing to exceed expectations in this high way.
Their style of play and staff has hardly changed since the return to the top flight, but great credit must go to the woods for the way he has refreshed the team since his arrival.
He has a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkett led an immense, super organized defense, while Menge kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their toes.
But the Rangers had a lot of inspiration.
As good as they were at the time under Gerrard, they fell short of the standards.
The last pass felt – just as they opened the home page – and it’s kind of like an awakening for the Rangers who found themselves in the middle of the field.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an is being welcomed in Cologne.
There were laughter and blue skies on Saturday (September 29th) when the heads of Turkey and Germany saw themselves drinking coffee in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany – which was planned to improve relations between NATO allies.
They discussed issues including human rights, freedom of the press in Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an is on his way to Cologne to open a new mosque.
The city is home to the largest population of Turks outside of Turkey.
Police have taken security measures to block a strong crowd of 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters have stepped up to see their president.
Hundreds of opponents of Erdogan - many of them Kurds - have also abandoned their voices, condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him into the country.
Twenty-two protesters reflect the divisions of a visitor who is greeted as a hero by various German monarchs and as a monarch by others.
Deptford Road Accident: Cyclist dies in collision with a car.
A cyclist died in a collision with a car in London.
The accident occurred not far from the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford, southwest of the city, at 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and the rescuers helped, but the man died on the spot.
The crash occurred months after a cyclist died in a driver's flight on Childers Street, about a mile away from the crash on Saturday.
Police said the officer was trying to identify the man and inform the family of the incident.
Roadblocks and bus stops are on the spot and motorists are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Officers Blessed in Disorder
Six prisoners have been blessed in an unrest in a high-security men's prison, the prison official said.
Unrest broke out at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire at about 09:30 BST on a Sunday and it continues.
Specialist "Tornado" officers were summoned to take care of the insurgency, which involved eight prisoners in a plane crash.
The officers were held on the spot for small wounds on the face.
A spokesman for the prison said: "Specially trained prison personnel have been employed to take care of the incident at the HMP Long Lartin.
Six members of staff were treated for blessings.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and we are clear that those responsible for the police will be deported and could spend longer behind bars."
HMP Long Lartin has more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous perpetrators.
In June, it was reported that the director of the prison at the clinic was treated after one was attacked by a prisoner.
In October last year, offensive officers were summoned to prison to take care of a serious disturbance in which personnel were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa affects Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with flooding (dry areas may benefit)
It's rare to experience a tropical depression in Arizona, but that's probably what happens early next week as Hurricane Rosa last sings energy down through the southwestern desert and brings flooding risks.
The National Weather Service has already reported floods for the minds and minds of four people heading west to Arizona south and east of Nevada, southwestern California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take the direct way over Phoenix to the memories and come closer to mind later with rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix wrote in a Twitter post that only "ten tropical cyclones could maintain the status of a tropical storm or depression within 200 miles of Phoenix away from 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the AZ border.
The latest national hurricane center models predict 2 to 4 centimeters of rainfall ahead, with insulated spans of up to 6 centimeters in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
Other areas of the southwestern desert, including the central Rockies and the Great Basin, can reach 1 to 2 centimeters, with isolated ridges of up to 4 centimeters.
For those without risks of flooding, the rose's rain is a blessing because the region is affected by a drought.
Although flooding is a very serious concern, a bit of rain is likely to be good because in the southwest are currently dry conditions.
The United States after just over 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least one extreme drought, the second-highest category," weather.com shares.
Hurricane Rosa is headed for Mexico's Baja California Peninsula.
Rosa, still hurricane-forced on a sunny morning with a maximum wall speed of 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and rebounds north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm caused more water to kill in the Pacific and therefore lost strength.
So, there is expected to be a landslide in Mexico with a tropical storm strengthening on Monday afternoon or evening.
In the case of Mexico, the risk of flooding could be significant.
"Precipitation of 3 to 6 centimeters is expected from Baja California and northwestern Sonora, with up to 10 centimeters possible," weather.com shared.
Rosa will then move north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border and early morning on Tuesday as a tropical depression, where she will then climb through Arizona and southern Utah late on Wednesday night.
"The main danger that is expected from Rosa or her survivors is heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora, and the United States southwestern desert," the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
It is expected that these rains will produce life-threatening floods and mudslides in the desert, and earthquakes in the mountains.
Midsomer Norton's four suspected murderers arrested
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested for alleged murder after a 16-year-old was found dead in Somerset.
The youth were found injured in the area of the Excelsior terraces in Midsomer Norton, against 04h00 and Samsden.
As soon as he was taken to the hospital, his health condition was stable.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and his 20-year-old man were arrested at night in the area of Radstock, police said in a statement.
The police have called for witnesses who may have picked up something on the phone to report to the police.
Trump says Kavanaugh is suffering from the rage of the Democratic Party.
"The election of Judge Kavanaugh as an election against the reckless and infuriating tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at an election party in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had suffered from recklessness in the Democratic Party's leadership throughout the election process.
Kavanaugh has vehemently and emotionally rebuffed Christine Blasey Ford's allegations that he sexually harassed her as a teenager.
Ford has also sworn that it is right here.
The president told a Samsden that "the American perfection saw the splendor and the quality and the courage" of Kavanaugh.
"A voice to confirm Judge Kavanaugh as a voice for one of the best lawyers of our time, a lawyer with a confirmed number of deaths for the public.
The president has unveiled his nomination on the Kavanaugh during his speech on the importance of Republican participation in half of the election period.
Five weeks before one of the most important choices in our lifetime.
"I'm not running, I'm running," he said.
"That's why I'm going everywhere to fight for great candidates."
Trump has argued that he is on a mission to "resist and brake."
The first decisive election at the Senate level for Kavanaugh's nomination should already take place, a senior employee told CNN.
Hundreds of dead in earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia continue to rise
At least 384 people have died, many of them floated away as huge waves hit the coast, as a major earthquake and a tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people took part in a festival on the beach in the city of Palu to celebrate as 6-metre-high waves and half-dark waves swept across the coast, killing many and destroying everything on their way.
The tsunami occurred after an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5.
"As the tsunami was threatened yesterday, people were still on the beach following their activities and did not immediately leave," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesian disaster protection, told a news conference in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, it was full of cars, huts, huts, everything took to land with it," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami at sea speeds of 800 km/h had hit one on the coast.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people have been evacuated and 24 centers in Palu have been evacuated.
Aerial photographs made public by disaster protection show many buildings and buttresses being destroyed, bridges ripped away and collided in a mosque surrounded entirely by water as well.
The samsdens were on the coast of the city.
Earthquakes have been saved in a region of 2.4 million people.
The agency for the evaluation and use of the technology said in a statement that the energy released during the earthquake had the power of 200 times the atomic bomb fell on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geographic situation of the city at the end of a long stretch of bay may have further amplified the size of the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho has described the shooting as "extreme" and said thousands of elevators, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels have been destroyed.
The bodies were found under the rubble of the collapsed buildings, he said, plus 540 wounded and 29 missing.
Nugroho said that the injuries and the injuries could be serious on the 300km long coast north of Palu, in a neighborhood called Doggola, and led me to the epicenter.
The communication "as completely collapsed and we are without information" from Donggola, says the Nugroho.
There are more than 300,000 people living there," the road crosses said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers are involved in the affected areas.
"It's a tragedy, but it can be a tragedy," he said.
The agency has been firmly criticized as his colleagues have only said that his tsunami hit Palu, officials said the waves came at the same time as the warning.
Amateur images on social media point to a man on a higher stack who, by calling you down the road, warns of a tsunami.
Within minutes, a water wall hits the coast, and travels buildings and cars matt.
Reuters was only able to directly confirm the images.
The tsunami caused a massive power outage and the communications around Palu have been paralyzed, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate the rescue efforts.
The army first sent transport flights with aid from Jakarta to other cities, according to the authorities, but the evacuated still urgently needed food and supplies for the most important needs.
The local airport was just opened for rescue teams and will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is expected to visit the evacuation centers in Palu.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 800.
It's as bad.
While the staff of World Vision from Donggola safely arrived in Palu City as to where the employees and tents were located on the site of this office, there had to be scenes of destruction, according to Lord Doseba.
"They've taught me that there's a lot of ruined houses," he said.
It's as bad.
Just as the relief teams began to recognize the extent of the destruction, several have complained that foreign relief teams with vast experience were only allowed to cross the areas on Palu.
According to Indonesian law, materials and personnel are allowed in the country only if the affected area is declared as a national disaster area.
It just doesn't happen.
"As always, a regional disaster," said Aulia Arriani, spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"As soon as the government says, 'Okay, it's like a national disaster,' we can open up to international aid but that's still happening."
As the second night in Palu comes after earthquakes and tsunamis of joy, friends and families hope that here missing ones are among those wonders that such disasters will always appear.
Samsden was rescued as a small boulder from a canal.
A Sunday rescuer rescued a woman who had been crushed under a pile of rubble, right next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian paragliding team, has two of the most missed paragliders who have been shot for the Asian players trained,
Some of the students from the Roa Roa Hotel were students, according to the Lord's Prayer.
"As a paraglider, I have my own emotional burden to bear," he said.
Mr Gendon said, in the hours after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel in the paragliding group went around, WhatsApp sent news to the teams that participated in the Beach Festival.
Sadly, there was only one of them, and only two of them had a wingspan.
"I think that's the only thing that's going to get out of the way," he said.
Robbers stole $26,750 while filling a vending machine in Newport /Levee.
The robbers were detained by a Brink's security man who was about to fill up his ATM, stealing $26,750 at Newport/Levee, according to a letter from the Newport police.
The driver was about to make the ATM empty in an endowment complex and had to pay the money, wrote police officer Dennis McCarthy.
While he was busy, his other man "came running from behind the Brink's employee" and stole his money case which was to be delivered right away.
Some of the suspects have been arrested, but the police have not been able to tell them how much they have eaten.
Anyone with information about the identity should contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
The rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
He tweeted, "Officially known as Kanye West.
West, 41, has been called Ye since a time and has used the nickname as the title of his eighth album, released in June.
The album is set to be released on Saturday Night Live, where a new album will be released.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande for "emotional reasons" only in the show, according to the founder of the show.
Although there is an abbreviation for his professional name as, the West has already said that the word also has a religious meaning for him.
"I believe ‘ye' as the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you'," the West told me early this year, during a presentation of his new album on Radio Big Boy.
"I'm you, I'm you, I'm you, I'm you.
It comes from Kanye, that is, the only one, to just Ye - his mirror of our goodness, our evil, our throughness, everything.
It's a mirror of who we are."
He changed your name as one of many famous rappers here.
Sean Combs is sometimes called Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he decided to love and brother love.
A former Matt singer from the West, JAY-Z, has always played with small and large letters.
The U.S. and the U.S. have sworn to fight only against civilians
On the eve of the 50th anniversary of the bloody end-pressure against students, Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador swore the military would never attack civilians.
Lopez Obrador has vowed to Samsden "never use the military too much to suppress the Mexican fullness."
During a peaceful demonstration in the Plaza on October 2, 1968, troops fired at the crowds and killed 300 at a time in which his left-handed thrust passed through Latin America as.
Lopez Obrador has announced that young Mexicans will be supported by monthly grants and students and by the opening of more free universities.
He argued that violence against women and children in the school districts is a crime.
The U.S. would have doubled the funding of the K.I.
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount in research in the field of artificial intelligence, says the investor and friends of AI Kai-Fu Lee, who has already worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These statements come after hearing more and more from circles of the U.S. government than that the U.S. does not have a proper strategy in researching AI.
Meanwhile, China has presented its plan for the last year: the first in AI research will be launched by 2030.
"The doubling of the research budget of artificial intelligence as a good start, when one considers that all other nations are so far behind the United States, and we are working on the next breakthrough in artificial intelligence," Lee said.
The doubling of funding could double the chances that the next leap will be measured in the U.S., Lee CNN said in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" this month, appeared at Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, as CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the most well-known AI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that beat the highest-ranked American Othello player, later serving as CEO at Microsoft Research and President of Google China.
Lee was aware of the previous technology competitions in the U.S. such as Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge and asked when the next ones would be, to help them find the next visionary.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to get state aid, Lee said.
"It's not just China that's taking the academic top; it's the societies," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have committed the luminaries and the lazy years of universities to working towards AI.
The U.S. Department of immigration has also announced that it will improve immigration laws in the U.S.
"I think the Green Card will automatically measure and give professors in the AI offered," he said.
In July 2017, the Chinese government launched its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan.
The Chinese National Natural Science Foundation funds people at academic institutions as well as the National Science Foundation and other government organizations to do research for the US, but the quality of academic work is only as good as in China, according to the LEE.
Earlier this year in the U.S., the Department of Defense established a joint AI center, which is supposed to bring together partners from industry and educational institutions, and the White House announced the establishment of a Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
In this month, DARPA has launched a $2 trillion investment in a joint initiative called Dry AI Next.
As for the NSF, which currently invests over $100 million in AI.
Meanwhile, where the US government is supposed to have established a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence only for a month.
Macedonia decides on a referendum to change the country's name
In a referendum on whether to change the name of the "Republic of North Macedonia" to "Macedonia" the full extent of Macedonia's membership in the European Union and the NATO, a slash for its ongoing strife with Greece has deterred the admission of membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claimed that the name of Noopeschland was an attempt to join the province and has vetoed its accession to NATO and the EU.
The two governments negotiated a proposal on the new name in June, but nationalist opponents argue that the change undermines the ethnic identity of the majority Slavic population in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he would only vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign has shown that it is difficult to reach the required 50 percent for the elections to be valid.
The woman of the referendum said: "You are in favour of a NATO and EU membership with acceptance of the agreement with Greece."
The founders of the name Wiesel, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the prize would be awarded for admission to organizations such as the EU and NATO of Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of former Yugoslavia.
"I have come today to vote for the future of Macedonia so that young people can live freely under the auspices of the European Union because it means a more secure life for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
Even though it was only legal, enough MPs said that they would be safe and get the result of the vote.
A second-thirds majority in parliament is needed for the change of name.
The State Election Commission said there would be no reports of unrest in the elections by 13 noon.
However, voter turnout is only 16%, compared to the 2016 parliamentary elections, where 66% of eligible voters were elected.
"I am happy to come to my children, our place as in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, who lives in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko announced in a referendum in Macedonia to change the country's name to NATO and the European Union on September 30, 2018, in Strumica, Macedonia.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardakov, 54, set up a small stage and silence in front of the tents of those who boycotted the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to be high headed, only through the hands of the people," Kavadarkov said.
"We're a poor country, but we're proud of it.
If they only want us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia in part of the Euro-Asia integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring us significant investments in Macedonia, which has a chomage tax of over 20 percent.
"I believe that the majority as well as more than 80 percent of the population for NATO and the EU as well," Zaev said after leaving the polling booth.
He said that his "yes" result would be "confirmation for our future."
A recent poll by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research said 30 to 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum - less than required.
According to a report by the Macedonian television station Telma TV, 57 percent of the respondents had planned to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent are math-savvy.
In order for the referendum to be valid, the vote must be 50% plus one.
It would be the first time that a pro-Western government campaign has taken place in the country.
See: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero passes through the entire defense of Brighton and makes a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling broke through the ‘Defense of Brighton at Manchester City and won 2-0 on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero took the ball lightly in the 65th minute.
The Argentinian sturmer crosses a pass in the midfield at the beginning of the run.
He ran like three defenders from Brighton and then opened his field.
It's like a four-pointer.
He's going to take one of his opponents away from the other, and he's going to take the other one away from the other.
Then he turned to his left, where he had taken the sterling.
The Englishman, as with the first ball-bearing on the field, fell in front of the pitch and picked up the Aguero who, with his right foot, struck Brighton's goalkeeper in the right corner.
"The Aquero is currently having small problems at its feet," City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We've been waiting for him for 55, 60 minutes.
Daedalus as it happens.
We're very happy that he scored his goal at the moment."
But it was the sterling who hated the Sky Blues' initial advantage in the Premier League.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
The Aquero crawls the ball far in the middle of Brighton.
He has a wonderful pass over the left flank at the Leroy Sane.
It's been a bit of a while, and it's been a bit of a long pass for the sterling.
The Sky Blues shot the ball straight and the net would have gone out.
City plays against Hoffenheim in a Champions League group game at 12:55 on Tuesday at the Rhine-Neckar Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Playing the game against the Rockies
With the decision of the nationals in the playoffs, as a ground there to force a new start.
But the ever-expanding joker hopes the handout will go against the Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies are still in the playoffs that are one game ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies are clinging to a wild card with a 5-2 win against the Nationals on Friday evening, but are still struggling to secure their title in the first division.
"And if we don't play for anything, at least we can play a big game, knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the audience and the other team that will probably play at the highest level that I will experience this year.
Why shouldn't I do that?"
However, it is important for the people of this country to be aware of the fact that they are in the right position to make the right choices in this matter.
The joker, who will play his 34th start, has thrown a bullpen session on Thursday and will play a Sunday on his break day.
Washington's left-handers as 18-7 have a 2.53 ERA in 300 strikeouts and 220 2/3 live this season.
Trump's election campaign in West Virginia
The president pointed to the situation surrounding his choice of Brett Kavanaugh for the House of Representatives while pointing to the importance of a Republican victory in these midterm elections.
"Everything I've seen is in November.
Five weeks before the most important choices in our lives.
This is one of the big, big candidates — I'm just running but I'm running for real for good candidates," he said.
Trump continued, "You see this feasible, feasible radical groups of Democrats, you see how it's happening now.
And those who are determined to take the power under all circumstances, you see the senselessness, the community.
No matter who they hurt, no matter who they have to pass over to get power and control, do what they want, power and control, we don't give them."
Democrats, he said, are on a mission of "resisting and blocking."
"And you've seen it in the last four days," he said, describing Democrats as "rose and senseless and clumsy and lost."
He mentions the Senate Judiciary Committee Matt of the Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein by the name, which was the most popular.
"Do you remember the answer here?"
Have you read the document?
Uh, uh, waat.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Work is no longer done by God.
It's like being intolerant to those who think so.
When I was in the polls, I was a little overwhelmed.
In the end, I'd like to say that I'm a part of a team that just wants to be a part of the team, and I'm just a part of the team that wants to be part of the team.
My party colleague Joan Ryan treats her as similar because she is resolutely opposed to anti-Semitism as well.
In my case, as the censorship has criticized me because I was wrong about Jeremy Corbyn.
Matt sees the importance of a responsible approach to the economy, national security, and Europe, ironically similar situations in which Jeremy has been criticized by leading figures.
The note to the Nottingham East Workers' Meeting on Joy says that "we want our meeting to be inclusive and productive."
At the end of my eight-year tenure as a local worker, the Friday evening meetings were exactly dated.
Today, unfortunately, just as the tone at many meetings and the promises of "my friendly, my fine" politics as for a long time forgotten when, of course, ever was so.
It is increasingly striking that other opinions are only tolerated in the Workers' Party and any opinion is expected to be acceptable as for the Party.
This is just as shortly after Jeremy took the lead, as colleagues with whom I had previously felt I would have had similar political views on even though I felt that I would have taken the position and referred to a position I would never have taken in the EU - even in the national.
Every time I have publicly failed - and it's not really important what I'm saying - I'm then getting a tirade of remarks on social media against the politics of the media, and which we say I'd only have my place in the Labour Party.
It's not just my experience.
However, I know that I'm better off than some of my colleagues because the comments I get are of a political nature.
I admire the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who are exposed to sexist or racist remarks every day and don't look away.
One of the saddest aspects in these political times is as the level of abuse becomes more and more normal.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn demanded that the Labour Party promote a culture of tolerance.
The truth is that we are no longer of God and with every "non-trust" movement or change of selection rules the party becomes smaller and smaller.
I've had a lot of trouble in the last two years, getting calm, not being too hard, and then I'd be "on the ridge."
But that's not why I came to politics.
Since I joined the government 32 years ago as a student in the Labour Party, prompted by a reluctance of the Thatcher government during which my classroom was almost coincident, I have tried to improve the public services as much as they need it – politics for those who need it most.
I've never tried to hide my politics, not even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have doubted my political position and the points on which I am not in agreement with the current leadership.
For those who approve of the movement of Friday, all I want to say is if the country goes against a Brexit, that it protects the city, trade and public services, I don't understand the desire to waste time and energy in my pursuit of labour.
But the only message I have is regarding the Nottingham momentum, it's for my constituents, whether Labour members or not: I'm proud to serve and I promise that no threats or political statements will take me away from it, to do whatever I believe in.

Ayr 38 – 17 Melrose Ayr unbeaten no above
Two attempts in the last time have scored the final result, but there's no doubt that Ayr deserves the triumph in this spectacular tenth's Premiership match of the day.
Now they're the only ones out of 10.
In the end, it was a better defense, just like the best seizing of opportunities, which the home team and coach Peter Murchie were pleased about.
"We've been in our games so far and we're still unhappy, so I have to be happy," he said.
Melrose's Robyn Christie said, "Good for Ayr, they've gotten the chance better than us."
Grant Anderson's attempt in the 14th minute, prompted by Frazier Climo, brought Ayr forward, but a yellow card for Scottish Rory Hughes, which he received in a game of the Warriors, weakened Melrose and Jason Baggot was able to start an unchanged attempt.
The Climo was able to convert a penalty kick for Ayr, just before the half-time, he then converted an attempt alone for the 17:5 for Ayr.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's run, surrounded by Baggot, was able to reduce the difference to five points.
After an interruption due to an injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was hurt, and a fresh start, Ayr was able to re-start through a run by Stafford McDowall, surrounded by Climo.
Ayr's captain, Blair Macpherson, was then given a yellow card, and again, Melrose was able to use the advantage with a run by Bruce Colvine, after strong pressure.
The home team came back, as always, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card, as he hit the climax without a ball on the penalty line, Macpherson was able to hit a touchdown in the back of the catching Ayr.
Climo was able to reverse, as he did from the beginning, after Kyle Rowe started David Armstrong's kickoff and helped flanking player Gregor Henry to his fifth lap.
A new career in the hospitality industry
Ford Kieran, the star of the show, is looking forward to switching to hotel after being nominated as the director of a restaurant chain.
The 56-year-old Jack Jarvis plays in the famous BBC show, which he writes and in which he plays as a co-star with longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the next 9 episodes will be the last of the show, and the Kernan plans to do something new after Craiglang.
According to official reports, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor borrows every comment on the story, although a source from the "Scottish Sun" revealed that the kernels are about to come into "the flourishing restoration industry" of Glasgow.
The sea belongs to us: Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen the way to the Pacific
Marines are patrolling under the bridge in La Paz's headquarters.
There were a number of public buildings that had an ocean-blue fence.
The naval base from Titicaca to the Amazon runs under the motto: "The sea belongs to us.
It's our duty to do it again."
Throughout Bolivia, the memory and a conflict in the 19th century and Chile's lost coast are still alive - the desire to sail back to the Pacific Ocean is revived.
At the moment, the hope is greater than ever, as Bolivia awaits a decision from the International Court of Justice on October 1, after five years of negotiations.
"Bolivia has the enthusiasm, the spirit of solidarity and of course hopes for a positive decision," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians are following the decision of the International Court of Justice on major screens in the hope that The Hague will grant Bolivia a decision and, after decades of sporadic talks, Chile will be forced to negotiate with Bolivia a sovereign access to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic president of Bolivia - who will preside over a controversial fight for re-election next year - is putting a lot of emphasis on Monday's speeches.
"We're going to go back to the Pacific," he said in a statement.
But some analysts are of the opinion that the court will well not be allowed to decide Bolivia – and that there would not be much change if it did.
The UN agency, which is based in the Netherlands, has no power over Chile and has announced that it will not interfere in any talks.
That the court's decision was already spoken six months after the final negotiations showed that the case "was not complicated," said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
In the past four years, the Bolivian government has been pushing ahead with the development of the country.
"The question of access to the sea has been challenged by the current Bolivian administration," the Zárate said.
Morales's combative rhetoric has weakened, clarified, all Chilean wills.
Bolivia and Chile continue to talk at some point, but it is then immensely difficult to advance the talks.
Since 1962, the two countries have no longer appointed ambassadors.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, as the Bolivian representative in The Hague, has reaffirmed that the court's decision was particularly swift.
On Monday, Bolivia offered "an exceptional opportunity for a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "end a 139-year-old conflict with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also reaffirmed that Morales – still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents – uses the maritime exit as a political leap forward.
"Bolivia never stops announcing its right to access the Pacific," he said.
"It's an opportunity for us to let go of our past, to leave our past behind."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won't happen before it can be trusted by the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never be the first to disarm if it can't trust Washington.
He spoke at a meeting of the UN General Assembly.
He appealed to the U.S. to uphold its promises to become the president of the rivals at the summit in Singapore.
His comments came as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo attempted to revive the collapsed nuclear talks of diplomacy more than three months into Singapore with North Korean Kim Jong Un.
The Ri says it is "a dream" that further sanctions in the U.S. speech against a declaration ending the Korean War would force Korea to kneel.
Washington is cautious, agreeing to the declaration, without Pyongyang taking the first step in the direction of massive disarmament.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is general skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about the disarmament of an arsenal that the country sees as the only guarantee for its security.
Pompeo is planning a visit to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit.
The Paris Fashionshows show a massive rise of head coverings on the streets.
If you want to increase your hat collection or completely block the sun, don't look any further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveil a range of oversized headwear for their SS19 collection at Catwalk, putting the style on fire at the Paris Fashion Weeks.
Absolutely impractical heat flooded Instagram this summer and these designers sent their eye-catching creations to the catwalk.
Valentino's highlight was an oversized beige hat with something resembling a feather in the model's head flooding.
Other oversized accessories with jewelry watermelon, a mixture of hat and pineapple – but they are not intended to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne has also released some comedic masks – right for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks have closed lips and are more similar to Hannibal Lecter than the Haute Couture.
One creation resembles a dive suit complete with snorkels and chests, while the other looks like a melted ice corn.
And if you want to see more - then you will not be disappointed.
It's important to note that the big ones will be able to find their way to you on the street.
The oversized heat resembles the feasts of "La Bomba", the hat with a 60 cm wide board, which one has already seen at Rihanna until Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the intensely impractical heat that has flooded social media sends yet another great creation on the catwalk – a beach basket as large as the model who presents it.
The deep orange bast basket, with bast fringes and a white song print, was the main highlight in the La-Riviera SS19 collection of Jacquemus on the Parisian fashion week.
Star stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect to see huge heat and beach baskets on our streets next summer - because designers have achieved such a huge impact, it will be difficult to ignore the demand for oversized accessories."
John Edward: Language skills are indispensable for world citizens
Scotland's independent school holds the record for academic performance and this year has continued with new outstanding exam results, which could only be strengthened by individual and collective performances in sports, arts, music and other social endeavors.
With over 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council for Independent Schools (SCIS), want to strive for the best level of service for their students and parents.
Independent schools work for their students to prepare for further and higher schools, for their chosen careers and their place as world citizens.
As a school with an agreed and discussed curriculum, we see modern languages as popular and desired subjects in the schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, "When you talk to a man in a language he understands, it goes to his head.
When you speak to him in your own language, it goes into your heart."
It's a strong reminder that we don't just rely on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
With this test, we can see that languages are very high, with the best results within the independent schools.
Sixty-eight percent of students who have studied foreign languages have graduated with an A+.
The data collected by the 74 SCIS schools showed that 72 percent of students had an A+ in Mandarin, while 72 percent in German, 69 percent in French and 63 percent in Spanish also achieved an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that students and young people need without a doubt in the future.
Languages as an elective are now considered the same as major subjects (sciences, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curriculum of independent schools, but also slightly different.
A 2014 survey by the English Commission on Professions and Skills found that employers indicated that it is difficult to occupy vacancies, 17 percent due to a lack of language proficiency.
Therefore, more and more language proficiency is becoming increasingly important in preparing young people for their future tasks.
With more future job opportunities requiring languages, these skills are becoming more and more important in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career one chooses when learning a second language, one has a real lead in the future.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically puts a multilingual person at the forefront of competition.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in England, 75 percent are not able to speak a foreign language well enough to conduct a conversation, while French as the only language still reaches the bilingual area with 15 percent.
That's why it's so important to invest in language learning in today's children.
Promise, especially those of growing economies, gives children a better chance of finding a meaningful job.
In Scotland, every school offers other languages as well.
A number of schools focus on the more classical modern languages, while learning other languages that could be more important for England after 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of what your child is interested in, there is always a range of languages and independent schools to choose from, with teaching staff specializing in this area.
Scottish independent schools are keen to provide a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills they need to achieve something, no matter what the future looks like.
It cannot be disputed in a global business environment that languages are vital to the future of the country and this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages need to be considered as "international communication skills."
Independent schools offer these whales, wildlife and rising performance for the young people of Scotland.
We have to do it.
John Edward is the head of the Scottish Council for Independent Schools.
LeBron makes his debut for the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The time is almost over for fans who are waiting for LeBron James to start for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Coach Luke Walton of the Lakers announced that James will play a Sunday in the pre-season game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
It only has to be determined by how many minutes he plays.
"They're more like one and less like 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Laker reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
As he won, James was asked earlier this week about his plans for the Lakers' six-player season program.
"I don't need any preseason games at this point in my career to be ready," he said.
Trump's Whale Event Tour in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump is launching a whaling campaign in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It's Trump's first of five tours in the coming week, with stations on him friendlyly kissed spots like Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation vote in the swing for his election to the post of Supreme Judge, Trump is splitting back support for the upcoming midterm elections, from which Republicans risk losing control of Congress if the elections are held in November.
What time is Trump's West Virginia election event tonight and how do you watch them online?
Trump's Wal-Mart event for West Virginia is scheduled for tonight, September 29, 2018, 19:00 ET time.
You can watch Trump's West Virginia election event online via livestream on YouTube.
Trump would record this week's hearing for the same-year nominee Brett Kavanaugh, whose whale has been on ice for a week due to the allegation of sexual abuse with a former senator while the FBI is monitoring the case.
But the first goal is to help Republicans get their faces off the ballot box in November and get new swings.
So President Trump's campaign said the five events next week have the goal of "giving new energy to volunteer and support, while Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives."
"Congress' control is so critical to its agenda that the president travels to as many states as possible during the important period of the campaign," said a spokesman for Trump's campaign, who did not want to be named.
Planned for the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, the election event can support the evening from "Ohio to Pennsylvania and be treated by the Pittsburgh media," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday is the second time in the last month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state where he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican senator for West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who is back in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come to help him get a job in the poll," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018 U.S. team proves courage to fight for the hopes of winning a Sunday singles fight
After three one-sided sessions, the quadruplet can be exactly what this Ryder Cup needs.
The swinging swing pendulum is a very invented sports concept, but one that the players believe, and no more so in competitions like these.
Where are you going to tell me that it's a scam?
"They had a lead of six points and now it's the next four, so we now see it as a small swing," Spieth said as he finished for today.
Europe has the advantage; of course, four points ahead with twelve more to play.
The Americans, as Spieth says, have a bit of a wall in their sails and they have a lot to be mounted, not to mention the shape of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together every day, and both of them scored three out of four points.
The spice was delicious from the tea to the green and is an example.
The Friday Kielgejäzi became harder as his round progressed, sinking an important punt for the match and where Thomas is two of two behind him.
His punch, by which they won the match at 15, was greeted with a similar circle, of that kind, a kiss that he believed the American team was not out there.
"It's just a matter of time before the game is over and you have to take care of your own game," he said.
That's all that's left of these games.
18 points to score.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed legends of the Ryder Cup.
Europe's old, but loves couples four out of four ahead and can't do anything wrong anymore.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't shoot Bogey on a Saturday, but those who shot Bogey on Saturday, Freedmen on Saturday, and the nine returned a Freedmen's Bogey as well.
On this run, and as their energy seems to flow in and out of the spectators, cement that they are the players that it is supposed to hit on a Sunday, and there will be no more popular players to seal a potential European victory than when the sun shines on the Gulf Le National.
It's best to have the two at the same time in different shades.
However, it's still a good idea to talk about a European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson have made short trials with Sergio Garcia, the hero of Moien in the Fourball, as a couple with Alex Noren.
A Bogey and two doubles on the first nine buried the Spaniards in the sword in a laugh, from which they did not emerge so quickly.
There's no one there to help you out of laughter.
The four-ball and four-player are so fascinating to watch because of the interactions between the pairs; the rank they give; the rank they don't give in the way a strategy and a distraction can change.
Europe has played better as a team so far and is going well and leading for the last day, but this four-player session has also shown that the U.S. team has the will to fight, which has been questioned, especially the States side.
Europe will go 10-6 in the Ryder Cup final day
Europe had a healthy advantage on the final day of the Ryder Cup after a Samsden's four-ball and the four-match against the USA with 10-6.
Inspired by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the game with two wins over a floating Tiger Woods to take the lead at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn on the European side, who lost the trophy to Hazeltine two years ago, dominated a poorly started American side in the four-ball, the series sitting 3-1.
The U.S. offers more resistance to the four, winning two games, but they do not get the deficit picked up.
Jim Furyk's side needs eight points out of 12 individual matches and sunstrokes to get the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European beginner to win four points in a row while making it to the Molinari, together "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend only the second pair are the four points since the first four matches in Ryders Cup history.
Against the Woods and Patrick Reed won in the four-ball match, they were well-harmonized against an empty Woods and American debutant Bryson Dechambeau at a sympathetic 5&4.
Woods, who went through two games himself at Samsden, showed heansdo brilliant outbursts in the four-ball and four-ball and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, beaten in the Four Balls Moies, came back to play with Henrik Stenson in the Fours and beat 2&1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - the first and third ranked in the world.
Europe doesn't just hate it on a beautiful, bright day in the southwest of Paris.
Three-time winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the pace for the Americans with two points at Samsden.
They picked up a graph 2&1 victory over Spunner Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the quarter-finals and later came back to win against Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the quarters despite losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup, a team has a come back from a four-point deficit for the singles, although Furyk's side only needs examples to get the trophy.
After they were second-best for two days, as always, a counterattack on Sunday looked like it wasn't wanted by them.
North Korea says 'in no case' they would unilaterally disarm without confidence
The North Korean Foreign Minister told the United Nations in Samsden that further sanctions would deepen the mistrust against the United States and there is no way that North Korea would unilaterally disarm its nuclear weapons under such emergencies.
Ri Yong Ho said at the annual general meeting that North Korea has shown a lot of "goodwill" in the past year, such as stopping nuclear and missile testers, rebuilding the nuclear test site, and not further increasing nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"We don't see any response from the United States," he said.
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such an emergency, there will be no way for us to unilaterally disarm ourselves.
While Ri reiterates the well-known complaint about Washington's resistance to a phased approach to denuclearization in North Korea for the single step, he emphasized his statement in which he did not expressly deny a unilateral denuclearization as Pyongyang has done in the past.
De Ri refers to a joint letter from Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit testified to an incumbent U.S. president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, where Kim negotiated a "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula" during the Trump administration for North Korea's security.
North Korea faced a formal end to the Korean War in 1950-53, but the United States first ordered Pyongyang to give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted appeals to relax international sanctions against North Korea.
"The U.S. insists on 'denuclearization first' and increases pressure through sanctions to enforce it in a compulsory manner, and raises calls against 'declaration of the end of war,'" Ri said.
"The perception that sanctions could force us on our knees is a dream of people who don't know us.
"But the problem is that we're going to lose our confidence."
Ri didn't say anything about plans for a second summit testifying to Kim and Trump who first had a U.S. leader the week before the United Nations.
The minister, however, held three meetings with Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, saying: "If the party for denuclearization were South Korea and not the United States, it would be denuclearization of the Korean peninsula and not such a thing."
Gradually, the tone of Ri Singer's speech was dramatically opposite to that of last year, as he told the UN General Assembly that targets on the U.S. mainland of North Korean missiles were triggered by the "Lord Devil President" Trump as he called Kim a "missile self-propelled man."
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, appealed to Kim for his courage to take the first steps towards disarmament, but said a lot of work remains to be done and North Korea must stay on top of sanctions.
On Wednesday, Trump said he did not have a timetable, "If it takes two years, three years or five months - it's not important."
China and Russia have demanded that the UN Security Council reward Pyongyang for its progress.
But US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Tuesday: "The imposition of sanctions by the Security Council must continue and in any case must be enforced until we have fully, definitively and proven denuclearization."
The Security Council has stepped up sanctions against North Korea since 2006, in the hope that it could defeat Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile program by using nuclear weapons.
Pompeo met with Ri during the UN General Assembly and said he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit has not gone well.
In July, he left Pyongyang, saying that progress had been made, but within hours, North Korea denounced him for his "gangster demands."
In a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea committed to dismantling a missile site and a nuclear complex, should the Americans take "dementia-pronounced measures."
He said Kim's "dementia-speaking measures" would abound, that he was looking for security guarantees that Trump secured in Singapore and rapprochement with normal relations with Washington.
Harvard's students have a lot to learn.
A new court at Harvard University invites all of its students to get more sleep and thus try to combat the growing Macho culture, in which one with caffeine in bloom at night.
One academic has found out that university students, the number one in the world, often have no idea what it means to look at themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham Women's Hospital, composed the court, which for him is the first in the area in America.
He was inspired to start the court after he gave a four-way solution on the impact of sleep deprivation on teaching.
"At the end of the quartet, a girl came to me and said, 'Why am I going to be this first, in my last year?'
He said that until now no one had told him anything about the importance of sleep - which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The Cour, which will be offered for the first time this year, explains to students the essentials of how good sleepers can help academic and sporting performance, just as a general well-being can bring with them.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and business leader of the university's health services, said that the university decided to invoke the court after noticing that students had a serious lack of sleep.
The course, which lasts an hour, offers a number of interactive tasks.
In part, a picture of a dormitory is shown, where students can click on coffee tables, rides, sports search and books and then learn about the effect of caffeine and lute, but also how athletic performance of sleep is affected and the importance of a sleep routine.
In another part, they learn that long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of the university area, with interactive icons, then encourages students to think about their daily routine.
"We don't know if it's worth changing the behavior of the students directly.
But we believe that they have a right to know – just as one has a right to know what health problems the smoke of cigarettes brings with it,” added Prof Czeisler.
The culture of practicing learning all night long still exists, so professors, and the modern technology and pressure on students, which is growing, has resulted in a lack of sleep and is a problem that is growing.
He said that insuring enough quality sleep should be a kind of "secret weapon" against stress, overexertion and fear - even to prevent one from helping, sleep deprivation will move the brains and starvation and one will always feel hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemistry and physics biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the court, even after choosing one of his courses in his last year in his first year at Harvard.
He said that the court had opened his eyes and inspired him to invoke the court of the whole university.
He hopes, in the next step, to bring all doctoral students in to complete a similar study program before joining the competitive institution.
Prof Czeisler recommends that students set an alarm for when to go to bed, but also for getting up, and to be careful of the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by electronic shaders and LED lights, which can cause and cause problems spreading out of the lane over the day.
Livingston 1 – 0 Rangers: Menga's goal beats Gerrard's team
The Rangers suffered a further defeat due to Dolly Menga's goal, which degraded Steven Gerrard's narrowly related side to a 1-0 defeat.
Ibrox's side tried to secure this first match since the 4-1 triumph at St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team brought Gerrard his second defeat and 18 games as a coach and left him eight points behind Ladbrokes Premiership's leaders.
Menga scored the goal seven minutes ahead of half-time and the line-up of the Rangers team felt it to inspiration and could not come close.
While the Rangers are now slipping to sixth place, Livingston climbs to third, behind Hiberian through the difference and the goalkeepers.
And there could still be further problems on the rankers after the abyss Calum Spence for a head wound had to be treated, and this was due to an object that was apparently shot at the end of the game.
Gerrard has switched sides eight times, giving him the opportunity to drop Ayr behind and come to the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, chose Livi 11, which cost the Hearts a point last week and he would be thrilled as his well-drawn team hit opponents here every time.
The Rangers had the ball more often, but Livingston had more with the ball than they had.
They could have scored a goal for two minutes in the game when Menga's first pass brought Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder had his big chance to go far.
A deep free throw by Keaghon Jacobs on Captain Craig Halkett gave Alan Lithglow in the defensive only the possibility of shooting at the posts from afar.
The Rangers were able to win control, but it looked more hopeful than faith and her game in the last third of the game.
Alfredo Morelos certainly had the feeling that he would have hit an eleven-footer after a four-hour run as he and Steven Lawless were sidelined, but Abiter Steven Thomsen ignored the Colombian's complaints.
The Rangers only scored twice in the first half on the goal, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly had almost no problem giving Lassana Coulibaly's headshot and Ovie Ejaria's harmless shot.
While Livi's 34-minute start could be seen as a run against the game, no one could claim that they didn't deserve all of this effort.
Once again, the Rangers agreed with a standard situation of Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher shot the ball in between to Scott Robinson, who kept a cool head and picked the Menge for a simple goal shot.
Gerrard reacted during the break and replaced Coulibaly against Ryan Kent, which practically had a direct impact as the outsider overtook Morelos, but the impressing Kelly came up from the side to block.
But Livingston continued to provide visitors with exactly the genres of games they loved, with Lithgow and Halkett taking one long ball after another.
The Holt's side could have continued to take advantage of this lead in the worst moments, but McGregor kept the Jacobs' bass before shooting the Lithgow from a far corner.
The Rangers here replaced Glenn Middleton has a further late right to an eleven-meter as he went along with Jacobs, but the Thomsen looked away again.
Almanac, the inventor of the violin
And now a page from our "Sunday Morning" Almanac: September 30, 1882, exactly 136 years ago on the day, and still on... the spy physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
The Geiger developed a method by which one can detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that later became known as the Geiger target.
The violin goal, since becoming a major supporter of science, has also become a pillar of pop culture, in 1950 the film "Bells of Colorado" was released with actors Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, who liked more cowboys than scientists:
Man: "What then?"
Rogers: "This is a geyser target that is used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you turn off the headphones, you can hear the effects of the atoms emitted by the radioactivity and the minerals."
Evans: "It's so cool, it's so cool now!"
The "Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
His name, however, is still alive, and his name is still alive.
New anti-cancer vaccine can help the immune system to detect malignant cells
New anti-cancer vaccines can help the immune system to detect and kill benign cells.
Vaccination contributes to the immune system, as it can detect malignant cells as part of the treatment
In the method, immunity cells are taken from a patient and then reversed in the lab.
They can then detect a protein that is contained in many cancer cells and then re-injected.
A test-vaccination has promising results in patients with various types of cancer.
In a woman who has been treated with the vaccine, which contributes to the detection of malignant cells in the immune system, the cancer of the egg has disappeared after more than 18 months.
In the method, immune cells are removed from a patient, then converted in the lab, so that they recognize a protein from many cancers, called HER2, and then the cells are injected back.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "drives the growth of different types of cancers," including breast, earplug, lung and durum cancers, Prof. Berzofsky explains.
A similar approach to taking immune cells from patients and "bringing" them, as used by cancer cells, has already worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West started a pro-Trump tyre, with a MAGA cap, after his appearance at SNL.
It's not going well
Kanye West was cast in the studio during the Saturday Night Live show, following a far-reaching performance in which he trusted US President Donald Trump and said he would be a 2020 presidential candidate.
After singing his third song of the evening, called Ghost Town, he wore a cap with the inscription Make America Great, backed up against Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"Sometimes I talk to white people and they say, 'How can you love Trump, he's a racist?'
"So, if I were concerned about racism, I would have been expelled from America for a long time," he said.
SNL began the show with a sketch with Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star makes a list about Brett Kavaunagh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee in the wake of sexual harassment by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it hasn't been disclosed, the West's tirade has been uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear whether the rock has tried to get along with those posts on the west side.
The West has also complained to the public that he has backstage problems because of his head.
"I've been bullied backstage.
They said, "Don't get out of your head like that."
They've been bullying me!
And then they said I was drowned," he said, as the Washington Examiner said.
The West went on to say, "Do you want to see the soaked place?", followed by a statement that "he would take off his Superman costume, no one can tell me what I can do. Do you want the world to go ahead?
"Try to love."
His comments on at least two bends brought by the audience and the SNL cast looked as if it were embarrassing to them, as Variety writes, and one person in the publication said, "It was totally quiet throughout the studio."
The West replaced singer Ariana Grande in the last minute, after her colleague, rapper Mac Miller, had died two days earlier.
The West has annoyed others with the performance of the song I Love It, wanting to make it look like a Perrier's bottle.
The West received support from four-member conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "And one of those courageous heads: THANK YOU, THANK YOU THANK YOU.
But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that the West is simply "ass who it is and that's absolutely wonderful."
"But I CHOSE to reward someone (whether I buy his music or his clothes or his 'art') by believing that a harmful ideology that could spread like that to my community.
He's free.
But we are too," she said.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, and that he would now be called "the artist who was formerly known as Kanye West."
He is not the first to change his name and thus follow in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another rapper, Snoop Dogg, named Snoop Lion and, of course, the later musical Prince, who changed his name to a symbol and then called himself "the artist previously known as Prince."

Game of Thrones star kit harington's attack on males
Kit Harington is best known for his sweeping role as Jon Snow in HBO's brutal fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the actor, 31 years old, attacked the stereotype of the Macho hero, saying that such roles on the screen often give young men the feeling that they have to mimic the strong man to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, the kit said it felt "something really went wrong" and misunderstood how to address the problem of bad masculinity in the #MeToo era.
The kit, who recently married his co-star Rose Leslie, also 31 years old, is said to be "quite strong" on the subject.
"I feel personally, pretty strong, at the moment - where did they go with the masculinity?" he said.
"What do we do when we grow up, when we grow up, in terms of the problem we see today?"
The kit believes that television is partly to blame for the rise of harmful masculinity, precisely because of its extremely masculine characters.
He said, "What is born and what is taught?
What is taught on TV, and in the streets, that young men are many men who are the destined side of man?
I think that's one of the big questions of our time - how do we change that?
"There's definitely something wrong with young people."
In the interview, he also admits that he doesn't want to make a four- or novelty of Game of Thrones when the series comes to an end next summer, and says he has enough of "battlefields and horses."
From November onwards, the kit will be seen in a revival of Sam Shepard's True West, a story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor once said that he finds his wife Rose's channeling the best thing that has come from Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife in the series, so in that sense she gave me my future family, and my life from now on," he said.
In the Emmy-winning fantasy series, Rose played Ygritte, the love of Kit's character Jon Snow.
The couple got married in June 2018 to showcase Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China announces 14% increase in new cases
According to China, the number of people living with HIV/AIDS has risen by 14%.
According to health experts, more than 820,000 people are affected in the country.
The 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The majority of the new cases were transmitted through sexual contacts, which marks an endgame.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly through various parts of China through infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people infected with HIV in that way would have been reduced to almost zero, as Chinese health experts said at a conference in Yunnan province.
From one year to the next, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
HIV transmission through sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is widespread.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who had sex with men eventually married women.
Many of these transmissions of diseases come from inadequate protection in those relationships.
Since 2003, China has pledged universal access to HIV medicine as part of an effort to get the problem under control.
Maxine Waters denies that Matuarbeiter leaked data from GOP senators, speaking of "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
U.S. Republican Maxine Waters has denied rumours that a member of her colleagues published personal information from three Republican U.S. senators on the legislatures of this Wikipedia page.
The Los Angeles Democrat insisted that the claims were made by "extreme right" figures and websites.
"Likes, leagues and even more disgusting leagues," the Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
Among the released information were apparently private addresses and telephone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsay Graham from South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared on Friday online, uploaded by an anonymous person at Capitol Hill during a Senate hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identified the source of the incident had a link to the Waters office, and they had released information about a member of the Waters' associates, lawmakers said to The Hill.
"These unsubstantiated claims are completely false and an absolute lie," Waters said.
"The member of my colleagues – whose identity, personal information, and security and dangers are the result of those honest and false claims – has absolutely nothing to do with the leakage of this information.
"This is a completely false statement and an absolute lie."
Waters' statements quickly found criticism online, including the former press spokesman of the White House, Ari Fleischer.
"It's a blur," the man wrote.
"It suggests that she doesn't have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
If one is accused of having done something that one has not done, then one should not be allowed to be rose.
There is no one to defy.
You don't have to ask the parents of your child for help.
It's got to be quiet and calm."
Fleischer has manifested to compare Waters' reaction to the criticism of Judge Kavanaugh's Democrats, who were accused by critics of rosing during the disobedience on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who opposes water and interim elections, also posted his opinion on Twitter.
"Great," he whispered.
In this statement, the Water said that this Bureau "informed the appropriate authorities and those responsible for the application of the law about these false claims."
"We are going to be sure that your blame will come to the light of day," she continued, "and that they will be held responsible for actions here that are destructive and dangerous to everyone and all members of my office."
Johnny English Strikes Again Criticism – slightly intoxicating Rowan Atkinson parody
It has become a tradition to now look into all new British films Brexit casts, which does not work appropriately in that revival of the Johnny English Action Comedy Parody franchise. This began in 2003 and was re-released in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Is this ironic self-sacrifice, which obviously makes us stupid, worth this nation's export opportunity here?
Regardless, the eye-catching and incompetent Johnny English with a plastic face has his letter for a second time wasting everything – the name of him already says enough, and that is a wide-ranging comedy creation that is intended for non-English-speaking cinematographers.
He is, of course, a dumb secret agent who, although has a comedic appeal for idiotic glamour, has a bit of Clouseau, a stroke of Mr Bean and a clapping of that type, who has a single night to be the "Chariots of Fire" main member at the 2012 opening ceremony at the Olympic Games.
He's also actually based on a traveler and international man of mystery who once played Atkinson in the long-forgotten Barclaycart television commercials, leaving chaos everywhere.
There are one or two good moments in the current Johnny English film.
I was thrilled with the scene where Johnny English arrives at a helicopter, dressed in a medieval armor, while the rotating helicopter blades clatter briefly against his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is seen, but the humor feels "understated" and comedic overwhelming, especially wanting to offer the "serious" movie brands like 007 and Mission Impossible even now with more persuasion comedy as an ingredient.
Humor feels like it's meant for children and not for adults, and for me, Johnny English's silly adventures just aren't as original and focused as Atkinson's daffodil sketches in the person of Bean.
It's a fact that the United Kingdom is currently facing serious difficulties in its own right.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated the super secret Internet network of spies in the UK, revealing the identities of all agents in the attack - unfortunately a small role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last drop that brings the mess to the forefront for the prime minister, a pompous and competitive figure who already represents a total collapse of political unrest: Emma Thompson is making her mark with this quasi-Theresa-May-character.
Here, secretary informs them that every single spy is in danger of having to bring someone back from retirement.
And that means the murmuring Johnny English and person, now appointed as the school director of a distinguished establishment, who, however, gives some courses on how to become a spy: a few dear wits here, wanting English to set up an Art School of Rock monthly spy school.
The Englishman has been shipped back to Whitehall for a briefing and emergency and reunited with his old-fashioned sidekick Bough, again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married, with a submarine commander, a sober role and Vicki Pepperdine is a bit wasted.
So Batman and Robin are all wrong in the name of the majesty of this secret service again in action and make the acquaintance of Olga Kurylenko's wife Fatale, Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister threatens to fall victim to a charismatic tech billionaire who claims he could solve Britain's computer problems: the dark Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
The English and de Bough here begin an odyssey of farce escape maneuvers: disguised as servers, they set a French restaurant in flames; they take care of chaos aboard Volta's luxury yacht; and the English leave behind some anarchy as he tries to unite with a virtual reality unit.
All the sketches are certainly taken out for the last sequence, but so friendly and burschikos everything, there is already something of children's television in the big picture.
It's a medium-sized.
And as with the other Johnny English films, I couldn't help but think: Can the British film industry not give Rowan Atkinson a role that is fair to his talent?
Labour denies that they are developing a plan for the British to introduce a four-day week, which will be paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party considers a radical plan, in which the British work four days a week, but are paid for five days.
The party seems to want the heads of enterprises to recover the savings they have gained through the revolution of artificial intelligence, the workers through an extra free day.
It would mean that employees would have a three-day weekend – but that would be paid.
Sources say that the idea would align with the party of this economic agenda and also with plans to separate the country and favor the worker.
Switching to a four-day working week is supported by Trades Union Congress as a way for workers to become the advancing of the changing economy.
A senior Labour party source told the Sunday Times: "A review of politics is expected to be announced at the end of the year.
It's not worth it to happen overnight, but a four-day workweek is an aspiration that aligns with the party's approach to rebalancing the economy and favor of the employee in the party's overall industrial strategy.
The Labour Party would not be the first to put itself behind such an idea, which the Greens had already come up with in the 2017 campaign for a four-day week.
However, this aspiration is not supported by the entire Labour Party at the moment.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "A four-day week is not a general party policy and it is not considered by the party."
The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, used last week's Labour Conference for his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to take back the power of "sensitive dictators" and "profitors" of supplying companies.
The Treasury Chancellor also plans that current shareholders and water companies could not repay investments here if a Labour government could demand certain "deductions" on the basis of false practices.
He also confirmed plans to place employees in the ranks of four enterprises and the so-called "Inclusive Ownership" fund is expected to sell 10% of the profits of companies in the private sector to workers, who could then receive annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsay Graham, John Kennedy called "60 Minutes" if Kavanaugh's investigation could change opinions here
The FBI's investigation into charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has received a ludicrous vote to his nomination to the Supreme Court at least a week later, prompting the question of whether the Bureau (FBI)'s findings could convince Republican senators to support him here only.
In an interview on Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham whether the FBI could figure out something new that would lead them to change their mind here.
Kennedy was more open-minded than his work colleague from South Carolina.
"Well, of course," Kennedy said.
"As I entered the audience, I said that I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the heat happened, this charge came out, and really said, "Did you do it?"
He was determined, he was determined, he was determined."
But Graham's wings seem to be written in stone.
"I have a strong opinion about the Kavanaugh board and there is already a strong responsibility to come to those who need to change it," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know the following: The board has vehemently contested it," Graham said in the context of Christine Blasey Ford.
"There's nothing to check on all the people they call.
It's been 36 years here.
I don't see anything that can change the situation."
What is the Global Citizens' Festival and what has helped to reduce poverty?
This samsete is worth taking place in New York once again at the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that has earned an immensely impressive line-up of stars who have appeared, but has an equally impressive mission: to end poverty around the world.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival is worth attending thousands of people at Central Park's "Great Lawn" to see not only such musical acts as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also for people on the right goal of the event to pay attention to the extreme.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international NGO that fights against poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it.
In order to get a free ticket (unless you want to buy a VIP ticket), the people who go to the concert have to do a number of tasks, such as volunteering, writing an email to a leader in the world, calling someone or other tasks that help you achieve the goal of poverty.
But how much success has Global Citizen, with only 12 years left to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert, an honest way of requiring people to become active, or again a further case of "clictivism" - people who lack it would make a real change by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Global Citizen says that since 2011, they have registered more than 11 million "actions" of these subsidiaries, targeting a variety of goals.
They say the actions held them have led global leaders to announce commitments and unlock policies of more than $37 billion that will help more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 engagements and announcements coming from these actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been distributed or collected.
The group estimates that the money collected so far has had an impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
One of the main commitments is to provide, among others, The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and emitters who are committed to "helping children live their full potential," promising – after reaching more than 4700 million tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can make social injustice of undernutrition a footnote in history," said Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman at the 2018 London Live Concert.
The group also said that more than 5000 actions in the UK were addressed to improve nutrition for mothers and children, and that the government announced the financial support of a project, The Power of Nutrition, which is worth more than 5 million dollars to women and children.
In response to a FAQ on the website, which asks, "What makes you think you can end up in extreme poverty?"
The Global Citizen responded: "It's worth a long and hard way to go – heansdo fail and fail me.
But, as all the major civil rights and anti-apartheid movements ahead of us, if we are successful, we want to be stronger together."
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe are just a few of the artists who will perform in New York this year, with Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman as moderators.
The U.S. could use a Navy blockade to restrict Russian energy exports – Interior Minister
Washington said it would deploy the Navy "where necessary" to stop Russian energy from coming to the markets, including in the Middle East, as U.S. Home Secretary Ryan Zinke said, citing the Washington Examiner.
Zinke argues that Russia's involvement in Syria - where they operate at the invitation of the legitimate government - would all be just a quadruple to explore new energy markets.
"I believe that they want to be in the Middle East, just like in Eastern Europe and there in the southern part of Europe, wanting to provide energy," he said.
And if anyone can believe in Him, there is always a way to go.
"The U.S. states of America have the ability, with our Navy, to make sure that sea routes are up, and, if necessary, to block to make sure that here energy does not come to the markets," he said.
Zinke addressed the participants of the event, organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance - an American NGO that sees itself as "the voice of the energy consumer."
He compared Washington's approaches to Russia and Iran and noted that they are ultimately the same.
"The economic options for Iran and Russia are draining, more or less, thus exerting pressure and replacing fuel," he said, while looking at the context, Russia as an economy that is totally dependent on fossil energy.
The claim comes while the Trump administration is on a mission to increase exports of natural gas to Europe to replace Russia, which is a much more legal option for the European consumer.
To this effect, employees of the Trump administration, and Trump himself, are trying to convince Darkland of the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which - if one listens to Trump - would make Berlin a prisoner of Moscow.
Moscow has often claimed that the 11-billion-dollar Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is expected to double the current pipeline capacity of 110 billion cubic meters, is some economic project.
The Kremlin argues that the vehement opposition to the Washington project is simply driven by economic reasons and that would be an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a means of exerting pressure and that it should be possible for the consumer to decide on this provider," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. has criticized Germany's position, which has once again reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The Federation of German Industries (BDI), the darkest major industry organization, has sacrificed itself to pull out of the EU's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren is "good to see" whether she will be a presidential candidate for 2020, said the Massachusetts senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren told reporters that she would "good to see" whether she would go to the presidential race after the midterm elections.
At a meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, the Warriors confirmed that they were considered to be candidates.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and flirt with our footy government and that also means a woman at the top," she said, according to The Hill.
"After November 6th, I'd like to see if I'm going to run for president."
The wars criticized President Donald Trump during the event, saying he would "lead the country into a wrong direction."
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump has done to our democracy," she said.
The wars have so far been open with criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet, the defendants said: "Of course, we need an FBI investigation before being selected."
However, a recent study has shown that Warren's own electorate is not short of what he expects to see happen in 2020.
According to a survey by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe, eighty percent of "probable" Massachusetts voters are of the opinion that they shouldn't go unchallenged.
Thirty-two percent found it to be a good idea.
The study showed that there is more support for the governor of Vidrun, Deval Patrick, with thirty-eight percent who are for him to step down and thirty-five percent who are against him.
Other high-profile Democrat names cited in the context of the 2020 presidential election include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would formally decide by January to not fight, the Associated Press said in a statement.
Sarah Palin mentions Palin's PTSD at a Donald Trump event
The track Palin, 26, was a year old in Iraq after he signed up in September.
He has been arrested and imprisoned for domestic violence.
"What my building is going through, what he's going through since he's home again, I can share with other families struggling with PTSD ramifications, and with the injuries with which our soldiers are coming back," she told an audience at an event for Donald Trump.
Palin called his name as "the elephant in the room" and said that her son and other veterans "recover a little bit differently, they're quicker, they come back and ask if there's respect for what the other soldiers and pilots, and all other members of the military, are there."
He was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic bodily injury against a woman, together in the report on general domestic violence and possession of a gun in an alcoholic state, according to Dann Bennett, spokesman for Wasedilla Police.
18 states, D.C., support challenge for new asylum policy
Eighteen states in the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy prohibiting victims of gang violence or domestic violence asylum.
Representatives from 18 states in the district have filed a memoir "amicus curiae" ("ami de la cour") in Washington to support asylum seekers and challenge policy, NBC News reported.
The entire name of the plaintiff in the Grace vs. Sessions locker, which was reached by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy, has not been made public.
She said that her partners "and his violent constructions, which are gang members," had acted as meddling, but U.S. officials had filed for asylum here on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
The states here, which support the Grace, describe El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, from which a large number of U.S. asylum applications come, as nations that have constant problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy amended a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to seek asylum.
Karl Racine, Attorney General of the District of Columbia, said in a statement that the new policy "would ignore state law, federal law and international law."
"Bundesstaatliches Recht requires that all asylum requests are addressed to the facts and emergencies of the request, and such a court goes against that principle," says the "ami de la cour".
Affected people continue to argue in the memoir that the policy would not allow immigrants entry, which would harm the U.S. economy, because they would likely be given to entrepreneurs, and a "important offer of workers."
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions demanded that judges grant asylum only to victims who want to escape domestic violence and gang violence.
"Asylum is possible for those who leave their country because of persecution or fear on the basis of their race, religion, nationality or want to be a member of a particular social group or political opinion," Sessions said in a statement.
Asylum was never meant to solve all the problems – even all the serious problems – that people have to deal with every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu while the number of dead doubles in comparison to survivors
For the survivors, the situation was more and more hopeless.
"It's all going well," said 35-year-old Risa Kusuma, while trying to reassure her little feverish baby at the evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute, an ambulance carries bodies.
There's almost no clean water."
Residents were seen as they went back into destroyed camps here, having their faces crossed by lost belongings to be able to save no matter what.
Hundreds of people were wounded and the hospitals, damaged by earthquakes of 7.5 on the judge's scale, were overrun.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who had a broken back and shoulders, rushed outside Palu's Army Hospital, where patients were treated outside due to the unbearable inconvenience.
As he noticed by feeling, as it was at 5 o'clock in the hotel room, he shared with his wife and his daughter, experiencing a brutal earthquake, he got tears in his eyes.
"There was no time to save us.
I've been torn down in the ruins of the walls, I miss it," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I didn't hear my wife's voice, but it was clear.
I don't know what's going on here or with my son.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. ambassador accuses China of "bullying" with "propaganda advertising"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertisement that claimed the beneficiaries of mutual U.S.-China trade in a U.S. newspaper, the U.S. ambassador to China in Beijing accused the U.S. press of prosecuting.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to China's paid advertisement on the Des Moines Register - Iowa's best-selling newspaper - after a Chinese government announced that it was trying to interfere in the November 6 congressional elections, which China contested.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere in U.S. elections is a new phase of Washington's escalation campaign to put pressure on China, according to a U.S. official.
While it is normal for foreign governments to publish advertisements for trade, Beijing and Washington are currently facing a de-escalating trade war, leading to higher tariffs on the other's imports.
China's retaliatory tariffs at the start of the trade war were intended to hit exporting states like Iowa - which support Trump's Republican party -, according to Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, U.S. Ambassador to China and former longtime Governor of Iowa – an important export state of agriculture to China – says Beijing wants American workers, farmers and businesses to do the same.
China, as Branstad wrote in an article in the Sunday Des Moines Register, "is now lending another ship to them, by now turning propaganda ads into our free press."
Through the spread of propaganda, the Chinese government is going against the long-standing tradition of freedom of expression and the free press by placing a paid advertisement on the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, at the newspaper stand below the street of Beijing, there are few opposition votes and there is no real reflection of various opinions that the Chinese could have had against the economic development slowdown of their country," he said.
He also said that "one of the most famous Chinese newspapers does not want to print his article," but he did not know how.
Republicans have been wary of women's votes before the election with the debacle in Kavanaugh, analysts warn.
While many top Republicans behind the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh are standing up and defending against various allegations of sexual violence, analysts have warned of a backlash in the interim, especially from women.
Emotions around this subject were extremely high and most Republicans said they would like to go ahead with the vote.
"Things like this can't be rolled back," said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, who spoke with The Hill for an article published on Sunday.
Reeher said Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s last-minute push for an FBI investigation to have only pink voters with him was worth it.
"Women don't appreciate forgetting what happened yesterday - they won't forget it tomorrow or even in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior advisor and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, who is happy if one can believe a Washington D.C. newspaper.
The Liberals, as they left the Senate's move, chanted "November is coming!" to protesters, while the Republicans who control the "Judiciary Committee" therefore decided to nominate Kavanaugh, despite the statement of Dr. Christine MiBericht-Nogem.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are extremely valuable," Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst, told the news site.
"People say it's high; it's true.
But it could go even higher, especially among so-called female "swing voters", and the four-year-old and young voters, 18-29-year-olds, who – although they did not like the president – often do not get many.
Even before Ford's public testimony, in which they gave an accurate description of the sexual assault nominated against the Supreme Court, analysts suggest that it could be backfired if Republicans continue with the confirmation.
"This is a confusing transition for the GOP," said Micheal Steele, former Republican quarterback of the National Committee, at the start of the week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just the committees vote or the ugly vote or whether the Kavanaugh judge will be, it's also a question of how the Republicans handled the whole thing and how they handled it," said Guy Cecil, director of U.S. Priorities, a group that helps Democrats elect and vote.
But Americans seem to be somewhat biased about what they should believe of Ford's statements and Kavanaugh, although there is a tendency to believe the blasphemer more.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or perhaps believe Ford's statements, while 35 percent say they definitely believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they believed Kavanaugh likely or definitively won during his tenure, while only 30 percent said that about the Ford.
According to Flake, the FBI is now investigating the allegations made by Ford and at least one other Ukloerin, Deborah Ramirez, as The Guardian wrote.
Ford said last week before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath that the Kavanaughs had abused them in drunken condition at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court has exposed the nominees at a party's genitals.
The inventor of the World Wide Web is planning a new Internet to go against Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, has started a startup that is supposed to be a competition of Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The technology legend's latest project, Inrupt, is a company built on Berners-Lee's open-source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to decide where data is stored here and who has access to water information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee laughed that his intention behind Inrupt was "the world domination."
"We've got to do it now," he said of the start-up.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid's technology to enable people to set up their own "personal online data store" or a POD.
It can bring together contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music library and other personal and professional instruments.
It's like when Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify all stick together in one browser, and that's ongoing.
What is unique about the "personal online data store" is that it is entirely up to the user who can have access to what kind of information.
The company calls it "personal emancipation through data."
The idea for Inrupt, according to the company's CEO John Bruce, is to bring resources, acquire qualifications, and adapt to be so solidly accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of the Berners Lee, the Bruce, a security platform acquired from IBM, some associates working as developers on a project in a community of volunteer coders.
Since that week, technology developers around the world have been able to create their own decentralized app with the tools that can be found on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team do not talk to Facebook or Google about whether or not they should make a complete change, where all of these business models are put on the head overnight.
"I'm not asking permission here."
In a post on Medium, which Samschten publishes, Berners-Lee wrote that the Inrupt has "the mission to deliver commercial energy and an eco-system, which is worth protecting the integrity and quality of the new web on solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he established the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In the last month, Berners-Lee was an influential voice in the debate over net neutrality.
Although an intruder has been founded, Berners-Lee remains the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm extremely optimistic about the new era of the web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: World War I Pastoral Celebrated with "Victoria Cross"
The only spiritual body from the Church of England that ever received a "Victoria cross" as a fighter during World War I was celebrated in his hometown after 100 years.
Lt. Col. The Reverend Bernard Vann was awarded the Order on 29 September 1918 in the attack at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
But he was murdered by a sniper for four days and never admitted that he was awarded the highest British military award.
A commemorative stone was unveiled a Saturday by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it would be "genius symbolic" that the stone would be unveiled exactly 100 years after the action of his bop, which earned him the medal.
According to the London Gazette, Lt. Col. Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin on 29 September 1918 "through thick fog and under attack in the field and by machine guns."
He was later taken to the line of fire and led the battalion again, before he picked up a field weapon with one hand and attacked three of the military units.
Lt. Col. Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 – just over a month before the war was over.
Michael Vann, 72, said he could not justify his grandfather's actions "but it would be a humble experience."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also unveiled a wreath after the parade, which led the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann says he "feels very honored to be part of the parade" and also said that "the courage of a true hero is demonstrated by the support of many people."
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch the Bellator 206 and got instead Peppa Pig
Imagine the following: You've spent the whole night watching a packed Bellator 206, only to be refused the cake of the main series there.
There were 13 matches from San Jose, including six on the main map and they were shown on Channel 5 live all night in the United Kingdom.
At 6 a.m., just as the Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to meet, spectators in the United Kingdom were inconceivable as the reporting on Peppa Pig was swapped.
Some were unimpressed, after they had been extra vigilant for the fight until the early hours of the morning.
One fan described the switch to the children's cartoon on Twitter as "a kind of sick joke."
"It's a prescription from the government that at 6 a.m. the content was inappropriate, so they had to switch to a children's program," said David Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communications, as he was referred to the transfer.
""Peppa the pig, jo.""
Bellator's entrepreneurial president Scott Coker said they would like to revise their schedules to accommodate viewers from the UK in the future.
"I think that when I think about the replay, I think we're probably going to be able to do it," Coker said.
"But it is 6 a.m. on my Sunday and we are not in the position to attend this until the Sunday of our time, the Wednesday of their time.
But I'm working on it.
Believe me, as it turned out, they were sent a lot of news back and forth here, and they weren't all friendly.
We tried to do it, but we thought it was a technical disruption.
But it wasn't, it was a legal problem.
I can assure you that this will not happen again the next time.
We reduced the fight to 5 instead of 6 – as we always do – and we tried to deliver the fans more, but we booked it.
It's a sad situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley 'feels like a man' in sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley said he was raised with the feeling of being inferior to everyone because of his sexuality - but that gave him the motivation to be successful.
The 24-year-old said he hadn't realized until he came to secondary that "not everyone is like me."
Speaking to the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs, presented by Lauren Laverne, he said that he had spoken about the sorcerer's rights to give other "hope."
He also said that being a parent led him to make a lesser effort to win the Olympics.
The regular presenter of the long-running show, Kirsty Young, took a few months off due to an illness.
On her appearance as an outcast in Laverne's first program, Daley said that he had the feeling of growing up "worthy of being a man" like everyone else, because "socially it wasn't accepted to love boys and girls."
He said: "To this day, the feeling of being less and feeling different has been the only thing that has given us the strength and endurance to be successful."
He wanted to prove that he was "something worthwhile," he said, so that he wouldn't disappoint anyone if they figured out at the end of his sexual preferences.
The two-time Olympic bronze winner is one of the most well-known LGBT supporters and he took advantage of his appearance at the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year to call for more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he said that because he felt happy, he wanted to be in a position to live openly and without consequences and to make others "hope."
The three-time world champion said that falling in love with a man - the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "has surprised me".
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older, last year, but he said the age difference was never a problem.
"When a man is so young, so much so" - he attended his first Olympics at the age of 1 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said that it was difficult to find someone who was as old as you and the same as him.
The couple became parents in June to a young man named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said his "whole perspective" had changed.
"If you asked me last year, it was all about 'I have to win a gold medal'," he said.
"You know what; there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My gold medal in the Olympics is Robbie.
His grandfather had the same name as his father Robert, who died at the age of 40 in 2011.
Daley said his father had not accepted that he would die and one of the last things he asked was whether they already had their tickets to London 2012 - because he wanted to sit in the first row.
"I couldn't tell him, 'You're not there to sit in the first row,'" he said.
"I held his hand as he stopped with aunts and it was only when he stopped with aunts and it was dead that I finally admitted that he wasn't invisible," he said.
The following year, Daley entered the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I only knew that it was what I had dreamed of for a long time - to dive in front of a crowd at home at the Olympics, there is no better feeling," he said.
This also inspired the selection of his first song – Proud of Heather Small – that he played in the background as he prepared for the Olympics and still caused a hangover with him.
Desert Island Discs is Sunday at 11:15 BST on BBC Radio 4.
Mickelson at the Ryder Cup and a Saturday on the bench
American Phil Mickelson sets a record on a Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he has to regain his form to avoid it becoming an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who plays for a 12th record at the event, held every 2 years, was sent to the bench by Captain Jim Furyk for four balls and four Saturdays.
Instead of standing at the center of the action, as he has so often done for the United States, the five-time main winner spent his day playing cheerleader and working on the range at his game, hoping to improve what he plotted.
Not even at the height of his career, he was the busiest driver, and therefore the 48-year-old player is not the ideal cast for the narrow track of Le Golf National, where the long-running rough feel-good shot is punished.
And if the bottoms aren't scary enough, Mickelson meets British Open champion Francesco Molinari on Sunday in the ninth game, forming a team with beginner Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their matches this week.
If the Americans with four points backs that start 12 individual games, have a difficult start, then Mickelson's match could prove to be absolutely important.
He's got the confidence of his wife, but he can't do anything else.
"He fully understood his role for today, slammed me on the back, turned his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He has a strong self-confidence.
He's on the sidelines and he's been on the sidelines in the past and this week he's been on the sidelines for so long.
I didn't think he was going to play two games.
I've done more, but that's how it worked and how we thought we had to do it.
He wants to be like everyone else out there."
Mickelson breaks Nick Faldo's record for the most played Ryder Cup matches on Sunday.
It could mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never really reached the heights of its personal record.
Mickelson had 18 victories, 20 losses and seven halves, but Furyk said that his presence had brought the team far no tangible advantages.
"He's lazy, he's sarcastic, he's lazy, he loves himself over other lazy and he's a wonderful man who loves one in the team room," he explained.
"I think the younger players were having fun when they were with him, and even this week, the ones that were watching were lazy.
It's much more than just playing."
The European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a great leap forward can quickly disappear.
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a pretty big lead for the last day's singles in the Ryder Cup can be turned into an uncomfortable ride very quickly.
Dan made his debut in the 1997 match in Valderrama, where a side with Captain Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but it was still just a half-time win with 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2:131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"You'll always remember that we had a big lead at Valderrama; we had a big lead at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won, but also only barely," said Bjorn, who was born in 2018.
So the story will show us and everyone in this team that this is not over yet.
Give it all up tomorrow.
Go out and do everything right.
This isn't until you see points on the letter.
We have a goal and that is to try to win this trophy, and we need to keep focusing on it.
I've been saying it all the time, I'm focusing on the 12 games that are on our side, but we're also aware of what's on the other side - the best players in the world."
Easing as his players beat themselves on a heavy golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never put myself in the foreground.
Tomorrow we'll have another one in front of us.
It's one of the most important things that happens, and that's another one.
It's great to be with a partner out there when things go well, but if one is out there alone, one is tested as a golfer to the blood.
That's the message that must be conveyed to the player: Be your best tomorrow.
Now let your partner go back and he must now go his way and be his best."
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent, Jim Furyk, wants his players to beat each other better as they did as a partner, the nominees being Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who took three of four points.
Furyk himself knows both sides of those big turns because he was part of the winning team at Brookline before they went as losers of the place because Europe played the "Wonders of Medina."
"I remember every damn word of it," he said in response to the question, as Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, collected his players on the last day.
"We've got 12 big players tomorrow, but you'd love to have the quick start you've seen in Brookline, you've seen in Medinah.
When the pendulum swings in one direction, then a lot of pressure is exerted on the midfielders.
"We've gotten to the point where we've gotten to the point where we've gotten to the point where we've gotten to the point where we've gotten to the point where we've gotten to the point where we've gotten to the point where we've gotten to the point where we've gotten to the point."
Thomas was given the task of trying to subdue the offense and faced Rory McIlroy in the main game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans on the other half of the set.
"I've decided to do this setup because I think it covers everything," Bjorn said about his individual selections.
Germany's new warship has been re-established
The newest frigate of the German Navy was commissioned in 2014 to replace the aging warships from the time of the Cold War, but there will be, according to local media, based on sinister systems and ever-increasing costs not completed before at least next year.
The order of the "Rheinland-Pfalz," the main ship of the frigate class Baden Württemberg, has now been cancelled, according to the newspaper "Die Zeit", which quotes a military spokesman, until the first half of 2019.
The ship was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, but the worrying problems after delivery have taken the fate of the ambitious project into account.
The four ships of the Baden-Württemberg class, which the Navy had already ordered in 2007, are thought to be the replacement of the aging frigate of the Bremen class.
They have a powerful rifle, a range of flight and ship fired missiles, as well as camouflage technologies such as reducing radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important functions include longer maintenance periods – it should be possible that the newest frigates do not run on the home port for up to two years.
But the constant delays mean for the innovative warships – which are supposed to prove to Germany its striking force and beyond – that they are already obsolete, before they even compete for the service, notes "Die Zeit".
The accident-hit F125 freighter made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to commission the ship and sent it back to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had sent a ship back to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but the German media called a number of critical "software and hardware defects" that would have rendered the ship in a combat mission useless.
The software shortcomings were particularly significant, as the ships of the Baden-Württemberg class were operated by a crew of nearly 120 sailors - even half of the staff of the old Bremen-class frigates.
It also turned out that the ship weighed too much, reducing its performance and decreasing the ability of the Navy to make future improvements.
The 7,000-tonne "Rheinland-Pfalz" is said to be twice as heavy as the ships of a similar class used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the sensational hardware, the price tag of the entire project – including the training of the team – will also be a problem.
It is estimated that it has already reached an astonishing <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) – from the original <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The problems with the newest frigates are especially important on the basis of recent warnings that the German naval strike force is failing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, chairman of the defence committee of the German parliament, announced that the navy was "providing the assailant ships."
The official said that the problem has worsened over time because old ships are being stowed away, but no new ships are being prepared.
He concluded that none of the frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class were in the team, the Navy was joining.
The National Trust listens to the secret life of Flanders
A new research, which is based on a piece of land in the Scottish Highlands, aims to reveal how flannel maize use the landscape on their hunt for food.
It is hoped that the results will shed a new light on the behaviors of the unique flight mothers and help to develop guidelines for future protective activities.
The study is conducted by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland and is usually followed up in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern corn but also bronchodilated Langour and Daubenton corn at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders are placed on important locations around the ground, to monitor the flannel mouse activities throughout the season.
The NHS staff and volunteers also conduct mobile recording with the help of hand detectors.
Based expert analysis of all the recordings determines the frequency of the fluttering pointers and how kind of what is done.
A map and a report of the living space are produced there to create a detailed picture of their behavior on a landscape scale.
Rob Dewar, Nature Conservation Advisor for NTS, hopes that the results will reveal how an area of living space for flannel maize is most important and how they are used by all species.
This information helps to determine the benefits of living space management work, such as how the shepherds of wisdom and how forestry is best served for flange maize and other similar species.
The population of flannel mice has declined significantly in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom in the last century.
They are driven by buildings and development work that affects sleeping places and a loss of living space.
Walkers and lighters can also pose a risk, such as mechanics and chemical treatments of building materials, but also the attack of house bugs.
Flanders isn't really blind.
But based on their nightly judging habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to the ends of prey.
They use a highly developed echolocation technique to eliminate insects and obstacles on their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the operation of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes Flanders maize very seriously.
They have ten trained experts who conduct regular screenings, sleep place inspections, and heansdo rescues.
The organization even established Scotland's first and only designated flannel reserve in Threave to Dumfries and Galloway, providing habitat for eight of Scotland's ten flannel species.
The land manager David Thompson says that the land is the ideal landscape for her.
"We've got a wonderful area for flamingoes," he said.
"We have the old buildings, for the old trees and the wonderful living space.
But there's still a lot we don't know about flannel maize, and the work we're doing here and on other grounds helps us better understand what they need to unfold."
He stressed the importance of looking for flannel corn before maintenance is carried out on the grounds, because the unconscious destruction of a single breeding habitat of up to 400 females and young flannel corn can kill and possibly result in a very local population.
They are protected and it is illegal to kill them, harass or disturb or destroy their livelihoods.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish head of the Bat Conservation Trust, called on the public to do so, advocating to help.
She said: "We still have a lot to learn about flank maize and for many of our species, we just don't know how their populations are going."
Ronaldo has been accused of rape, and his lawyers are trying to explain it to the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called the rape allegation against him a "false report" stating that people "want to make themselves known" by using their name.
His lawyers want to explain to the German news magazine "Der Spiegel" who published the wrong allegations.
The Portuguese and Juventus stormtroopers were convicted of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in 2009 in a hotel room in Las Vegas.
It is claimed that he then paid $375,000 to not bring the incident to the public, The Mirror reported on Friday.
While he was briefed on the allegations hours afterwards, in an Instagram live video he spoke to his 142 million followers, Ronaldo, 33, denounced the reporters as "false reports."
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they say today, they are false reports," said the five-time winner of the Ballon d'Or and the camera.
"She wanted to advertise for herself, by using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be known by calling my name, but it belongs to the work.
"I'm a very nice guy," the player added with a smile.
Ronaldo's attorneys are preparing to explain "The Mirror" to the wrong allegations, which they call, according to Reuters, "an unacceptable reporting of suspicions in the area of privacy."
Attorney General Christian Schertz said the player wants a decision for "moral divorce with a fine corresponding to the severity of the violation, which will be one of the most difficult understandings against personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 in a suite of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After a meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the player's room where he had been allegedly anally raped, according to documents from the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claimed Ronaldo had fallen on his knees after the alleged incident and had said he was "99 percent" a "good guy" of that "none percent".
The documents claimed that Ronaldo had confirmed that the two had had sex, but that it had taken place with a biased understanding.
Mayorga also claimed that it had gone to the police, and that she had photographs of his injuries, which were shot at the hospital, but had later agreed to resolve the case at l'amiable, because she had "great fears of retaliation," he said.
The 34-year-old woman says she would now try to leave the agreement because she is still traumatized by the alleged accident.
Ronaldo was just about to move from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged override, and this summer he was swapped with a 100-million-dollar deal at Italian club Juve.
Brexit: The United Kingdom will "prepare it forever" to lose the automakers
The United Kingdom will "prepare it forever" if it loses its status as the world's leading automaker, Economy Minister Greg Clark said.
He added that it would be "unfortunate" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if the UK left the EU without a deal, they would temporarily suspend production at their factory in Burnaston, in the Derby area.
"We need a deal," Mr. Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the effects of delays at the border in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs.
The factory in Burnaston – where the Toyota Auris and Avensis were produced – produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if the UK falls out of the EU, production at our factory will be stopped," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's Managing Director at Burnaston.
Other UK automakers have also raised concerns about leaving the EU without a deal on how the cross-border trade should work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW says it will close its mini-factory in Oxford for a long time after Brexit.
The main concerns thus hang together, according to automakers, are the risks of supply in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line will be "completely synchronized," with parts arriving on order every 37 minutes from customs companies in the United Kingdom as well as from the EU for cars.
If the UK leaves the EU on March 29 without a deal, there could be an interruption at the border, which, according to the industry, could lead to delays and bottlenecks at parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to hold a stock of more than one day at the Derbyshire factory, the company said, and as a result production would be stopped.
Clark told Theresa May her Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is "precisely calibrated to avoid the overhauls at the border."
"We absolutely need a deal. We want the best deal that allows us, as I say, not only to enjoy the success now, but also to seize this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4 program Today.
"It's not just from Toyota, but also from other manufacturers that we have to be absolutely in the position to advance what was an extremely successful set of live works."
Toyota was not in a position to say how long production would be stopped, but long-term they warned that the additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factory and eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is the union employee of Unite in the factory, said that his members are increasingly concerned: "From experience, I can say that if these jobs are lost, they will never return.
A government spokesman said: "We have worked out a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein is likely to be postponed
Donald Trump's auspicious meeting with deputy justice minister Rod Rosenstein could be postponed "a further week after Hanna," as the fight for the federal Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Sun lawyer Robert Mueller, who, in the event of a possible Russian interference at the ballot box, is considering connections between Trump supporters and Russia and a potential obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether or not Trump expelled the deputy justice minister and thus put Mueller's independence at stake is the number one topic of talks in Washington.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had talked about being convicted of signing up for talks with Trump and about the possibility of deposing the president over the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein dismissed the report.
But last Monday he went to the White House and, according to reporters, he was there to sing.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was at the United Nations in New York at the time, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he would rather not "expulse" Rosenstein, but you were denied the meeting in order to avoid an overlap with the Senate's hearing of the judiciary shot, in which Kavanaugh and one of the women, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, dismissed all of them.
On Friday, Trump ordered an FBI probe into a week of allegations against Kavanaugh, further delaying a full Senate vote.
Trump's spokeswoman, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
On the question about the Rosenstein meeting, she replied: "There has not been a date set for this, it could be this week, it could also be that I have to give it up another week after, with all the other things left at the Supreme Federal Court.
But I've always loved it, and I've always loved it."
Some reporters have posed the allegation and question: The Sanders have not held any press releases from the White House since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace has asked.
Sanders felt that the lack of rounds of information was not caused by an aversion to television reporters who are on "effectuation," even though she admitted, "I don't dispute the fact that they are conducting effectuation hacking."
She suggested that there would be more direct contact between Trump and the press.
"The president holds more R&D sessions or like any president in front of him," she said, adding without evidence: "We've looked at the numbers."
News circles are still taking place, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask the president directly, then it's definitely better than talking to me.
We're trying to do a lot of that and you've seen that we've done a lot of that in the last few weeks, and that's replacing a press release in the future when you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump regularly asks questions when he leaves the White House or attends public meetings or re-entry visits to press conferences.
Press conferences alone are souls.
In New York, the president may have proved this week why, by looking at a lab and so bizarre appearance in front of the gathered reporters.
The Minister of Health writes to EU staff at NHS Scotland due to Brexit fears
The Minister of Health wrote to the EU staff of the Scottish NHS (State Health Service) to express the country's gratitude and wished that they would also remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, has sent a letter to the UK to leave the EU less than six months ago.
The Scottish government has already committed itself to take over the costs of a contract for a regulated status for EU citizens who work in its delegated public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: "The summer on which negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU on the withdrawal are on track and it is heading towards expected decisions for this period.
But the government of the United Kingdom has also increased its preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know it's going to be a tough time for all of you.
That's why I want to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of each member of staff, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU, and beyond, bring valuable experience and skills that will strengthen and improve the work of the health service, benefiting the patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is truly your home, and we really want you to stay."
Christion Abercrombie's surgery for a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christion Abercrombie has undergone an emergency operation following a head injury in the 31:27 defeat against the Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, the Tennessean's Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee State coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before the half-time.
"He came to the sidelines and collapsed there," Reed said.
The trainers and medical staff tested Abercrombie's oxygen on the sidelines and put him on a beer and brought him to Han for further assessment.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that the Abercrombie had left the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there will be no details on the type/extent of the injury" and that Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury happened.
This is Abercrombie, a college athlete in his 2nd year, his first season at Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
He scored a total of five tackles before leaving the game, bringing his season to a total of 18 tackles.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp duty if they buy a plot of land in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp fees if they buy a property in the United Kingdom, while the additional tax will be used under the Tory plan to help the homeless.
The move neutralizes the success of Corbyn's action to take young voters
The stamp tax increase will be imposed on those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom.
Finance Ministers Expect to Climb to <0xC2><0xA3>120 Million a Year – to Help the Homeless
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp boxes if they buy a property in the United Kingdom, while the additional tax will be used under the Tory plan to help the homeless, Theresa May said today.
The move is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's action, attract young voters with promises, prepare more affordable housing, and participate in well-deserved retirement.
The stamp tax increase will be imposed on individuals and businesses who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, while the additional money will strengthen the government's fight against sleeping on the street.
The additional tax – which is in addition to the current stamp rate, including the higher levels imposed on second homes and homes two years ago – could amount to up to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance expects the move to be worth <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
An estimated 13 percent of newly built properties in London are bought by non-United Kingdom citizens, driving prices into the air and making it harder for first-time buyers to get a foothold in housing construction.
Many rich areas in the country – especially in the capital – are due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad, becoming "spirit cities."
The new directive comes just weeks after Boris Johnson demanded a stamp tax to help more young people own their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping land prices high by acquiring land but not using it, and he urged the Ms. May to give up quotas on affordable homes, in order to raise "residential property" from the UK.
Mr. Corbyn announced an abrupt series of housing reform proposals, including rent controls and an end to forced evictions "without interference."
He also wants to give the community more power to build new homes.
Ms May said: "Last year I said that I would use my tenure as Prime Minister to revive the British dream - that life should be better for every new generation.
That's why it's important to repair the debris.
The UK is always up for people who live, work and want to build a life here.
It may not be true that it is for people who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as for foreign companies, to buy residences such as British burgers.
For many people, the dream of home is too far away and the humiliation of sleeping on the road remains too real."
Jack Ross: "My biggest ambition is to manage Scotland"
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his "greatest ambition" is to become Scotland's manager at some point.
Scott, 42, enjoys the challenge of reviving the North-East Club, which is right in third place in League One, three points away from the top.
He joined the Stadium of Light this summer, after returning to St Mirren in the last season to bring the Scottish Premiership (1st League of Scotland).
"I wanted to play for my country.
I got a B-cap and that's all," Ross told the Scottish BBC Sports Sound.
"But I grew up watching a lot of Scottish players in Hampden as a child with my father and that's something that has always brought me back.
But that's the only chance I'll have if I'm successful in the club management."
Ross's predecessors as Sunderland manager included Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of Alloa Athletic says he's not afraid to follow such established names at such a large club, while previously making offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"I've been asked the following question: 'Can I bring this club back to the Premier League?'
Based on the structure and equipment of this club, it belongs undoubtedly to the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy task to get there, but I would only consider myself here as successful if I can get the club back there."
Ross has only three years of experience as a manager, after a time as assistant manager at Dumbarton and 15 months with coaching staff at Hearts.
Then he helped Alloa catch up from the off-season in the third league and transform St Mirren from the off-season candidate to the championship title winner in the following season.
In the words of Ross, he now feels better than ever during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It's probably a real divorce," he recalls as he took over Alloa.
"I really felt that the administration was the right one for me to play even more like a game.
It sounds funny, but I've beaten myself well, can live well there and have enjoyed some perceived highlights.
But play can be hard.
There's a lot to be done every week.
I'm still doing it as a stress and pressure through the work, but the administration just feels right.
I've always wanted to manage and now where I do it, it feels like the best thing I've done in my entire adult life."

The perfect time for a pint is, according to a study, at 5:30 a.m.
The summer heatwave has increased the recipes of British pubs fighting for survival, but has increased the pressure on restaurant chains.
Pub and bar groups saw an increase of 2.7 percent in July - but recipes and restaurants dropped 4.8 percent, as the numbers show.
Peter Martin of the consultancy firm CGA, which compiled the figures, said: "Enduring sunshine and the longer-expected participation of England in the World Cup resulted in July having a similar pattern as in June, when the restaurant dusted more than 2.8 percent.
The decline of 1.8 percent in the restoration in June continued to worsen in July.
The pubs and bars in which the drinks are drunk have cut off far more strongly than the restaurants had bounced off.
The food and drinks that are served in the restaurant are also served under the sun, although not as dramatic as the restaurant operators.
It's like people just want to have a drink.
In all managed pubs and bars, beverage sales went up by 6.6 percent in that month, while at mealtimes they were down three percent."
Paul Newman of leisure and hotel analyst RSM said: "The results continue to drive the trend we've seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain the most important factors when it comes to sales in the off-house market.
It's not surprising that the restaurant group continues to struggle, but a sales spike of 4.8 percent year-on-year is in addition to the unsustainable cost pressure.
The long extremely warm summer could not come at a worse time for operators in the food industry and the time will show whether the more moderate temperatures we had in August bring such an urgently anticipated breakthrough."
In July, sales in all pubs and restaurants, including new openings, climbed by 2.7 percent, reflecting the slowdown in brand openings.

One in five children has secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents
One in five children – some of whom are just 11 – have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and schoolteacher, according to a survey
The study of 20,000 secondary school pupils discovered a stigma in the "false Insta" pages
It's the fear that sexual harassment will lead to
Twenty percent of students said they had a "main account" that they showed to their parents
One in five children – some of them just 11 – create social media accounts that keep them secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students has discovered a rapid rise in "false insta" accounts - a play on the photo-friends website Instagram.
In the meantime, it has led to the fear that sexual content will be posted.
Twenty percent of the students said they would operate a "main account" that they would show to their parents while also having a private one.
A mother who bumped into the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenage boy calling her "rape me."
Research by Digital Awareness UK at the Headmasters' and Headmasters' Conference (HMC) of independent schools found that 40 percent of 11- to 18-year-olds had two profiles, most of which had been assigned to operate private accounts.
HMC's Mike Buchanan said: "It's disturbing that so many teenagers are trying to create online areas where parents and schoolteachers can't find them."
Eilidh Doyle becomes "language coach of the athletes" at the Scottish Athletics kickoff
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics' annual general meeting as a member of the Scottish Athletics Board of Directors.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated light athlete, and chairman Ian Beattie saw the move as a significant opportunity for those who practice the sport to benefit from their wide-ranging international experience in the last decade.
"Eilidh enjoys immense respect from the light athletics community across Scotland, the United Kingdom and around the world, and we are sure that light athletics in Scotland would benefit greatly if we got shot," Beattie said in a statement.
Doyle said: "I am delighted to act as a linguist for the athletes and I hope that I can really contribute and help bring sport to Scotland."
The American, who won the 200- and 400-meter race at the Atlanta Olympics in 1996 and has won a total of 4 Olympic gold medals, and is now a regular BBC expert, can no longer go after having a transiently shameful attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "About a month ago I had a blow.
I couldn't go.

It was hard work, but I've fully recovered, learned to go again and today I'm doing mobility exercises!

In order to get the information you need to get your mom online, it is advisable to use the
A company for milk pumping has online with an advertisement that compares stubborn moms to cats, who are stripped, reaches the midwives.
For the introduction of the so-called "world's first unobtrusive portable milk pump", the consumer technology company Elvie has released a not-so-music-video-inspired advertisement, for the purpose of promoting freedom, the mothers of mothers – the mothers of mothers.
Four real moms are dancing in a coustal filled with Hee to a music that contains the following lyrics: "Yes, I'm stroking myself, but you don't see a tail" and "In case you didn't notice, this is no audible that they're my breasts."
The choir continues: "Pump or, pump or, I'm feeding my puppies, pump or, pump or, I'm stroking my ponds."
The ad, which was posted on the company's Facebook page, however, sparked a controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video sparked mixed reactions among spectators, many of whom say it raises the "horror" of the dairy industry.
"It's a very bad decision to use to promote this product.
Just like we have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, with the exception that her babies will be removed a few days after birth," one wrote.
Ellie's mother, Ellie's mother, is the mother of
Another commented: "Understandably traumatic for the mother as well as for the baby.
"Why don't they use a milk pump for mothers who are nursing their babies?"
Another said, "It's such an inconvenience."
Others defended the advertisement, while a mother admitted that she found the song "immensely funny."
"I think this is a brilliant idea.
I'd buy one if I were still going to buy it.
By the time I got there, I felt like I had a cold.
It's a bit crazy, but I'm pretty sure it's what it is.
"This is a great product," he wrote.
Another commented: "This is a list of advertisements aimed at moms who are pumping up (often at their work or the toilets) and feel like "wow."
"This is not an advertisement that runs or condemns the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, the women show that they all danced with the discreet pumps that were placed in their bra.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the view that many women who pump milk say they feel like they're going to die.
Elvie's pump, however, is quite inconspicuous, has no twists or turns and fits discreetly in a fitting socket and asks women to move freely, to hold their babies and even to go out during the pumping.
Ana Balarin, Partner and ECD at "Mother" commented: "Elvie's pump is a revolutionary product that deserves a bold and provocative introduction.
By pulling a parallel, between pumping mothers and milk, we wanted to raise the pumps of milk and the associated challenges and at the same time demonstrate in a sustained and compelling way.
This isn't the first time that Elvis's headlines have been made.

Hundreds of Migrant Children Sit Silently in a Tent Camp on the Texas Border
The number of detained migrant children has reached a peak, although the possible border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, partly because of the Trump administration's harsh rhetoric and the guidelines they have followed making it difficult for children to sponsor.
Traditionally, most sponsors were themselves undocumented immigrants and risked their own opportunity to stay in the country, to put on the game, by registering themselves, to adopt a child.
The risk rose in June as federal agencies announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their state would have to give up their fingerprints, and that the dates would be shared with the immigration agencies.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, told Congress that the agency had detained dozens of children of people who had committed to sponsoring unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of the detainees had not previously been pre-trial detained.
"Nearly 80 percent of the people who are either sponsors or sponsors are illegal here in the country, and a large proportion of them are criminal aliens.
"We're going to follow these people," said the Lord Albenz.
In trying to get the children off work faster, officials, according to subcontract employees, introduced new rules, requiring some of them to appear before court within a month after the appointment, rather than after 60 days (the previous standard).
Many appear via video conferencing instead of in person to forward their case to an immigration judge for legal status.
Those who do not qualify for the aid will be quickly dismissed.
The longer the children remain in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious and depressed, which, according to subcontract workers and reporters who have been known to be out of the system in recent months, can lead to violent outbreaks or attempts to flee.
Advocates have argued that these concerns are further reinforced in a larger facility like Tornillo, where it is more likely that the signs based on the facility's size will be overshadowed by the fact that a child is struggling with it.
They added that the bestowal of children in the tent city would not prepare enough time to prepare them emotionally or to tell friends that the trauma with which they are struggling could worsen.
Syria demands that the U.S., France and Turkey immediately withdraw their "occupation"
At the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return to their homes, although the war in the country has lasted for eight years.
Al-Moualem, who is also deputy prime minister, said the foreign forces are stopping illegally on Syrian soil on the pretext of combating terrorism and are being "consequentially deported with them."
"They have to go straight to the bottom of the table," he told the audience.
Al-Moualem insisted that the "war on terror in Syria is as good as it is now," where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions of others have lost their homes.
He said that Damascus "continues its holy struggle until we have cleared all Syrian areas" of terrorist groups as well as "illegal foreign presences."
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and advising Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs fighting President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground of the war-torn country.
Regarding the refugees, al-Moualem said prayers for them to be in line to return, and he accused "some Western countries" of "spreading irrational fears" that urged refugees to stay away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate this return," he said.
"They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian problem."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no build-up aid for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last major rebel-held city of Idlib has created an opportunity to advance political talks.
The Russian-Turkish deal has prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, where three million people live.
Al-Moualem, however, warned that the deal would have "clear deadlines" and expressed the hope that the military action would take jihadists, including fighters from the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra front and the Vizir, "out."
UN Secretary-General Staffan de Mistura hopes that the first meeting of a new committee of government and opposition members will soon come together to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and establish the way for elections.
Al-Moualem called for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, saying that the work of the council should be restricted to "reviewing the articles of the current constitution," and warned against interference.
Why Trump won a second term in office
According to that logic, Mr Trump would win the new election in 2020, unless how many liberal spectators are likely to hope that a resignation or a scandal would prematurely end his presidency.
What a dramatic end to a presidency that has ever happened!'"
So far, however, there has been no sign of extinction.
Since 2014, the number of headline broadcasts on CNN has doubled to 1.05 million and MSNBC has nearly tripled to 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen, Fox News averaged 2.4 million headline viewers, four years ago it was 1.7 million, and MSNBC's "Rachel Maddow Show" hit the cable rate with no less than 3.5 million viewers.
"This is a fire that people don't care about because it's something we don't understand," Neal Baer, the serial director of ABC's "Designated Survivor," said about a government secretary who becomes president after an attack destroyed the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a well-known comedian and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club" has a different theory.
He took a taxi to Boston before the whale crashed in 2016.
The driver told him that he was going to choose Mr. Trump.
Why? he asked.
He replied, "Well, he made me laugh," Mrs. Scovell told me.
There is chaos in the chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, the actions from the White House could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families will reunite and the health of the global economy.
Ignoring this is a luxury that can only be afforded to the most privileged spectators.

Sweepstakes from the outside and the midterms for the race around the house
It's no surprise that the 17th District of Pennsylvania is seeing an outpouring of money, thanks to the realignment of the congressional districts, which have received two incumbents in a race for the same seat.
This newly renovated suburban district of Pittsburgh is to the detriment of Democratic Representative Conor Lamb – who won his seat in a Sunday election last spring in another district.
The Lamb faces another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who represents the Ament in the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which overlaps with the new 17th.
The maps were re-drawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were being manipulated by Republicans in violation of the constitution.
The race around the new 17th has left a beating exchange for campaign funding between the main funding arm, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb has become a well-known name after a narrow victory in a much-watched Sunday election in March for Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District.
The seat was held for over a decade by a Republican and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts have given the Democrats a light lead.
The U.S. has been considering El Salvador to punish China's support, but has abandoned it.
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, without much resistance from the United States.
Mr. Trump had a heartfelt meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and he had a hotel in Panama until the partners took out the Trump Organization's management team.
State Department officials have decided to withdraw the U.S. leaders of their diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama due to the "recent decision not to recognize Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, a spokeswoman for the ministry.
However, only penalties were tested against El Salvador, which received approximately $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including for drug controls, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, which cut financial aid payments and impose visa restrictions, have been painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates, he said.
As progress was made at internal meetings, the officials of North and Central America held a high-level conference with a focus on security and economic prosperity, to conclude a similar meeting last year, which, as a step towards progress in the efforts made, will be followed by steps towards
But in mid-September, leading officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to be convened and thus effectively ended all transfers for punishment measures for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence must now set up the conference, scheduled for mid-October, as a signal for the imports that the administration is setting for the meetings, diplomats said.
The three U.S. ambassadors returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic, with no news or punishment from Washington.
A representative of the White House spokesperson for Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate, citing three American diplomats, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal views on the conditions of anonymity.
Their reports were confirmed by an external analyst who works closely with the administration and who also spoke about the conditions of anonymity.
The history of learning
Your next job message could be Special Investigator Robert Mueller's report on Mr. Trump's possible legal impediment, on which there is now substantial evidence in the public files.
Mr Mueller, according to reports, also wants to find out with his enquiry about Mr Trump's campaign with Russia to attack our elections.
If the congress is to be reconvened, then Mr Trump will have to show responsibility before the new set-up, sooner and later the electorate will have to decide again, and perhaps even a jury of his colleagues.
That's a lot of conditions, and I don't want to suggest that Mr. Trump's demise is inevitable - or that of his European equivalents.
We all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will have an impact on the length of this conflict.
In 1938, German officers were ready to start a coup against Hitler, when the West had only resisted him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and did not seize the opportunity to avoid the years of massacres that resulted from it.
The course of history revolves around such turning points, in which democracy's relentless march is accelerated or delayed.
The U.S. is currently facing some of these challenges.
What do we do when Mr. Trump releases Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein is in a heated situation since this newspaper reported that he had suggested last year that he secretly picked up the president and speculated that he was not for his post.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times report is flawed.
"What will be our reaction if Brett Kavanaugh's newly-demanded F.B.I. investigation is not complete or fair - or if he is sworn in in the Supreme Court, even if there are credible accusations of sexual abuse and dishonest statements against him?
And, above all, will we in the midterms elect a congress that will hold Mr Trump accountable?
If we don't do that, we're going to have a bad time.
But I don't think we will fail, because of a lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who belonged to the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy hometown and was deported to Auschwitz.
She survived, emigrated to America, and, 60 years later, she sent me out to start the Sabbath candles on the table with the Swastika afterwards.
With that in my heritage, how can I not be an optimist about our future?"

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers optimistic ahead of Rapid Vienna fight
The Rangers host Rapid Vienna a Thursday is aware that the victory against the Austrians, having initially played this mountain in Spain impressively equal against Villarreal, brings them in a strong position for themselves to qualify for Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury caused midfielder Graham Dorrans to hold off playing his first game of the season since the 2-2 draw with Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use this result as a springboard for better things to achieve.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal are a good side," said the 31-year-old.
"We went into the game with the belief that we got something and they went home with a point.
We might have been able to find out about it in the end, but in general, a match is probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half and we were in the second half the better side.
In the meantime, it's a big European night.
Hopefully we can get three points but that will be a difficult match because they have had a good result in their last match but, with the spectators on our side, I'm sure we can continue and get a positive result.
Last year was definitely hard, with everything going on with my injuries and the changes in the club itself but it feels good now.
The squad is good and the boys have a lot of fun; the training is good.
Hopefully we'll be able to go ahead and be behind the last season and be successful."
Women can't sleep because of this fear of retirement savings
Even though the participants of the survey had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few people talk to members of their family about it.
About half of the individuals in this nationwide study said they were going to talk to their partner about the costs of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they were going to talk to their children about it.
"People want to be provided by a member of their family, but they don't take the steps to have the conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice president of nationwide their life insurance company.
That's how one starts.
Talk to your partner and children: You can't prepare your family to take care of you if you don't know your desires early enough.
Work with your advisor and your family to discuss where and how they can get support, as the choices play an important role in calculating the costs.
Involve your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you find an opportunity to pay the costs.
Your choices to pay for your long-term service include a traditional long-term service insurance policy, a hybrid cash value life insurance policy to help cover the costs, or a self-insurance policy with your own wealth - as long as you have the money.
You're in the process of creating your own legal documents
Establish a health insurance proxy so that a person who is dear to you can monitor your health insurance and ensure that your professional wishes are met in the event that they are not able to communicate.
You also need to consider a power of attorney for your finances.
You're going to choose a person your pet trusts to make your financial decisions and ensure that the bills will be paid in case you become incapacitated.
Don't forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on the way to the hospital.
Will you be able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
Write down the details in a written plan so that the door is ready.

Earthquakes and Tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died during a severe earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian state of Palu de Friden, according to the Housing Authority, with the expectation that the number of deaths will still rise.
Because the communication capabilities are broken, the official aid could not get any information from the Donggala Regency, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake with a force of 7.5.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated to Palu after the disaster.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was in the process of celebrating its 40th birthday when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala is a regency that stretches over more than 300km (180 miles) from the coast in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The Regency, an administrative region under the province, has an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the foundation of the economy of the Central Sulawesi Province, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Necklace construction is also important in the province, but it is mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis in the last 100 years, according to information from the Indonesian disaster relief agency.
In 1938, a tsunami in Donggalamei killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
A tsunami also struck the west of Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is undergoing seismic fires and is regularly affected by earthquakes.
Here are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis of the past year:
2004: A major tsunami hit 14 countries on 26 Dec. 2004 on the western coast of Indonesia's Aceh Province in northern Sumatra, killing 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them.
2005: A series of strong bends hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds have died on the island of Nias, and the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-strong force hit the south of Java, the most populous island of Indonesia, and a tsunami caused it to land on the south coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-strong bend hit near the city of Padang, the capital of Western Sumatra Province.
More than 1,100 people have died.
2010: A 7.5 strong bend hit one of the Menawai islands, near Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A superficial bend hit the Pidie Jaya Regency in Aceh and caused destruction and panic as people remembered the devastation of the deadly bend in the tsunami.
There was no tsunami this time, but more than 100 people were killed by collapsed buildings.
2018: Large waves hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok and killed more than 500 people, mainly on the northern side of the island.
The building has destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily detained thousands of tourists on the island.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence
The track Palin, the eldest son of former Governor of Alaksa and Vice Presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested for alleged aggression.
Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was released on Saturday due to suspicion of domestic violence, application of a report of domestic violence and resistance to a stronghold, according to a report released by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to a police report, as a female acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took his phone away.
Palin is in custody at the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and is held on an unsecured debt of $500, KTUU reported.
He was on trial on Saturday , where he declared that he was "not at all guilty" when a plea of guilty was asked, the broadcaster said.
Palin faces three class-A pardons, which means he could go to jail for a year and get a $250,000 fine.
He was also convicted with a Class B pardon, punishable by a day in prison and a fine of $2000.
This isn't the first time that Palin has been shot.
In December 2017, he was executed, and his father, Todd Palin, had been imprisoned.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Veteran's Court of Alaska.
In January 2016, a case was filed due to domestic violence, the application of a report of a domestic violence crime and due to possession of a weapon while drunk and in connection with the incident.
His friend said that he had slapped him in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 for seeing her son's violent behavior and connection to PTSD from his service in Iraq.
Indonesian Tsunami: Hundreds of people killed
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are out and it is expected that the number of deaths will increase in the next few days.
The earthquake struck a little far from the center of Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
There are videos circulating on social networks that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the shore.
Federal Prosecutors Want Rare Death Penalty for Suspects of NYC Terror Attack
Federal prosecutors in New York want the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City terror attack that killed eight people — a rare sentence that has not been executed in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a rewarded home depot truck to carry out the attack on a motorway along the West Side Highway and Lower Manhattan, and had pedestrians and cyclists overrun in his path in October.
To justify a death sentence, prosecutors must prove that Saipov "deliberately" killed eight people and "deliberately" caused serious bodily harm, according to the statement of intent for the death sentence, obtained from the Southern District of New York.
The two of them may be subjected to a death penalty, according to a court case.
A week after the attack, a federal grand jury acquitted Saipov of 22 counts, which included eight counts of murder in aid of protection money smuggling, which is normally used by federal prosecutors in cases of organized crime, and one count due to violence and motorized firing.
The attack required "substantial planning and premeditation," prosecutors said, describing the manner in which Saipov executed it as "cruel, feasible and extinct."
"The Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, insults, and losses to families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan DIEGO Mendoza and Damian Pagnucco," the statement read.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It is a decade since her Southern District of New York for the charges followed a death penalty case.
The detainee, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug addicts but was finally sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed after conspiring for two years earlier to spy for the Soviet Union.
The two Rosenbergs were killed by electric shock on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, has shown a lack of regret in the days and months following the attack, according to court filings.
He told the police that he was going to feel good about what he had done, the police said.
Saipov told the agencies that he was inspired to carry out the attack after an ISIS video was watched on his phone, according to the indictment.
He also asked for ISIS to hang up in his hospital room, police said.
He didn't make any mistakes for the 22-year-old.
David Patton, one of the federal prosecutors representing Saipov, said they were "obviously disappointed" with the decision to prosecute him.
"More people think that the decision to consider the death penalty will prolong the trauma of these events for everyone, rather than a confession of guilt and a life in prison without the possibility of being released," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team has already asked him not to consider the death penalty.

Nigel Farage vowed during a protest at a Tory conference today that a "people's army will mobilize."
The former UKIP leader said politicians had "must muscle the heat" of the Eurosceptics - while one of May's own MPs suggested that he should lead negotiations with the EU.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bone told the Birmingham march that the UK would already be "out" if Mr Farage were Brexit secretary.
But the challenge that Ms May faced to bring back the deeply separate ranks has been highlighted by pro-remain Tory, who joined a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister has problems keeping his Chequers compromise plan around the attacks of Brexiteers, remainers in the EU at bay.
Allies have insisted that he should continue to fight to get a deal with Brussels, despite the backlash – and force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose either his package or ‘chaos’.
Lord Bone told the Leave Means Leave Rally in Solihull that he would kick out the checkers."
He suggested that the Lord Farage should become a peer and take responsibility for the negotiations in Brussels.
"If he was going to suffer, we'd be out now," he said.
Wellingborough MP added: "I stand up for Brexit but we have to get the checkers out."
To make his opposition to the EU clear, he said: "We have not fought in world wars to be subjugated.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.
Mr Bone has suggested that public opinion has changed since the 2016 election: The idea that the British people have changed their opinion and want to remain is completely wrong."
Tory Brexiter Andrea Jenkyns was also on the march, and the journalists said: I would just: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"Chequers is not popular with the public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not popular with our party and our activists who are really going through the streets and leading us to be elected at all.
When I'm up, I let the checkers fall and start listening."
In a press release to Mrs. May, she added: "The prime ministers will keep their job if they keep their promises."
Mr Farage told the rally that politicians must 'sweep the heat' if they are to back the decision of the 2016 referendum.
"It's about trust between us - the people - and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to reverse Brexit and we're here today to tell them 'don't let you get there.'"
In a message to an enthusiastic audience, he added: "I think that our political class, which is just ahead of Brexit, is letting go of the heat.
"More will mobilize the popular armies of this country that have given us the victory with Brexit and will never rest until we are an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom."
In the meantime, the Remainers marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the center of the city.
A small group of activists rallyed around after the group's founding this weekend's Tories Against Brexit banners.
Labour peer Lord Adonis had a quarrel with the Conservatives over the security concerns they had with a party app when the conference began.
"These are the people who tell us that they know the IT systems and all the technology to install for Canada plus plus, for a seamless border, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
It's a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit," he added.
It's going to be a "severe look" for presidential candidates.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she was "seriously looking forward to becoming a presidential candidate" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke to the Samsden about their future during a speech at the Stathal in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a regular critic of President Donald Trump, ran for re-election in November against GOP state Republican Geoff Diehl, who was Trump's co-chairman of his 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
It was the center of speculation that was going to defeat Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with the electorate in the Stadhal format since Trump took office.
One of the candidates asked if he was going to be a presidential candidate.
The Warriors responded that it would be time "for the women to go to Washington to stain our pitiless government, and that also means that a woman must be at the top."
There's no doubt about it, LSU Sims
Police in Baton Rouge, LA, announced on Saturday that a suspect has been arrested in connection with the deadly shooting of basketball player Wayde Sims.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at 11 a.m. ET press conference.
They released a happy video of the scissors, and asked for help to identify the man who was seen in the video.
The Sims, 20, was shot and killed early on from the Southern University campus.
"The Wayde Sims suffered a shot in the head and died as a result," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wayde tried to help his colleague and was shot by the Simpsons.
Simpson was questioned and admitted that he was at the scene, with a gun, and admitted that he shot the Wayde Sims.
The Simpsons were arrested without charge and detained in the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
The Sims, a 6.6ft junior who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games with 10 starts last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points, and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton is known for the world title more after the team's success gives him the victory over Sebastian Vettel.
It is clear that the Mercedes team will play a major role in the race as Valtteri Bottas qualified the Saturdays ahead of Lewis Hamilton.
From the pole, Bottas got a good start and almost took Hamilton away while defending his position and defending the first two animals and the Vettel invited his teammates to attack.
Vettel was the first to go in the pits and drove Hamilton to drive the traffic to the end of the pack, which should have been decisive.
The Mercedes then drove a tour in the pits and was shown behind the vet as he came out, but the Hamilton became the first after a wheel-to-wheel action, because the Ferrari driver unintentionally had to release the banner and still risked retaliation for after a double overturn to the Verde.
Max Verstappen started in the lunar row of the grid and was the seventh at the end of the first tour on his 21st birthday.
He was then for a majority of the race the first while holding one of his tyres to score a quick finish and to take over the Kimi Raikkonen for fourth.
He was finally driven at the 44th round and the pits but he was not able to raise his rhythm and the last eight animals afterwards, while the Raikkonen got the fourth place.
It's a tough day because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and he was a real gentleman to let me along.
The team has hired such an exceptional job to have one and two, Hamilton said.
It was a very bad body language.
President Donald Trump made fun of Senator Dianne Feinstein on Saturday at a rally because he insisted that his letter to Christine Blasey Ford, accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault, had not been leaked.
During a speech at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not speak directly about Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead commented that what the Senate suggests shows that people are "good and fair and dishonest."
"The one thing that could happen and the beautiful thing that has been going on in the Senate over the last few days, when one sees the roses, when one sees the people who are pink and evil and honest and dishonest," he said.
"When someone looks at what's being done publicly and leaks and says, 'Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember you?
Dianne Feinstein, did you have a leak?
"Remember his answer... you leaked the document - 2oh, oh, what?
Oh, no, no, no.
I didn't leak.
Oh, wait a minute.
"No, no, no, no, no," he whispered to the senator.
Feinstein received the letter detailing the allegations against Ford's Kavanaugh in July, and it was leaked in early September - but Feinstein denied knowing the leak from his office.
"I didn't conceal Dr. Ford's claims, I didn't leak his story," Feinstein told the committee.
"He asked me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential as he asked."
But his refusal did not go well with the president, who, during a rally on Saturday, commented: "I tell you, that was very bad body language.
"Maybe not, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The president, who continued to nominate his defense of the Supreme Court, who was convicted by three women for sexual misconduct, suggested that Democrats would use the allegations for their own purposes.
"They want to get back the power with all the means they need.
"There's no one to blame, no one to blame, no one to blame, no one to blame, no one to blame, no one to blame," he said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars claimed the loss in the Elite League against the Belfast Giants by winning the 5-3 draw to Dundee a Saturday.
The Giants were early on with two goals through strikes by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie made the home team tie before the giants came back due to the dwyer.
France's Francois Bouchard scored two goals for Dundee, ahead of Lukas Lundvald Nielsen Goaler.
It was a third Elite League defeat of the season for Adam Keefe's men, who came from Hanover to defeat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast a free evening.
It was a fourth meeting of the season between the two sides, and the giants won the three games previously.
Dwyer's opening was in the fourth minute at 3:35 by a Kendall McFaul Assist, with David Rutherford giving the assist while Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In a charged start period, Sullivan returned home at 13:10 and the game brought Matt Marquardt to Cownie's 15:16 draw.
Dwyer made sure that the giants would take a lead and take the first break when he scored the second goal of the evening at the end of the first half.
The home side regrouped and Bouchard brought them back to the same level with a power play goal at 27:37.
The Cownie and Charles Corcoran teamed up to help the Nielsen to give Dundee the lead for the first time in the game late in the second half and made sure they won with his team their fifth in half of the last half.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, are home to Milton Keynes in their next game.
It's a good idea to make sure that people can fly in the air before an earthquake strikes.
A flight attendant in Indonesia is recognized as a hero after he died while trying to make sure that a plane with hundreds of people safely comes from the ground.
More than 800 people have died and many more are still missing after a major earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi, causing a tsunami.
There are a lot of tourists in the area, and many of them are in the city of Palu.
But while his co-workers fled to save her life, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post at the wanted checkpoint at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu airport.
He remained to make sure that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was at the moment on the runway, could safely continue.
He then jumped out of the traffic control tower as he thought he was going to collapse.
He then died in the hospital.
The spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said the decision likely saved hundreds of lives, Australian ABC News reported.
Seas prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to bring him to a large hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost these walls before the helicopter reached Palu.
"Our hearts are broken when we hear it," he said.
According to the agency, the death toll could go up to thousands, while the country's disaster relief agency says access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"It is expected that the number will continue to go up in the air because many bodies are still lying under the trunk while others cannot be reached," the agency's spokesman, Sutop Purvo Nugroho, said in a statement.
Waves that were up to 6 meters tall destroyed Palu, where a solar eclipse is held by a mass grave.
The military and the traffic wings bring help and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance brings bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
The mini-marts are all over the place."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is doing its best to help the survivors, but we don't know what we will find there.
It's already a tragedy, but it could be much worse."
The President of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete your tasks in the framework of the evacuation.
Are you ready?" reported CNN.
Indonesia was initially hit by earthquakes in Lombok this year, in which more than 550 people died.
Air Niugini says a man has disappeared after plane crash in Laguna
The airline that carried out a flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia has now reported that a man has disappeared, after it was previously said that all 47 passengers and crew were evacuated safely from the plane that was in the process of sinking.
Air Niugini said in a public statement that since Saturday afternoon, they can't get up for a male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local agency, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not respond directly to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane landed on the water as it was attempted to land at Chuuk Island airport.
The agency said it was pleased that seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline said that six passengers will remain in the hospital on Saturday, and that they are all in a stable condition.
The exact cause of the accident and the exact cause of the accident remain unclear.
The U.S. Air Force and the U.S. Navy both said the plane was landed in the lagoon, not far from the runway.
Some of the witnesses said that the plane had gone over the slope.
Bill Jaynes, a U.S. passenger, said the plane was flying deep.
"That's an extremely good thing," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said that he and others had carried it through the water, which went up to the heels, to the safety exits on the plane, which was in the process of being lowered, to water.
He said that he was panicking and that he had been suffering from a small wound to the head.
The U.S. Navy said that Siamese men who worked closely to improve a shipyard also helped with the rescue by using inflatable boats to bring people to land before the planes and about 30 meters (100 feet) deep underwater.
Data from the Air Safety Network has indicated that in the last two decades 111 people have died in accidents of PNG-registered airlines, but none of them was in connection with Air Niugini.
Analyst retraces the time span of the night and finds a woman burned alive.
The prosecution on Saturday concluded the statement of her case in a second investigation by a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. analyst Paul Rowlett of the Department of Justice has long stated that he is an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
He retraced for the jury how a mobile phone file was used for the motion of 29-year-old Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers sitting together on the night he died.
The Rowlett said that he received location data from many mobile phone operators that showed that Tellis was with Chambers on the evening of his death, contradicting his statements of one, reports The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his phone was with Chambers's at the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sandford.
Sandford issued a statement, claiming that he had not been on the roof in the city.
When investigators asked if Tellis was going to tell the truth when he said he would have been in his truck at Sandford that night, Sandford said he was going to "leave because my truck was in Nashville."
Another misunderstanding was that Tellis said he knew the Chambers had been around for about two weeks when he died.
They've only known each other for a few weeks now.
Rowlett said that after some time after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted text messages, urine and contact information from Chambers's phone.
"He's gone from his life," he said.
It is planned that the defense will begin to give its last arguments.
The judge said he expects the trial to take place later in the day before the jury.
The High Breed What is Hip Hop?
A hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling their music with a positive message.
The High Breed, of Bristol, claimed that the hip hop has gone from its origins of political messages to the solution of social problems.
They want to go back to the roots and make conscious hip hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently become popular again in the UK due to artists such as Akala and Lowkey.

A New York-based babysitter pleads guilty to a couple to a discriminatory dismissal after receiving a falsely-addressed text from her mother claiming it was "after a black man."
The group argues that they are racist, and compare the plaintiffs with "extortion"
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed horror when she found out that the new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, would be black as it arrived for its first day of work in 2016.
"It's a shame," Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Maurice, twice.
After noticing the fake pass, an "unhappy" Plasco-Flaxman fired Ms. Maurice, explaining that the baby girl had just gone, an African-American, doing poor work and that it was instead a Filipino waiting for the New York Post.
Mrs. Maurice was paid for her one work day and was sent home with an Uber.
Now Maurice promises the couple to receive compensation for the dismissal, and expects a compensation of about $350 per day for the 6-month job for which it would have lived in the house for which it was originally arranged, but without a contract.
"I want to show them, look, so you don't do anything," said a cheery post, adding "I know it's discrimination."
The couple backed off from the allegations that they were racist, saying it was the reasonable decision to break Maurice's stance, fearing they couldn't trust him after they insulted him.
"My wife sent him something he didn't want to say.
He's not a racist.
We are not racist people," said the man, Joel Plasco, to the Post.
I'm going to give your children a hand with the one who was waiting, even if it was an ingenuity?
"Your newborn baby?"
Dajee."
Plasco, while comparing the complaint to "extortion," said his wife had only had a baby two months ago and was in a "very difficult situation."
Isn't there a person who's going to run away?
This is not a good way to trade," added the investment banker.
While the trial case was still pending, the court of public opinion quickly denounced the couple on social media, and reprimanded them for their behavior and their logic.
Paddington's shifters risked that the reader could not relate to a beer talking, a new letter next.
To Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: "It's hard to get into the lag of someone who does it the first read before it is released.
It's really fun to know what we know about Paddington's success now."
It said that his father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before being inspired by a small teddy bear to write the children's book, had been shown rose if his work were not accepted, and said that the 60th birthday of the books was "beautiful."
Speaking of Paddington, who describes him as a "very important family member," it says that his father was calmly proud of his later success.
"He was a very quiet man, and he wasn't a person who broke up," he said.
"Because Paddington was so real to him, it was a bit like one could have accomplished something: he's really proud of her even though it's not his own creation.
I think he saw Paddington's success a bit in that direction.
Even though it was his creation and his imagination, he always attributed the credit to Paddington himself."
My daughter was about to die and I had to tell Eddy about the phone.
After the landing, his daughter and Louis Pasteur 2 were taken to the hospital in Nice, where the doctors tried unsuccessfully to save his life.
"The Nad has often called to say that it would look very bad, that it would not be expected that it would pack," said Ms. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got a call from Nad to tell him that he was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say obeisance to him.
And that's what I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, my love.
I'm in the same with that.
I'm going to make sense of it.
The medications given to him by doctors to keep his heart at bay have slowed and slowed down and left his system.
He had just died, and that was just the end.
I just have to sit there and wait, knowing that all of this is happening right now.
I couldn't beer or scream because I was in a situation with family and people.
I'm really going to get raped."
Eventually, Ms. Ednan-Laperouse, who is momentarily in mourning for the loss of her daughter, misses the other passenger – without knowing what she is going through – and climbs the plane.
"Don't know anything," she said.
"I've lowered my head, and the trains have been falling.
It's hard to explain, but on the flip side, I've saved an immense amount of sympathy for Nad.
He needs my love and my understanding. . . .
I knew how much he loved.
Women in mourning send cards to prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women who have lost their loved ones because of suicide have worked to stop others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have sent cards with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for support under a Welsh bridge.
Mrs. Davis' son Tyler was 13 years old when he began suffering from depression and took his own life at the age of 18.
"I don't want my parents to feel what I feel," he said.
Ms. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a promising cat with a prominent border.
"Everyone knows it because of his smile.
"They've always said that they're going to be in the same room."
But, he left his job before he died, because he was "in a darker place."
In 2014, it was Tyler's brother, who was 11 years old at the time, who found his sister's part after he took his own life.
Ms. Davis said: "I'm constantly worried that it will have consequences."
Ms. Davis made the card, "to let people know that there are people out there who can go to one and talk to one, even if it's a friend.
“Don’t worry, you have to talk.”
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been friends with Mrs. Davies for years, has lost Mark, her 15-year-old partner, not long after her mother's death.
He didn't say he felt bad or depressed or anything," he said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed that something was going to be different.
It was the end of Christmas, and when the children opened their gifts, they didn't look into their eyes or anything."
He said that his death was a great trauma for her, but that she had to be one: "It's a laughingstock through the whole family.
It's replacing ice.
We all have to fight and fight.

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in an unstable balance as the FBI begins its investigation
"I thought that if we could really get something like what one asked for - a time-limited investigation, with a limited scope - then we could perhaps reach a little unity," said Lord Flake on Saturday, adding that he was "fearing" the committee.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to get involved?
The time has come for them to complete their journey.
The midterm elections are only five weeks away, on November 6 - if, as expected, Republicans get poor results, they will be severely weakened in their attempts to get the man they want elected to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush picked up the phone and called the senators to lobby them to support his Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush and through him his wife, Ashley, met what was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI produces its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are sitting at the moment.
It's still unclear whether Mr Kavanaugh can get at least 50 Senate elections, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to pass a parity and challenge him to the Supreme Court.
North Korea's 'failure' to pay taxes under Kim
The number of survivors from North Korea to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean lawmaker.
Park Byeong-seug cited data from the union ministry in the south and said that last year there were 1,127 survivors – compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Lord Park said strict border controls between North Korea and China and large costs of human smuggling played a major role.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
The vast majority of North Korean survivors will eventually receive a South Korean state-owned property.
Seoul says that since the Korean War in 1953, more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally.
Most flee over China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily defended Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China sees the survivors as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often sends them back forcibly to their country.
The relations between North and South Korea - which technically still seem to be waging war - have improved dramatically in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to hold talks on the halting of denuclearization negotiations.
This is after the historic June meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they generally agree to work for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
On Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the U.S. for the lack of progress.
"Without confidence in the U.S., there will be no self-confidence in our national security and under these circumstances it will be impossible for us to disarm unilaterally first," Ri told the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he is not fit to serve in the Supreme Court.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called the nominee for the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said that he and his temperament were not suitable to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi gave the comments Saturday in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if a woman had ever acted like this, she would be saying 'hysterical'," Pelosi said about his reaction to Kavanaugh's statement before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh has alleged that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford as they were all emotionally challenged by the two teenage boys.
During his inaugural statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, partly skinned or swallowed while sneering at his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats on the committee and called the allegations against him a "gross and coordinated rhetorical campaign" organized by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said he believed that Kavanaugh's statements proved that he could not serve in the Supreme Court because it shows that he voted against the Democrats.
"I think he disqualified himself with these statements in his own way in the way he hated the Clintons and the Democrats," he said.
Pelosi expressed concerns as it was asked whether it would try to unsettle the Kavanaugh in the event of an oath, and whether the Democrats would win the majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'm just saying this - if he's not telling Congress or the FBI the truth, then he's not only fit to be in the Supreme Court, but to be in court where he's right," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that, as a democrat, he would be concerned about Kavanaugh's potential decisions against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, because he is seen as conservative justice.
In his disobedience, Kavanaugh asked about the possibility that he was going to die of certain Supreme Court decisions, going out of the way.
"It's not the time to take a hysterical, biased person to court and then expect us to say 'don't think that's wonderful,'" Pelosi said.
And the woman has to do it.
It's a fairy tale, months and years of rage that overwhelms, and hasn't gotten out without screaming.
"Well, we're going to have to go back," said Mrs. Smith, 45 years later.
"I don't think that's unusual, do you?"
She continues, "I got a lot of help from a woman who was a leader somewhere, where she said that she would also cry when she rose, but that she developed a technique, which means that when she rose and began to cry, she would then cry to the person.
I'm going to rose."
And then she just went on.
And I think that would be brilliant."
Screws are partly allowed as a valve for rosing because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my sharpest recollections of a former job, in a mostly male office, where I was stuck with indescribable rage, was that an elderly woman took me to Kolli – a cold manager in front of whom I was always a little scared and scared.
"Don't let them see you," he said.
"They don't know that the rose is bass.
They're going to make you feel sad, and they're going to make you feel happy."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart as a presidential candidate.
In 1987, when the Lord's Heart was caught in an extraordinary affair on a boat called Monkey Business and left the course, Ms. Schroeder, with great frustration, thought that it should no longer be considered the idea for the presidential candidate himself.
"It wasn't a good decision," he said with a laugh 30 years later.
"There were seven other candidates in the course, and the last one they needed was another.
One of them called it "The Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Because it was already late in the campaign, it was lagging behind with donation-gathering, so it swore that it would not go into the course unless it collected $2 million.
It was a battle that was lost.
He found out that some of his supporters, who gave men $1000, gave him just $250.
"How much do I have to pay for it?" he asked.
As it held its council and announced that there was no formal campaign going to start, it was so overwhelmed by feelings – gratitude for the people who went to support, frustration with the system that makes it so hard to collect money and for voters and not delegates to target the sex, and rose.
"Well, I think I'm going to have to take a break," Mrs. Schroeder recalled to the press.
"Someone would have thought that Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, 'What are you going to write on my grave?'
"Did it crash?"
How the U.S. trade war could be good for Beijing.
The first bailouts of the US-China trade war have made a difference, and even if the fight is not over for a long time, a break between the countries could be beneficial in the long run for Beijing, experts say.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, fired the first warnings earlier this year by taxing a major Chinese exporter, such as solar cells, chairs and aluminum.
The most significant escalation was this week with new tariffs hitting objects worth $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), so that in the end half of the nets coming from China and the US were taxed.
Beijing has backed down every time, and recently put tariffs at five to ten percent on US grids worth $60 billion.
China has vowed that it will join the U.S. squad, and the world's second-largest economy will not push back so quickly.
If they wanted Washington to stop doing so, they would have to respond to demands, but to make themselves publicly small before the United States would be too big a blame for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
But, experts say, if Beijing makes the right decisions, it could positively support U.S. pressure in China's trade war in the long term as it will make the intertwining of the two economies smaller.
"The fact that a swift political decision either in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions that could trigger an economic turmoil in the two countries is ultimately much more dangerous than the spectators have acknowledged so far," said Abigail A. Tancenter, a spokeswoman for Center of American Grace.
Syria is 'prepared' for refugees returning, says Foreign Minister
Syria says it would be ready for the refugees who want to return and asks for help to rebuild the country that was destroyed by a more than seven-year war.
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the situation in the country is improving.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and safe thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to build up the areas that were destroyed by terrorists again to restore normality.
All the conditions have now been met so that those refugees who want to return to the country and who are forced to flee due to terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that have affected their daily lives and their living situation can return.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
There are still 6 million people living in the country who need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian government would be happy to help rebuild the destroyed country.
But he stressed that they would not accept any conditional help or help from countries that sponsored the uprising.
Europe to win the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europa won the 2018 Ryder Cup as they defeated Team USA with a score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The U.S. has now lost six times in Europe and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe took back the crown as the Danish captain's team scored the 14.5 points needed to defeat the United States.
U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who has the majority of the tournament's problems, shot his tea shot in the water at par-3 from 16th laugh, and then lost his match against Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari was excellent in all his rounds, and is going to be 1 of the 4 players who each had a 5-0-0 since the tournament in 1979 took the hot form.
American Jordan Spieth was eliminated with 5&4 by the worst player on the rankings of the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
The world's best-placed player, Dustin Johnson, has fallen 2-1 against England's Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
Spain's Sergio Garcia, a veteran of eight Ryder Cups, has become the European with the most victories of all time with 25.5 as a career point.
"I don't usually cry today, I can't do anything else.
It was a tough year.
I'm so grateful to Thomas for taking me along and believing in me.
I'm so happy to have the cup again.
It's about the team, and I'm glad I could help," Garcia said emotionally after the European victory.
He will be the face of his country schoolmate, John Ram, who defeated US Legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in the singles game a Sunday.
"The tremendous pride I feel in defeating Tiger Woods, I watched him as I grew up," said the 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his games to France and now has a career record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
A comedic statistic for one of the best players of all time, who won 14 major titles as second after Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team has been struggling to find fairways all weekend, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played the entire tournament over golf at a high level.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk said after the disappointing performance for his squad, "I'm proud of the boys they fought.
There was a time when we were celebrating Europe.
More of them fought.
Chapel for Thomas.
He's a very good captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We will be regrouping, I will talk to the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee and we will continue.
I love the 12 boys and I'm proud to be their captain.
It's got to be one of his mugs.
We were overwhelmed."
