Members of the National Assembly for Wales fear confusion with the Muppets
Some members of the National Assembly are shocked by the proposal to change their title to "MWP" (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The reason for this is plans to change the name of the National Assembly to “Welsh Parliament”.
Members of the National Assembly of all political directions fear becoming the target of the mockery.
A member of the Labour Party’s National Assembly said his group was concerned because the name “rhymes with ‘Twp’ and ‘Pwp’.”
For non-Welsh readers: In Welsh, "twp" stands for "doof" and "pwp" stands for "aa".
Plaid Cymru, a member of the National Assembly, said the entire group was "not happy" and had proposed alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said his group was open to the name change, but pointed to the great similarity between "MWP" and "Muppet".
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced similarly to the letter u in English spoken in Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting a name change law, said: “The final decision on the names of the members of the National Assembly is, of course, up to the members themselves.”
The Government of Wales Act of 2017 authorized the Welsh National Assembly to change its name.
In June, the panel published the results of a public hearing on the proposals, which resulted in broad support for the name ‘Welsh Parliament’ for the National Assembly.
With regard to the titles of members of the National Assembly, the Welsh Parliament Members or WMPs preferred, while the MWP option was the most supported at a public hearing.
The National Assembly members seem to be proposing alternative options, but calling for a consensus for President Elin Jones to come forward with a bill within weeks could be a problem.
The reform law will include further changes to the way the National Assembly works, including rules for disqualifying members of the National Assembly and for shaping the committee system.
Members of the National Assembly may vote definitively on their names during their debate on the law.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on changing the country's name
Voters will decide on Sunday whether to change their country’s name to “Republic of North Macedonia”.
The referendum was set up to settle a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has a province with the similar name Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor means that this claim rises to Greek territory, and has repeatedly opposed its admission to the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the referendum on the name change, said he would not recognize the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is the price to be paid for joining the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's remain silent in the face of the difficulties of the churches in Harlem
“The old people I spoke to said in the past there was a bar and a church in every corner,” Adams said.
“Today, there are no more of them.”
He said the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
“People’s social lives today look different,” he said.
“Bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighborhood where people regularly meet.”
For the churches, he fears that the money from the sale of assets will not last as long as the church leaders assume, and that “sooner or later they will be at the beginning again.”
Churches, he added, could be replaced by condominiums with condominiums where people who don’t support the remaining shelters live.
“The overwhelming majority of people who buy condominiums in these buildings will be white,” he said, “and thus accelerate the complete closure of these churches, as it is unlikely that most of the people who move into these condominiums will become members of these churches.”
Both churches were built by white communities before Harlem became a black metropolis: Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist community moved out in the 1930s.
A black community that held their services nearby became the owner of the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black community under Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, a major shopping street in Harlem that refused to hire or support blacks.
In a fire in 1939, the building was severely damaged, but when Father Johnson's community members planned to rebuild it, they commissioned the bell toll.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin's, proudly described the bell tone as "the bells of the poor".
The expert who sounded the bell in July used other words: “a cultural treasure” and “an irreplaceable historical instrument”.
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the world’s first bell to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who switched to the larger bell at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said he wasn't replaced by St. Martin's.
What has taken place in recent months in St. Martin's is a complicated story with architects and contractors drawn in part by the lay leaders of the church and in part by the diocese of the bishops.
In July, the parish board – the board of lay leaders of the parish – expressed written concerns to the diocese that the diocese would try to pass on the costs to the parish board, even though the diocese was not involved in the commissioning of the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some church members complained of a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
California's 13-Year-Old Shark Injured by Lobster Scuba Diving
In California, on Saturday, the first day of the lobster season, according to official statements, a shark attacked a 13-year-old boy while diving for lobster.
The attack took place just before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
As Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego, he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy’s cry for help and paddled with several others to the boy to help pull him out of the water.
Hammel said he first thought the boy was happy to have caught a lobster, but then he realized that the boy was yelling, “I was bitten!
I have been bitten!"
When Hammel arrived at the boy, he noticed that his entire jawbone had been torn open.
“I shouted that everyone should come out of the water: ‘There’s a shark in the water!’” added Hammel.
The boy was flown to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and is in critical condition.
The nature of the shark responsible for the attack was not known.
Rescue swimmer Captain Larry Giles told the media that a shark had been seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was concluded that it was not a dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the upper body.
Officials blocked access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Encinitas for 48 hours for investigative and security reasons.
According to Giles, there are over 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to advance the UK cosmetics market
Sainsbury's is attacking boats, superdrugs and Debenhams with department store cosmetics staffed with specialist assistants.
As part of a large-scale push to the <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion UK cosmetics market, which continues to grow as fashion and household merchandise sales decline, the larger cosmetics departments in eleven stores nationwide will be tested, and if more prove successful, they will roll out next year.
The investment in cosmetics coincides with the search of supermarkets for ways to use store space previously used for televisions, microwaves and household goods elsewhere.
According to Sainsbury’s, the volume of its cosmetics offering is doubling for the first time to up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Also existing series of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will get more space and brand areas similar to those in stores such as boots.
In addition, the supermarket is relaunching its “Boutique” makeup series, making most of the products vegan-friendly – an aspect that is increasingly demanded by younger customers.
In addition, the fragrance store Fragrance Shop will be tested in two Sainsbury's branch outlets. The first outlet opened last week in Croydon, South London, and a second will open later this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
Online shopping and the transition to buying small amounts of food daily in local grocery stores mean that supermarkets need to do more to get customers to visit them.
According to Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, the outlets will increasingly look like department stores as the supermarket chain tries to fight off discounters Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food items.
Since purchasing the Argos and Habitat chains two years ago, Sainsbury's has set up hundreds of Argos outlets and a number of Habitat outlets in hundreds of branches, increasing food sales and the profitability of the acquisitions.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to reorganize its cosmetics and pharmacy departments failed.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with boats in the early 2000s, but ended after a dispute over the distribution of revenue from the drug dealer's stores in the supermarkets.
The new strategy follows Sainsbury’s sale of its 281-store pharmacy business to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
The company said Lloyds will play a role in the plan by adding an expanded range of luxury skin care brands in four stores, such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director at Sainsbury’s, said: “We have redesigned the appearance of our cosmetics departments to create a more attractive environment for our customers.
In addition, we have invested in specially trained colleagues who are available as consultants.
Our brand range is tailored to all needs. Due to the attractive environment and the favorable locations, we are now an attractive destination for cosmetics purchases, questioning the way we have shopped so far."
Peter Jones 'angry' after Holly Willoughby's withdrawal from a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million store
"Dragons' Den" star Peter Jones is "angry" after TV host Holly Willoughby withdrew from a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with his lifestyle brand company to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time for the joint homewear and accessories brand Truly.
The business of the two was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The “This Morning” moderator, 37, announced her retirement on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby angered “Dragons’ Den” star Peter Jones with her extremely short-term withdrawal from her lucrative lifestyle brand company to focus on her own new affiliation contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Jones is said to have been "angry" when the TV's "Golden Girl" admitted at a tense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, due to their new businesses - worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million - the common homewear and accessory brand can no longer afford.
The company was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand and would likely have doubled Willoughby’s estimated assets of <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
While Willoughby, 37, announced her retirement from Truly on Instagram, Jones left Britain on her way to one of his holiday homes.
A source said: “Truly had the highest priority for Holly by far.
It should secure their future for them in the long term over the next decades.
Their decision to withdraw came as a complete surprise to all involved.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, so shortly before the launch.
At the headquarters in Marlow, a warehouse full of goods is waiting to be sold."
Experts believe the withdrawal of the “This Morning” host, one of Britain’s most promising stars, could cost the company millions due to high investments in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and homewear and potential further delays in launching.
It could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly in 2016 with Capp, and Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.
The couples spend the holiday together, and Jones holds a 40 percent stake in Baldwin’s TV production company.
Willoughby is set to become a brand ambassador for M&S, replacing Ant McPartlin as host of ITV’s “I’m A Celebrity.”
A source close to Jones said last night: “We are not commenting on his business matters.”
Hard words “and then we fell in love”
He joked about the criticism he expected from the news media for a comment that some would consider “non-presidential” and for such positive statements about North Korea’s leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said imitating the voice of a news moderator:
“I didn’t give up anything.”
He noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting as the first meeting in Singapore in June was praised by Trump as a major step towards denuclearization of North Korea.
However, the denuclearisation negotiations have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, Ri Yong Ho, North Korea’s top diplomat, told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that the North saw no “correspondent response” from the United States to North Korea’s first disarmament measures.
Instead, he noted, the U.S. adhered to sanctions that should maintain the pressure.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech.
“We are very successful with North Korea,” he said.
“We were facing a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have this great relationship.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim showed positive results: an end to the missile tests, support for the release of hostages and the repatriation of the mortal remains of American military personnel.
In addition, he defended his unusual way of talking about the relationship with Kim.
“It’s so easy to be presidential, but instead of 10,000 people standing outside trying to get into this crowded arena, about 200 people would be standing here,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd right in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake devastate an island in Indonesia, costing hundreds of lives
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs were told they would not be needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the population was displaced by Lombok, no national emergency has been declared, a prerequisite for the mobilization of international aid.
“Unfortunately, in many cases, they have made it very clear that they are not asking for international support, so that’s a bit difficult,” Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is putting together a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet clear whether foreign employees can work on site.
Sutopo, a spokesman for the disaster protection authority, said Indonesian officials assessed the situation in Palu following whether international bodies were allowed to participate in the relief efforts.
In the face of the earthquakes Indonesia is constantly struggling with, the country is still unfortunately poorly prepared for natural forces.
While tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are not a common sight on other coastal strips.
The apparently missing tsunami warning siren in Palu has probably contributed to the deaths.
Travelling between Indonesia’s many islands is a challenge at best.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but will reach the site of the new disaster in no earlier than three days.
President Joko Widodo has made the improvement of Indonesia’s undermined infrastructure the core of his election campaign, spending ample money on roads and railways.
However, the government of Joko, who is seeking re-election next year, suffers from funding deficits.
In addition, Joko is under pressure from ongoing religious tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority practice a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands displaced from their homes and apartments as gangs of Christians and Muslims fought in the streets with machetes, arrows and bows, as well as other primitive weapons.
View: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge scores deep draw against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool on Saturday at London's Stamford Bridge Stadium with a hit in the 89th minute ahead of a Premier League loss to Chelsea.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri at his team's 0–1 back at approximately 27 metres from Chelsea's goal.
He pointed the ball to the left and then shot it in the direction of the rear post.
The shot sailed high above the penalty area and drifted into the upper right corner of the net.
Finally, the ball fell over the bouncing Kepa Arrizabalaga and then into the net.
“I was just trying to get myself into this position and get to the ball. Players like Shaq are always playing as much forward as possible, so I just tried to make as much time as possible for myself,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante coming and had a contact with the ball. I didn’t think too much about it and just accepted the shot.”
Chelsea led in the 25th minute by Belgian star Eden Hazard at halftime with 1:0.
The blues striker gave a pass with the heel back to Mateo, then turned off near the midfield and sprinted into the Liverpool half.
Kovacic played a quick double pass in the midfield.
He then shot a good steep pass, so Hazard got into the penalty area.
Hazard left the defenders behind and left a shot at Liverpool's Alisson Becker past the back of the net.
Liverpool will play in the group stage of the Champions League on Wednesday at 15:00 at Stadio San Paolo in Naples.
Chelsea will face UEFA Europa League Videoton in London on Thursday at 3:00 p.m.
Tsunami death toll in Indonesia rises to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the Disaster Protection Authority said on Sunday morning.
Many people are said to have been trapped in the debris of buildings that were destroyed by Friday's 7.5 magnitude earthquake, which had triggered waves of up to six meters in height, government spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, was filled with the debris of collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after woman stabbed
After a woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside, a murder investigation was launched.
The 44-year-old was found stabbed at 7:55 a.m. in Grayson Mews on John Street and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police are urging residents to report if they have seen or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O’Hagan said: “The investigation is at an early stage, but I would ask anyone who has stayed near John Street in Birkenhead and seen or heard something suspicious to contact us.
In addition, I would like to ask all persons, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded something with a dashcam, to contact us and may have information that is of the utmost importance for our investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found lived in Birkenhead and was found in a building.
This afternoon, friends who believe to know the woman arrived at the scene to inquire where she was found this morning.
Investigations are underway, and the police said they are in the process of informing the next family members of the victim.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews was just trying to get into his apartment, but was informed by police that no one was allowed to enter or leave the building.
He was speechless when he found out what had happened.
Residents are now informed that it will take hours for them to re-enter the building.
It was heard as a police officer told a man that the entire area is now being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared in tears at the scene of the incident.
She repeats again and again, “That’s so terrible.”
At 2:00 p.m., two police vehicles were inside the lockdown and another vehicle was in front of the lockdown.
Within the lockdown were several police officers who were monitoring the residential block.
Persons who have information are asked to send a direct message to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or anonymously contact Crimestoppers at 0800 555 111 and refer to Log entry 247 of September 30.
The Cromwell Statue in front of Parliament becomes the latest monument to be the subject of controversy over rewriting history
Their banishment would be poetic justice for his Taliban-like destruction of so many of England’s cultural and religious artifacts by his fanatical Puritan supporters.
The Cromwell Society, however, described Crick's proposal as "crazy" and "an attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: “It was inevitable in the current debate over the removal of statues that Oliver Cromwell’s statue in front of the Palace of Westminster became the target.
The picture storm in the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the deeds of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft’s magnificent portrayal of Cromwell is proof of the 19th-century opinion and part of the history of a figure that many believe is still worth celebrating.
Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is being viewed by many, perhaps at the end of the 19th century, more than today, when someone defended Parliament against pressure from outside, in his case of course by the monarchy.
Whether this is a completely correct representation is the subject of continued historical debates.
Certainly, the conflict shaped the subsequent development of our nation in the middle of the 17th century, and Cromwell is a single recognizable figure who represents one side of this divide.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worth celebrating and remembering."
Killer pig bites Chinese farmers dead
According to local media reports, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest China.
The man, to whom only the surname "Yuan" was given, was found dead with a blood-stained artery near a pig stall in the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to inject pigs with vaccines on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He reportedly arrived Wednesday with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead and saw that a door to an adjacent pig stable was open.
He said there was a large male pig in the stable with blood on its snout.
According to the report, a forensic investigation confirmed that the 250-kilogram pig had killed the farmers.
“My cousin’s legs were bloody and mutilated,” the cousin, who was given the surname “Wu,” was quoted as saying by Guiyang Evening News.
Footage of a security camera showed Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told the Evening News that the pig had been locked up to prevent attacks on more people while police were gathering evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and market authorities are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
While it is rare for pigs to attack humans, such cases are known.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, where the man suffered serious injuries.
Ten years ago, a 290-kilogram pig clamped a Welsh farmer between itself and a tractor until the farmer’s wife was able to shake the animal.
After a farmer was eaten by his pigs in Oregon in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a “trigger.”
“They are just playful.
They like to twitch and are very curious, ... they are not ready to hurt anyone.
You just have to treat them with the right amount of respect,” he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa bring widespread heavy rainfall to the southwestern United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa is weakening along the way across the colder waters on the north coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring flood-causing rainfall in northern Mexico and the southwestern United States in the coming days.
On Sunday at 5:00 a.m. East Coast Time, Rosa had wind speeds of 136 km/h, equivalent to a Category 1 hurricane, and was located 620 kilometers southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
In the meantime, a trough is beginning to form over the Pacific, moving towards the east to the west coast of the United States. When Rosa reaches the Baja California Peninsula as a tropical storm on Monday, high tropical humidity is transported north to the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will cause up to 25 inches of precipitation in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then the tropical moisture in the coming days, due to interactions with the advancing trough, generates widespread heavy rainfall in the southwest.
Locally, 2.5 to 10 centimeters of rainfall can cause dangerous flood-like flooding, drifting debris in the water, and possibly landslides in the desert.
High tropical humidity occasionally leads to precipitation rates of nearly 5 to 7.5 centimeters per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In the southwest, especially in a large part of Arizona, precipitation of up to 5 to 10 centimeters is expected.
Due to the dispersion of tropical rainfall, there is the possibility of flooding with rapidly deteriorating conditions.
Given the imminent tropical rainfall, it is strongly advised not to walk into the desert.
Heavy rainfall can cause streams to burst from the canyons, and thunderstorms bring local wind gusts as well as winds that carry dust.
The nearby trough brings locally heavy rainfall to parts of the coast of Southern California.
Total precipitations of more than one centimeter are possible, which can lead to small amounts of debris driving in the water and to smooth roads.
This would be the first rainfall in the region.
The first isolated tropical rain showers reach Arizona on Sunday evenings and Monday mornings, with widespread rainfall on Monday evenings and Tuesdays.
On Tuesday it will be rainy throughout the four-corners region.
In October, strong temperature fluctuations are possible throughout the U.S. as the Arctic cools down while the tropics remain relatively warm.
This sometimes leads to drastic temperature differences over short distances.
On Sunday, there is a good example of drastic temperature differences in the center of the United States.
Between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, as well as between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, there is a temperature difference of almost 12 oC.
In the next few days, the persistent summer heat is trying to evolve and expand again.
For much of the middle and east of the United States, a warm beginning of October with widespread temperatures of 27 oC is expected from the Southern Plains to parts of the northeast.
New York City could reach 27 oC on Tuesday, which is about 6 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates a high likelihood of above-average temperatures in the first half of October in the eastern United States.
More than 20 million viewers have seen the hearing of Brett Kavanaugh
More than 20 million viewers watched the captivating statements of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman, Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual assault in the 1980s.
In the meantime, the political stalemate stopped, and on Friday the television stations interrupted their regular program because of a last-minute turn: an agreement negotiated by Jeff Flake, a senator from Arizona, according to which the FBI is to conduct a one-week investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee to be 100% sure that Kavanaugh had been drunk at a high school party, harassed her, and tried to remove her clothes.
Kavanaugh said in a passionate statement that he was 100% sure that this did not happen.
It is likely that more than the 20.4 million viewers reported by Nielsen have seen the hearing.
The company found average viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
For other networks such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, which broadcast the hearing, the figures were not immediately available.
In addition, Nielsen usually has trouble measuring spectator numbers in offices.
To put this in the right perspective: This corresponds to the number of spectators at a play-off football game or at the Oscars.
The Fox News Channel, whose opinion-oriented moderators strongly support Kavanaugh’s nomination, recorded the highest numbers of all networks, according to Nielsen, with an average of 5.69 million viewers in the full-day hearing.
ABC came in second with 3.26 million viewers.
According to Nielsen, CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million.
The interest remained strong after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in Friday’s drama.
After the office of the moderate Republican issued a statement saying he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was filmed on Friday morning by cameras of CNN and CBS as protesters loudly pressed him in the elevator on the way to a hearing of the Justice Committee.
The scene was broadcast live on CNN, where he watched for minutes while he was being insulted.
“I’m right here in front of you,” said one woman.
“Do you think he’s telling the truth?”
“They have power, while so many women are powerless,” one woman said.
Flake said his office had issued a statement and added before the elevator closed that he would have more to say at the hearing before the committee.
All cable and broadcasting networks broadcast live hours later, when the Justice Committee was due to vote on the redirection of Kavanaugh’s nomination to the entire Senate.
Flake, however, said he would only do so on the condition that the FBI investigate the allegations against the candidate next week as required by the democratic minority.
Flake is partly convinced by conversations with a friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After an interview with Coons and then various senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake's decision was of great importance as it was obvious that the Republicans would not have enough votes to confirm Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has initiated an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May Accuses Critics of Using Brexit for Political Purposes
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union, exploiting Britain’s future for political purposes and undermining the nation’s interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May will attend the Conservative Party Congress in Birmingham on September 29, 2018.
In an interview alongside her on the front page of the newspaper, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson exacerbated his attack on her so-called “Chequers plan” for Brexit by calling a proposal that envisages the reciprocal levy of tariffs by the UK and the EU “totally absurd.”
Wayde Sims: Police Arrest Suspect Dyteon Simpson in Relation to LSU Player's Death
Police have arrested a suspect in connection with the deadly shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at Louisiana State University (LSU).
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and imprisoned for murder, according to Baton Rouge police.
The agency released video footage of the Sims and Simpsons clash, and police said Sims lost their glasses during the fight.
According to CBS partner WAFB, police secured the glasses at the scene and said that Simpson’s DNA was found on the glasses.
Following an interview with Simpsons, police said he had confessed to the deadly shootings on Wayde.
The lawyer reports that the bail has been set at $350,000.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office released a preliminary report Friday that said the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the neck.
The police thank the Louisiana State Police Fugitive Task Force, the forensic laboratory of the federal police, the Southern University Police and the citizens in the area for their support in the investigation leading to the arrest.
LSU Sports Director Joe Alleva thanked the regional enforcement agency for “the care and pursuit of justice”.
Sims was 20 years old.
He grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne played for the LSU basketball team.
Last season, he averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "deeply shaken" by Wayde's death and was "shocked".
“You’re always afraid of something like that,” Wade said.
Volcano spits ash on Mexico City.
Ash ejected from the volcano Popocatepetl has reached the southern quarters of the Mexican capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity in the crater had increased and 183 outbursts of gas and ash were recorded within 24 hours.
The Authority monitored numerous cases of groans and tremors.
Pictures on social media showed thin ash layers on the windshields of cars in neighborhoods of Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have found that since a 7.1-magnitude earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017, activity has increased at the volcano 72 kilometers southeast of the capital.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Clashes between police and Catalan separatists on the anniversary of the independence vote
In Barcelona, six people were arrested on Saturday after clashes between the police and pro-independence protesters, with thousands taking part in other demonstrations to commemorate the first anniversary of the polarizing independence referendum in Catalonia.
A group of masked pro-separatists, held back by the standby police, threw eggs and also spilled colored powder, creating dark dust clouds in the streets normally populated by tourists.
Over the course of the next day, there were also handcuffs with the police, who used their batons to curb the fighting.
For several hours, pro-independence groups chanted "No Forget, No Forgiveness" as Unionists shouted "Long live Spain."
As the local press reported, fourteen people were treated for minor injuries sustained during the protests.
A year after the October 1 referendum, which was considered illegal by Madrid but celebrated by separatist Catalans, the situation in the independent region remains very tense.
Voters had overwhelmingly opted for independence, although voter turnout was low, as the secessionists largely boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year when police tried to prevent the vote in violent clashes in front of the polling stations.
Pro-independence groups had camped outdoors overnight on Friday to prevent a demonstration for the national police.
The demonstration took place, but was forced to take a different path.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who participated with his wife in the protest of the separatists, said he saw the prospects that Catalonia would gain independence, no longer with hope.
“Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying for joy because they could choose, but now we’re stuck,” he said.
Despite an important, albeit scarce, victory in the regional elections last December, the Catalan pro-independence parties this year had difficulty maintaining the momentum. Many of their best-known leaders are either in self-imposed exile or in detention, where they were hanging on to their procedures due to their role in the regeneration of the organization.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in favor of the police on his phone, said the conflict had been fueled by politicians on both sides.
“The situation is getting more and more tense,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been in probation since the end of last year, announced his candidacy for the European Parliament elections next year.
"To run as a candidate for the European elections is the best way to denounce the undermining of democratic values and the oppression by the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men Arrested After House Was Crashed by Car
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after a house in Londonderry had been repeatedly blocked by a car.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 7:30 p.m.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the gates and the building itself were damaged.
In addition, he may have been shot in the car with an armrest.
Menga hits mean 1-0 win over Rangers for Livingston
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured the victory.
The rising Livingston FC surprised the Rangers and led to the first second defeat for Steven Gerrard in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's hit proved crucial for Gary Holt's team to match Hibernian in the second half.
Gerrard's team remains in the Premiership this season without an outside win and faces the Hearts next Sunday, who are eight points behind.
Previously, the Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday in the Europa League.
In the meantime, Livingston can increase his division win series to six games, meaning head coach Holt hasn’t lost since his takeover from Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses chances against open-minded guests
Holt’s team should have been in the lead long before the hit, as his directness put the Rangers before a variety of problems.
Scott Robinson broke through, but slowed down in front of the goal, so Alan Lithgow could only shoot far after sliding in to hit Craig Halkett's head shot past the goal.
The hosts were content to let the Rangers play in front of them because they knew they could hinder the guests in standard situations.
This is how the decisive gate came into being.
The Rangers allowed a free kick, and Livingston prepared a chance, in which Declan Gallagher and Robinson put Menga in a shot position together, who shot the goal with a ball contact from the middle of the penalty area.
At this stage, the Rangers had dominated the possession of the ball, but were unable to overcome the defense of the hosts, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly remained largely unaffected.
This pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos once forced Kelly to defend.
Scott Pittman was defeated by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgow swept the ball from another standard situation of Livingston.
Flanks repeatedly reached Livingston’s penalty area and were regularly taken out of the danger zone, while two required penalty kicks – one by Halkett against Glenn Middleton and one by hand play – were denied.
"Phenomenal" by Livingston – Analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and a strong result for Livingston.
They were exceptionally outstanding and exceeded expectations again in this upward trend.
Their way of playing and their team has barely changed since their return to the top teams, but Holt deserves great praise for the way he has shaken the team up since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was great and led an excellently organized defense while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on track throughout the game.
The Rangers were lacking in inspiration.
As good as they were under Gerrard for a time, they could not achieve this standard.
Their last ball was insufficient – only once they were able to penetrate the hosts’ squad – and that’s kind of a wake-up call for the Rangers in the middle of the table.
Receiving Erdogan with mixed reactions in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29th), smiling faces and blue skies prevailed when the heads of government of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which was to serve to repair relations between NATO allies.
There had been disputes over issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey’s accession to the EU.
Afterwards, Erdogan traveled to Cologne to open a large new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
The police cited security reasons for preventing a crowd of 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters found themselves nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, many of them Kurds, were also heard, condemning Erdogan’s policies as well as the German government’s decision to welcome him into the country.
The opposing protests reflect the polarizing effect of the visitor, who is praised by some German Turks as a hero and insulted by others as an autocrat.
Traffic accident in Deptford: cyclist dies in collision with car
A cyclist died in a car crash in London.
The clash occurred around 10:15 a.m. British summer time near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford in the city's southeast.
The driver of the car stopped, and the paramedics took care of the man, but he died at the scene of the accident.
Months before the accident, another cyclist was killed in an accident with a driver fleeing in Childers Street, about 1.6 kilometers from the accident on Saturday.
According to the Metropolitan Police, officials were working to identify the man and notify his next family members.
Roadblocks and reroutes for buses have been set up, and motorists have been advised to avoid the area.
Long-Lartin Prison: Six Officials Injured in Riots
According to the Prison Office, six prison officers were injured during riots in a high-security prison for men.
The riots erupted on Sunday at about 9:30 a.m. British summer time at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire and are still ongoing.
Specialized "Tornado" officials have been deployed to end the unrest involving eight inmates and limited to one wing.
The officers were treated on the spot for minor facial injuries.
A spokesman for the Prison Service said: “Specially trained prison personnel have been deployed to resolve an ongoing incident in HMP Long Lartin.
Six employees were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and want to make it clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and possibly spend longer behind bars."
HMP Long Lartin has more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison manager was treated after an attack by a prisoner in the hospital.
In October last year, emergency officers were summoned to the prison to address serious unrest in which personnel were attacked with pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with flood-like flooding (dry areas may benefit)
It rarely happens that a tropical depression reaches Arizona, but that’s exactly what is likely to happen early next week when the remnants of Hurricane Rosa pull over the desert-shaped southwest and bring the risk of flood-like flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued flood-like warnings Monday and Tuesday from western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada as well as southeastern California and Utah including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to approach with rain on Monday evening and move directly over Phoenix on Tuesday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix reported in a tweet that “since 1950, only ten tropical cyclones as a tropical storm or tropical depression have approached Phoenix up to 320 kilometers!
Katrina (1967) was located as a hurricane within 64 kilometers of the Arizona border.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 centimeters of rainfall with occasional up to 15 centimeters in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
In other areas of the desert-shaped southwest, including the central Rockies and the Great Basin, 2.5 to 5 centimeters are likely and singles are possible in total up to 10 centimeters.
For those who are not at risk of flooding, the rainfall associated with Rosa can be a blessing due to the drought in the region.
Although flooding is a major concern, this rain is likely to be useful in part, as drought is currently prevailing in the southwest.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, a little more than 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least extreme drought, the second highest category," weather.com reported.
First, the path of the hurricane means that Rosa will hit land on the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
On Sunday morning, Rosa will still have hurricane strength with maximum winds of 136 kilometers per hour and is located 620 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, after which the hurricane will move north at 19 kilometers per hour.
In the Pacific, the storm will hit colder water and weaken as a result.
Therefore, Rosa is expected to hit land on Monday afternoon or evening in Mexico with the strength of a tropical storm.
The rainfall can be severe in parts of Mexico, so there is a significant risk of flooding.
“From Baja California to the northwest of the Sonora Desert, precipitation is expected to be 7.5 to 15 centimeters, with up to 25 centimeters possible,” weather.com reported.
Rosa will then move northwards over Mexico as a tropical storm, reach the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, and then up south of Utah until late Tuesday evening through Arizona.
"The main threat associated with Rosa or her remains is expected to be very heavy rainfall in Baja California, the northwestern Sonora Desert and the desert-shaped southwestern United States," the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
As a result of these precipitations, life-threatening floods and debris in the desert, as well as landslides in mountainous areas, are expected.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Arrests for Attempted Murder
After finding a 16-year-old man with stab wounds in Somerset, three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder.
The teenager was found injured on Saturday at around 4:00 a.m. British time in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton.
He was taken to a hospital and his condition is “stable”.
According to Avon and Somerset police, a 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area.
Officials asked anyone with records of the events on a mobile phone to report.
Trump said Kavanaugh had suffered “under the commonality, the rage” of the Democrats.
“A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the unscrupulous and unheard-of tactics of the Democrats,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had suffered “under the commonwealth, the rage” of the Democrats throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh said in front of Congress on Thursday, dismissing the allegation made by Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually harassed her decades ago when both were teenagers.
Ford also spoke at the hearing about her allegations.
The president said on Saturday that the American people saw the brilliance, quality and courage of Kavanaugh on that day.
“A vote for the confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote for the confirmation of one of the most experienced legal minds of our time, a lawyer with an excellent record in the service of the general public,” he told the crowd of his supporters in West Virginia.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's nomination when he talked about the importance of Republican voter participation in the midterm elections.
“Five weeks before one of the most important choices of our lives.
I’m not joining, but in reality I’m joining,” he said.
“That’s why I’m fighting for great candidates everywhere.”
Trump argued that the Democrats saw their mission as “resisting and blocking.”
The first major procedural vote on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place in the Senate by Friday at the latest, a senior GOP leader told CNN.
Hundreds killed in earthquakes in Indonesia, death toll rises
Authorities said at least 384 people were killed on Saturday, many of them fleeing when huge waves hit the beaches due to a strong earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Hundreds of people gathered on Friday at a party on the beach of the city of Palu when, at nightfall, waves of up to six meters high struck the beach, tearing many people to death and destroying everything that stood in their way.
The tsunami was preceded by an earthquake of magnitude 7.5.
“When the tsunami threat surfaced yesterday, people were still following their activities on the beach and didn’t immediately run away, and they fell victim to it,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the Indonesian BNPB disaster protection authority, told a conference in Jakarta.
“The tsunami didn’t come alone, it swam cars, tree trunks and houses, it hit everything on land,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had pulled over the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
Some people had climbed trees while fleeing the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated and housed in 24 centers in Palu.
Air images released by the Disaster Protection Authority showed numerous destroyed buildings and shops, bent and collapsed bridges, as well as a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the coastal city was shaken by further aftershocks.
The earthquake was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian authority BPPT (Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology) said in a statement that the energy released in Friday’s massive quake was equivalent to 200 times the energy of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
Due to the location of the city at the end of a long, narrow bay, the tsunami could have become larger, the authority said.
Nugroho described the damage as “extensive” and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
According to him, the bodies of some of the victims were found under the debris of collapsed buildings. 540 people were injured, and 29 are missing.
Nugroho said the number of casualties and the damage could have been higher along the coast 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the quake.
Communication with Donggala was completely paralyzed, according to Nugroho, and there was no information.
According to a statement by the Red Cross, more than 300,000 people live there, and its staff and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse," the statement said.
On Saturday, the authority was repeatedly criticized for not informing that a tsunami had hit Palu, although the waves arrived at the time of the warning, according to official information.
Amateur footage posted on social media shows a man on the top floor of a building desperately warning people on the street beneath him of the imminent tsunami.
Within minutes, force a water wall onto the shore and float buildings and cars from it.
Reuters could not immediately verify the authenticity of the footage.
The quake and tsunami resulted in a massive power outage that disrupted communication around Palu and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
According to authorities, the military has started sending cargo planes with support from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuated still urgently need food and other vital goods.
The city’s airport remains closed until October and was reopened only for relief.
A visit by President Joko Widodo to evacuation centers in Palu was planned for Sunday.
The number of tsunami victims has risen to more than 800.
The location is very bad.
World Vision employees from Donggala have safely reached the city of Palu, where the employees are housed in tent accommodations in the courtyard of their office, but, according to Doseba, they passed scenes of devastation along the way.
“They said they had seen numerous destroyed houses,” he said.
The location is very bad.
Even as the relief groups began the difficult task of launching disaster relief, some warned that expert foreign aid workers would be prevented from traveling to Palu.
Under Indonesian law, financial assistance, supplies and personnel from abroad are only possible if the site of an accident has been declared a national disaster area.
This has not happened until now.
“At the moment it is still a disaster at the provincial level,” said Aulia Arriani, spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As soon as the government says, ‘Okay, this is a national disaster,’ we can accept international support, but so far this status does not apply.”
As the second night since Friday’s earthquake and tsunami descended over Palu, friends and family members of those still missing hoped for one of the wonders that lightened up the sad stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled out of a sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman who had been trapped under rubble beside her mother’s body for two days.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian paragliding national team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others of the prisoners at the Roa-Roa hotel were, as Mandagi added, his students.
“As a senior in paragliding, I have my own emotional burden to bear,” he said.
Gendon recounted how in the hours after the news of the crash of the Roa Roa Hotel among the paragliders, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the contestants from Palu who attended the beach party.
However, instead of blue ticks, his messages only led to grey question marks.
“I think that means the news hasn’t been delivered,” he said.
Thieves Steal $26,750 While Filling ATM in Newport on the Levee
According to a press release from Newport police on Friday morning in Newport on the Levee thieves stole an employee of Brink’s while replenishing an ATM $26,750.
The driver of the vehicle had emptied an ATM in the entertainment complex and wanted to check out more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the press release.
While he was busy, “a man ran behind the employee of Brink’s” and stole a bag full of money intended for the vending machine.
According to the press release, witnesses saw several suspects flee the scene, but police did not specify how many people were involved in the incident.
Individuals who have information about the identity of the suspects are requested to contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West Changes His Name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
In announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: “The being formally known as Kanye West.”
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for some time and has used it as the title of his eighth album released in June.
The change precedes his appearance at Saturday Night Live, where the release of his new album "Yandhi" is expected.
He appears on the show as a replacement for singer Ariana Grande, who has cancelled for “emotional reasons” according to the producer.
The word is not only an abbreviation of its current professional name, but it has, according to its own statement, a religious meaning for the West.
“I think ‘ye’ is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you’,” West said this year in a conversation about his album with radio host Big Boy.
“I am you, I am we, it is us.
From Kanye, which means ‘the only one’, it just became ‘Ye’ – simply a reflection of our good, our bad, our confused, of everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are.”
He is one of several famous rappers who have changed his name.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year announced that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, with whom West has previously collaborated, has already written his name with and without hyphens and capital letters.
Mexico's AMLO vows not to use the military against the civilian population
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador vowed never to use military violence against the civilian population as the 50th anniversary of the bloody retaliation against students in his country approaches.
Lopez Obrador pledged on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza to “never use the military to oppress the Mexican people.”
Soldiers fired at a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, killing 300 people, at which time left-wing student movements were settling throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador pledged to support young Mexicans through monthly student grants and the opening of additional free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of training opportunities led to juvenile criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double funding for artificial intelligence
Given China’s increased activities in the field of artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double its spending on research in this area, says investor and AI practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments follow AI announcements from various areas of the U.S. government, even though the U.S. generally lacks a formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, last year, China presented its plan: the country intends to become the No. 1 in the field of AI innovation by 2030.
“Double the budget for AI research would be a good start given the fact that all other countries are so far behind the U.S. We are looking for the next AI breakthrough,” Lee said.
Doubled funding could double the odds that the next major AI success would be achieved in the U.S., Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China’s most prominent AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an AI system that defeated the highest-ranked American Othello player, later serving as senior executive at Microsoft Research and president of Google’s China branch.
Lee praised earlier U.S. government technology competitions such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s (DARPA) Robotics Challenge and asked about the timing of the next competition, as he wanted to help identify the next visionary.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to get government subsidies.
“It’s not China that’s taking away top academic strengths, it’s taking away companies,” Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired coryphes from universities to work on AI in recent years.
According to Lee, a changed U.S. immigration policy could also be beneficial to U.S. AI efforts.
“I think that in the field of AI, doctoral candidates should automatically be offered greencards,” he said.
In July 2017, China’s Council of State presented its plan for the development of the next generation of AI technologies (Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan).
According to Read, the National Natural Science Foundation of China funds individuals at academic institutions similar to the National Science Foundation and other government organizations donating funds to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which will involve partners from industry and science, and the White House announced the formation of a special committee on artificial intelligence.
In addition, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in the AI Next initiative this month.
The National Science Foundation (NSF) currently invests more than $100 million annually in AI research.
In the meantime, nothing has been done in U.S. laws regarding the formation of the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence for months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on changing the country's name
Macedonia's population voted in a referendum on Sunday to change the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia" to settle a decades-old dispute with Greece that had blocked Macedonia's requests to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbor means that it is claiming Greek territory, so Greece has vetoed Macedonia’s admission to NATO and the EU.
The two governments concluded an agreement in June on the basis of the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority population of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum. A boycott campaign casts doubt that the electoral turnout reaches the 50% required for the validity of the referendum.
The question on the ballot was: “Are you in favour of joining NATO and the EU by accepting the agreement with Greece?”
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia, admission to organisations such as the EU and NATO is worth the price.
“I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the result of the vote is not legally binding, enough Members of Parliament have said that they would stick to the result so that it is decisive.
The change of name would require a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The state election commission said there had been no reports of irregularities until 1 p.m.
However, voter turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, in which 66 percent of registered voters had cast their vote.
“I am here because of my children to vote, our place is in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko will vote in the referendum on the country’s name change that would open the way for Macedonia to join NATO and the European Union on September 30, 2018 in Strumica, Macedonia.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small stage and presented chairs in front of tents set up by people who wanted to boycott the referendum.
“We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join the raised head, not through the back door,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of integration between Europe and Asia.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will result in urgently needed investments for Macedonia, whose unemployment rate is more than 20 percent.
“I think a large majority will be for it, as more than 80 percent of our citizens are for the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after his vote.
In his words, a "yes" result would be a "confirmation of our future."
According to a survey published on Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research, between 30 and 43 percent of voters would take part in the referendum, a figure below the required voter turnout.
Another survey conducted by Macedonia’s Telma TV found that 57 percent of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent said they would vote yes.
For the referendum to be successful, voter turnout must be 50 percent plus one vote.
A failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government’s policy since it took power in May last year.
View: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero maneuvered through the entire Brighton defense to score goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling beat Brighton on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester in a 2-0 win over Manchester City.
Aguero made his score in the 65th minute look ridiculous.
The Argentine striker received a pass in the midfield at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran between three Brighton defenders and then ran into the open field.
Aguero then saw himself surrounded by four green jerseys.
He played around a defender and then overtook several other defenders on the edge of the Brighton Penitentiary.
He then shot a pass to the left of Sterling.
The English striker used his first ball contact in the penalty area to play the ball back to Aguero, who overcame Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with his right shoe and shot into the right side of the net.
“Aguero is struggling with problems in his feet,” city manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We talked about him playing 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored a goal at the moment.”
However, it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage in the Premier League duel.
That goal fell in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball on that move far on the side of Brighton.
He shot a good steep pass along the left flank to Leroy Sané.
Sané needed a few trains to steer Sterling to the long corner.
The Sky Blues attacker aimed the ball into the net shortly before it slipped out.
City will play in the Champions League group game on Tuesday at 12:55 in the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim against Hoffenheim.
Scherzer wants to spoil the game for the Rockies
Since the nationals have been eliminated from the playoff competition, there was little reason to force another bet.
However, the always-performing joker hopes to stand on the hill against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if this is relevant for the Rockies who have a game lead over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West for the playoffs.
The Rockies scored at least one wildcard with a 5:2 victory over the Nationals on Friday night, but still want to secure their first division title.
“Although we don’t play for anything, we can at least throw because we know the atmosphere among the spectators here in Denver and the other team would probably play at the highest level that I would encounter this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to participate in this competition?”
The Nationals have not yet announced a starter for Sunday, but are reportedly inclined to let jokers throw in such a situation.
Scherzer, for whom this would be the 34th bet as the starting player, practiced on Thursday in the Bullpen and would throw on Sunday on his normal rest day.
The Washington right-hander has a statistic of 18-7 this season, an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings.
Trump holds rally in West Virginia
The president indirectly referred to the situation involving his Supreme Court-appointed Brett Kavanaugh when he spoke about the importance of Republican voter participation in the midterm elections.
“Everything we’ve done is at stake in November.
Five weeks before one of the most important choices of our lives.
This is one of the big, big ones – I’m not joining, but in reality I’m joining, that’s why I’m fighting for great candidates everywhere.”
Trump continued, “You see this terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, you see it happening right now.
And they are determined to regain power by all means, they see commonality, disgust.
They don’t care who they hurt, who they have to overtake in order to gain power and control, that’s what they want, power and control, we won’t give it to them.”
The Democrats, he said, saw their mission as “resisting and blocking.”
"And you see that in the last four days," he said, describing the Democrats as "angry and mean and disgusting and dishonest."
He named the highest-ranking Democrat in the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator Dianne Feinstein, which provoked loud shouts from the audience.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you get the document out?
Uh, uh, what.
No, uh no, I’m waiting for you—that was a really bad body language—the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Labour no longer accepts all opinions.
The party is intolerant of those who say their opinion.
When the momentum activists in my local party voted to blame me, this came as little as a surprise.
After all, I am the last of a series of Labour Members to be told that they are not welcome – just because we say our opinion.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan was treated similarly because she had vigorously stood up against anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized for holding a different opinion than Jeremy Corbyn.
About the importance of responsible economic policy, about national security, about Europe, ironically about similar issues, about which Jeremy did not agree with former top politicians.
The announcement of the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday stated that “the meetings should be all inclusive and productive.”
Most of the Friday evening GC sessions in my eight years as a local Labour MP were just that.
Unfortunately, most sessions today are not marked by this tone, and the promised “more friendly, more caring” policy has long been forgotten if it has ever even begun.
It is becoming increasingly clear that divergent views in the Labour Party are not tolerated and that any opinion is judged on whether it is accepted by the party leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy became party leader, and colleagues with whom I previously thought I would share similar political views now expected me to turn around and take positions that I would otherwise never have agreed with – whether it was about national security or the European single market.
Whenever I speak in public – no matter what I say – a social media bullshit follows, calling for my rejection, denouncing the political center and saying that I should not be a member of the Labour Party.
And with this experience, I am not alone.
In fact, I know that I am doing better than some of my colleagues, as the comments I have received are mostly political in nature.
I admire the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face a flood of sexist or racist insults every day and yet never give in.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political age is that insults have become normal.
Jeremy Corbyn last week called for the Labour Party to promote a culture of tolerance.
In reality, we no longer allow all opinions to apply, and with each motion of no-confidence and every change in the electoral rules, the party becomes tighter.
In the last two years, I have often been advised to shrug my head and not express my opinion so clearly, so I would have “no problems”.
But I didn’t go into politics for that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student, caused by the neglect of the Thatcher government, because of which my classroom in the general school literally fell apart, I have fought for better public services for those who need them most urgently – both as a minister and as a councillor.
I never made a helm out of my political views, not even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could in any way be unclear about my political positions and about areas where I disagree with the current leadership.
To supporters of Friday’s motion, I just want to say the following: Given the fact that the country is rushing to a Brexit that will hurt households, businesses and our public service, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leadership of the Labour Party.
In fact, however, I am sending this message not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents, whether they are Labour members or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that still so many rejection threats or political purpose will not deter me from acting in my opinion in the best interest of all of you.

Ayr vs Melrose 38:17: Unbeaten Ayr team rises to the top
Two late attempts may have distorted the end result somewhat, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved the victory in this highly entertaining game of the day in the Tennent's Premiership.
They are now the only of the ten teams to be unbeaten at the top of the table.
Ultimately, the success of the home team was due to their superior defense as well as their better opportunity utilization, and coach Peter Murchie had every reason to be satisfied.
“We’ve been tested so far in our games, and we’re still unbeaten, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, “Congratulations to Ayr, they have used their opportunities better than we did.”
Grant Anderson's attempt in the 14th minute, boosted by Frazier Climo, led Ayr to the lead. However, due to a yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, who had been freed for the game by the Warriors, Melrose was able to speak the numbers, and Jason Baggot caught an unincreased attempt.
Climo expanded Ayr's lead with a penalty kick before scoring a hit directly at half-time and then, alone, an increased attempt, making it 17:5 for Ayr at break.
Melrose started the second half well, however, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, which was increased by Baggot, reduced the distance to five points.
There was then a prolonged interruption due to a severe injury from Ruaridh Knott, who was carried by the playing field. After the continuation, Ayr expanded his lead by an attempt increased by Climo from Stafford McDowall.
Then, as Ayr's captain, Blair Macpherson received a yellow card, and again, at the end of a phase of enormous pressure, Melrose had the extra man pay off by an unincreased attempt by Bruce Colvine.
However, the home team came back, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for tackling without a ball against Climo, MacPherson scored from the penalty area from a touchdown behind the advancing Ayr package.
Climo increased as almost since the interruption, after Kyle Rowe intercepted David Armstrong's boxkick and dispatched flank player Gregor Henry for the fifth attempt of the home team.
"Still Game" star seems ready for new career in gastronomy
"Still Game" star Ford Kieran seems to be ready for a move into the hospitality industry after it turned out he was named as the managing director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show, whose screenplays he writes and in which he plays one of the main roles together with his longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The two have announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the last of the show, and Kiernan seems to be planning a life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the Managing Director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although a Scottish Sun source suggested that Kiernan was interested in entering Glasgow's "flowering restaurant business."
“The sea belongs to us”: Bolivia locked up by land hopes a court will open its way to the Pacific
Marines patrol in front of the naval headquarters in La Paz, decorated with ropework.
A sea blue flag is hoisted on public buildings.
Fleet bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon bear the motto: “The sea is our legitimate property.
Reclaiming it is a duty.”
Everywhere in Bolivia, the memory of the coastline lost to Chile in a bloody conflict over resources in the 19th century is as alive as the desire to cross the Pacific again.
These hopes may not be as strong as they have been for decades, as Bolivia awaits a judgment of the International Court of Justice, which is due to be delivered on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
“Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity and naturally expects the result with a positive attitude,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Across the country, many Bolivians will follow the IGH’s verdict on large screens in the hope that the court in The Hague will rule in favor of Bolivia’s claim, according to which, after decades of sporadic talks, Chile is obliged to negotiate Bolivia’s sovereign access to the sea.
For Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic indigenous president, who is facing a controversial fight for his re-election next year, there is also a lot at stake in the verdict on Monday.
“We are about to return to the Pacific,” he promised at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe it is unlikely that the court will decide in favor of Bolivia, and believe that this would also change little.
The UN body based in the Netherlands is not authorized to grant Chilean territory, and has determined that it will not decide on the outcome of possible talks.
According to Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law, the IGH’s verdict is already available six months after the final pleading, suggesting that the case was “not complicated”.
Far from supporting the Bolivian case, the last four years could also mean a setback.
“The current Bolivian government has taken up the issue of access to the sea,” Zárate said.
She pointed out that Morales's warlike rhetoric has suffocated any remaining goodwill in Chile.
Bolivia and Chile will continue their talks at some point, but after these events, it will be extremely difficult.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, rejected the view that the court’s decision was unusually swift.
On Monday, Bolivia has "an extraordinary opportunity to usher in a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "end the 139-year-long disputes for mutual benefit," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents – uses the theme of the sea as a political crutch.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific,” he added.
“The verdict is a chance to realize that we have to overcome the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will only take place if it can be trusted by the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his nation would never first disarm its nuclear weapons if it could not trust Washington.
Ri spoke in front of the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to implement the promises made during a summit between the heads of state of rivals in Singapore.
His remarks come at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, more than three months after the summit with North Korean head of state Kim Jong-un in Singapore, appears to be about to resume detained nuclear diplomacy.
Ri described the notion that further sanctions and U.S. resistance to a declaration ending the Korean War would ever put the North on its knees, as a “spin-off.”
Washington is skeptical and does not want to agree to the declaration without Pyongyang first taking substantial steps of disarmament.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about renouncing an arsenal in which the country probably sees the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans a visit to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Fashion shows in Paris showcase the latest collections of huge headwear that will soon be available in the shopping streets near you
If you want to expand your hat collection or completely shield the sun, you no longer have to look.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne showed off a range of crazy oversized headwear for their 2019 summer collection that fascinated the fashion world at the Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely impractical hats flooded Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their eye-catching creations across the hallway.
Valentino’s most outstanding piece was an extravagant beige hat with a feather-like wide edge that almost squeezed the models’ heads.
Other oversized accessories have been shown with jeweled watermelon, a magic hat and even a pineapple, but these are not meant to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also unveiled a series of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colourful masks were sewn on lips and had more resemblance to Hannibal Lecter than to Haute Couture.
One creation resembled a scuba gear, including snorkelling and diving glasses, while another looked like a melted ice bag.
And if you want to make another huge fashion statement, you’re lucky.
Fashion observers predict that the huge head coverings could find their way into shopping streets near you.
The oversized hats follow directly to "La Bomba", the 60-centimeter-wide straw hat that everyone wears from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the extremely impractical hat that hit big waves on social media sent another big creation across the walkway: a beach bag made of straw that was almost as big as the model wearing a swimsuit that held the bag.
The bast pocket in reddish orange with bast fringes and a white leather handle was the highlight of Jacquemus’ summer 2019 collection “La Riviera” at the Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect big hats and beach bags to be available in the shopping streets next summer. The designer has aroused so much attention that the demand for oversized accessories will hardly be ignored.”
John Edward: Language skills are essential for world citizens
Scotland’s independent schools continue to be distinguished by academic excellence, which continued in 2018 with further outstanding exam results and is only underpinned by individual and joint successes in the areas of sport, art, music and other community ventures.
With more than 30,000 students from all over Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to care for their students and their parents at the highest possible level.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further education and higher education, the profession of their choice and their place as world citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement a tailor-made curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and sought after in schools as electives.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If you talk to someone in a language they understand, you reach their head.
If you speak to him in his own language, you will reach his heart.”
This is an impressive reminder that we can’t rely only on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
This year’s exam results show that languages with the highest enrollment rates are at the top of the rankings of independent schools.
A total of 68% of students who learned foreign languages scored A on the higher exams.
The data collected by 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 percent of students in Mandarin achieved the grade A on the higher exams, while 72 percent of students who learned German, 69 percent of students who learned French, and 63 percent of students who also learned Spanish.
This illustrates that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as important knowledge that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are now regarded as elective subjects as well as STEM subjects (Natural Sciences, Engineering, Engineering and Mathematics) in the curricula of independent schools and elsewhere.
According to a 2014 survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills, 17 percent of the reasons employers cited for the problems of occupying open positions were related to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly necessary when it comes to preparing young people for their future profession.
As more and more open positions require languages, this knowledge is essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the chosen profession, young people who have learned a second language will have a real advantage in the future through such a lifelong ability.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically give multilingual people an advantage over competitors.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language well enough to conduct a conversation, and French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage (15 percent).
For this reason, it is important for today’s children that we now invest in language teaching.
Children who speak multiple languages, especially languages of developing countries, will have better chances of finding meaningful employment.
In Scotland, different languages are taught in all schools.
A number of schools will focus on the more classical modern languages, while others will be taught languages that are most important for the UK with a view to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Wherever your child’s interests lie, independent schools will always have a number of languages with appropriately specialized teachers to choose from.
Scottish independent schools are committed to creating a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills necessary for their success, no matter what the future looks like.
At this point in a global economic environment, it is impossible to deny that languages are still of elementary importance for the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should actually be seen as “international communication skills”.
Independent schools will continue to offer young people in Scotland this choice, diversity and excellence.
We have to do it.
John Edward is head of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron to make Lakers debut in San Diego on Sunday
For fans who want to see LeBron James compete for the Los Angeles Lakers for the first time, the wait is coming to an end soon.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday in the opening game of the pre-season.
How many minutes he will play is still unclear.
“It will be more than one and less than 48,” Walton said on the Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play only a few minutes.
Earlier this week, James was asked to train for his plans for the Lakers' six-game pre-season schedule.
“I don’t need any pre-season games at this stage of my career to prepare,” he said.
Time for Trump's rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump will begin a series of campaign demonstrations tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of Trump’s five rallies scheduled for next week, including well-meaning places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
Given the floating vote to confirm his election for the vacancy in the Supreme Court, Trump wants to build support for the upcoming midterm elections in November as Republicans run the risk of losing control of Congress.
When is Trump's rally in West Virginia tonight, and how can you watch it online?
Trump’s rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for today, Saturday, September 29, 2018, at 19:00 (East Coast Time).
You can follow Trump's rally in West Virginia below as a live stream on YouTube online.
Trump is likely to address the hearings of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh on allegations of sexual misconduct that took place this week in a tense atmosphere. The expected Senate vote on the confirmation remains in suspense for up to a week as the FBI conducts investigations.
However, the main goal of this rally series is to support Republicans who are facing a difficult November election.
President Trump’s campaign team told Reuters that these five rallies next week serve to “mobilize volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to preserve and expand their majority in the Senate and House of Representatives.”
“Control over Congress is so important to his plans that the president will travel to as many states as possible as the operative election campaign season approaches,” a Trump campaign spokesman, who did not want to name him, told Reuters.
According to the West Virginia Metro News, supporters from “Ohio and Pennsylvania could participate in the rally scheduled for tonight at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling and report media from Pittsburgh.”
The visit on Saturday is Trump’s second visit this month to West Virginia, the state he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to support the Republican Senate candidate from West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who is behind in polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come to try to boost him in the polls,” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. Team Shows Fighting Willingness to Maintain Hope for Individuals on Sunday
After three one-sided laps, the four-game Saturday afternoons may have been exactly what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging pendulum of the moment is a pure invention as a sports concept, but one in which players really believe, especially in competitions like this one.
So where, in your opinion, is the momentum now?
“They were in the lead with six points, and now it’s four, so I think that means a little momentum for us,” Spieth said.
Of course, Europe is ahead and four points ahead, while twelve more will follow.
However, according to Spieth, Americans feel a bit of wind in their sails and have reason to feel encouraged, not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have been playing together all day, each showing three out of four points.
Spieth was incredibly strong from the start to the green and sets a good example.
The guttural screams of enthusiasm grew louder in the further course of his round as he lowered an important putt to decide the fourth four-point match for both of them after he and Thomas had lagged behind after two holes with two points.
His putt, who decided the match on the 15th hole for her, triggered a similar scream, suggesting that the American team is not out of the game yet.
“I really need to clean up and take care of my own game,” Spieth said.
That’s all the players have left.
18 holes to put a sign.
Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood have been the only players to score more points in the last two days than Spieth and Thomas, undoubtedly writing the history of the Ryder Cup.
Europe’s unequal but sympathetic duo is at four out of four points and can do nothing wrong.
“Moliwood” wasn’t the only couple who didn’t beat Bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they had also avoided Bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and at the back nine holes on Friday morning.
This series and the seemingly flowing energy between them and the crowd omitted underscore that they are the players to beat on Sunday. Fleetwood and Molinari would be the most popular players to seal a possible European victory at sunset over Le Golf National.
Preferably both simultaneously at different holes.
Speaking of European fame, however, would be premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made a short trial with Sergio Garcia, the four-hero of the morning, who played alongside Alex Noren.
A Bogey and two doubles at the front nine holes brought the Spaniard and the Swedes into a clamp that they could not nearly overcome.
On Sunday, however, no one can help them out of the clamp.
The four and four pairs are so fascinating to look at from close up because of the interactions between the pairs, the advice they give or don’t give, and the way a strategy can change quickly.
The Europeans have played better as a team so far and are clearly in the lead on the last day, but this four-round has also shown that the U.S. team is ready for battle, which some, especially in the U.S., had doubted.
Europe takes the lead on the last day of the Ryder Cup with 10:6
After the four and four games from Saturday, Europe is ahead of the U.S. with 10:6 and goes with a solid lead in the last day of the Ryder Cup.
The ingenious duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari went ahead with two victories over the struggling Tiger Woods and was able to score four points in Le Golf National.
The European team led by Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn, which wants to win back the trophy lost two years ago in Hazeltine, dominated in the four-match against the wrong-playing American team and won the series 3-1.
In the four games, the U.S. made more resistance and won two matches, but could not catch up.
Jim Furyk's team needed eight points in the twelve singles played on Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood won four points in a row as the first European newcomer, while he and Molinari, who were baptized after a sensational Molliwood weekend, won four points as the second duo in Ryder Cup history in their four opening matches.
After beating Woods and Patrick Reed in the four, they harmonized excellently and beat the enchanted Woods and the American newcomer Bryson Dechambeau with an even stronger 5&4.
Woods, who had dragged himself through two matches on Saturday, occasionally flashed his brilliance, but has now lost 19 of his 29 matches in four and four games and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who had rested during the four in the morning, returned and played the four games as a partner of Henrik Stenson. They won 2&1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the number one and three in the world.
For Europe, however, on this pleasant windy day southwest of Paris, not everything went according to their imaginations.
Three-time major winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the bar for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They scored a tough 2&1 victory over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter and beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy in the four-part 4&3 after losing their first two holes.
In Ryder Cup history, it has only happened twice that a team came back with a four-point gap, but as a title holder, a draw is enough for Furyk's team to keep the trophy.
After only being second for two days, it doesn’t look like they could launch a counterattack on Sunday.
North Korea Rejects Unilateral Disarmament Without Confidence
North Korea’s foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions would deepen its mistrust of the United States and that the country would not unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons under these circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Organization’s annual general assembly that North Korea had taken “substantial measures of goodwill” last year, for example, stopping nuclear and missile tests to demolish the nuclear test site and committing to not proliferating nuclear weapons and technologies.
“But we do not see a corresponding reaction from the United States,” he said.
Without trust in the United States, there is no trust in our national security, and under these circumstances, we will by no means unilaterally disarm ourselves first.
While Ri trusted North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a "phased" approach to denuclearization, in which North Korea would be rewarded for successive steps, his statement seemed significant insofar as it had not received unilateral denuclearization from the past as it had refused.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first summit between a serving US president and a North Korean leader on June 12 in Singapore, in which Kim assured to work towards “denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula” while Trump pledged North Korea’s security guarantees.
North Korea is pursuing an official end to the 1950-1953 Korean War, while the United States has said Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
In addition, Washington is opposed to demands for an easing of strict international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States insists on 'denuclearization first' and increases pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal by coercion, and is even against the 'declaration of the end of the war,'" Ri said.
“The assumption that sanctions can force us to kneel is a brainstorming of people who don’t know anything about us.
The problem, however, is that the continued sanctions deepen our mistrust.”
Ri did not agree on plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. head of state had highlighted at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister pointed to three meetings between Kim and South Korean head of state Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: “If South Korea were the other party on the issue of denuclearization instead of the United States, it would not have come to this standstill in the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.”
Yet the tone of Ri’s speech differed enormously from his speech last year when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable to target the US mainland with North Korea’s missiles after “evil President” Trump called Kim a “missile man” on a suicide mission.
This year, Trump, who last year threatened to “completely destroy” North Korea, overwhelmed Kim with praise at the United Nations for his courage in taking steps toward disarmament, but he said there was still a lot of work to be done and the sanctions would have to remain in place until North Korea’s denuclearization.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time frame for it: “Whether it takes two years, three years or five months – it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that “enforcement of the Security Council sanctions must definitely continue vigorously until we achieve complete, final and verified denuclearization.”
The Security Council has unanimously stepped up sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in order to financially drain Pyongyang’s nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was not successful.
In July, when he left Pyongyang, he said that progress had been made, only to be accused hours later by North Korea of making “gangster-like demands.”
North Korea vowed to demolish a moon, missile base and nuclear complex at a meeting this month if the United States took "corresponding action."
He said Kim had told him that the “appropriate measures” sought were security guarantees given by Trump in Singapore, as well as steps to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard Students Learn to Sleep Enough in a Course
A new course at Harvard University ensures that all undergraduate students get more sleep this year, a measure against the expanding macho culture of staying awake with caffeine and learning all night long.
One scholar has found that students at the world’s leading university are often unnecessary when it comes to paying attention to themselves.
The course was conceived by Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, and is in his opinion the first such course in the United States.
He was inspired to bring the course to life after giving a lecture on the effects of sleep deprivation on learning.
“Finally, a girl came to me and asked, ‘Why am I only learning about it now, in my last year?’
According to her, no one had ever told her how important sleep was, which surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
This year’s course for the first time explained to the students how the basics of good sleep habits contribute to academic and sporting performance and also improve general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and managing director of the university’s health services, said the university had decided to introduce the course after finding that students suffered from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The one-hour course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one section, students see the image of a room in a residence and click on coffee cups, curtains, exercise shoes and books, where they receive information about the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the effects of sleep deprivation on sports performance and the importance of a sleep routine.
In another section, participants learn that long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, and cancer.
They are then encouraged to reflect on their daily routine using a map of the university site with interactive symbols.
“We know that it will not change the behavior of the students immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know this – just as you have the right to know how the decision to smoke affects your health,” added Professor Czeisler.
Pride in pushing a “night layer” is still widespread, he said, adding that modern technologies and the ever-increasing pressure on students made sleep deprivation a growing problem.
Ensuring good enough sleep should be the “secret weapon” of all students against stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said, and weight gain could be avoided because sleep deprivation puts the brain in hunger mode so that they are constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student from California who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler to conceive the course. He had taken one of his courses last year in his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and encouraged him to push for a university-wide course.
He hopes that in the next step, all postgraduate students will be asked to complete a similar study program before taking up their studies at the competitive university.
According to the recommendation of Professor Czeisler, students should take a wake-up call for sleep time and wake-up time and be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" that comes from electronic screens and LED lighting and can bring the circadian rhythm out of the clock.
Livingston vs Rangers 1:0: Menga-Goal defeats Gerrards player
The Rangers lost another away game when Dolly Menga's hit for Steven Gerrard's dissident team meant a 0–1 defeat at Livingston.
The Ibrox team wanted to record their first outfield win since the 4-1 triumph at St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team added Gerrard's first second defeat in 18 games as manager, leaving his team eight points behind the leading hearts in the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga hit seven minutes ahead of halftime, and the low-inspiration rangers seemed to have no chance to make up for it.
While the Rangers are now in sixth place, Livingston rises to third place and is only behind Hibernian in the torque difference.
The Rangers are also facing further trouble after line judge Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury by an object apparently thrown out of the guest block.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team, overtaking Ayr and reaching the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, stayed with the same eleven Livingston players who took the Hearts a point last week, and would have to be thrilled as his well-trained team kept their opponents on foot and foot under pressure.
The Rangers dominated the possession of the ball, but Livingston achieved more when they had the ball.
They should have scored a goal after just two minutes when Menga's first pass led Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder missed his chance and shot beside it.
Then a long free kick from Keaghan Jacobs reached Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow could only pass the rear post.
The Rangers took control, but their game seemed more hopeful than convinced in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos was obviously of the opinion that he should have received a penalty kick after a quarter-hour due to a clash between him and Steven Lawless, but referee Steven Thomson did not allow the Colombian's complaints to apply.
The Rangers only scored two goals in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly had little trouble with Lassana Coulibaly's header and a tame shot from Ovie Ejaria.
Although Livingston's hit in the 34th minute may not match the course of the game, there is no denying that they earned him alone for their hard work.
Again, the Rangers were unable to cope with a ball that Jacobs had shot for a long time in a standard situation.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher shot the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept calm and selected Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard traded Coulibaly to Ryan Kent at half-time, and the change was almost instantly effective when the winger put Morelos in position, but the impressive Kelly pulled up from his line to block the ball.
Livingston, however, continued to get the guests to play exactly the game they deserved, with Lithgow and Halkett getting a long ball after each other.
Holt's team could have expanded their lead in the final phase, but McGregor held up well and defeated Jacobs before Lithgow dropped a header from the corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton also called for a penalty kick late after a mix with Jacobs, but Thomson looked away again.
Almanach: The Inventor of the Geiger Counter
And now a page from our "Sunday Morning" almanac: On September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago, the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as the Geiger counter.
The violin counter, which has since become the standard element of science, has also become a standard element of pop culture, for example in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado" with the seemingly unusual cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: “What in the world is that?”
Rogers: “This is a violin counter used to search for radioactive minerals like uranium.
If you put on these headphones, you can hear the effects of radioactive radiation in the minerals."
Evans: “Actually, I hear a crack!”
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
The invention that bears his name, however, lives on.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” degenerated cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” and destroy degenerated cells.
The vaccine helps the immune system to detect degenerated cells during treatment.
In the method, immune cells are taken from a patient, which are altered in the laboratory.
These cells can “see” a lot of cancers, and are then re-injected.
A test vaccine shows promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
The ovarian cancer of a woman who was treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to detect degenerated cells disappeared for more than 18 months.
In the method, immune cells are removed from a patient, which are altered in the laboratory so that they can “see” the common protein HER2 in many cancers, and then the cells are re-injected.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our findings suggest that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “promotes the growth of various types of cancers,” including breast, ovarian, lung and bowel cancers, Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar method in which patients are taken immune cells and taught to attack cancer cells has helped in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West released a pro-Trump tyre after his appearance at SNL, wearing a MAGA cap ("Make America Great Again").
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was spotted in the studio at Saturday Night Live after he flatteredly praised US President Donald Trump and said he wanted to run for president in 2020.
After singing his third title of the evening, “Ghost Town,” wearing a make-America great-again cap, he continued with a slanderous cannonade against the Democrats, again emphasizing his support for Trump.
“I’m so often asked by whites, ‘How can you like Trump?
“So if I were worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago,” he said.
SNL began the show with a sketch with Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's statement before the Senate Judiciary Committee on the allegations of sexual harassment raised by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although the recording of West's Smurf Tyrade was not sent, it was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It’s unclear if Rock wanted to make fun of the West release.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he had difficulties behind the scenes because of his head covering.
“They harassed me behind the scenes.
You said, ‘Don’t go out with the cap.’
You harassed me!
And then they say I’m in a submerged area,” he told the Washington Examiner.
West continues, “Do you want to see the submerged area?” He said, “He’s going to wear my Supermancape because that means you can’t tell me what I have to do. You want it to go with the world?
Try it with love.”
His remarks sparked at least two buzzing calls from the audience, and SNL contributors were embarrassed, Variety reported. One person told the magazine, "It was dead silent in the studio."
West had been hired late as a replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose former friend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West confused many with a lecture titled "I Love It", in which he was disguised as a Perrier bottle.
West received support from Candace Turner, the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, who tweeted: “To one of the bravest ghosts: THANK YOU, YOU HAST RECEIVED THE MASS.”
Talk show host Karen Hunter, however, tweeted that West was simply himself and that was absolutely wonderful.
“But I don’t want to reward someone who, in my opinion, takes on an ideology that is harmful to my community and gives up (by buying his music or his clothes or supporting his ‘art’).
He's free.
The same applies to us,” she added.
Before the show, the rapper had announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and was now "The being formally known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name, and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His rapper colleague Snoop Dogg was named Snoop Lion, and of course Prince, the late music legend, changed his name to a symbol and then to "The Artist Formerly Known As Prince".
Prosecution for attempted murder in connection with stab injury in Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after a man was wounded with a knife in a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, according to police.
The defendant is scheduled to appear at the Belfast Arbitration Court on Monday.
The allegations are reviewed by the Prosecutor's Office.
"Game of Thrones" star Kit Harington attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as the sword swinger Jon Snow in HBO's violently shaped medieval fantasy series "Game of Thrones".
However, the 31-year-old actor has attacked the stereotype of the Macho hero, saying such roles on the screen would result in boys often feeling the need to be strong in order to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Harington said he believes something went wrong and asked how to solve the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo age.
Harington, who recently married Rose Leslie, also a 31-year-old star in Game of Thrones, admitted that solving the problem was "very important".
“I personally find the question of what went wrong with masculinity very important at the moment,” he said.
“What have we taught growing men in relation to the problem we are now observing?”
Harington believes that because of the very masculine characters, television may be partly responsible for the increasing toxic masculinity.
He continued: “What is innate, and what is learned?
What is taught on television and on the street that makes a boy feel like he has to embody this particular side of a man?
I think that’s really one of the big questions of our time: how do we change that?
“Something went wrong with the young men.”
He also admitted in the interview that he will not be participating in prequels or sequels to "Game of Thrones" after the end of the series next summer. He has "enough of battlefields and horses".
From November, Harington will be seen in a reissue of Sam Shepard’s True West, the story of a film producer and his brother, a robber.
The actor recently revealed that for him the best thing about “Game of Thrones” was that he met his wife Rose.
“I met my wife on this show, so that’s how I got my future family and my life from now on,” he said.
Rose Leslie starred in the Emmy-winning fantasy series Ygritte, the lover of Harington's character Jon Snow.
The two married in June 2018 on Leslie’s family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV or AIDS.
According to health officials, more than 820,000 people are affected in the country.
Around 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
Unlike in the past, the overwhelming majority of new cases were transmitted through sexual intercourse.
So far, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
In China, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS has increased by 100,000.
HIV transmission through sexual intercourse is an acute problem in China’s LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against members of the LGBT community is said to be widespread.
Due to the country’s conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry women.
Many of the disease transmissions are due to insufficient protection during sexual intercourse in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has, among other things, promised general access to HIV drugs to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies employees leaked GOP senators’ data, criticizes “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories”
Maxine Waters, a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, denied on Saturday claims that a member of her staff posted the personal information of three Republican U.S. senators on the deputies’ Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat said the allegations were spread by “ultra-right” experts and websites.
“Lies, lies, and even more disgusting lies,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information published includes the private addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday and was published during a Senate committee hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct by an unknown person in the government district against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The publication took place after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identified the source of the posts was assigned to Waters’ office and published the information of a member of Waters’ staff, The Hill reported.
“This unfounded accusation is completely false and an absolute lie,” Waters continued.
“The member of my staff – whose identity, personal data and security were compromised by these fraudulent and false allegations – was in no way responsible for leaking this information.
This unfounded accusation is completely false and an absolute lie.”
Waters’ statement quickly sparked online criticism, including that of Ari Fleischer, a former White House press spokesman.
“This denial is angry,” Fleischer wrote.
“This suggests that she doesn’t have the right temperament to be a member of Congress.
People who are accused of something they didn’t do shouldn’t be angry.
They must not be defiant.
You are not allowed to question the prosecutor's motives.
They have to be calm and relaxed.”
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters’ reaction to Democrats’ criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of acting too angry during Thursday’s hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who is running in the midterm elections to replace Waters, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
“Great thing, if that’s true,” he tweeted.
Waters said in her statement that her office had informed the competent authorities and law enforcement agencies about these fraudulent allegations.
“We will make sure that the perpetrators are exposed,” she continued, “and that they are held accountable for all their actions, which are destructive and dangerous to all members of my staff.”
Johnny English – You only live three times – weak spy parody with Rowan Atkinson
It is now a tradition to look for Brexit references in every new British-coloured film. This also seems to apply to this revival of the action comedy parody franchise “Johnny English”, which began in 2003 with “Johnny English – The Spy Who Sieved It” and again in 2011 with “Johnny English – Now Stands Right”.
Is an ironic self-parody on the topic, how obviously stupid we are, the new export opportunity for the nation?
In any case, Johnny English’s license for the second time has been extended, as he is a general comic creation for non-English-speaking cinemagoers, with his name signifying above all else that he is a general comic for non-English-speaking cinemagoers.
Of course, he is again the clumsy secret agent who bizarrely considers himself cool and worldly, while in reality he is from something Clouseau, a priss Mr. Bean and a clapping of this guy who has a single note to the title melody of "The Hour of the Winner" at the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympics in London.
In addition, the character was originally based on the chaos left behind by travelers and international secret agents who played Atkinson in the now-forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials.
The last adventure of Johnny English has one or two nice moments.
I liked how Johnny English approached a helicopter in a medieval armor and the rotor blades briefly dangled around his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comics comes to light, but the humor seems rather weak and strangely superfluous, especially because the "serious" movie series like "007" and "Mission Impossible" now offer self-confident comedic elements.
Humor seems to be more about children than adults, and for me, Johnny English’s crazy misadventures aren’t as inventive and focused as Atkinson’s silent film gags in the role of Bean.
The ever-present premise now is that Britain is in great danger.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated the super-secret British spy network and revealed the identities of all British agents deployed, much to the displeasure of the serving agent, an unfortunately small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last straw for the prime minister, an inflated and oppressed figure who is already facing complete collapse due to her political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing her best with this quasi-Teresa May character, but the script doesn’t give much to work with.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that all active spies have been uncovered and she must therefore take someone out of retirement.
This includes Johnny English himself, who now works as a teacher at a chic institution, but has unofficial lessons in working as an undercover agent. There are a few gags, because English offers a spy academy reminiscent of the "School of Rock".
English is taken back to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and reunited with his former hard-tested Kumpan Bough, who is again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a submarine commander, an annoying upper society woman in whose role Vicki Pepperdine is somewhat wasted.
So Batman and Robin, who are always making terrible mistakes in your Majesty's secret service, are back in action, encountering Olga Kurylenko's beautiful wife Fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is dangerously in the trap of a charismatic tech billionaire played by Jake Lacy, Jason Volta, who claims to be able to solve Britain's computer problems.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of grotesque laughter: dressed as waiters, they set fire to a chic French restaurant, they create chaos as they smuggle themselves aboard Volta's luxury yacht, and English unleashes pure anarchy as he tries to turn himself into the head of the house with the help of a virtual reality Voluttas.
In this last sequence, all the registers are drawn, but as nice and funny as it is, the topic is already discussed in detail on children's television.
Pretty moderate fabric.
As with the other Johnny English films, I had to ask myself, “Can’t the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really suits his talent?”
Labour denies working on a plan that would allow the British to work four days a week but pay for five days
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party is expected to consider a radical plan that requires the British to work four days a week but be paid for five days.
According to reports, the party wants corporate leaders to pass on the savings made by the AI (artificial intelligence) revolution in the form of an additional day off to employees.
This would give employees a three-day weekend, but would still receive the same pay.
According to sources, the idea "fits" the party's economic agenda and its plans to shift the balance in the country in favor of workers.
The shift to a four-day week was endorsed by the Trades Union Congress as an opportunity for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour source told the Sunday Times: “A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
“A shift will not occur overnight, but a four-day working week is an endeavor consistent with the party’s approach to restoring economic balance for the benefit of workers, as well as the party’s general industrial policy strategy.”
The Labour Party would not be the first party to support such an idea; the Green Party already promised to introduce a 4-day week during the 2017 general election campaign.
However, the approach is not generally endorsed by the Labour Party at the moment.
A spokesman for the Labour Party said: “A four-day week is not party politics and is not considered by the party.”
The shadow chancellor John McDonnell concreted his idea of a socialist revolution in the economy at the Labour Conference last week.
McDonnell said he was determined to regain the power of “anonymous directors” and “profits” at public utility companies.
The shadow chancellor's plans also mean that the current shareholders of the water companies may not be able to recover their full share, as a Labour government could make "deductions" due to alleged misconduct.
He also confirmed plans to appoint employees to the boards of directors of companies and set up Inclusive Ownership Funds to hand over 10% of private company equity to employees who cash out annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy Speak in News Magazine '60 Minutes' on whether FBI Investigation in Kavanaugh Case Could Change Their Opinion
The FBI investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed a final vote on his appointment as a Supreme Court judge by at least a week, raising the question of whether the agency’s findings could influence Republican senators to win their support.
In an interview on Sunday, 60-minute correspondent Scott Pelley interviewed Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham on whether the FBI could bring out something that could ultimately change their mind.
Kennedy seemed to be more open than his South Carolina counterpart.
“I mean, of course,” Kennedy said.
“I said in the hearing that I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him afterwards, this claim was made, and asked if he had done it.
He was determined, determined and unmistakable.”
Graham’s voice, however, appears to be carved in stone.
“My opinion is clear as to Brett Kavanaugh, and there should be a bomb going off,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know this: Brett vehemently denied it,” Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And all those who called her could not confirm it.”
It is now 36 years.
And I can't see any changes."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and was it used to help alleviate poverty?
On Saturday, New York City hosts the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music festival with an impressive lineup of stars and an equally impressive mission – to fight poverty in the world.
Tens of thousands will attend this year’s Global Citizen Festival for the 7th time, not only to experience the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the event’s real goal: combating extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which took place for the first time in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project. As part of this project, an international stakeholder group is trying to combat poverty by motivating more and more people to actively participate in the fight against poverty.
To get a free ticket for the event (the other option would be to buy a VIP ticket), you need to complete a number of tasks, including actions such as volunteering, communicating with a leading politician worldwide (by email or phone) or similar measures to raise awareness of the goal of fighting poverty.
How successful is the project, considering that Global Citizen still has 12 years to achieve the goal?
Is the idea of putting a cool free concert in perspective, a sensible way to convince others that it’s time to act, or just another case of so-called clickivism – if you’re thinking of making a difference by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Global Citizen announced that since 2011, the project has been able to record more than 19 million actions from its supporters and achieve various goals.
These actions are said to have helped incentivize leading politicians around the world to announce commitments and strategies worth more than $37 billion that will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements resulting from its actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid out or raised through fundraising.
The group estimates that the funds secured so far have a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include the Power of Nutrition project, a partnership of UK-based investors and implementers who have pledged to support children in their optimal development, and who have pledged to help Rwanda with $35 million to fight malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 global tweets from Citiz.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history,” said The Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions calling on the UK to improve the nutritional situation of mothers and children, the government announced funding for The Power of Nutrition project, which aims to reach 5 million women and children and provide nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the most frequently asked questions on the website, namely, what are the reasons why Global Citizen can fight extreme poverty,
They replied, “It will be a long and arduous journey with highs and lows.
But like the big civil rights and anti-apartheid movements ahead of us, we will succeed because together we are stronger and more influential.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the artists performing at this year’s event in New York, with Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman as moderators.
The U.S. could use the Navy for blockade purposes to hinder Russian energy exports – Interior Ministry
According to the Washington Examine, Washington can resort to the Navy if needed, so that energy from Russia does not reach markets including the Middle East, U.S. Home Secretary Ryan Zinke said.
Zinke claimed that Russia’s deployment in Syria is a pretext for exploring new energy markets, and Russia is currently operating at the invitation of the legitimate government in these areas.
“I think the real reason for Russia’s deployment in the Middle East is to negotiate new markets in the energy sector, just like in Eastern Europe,” he said.
And according to the official, there are means and ways to address this.
“The United States, together with the Navy, can ensure that sea routes remain open and block them if necessary to ensure that energy from Russia does not reach the market,” he said.
Zinke addressed the participants of the event of the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that sees itself as a “voice of the electricity consumers” in the United States.
He compared Washington’s approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they are virtually identical.
“The use and replacement of fuels is more or less the economic option in Iran and Russia,” he said, while calling Russia a “one trick pony” with a fossil-fuel-dependent economy.
The statements were made when the Trump administration was expanding exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, the far cheaper option for consumers in Europe.
To this end, government officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, made Berlin a “prisoner” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is intended to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s massive opposition to the project is due to economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I think we are all of the opinion that energy should not be used as a means to exert pressure, and that consumers can choose the suppliers themselves,” Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The United States has received counter-wind from Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industrial organization, the Federal Association of German Industry (BDI), has urged the US to stay out of EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“It’s a big problem if a third country interferes in our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, the BDI’s board of directors, after a meeting between Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren Wants to “Exactly Examine” 2020 Presidential Candidacy, Says Massachusetts Senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren announced on Saturday that she would “exactly consider” a presidential nomination after the midterm elections.
During a town hall meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering a candidacy.
According to The Hill, Warren said it would be time for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government, and that includes women at the top.
Warren plans to “examine closely” a presidential nomination after November 6.
Warren said during the meeting that President Trump is steering this country in the wrong direction.
“I am extremely concerned about how Donald Trump is dealing with our democracy,” she said.
Warren has not taken a leaf in her criticism of Donald Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court.
In a tweet on Friday, she announced that, of course, an FBI investigation is required before the vote.
However, a poll published on Thursday showed that the majority of Warren voters do not believe they should run for office for 2020.
According to a survey by the Suffolk University Political Research Center and the Boston Globe, 58 percent of potential voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run.
32 percent of voters supported such a candidacy.
The poll showed more support for a candidacy of former governor Deval Patrick; with 38 percent in favour of a potential candidacy and 48 percent against it.
Other names of prominent Democrats eligible for a possible 2020 candidacy include former vice president Joe Biden and Vermont senator Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Biden announced that he would make an official decision by January.
Sarah Palin speaks at the Donald Trump rally about post-traumatic stress disorder, under which Palin suffers
Track Palin, 26, was in Iraq for a year.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
“What my son is going through, what he is going through when he comes back, everything that other families can feel the effects of PTSD and some of the wounds our soldiers are going back with,” she told the audience at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin described his arrest as an "elephant in space" and said about her son and other war veterans that they will return changed, that they will return more brewed, that they will return and wonder if there is this respect for what other soldiers and pilots and any other member of the military have given to the country.
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and D.C. support a legal remedy for the new asylum policy
18 states and the District of Columbia support a legal remedy to the new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims of gang activity or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the district filed a forensic statement in Washington on Friday to support an asylum seeker who is questioning the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal policy in August was not disclosed.
She said her partner "and his violent gang sons" abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her application for asylum on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Attorneys supporting Grace called El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where many people apply for asylum in the U.S., nations facing major problems with criminal gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a 2014 Board of Immigrant Appeals decision that allowed illegal immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy “ignores decades of legislation at the state, federal and international levels.”
"The federal law requires that all applications for asylum be judged on the basis of the respective facts and circumstances of the application, and this court violates this principle," the court's expert statement said.
The lawyers further argued in the statement that the policies that deny immigrants entry to the country adversely affect the U.S. economy, as immigrants may be more likely to work as entrepreneurs and provide the necessary workforce.
In June, Federal Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and the violence of criminal gangs.
“Asylum exists for anyone who leaves their homeland because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or belonging to a particular social group or political belief,” Sessions said in his June 11 policy announcement.
It was never the plan to defuse all the problems by granting asylum, even all the serious problems that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue attempts in Palu as the number of deaths in the race doubles over time
For the survivors, the situation was getting worse.
“It’s all very tense,” says 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, calming her little feverish son in a rescue center in the destroyed downtown of Palu.
“Every minute a new ambulance comes with dead people.
Clean drinking water is scarce."
Residents returned to their destroyed homes to collect their wettest possessions and possessions while storing everything they could find.
Hundreds were injured, and the staff of hospitals damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake were completely overloaded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who contracted vertebral fractures and a broken shoulder, remained outside the Palu Military Hospital, where patients were being treated outdoors due to the ongoing strong aftershocks.
With tears in his eyes, he recounted how the violent earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
“Everything went way too fast.
I think I was stuck beneath the walls,” he told the Associated Press, adding that the reason for staying in the city was a wedding.
“I heard my wife’s cry for help, but then it was quiet.
I don't know what happened to my wife and child.
I can only hope that they are in a safe place.”
U.S. ambassador accuses China of tyranny with “propaganda ads”
A week after an official Chinese newspaper posted a four-page ad in an American daily announcing the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of exploiting the U.S. press for propaganda purposes.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to the paid cover of the China Daily in the Des Moines Register, Iowa’s best-selling magazine, after accusing China of interfering in the U.S. congressional elections on November 6, a charge that China denies.
Trump’s allegations that Beijing tried to interfere in the U.S. election are in line with the announcement by U.S. officials to Reuters; a new phase of an escalating campaign triggered by Washington to put pressure on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to advertise for boosting the economy, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in a rampant trade war, with tariffs on imports for both countries.
China’s retaliatory tariffs at the start of the trade war should hit exporters in states like Iowa that supported Trump’s Republican Party, Chinese and US experts said.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa, who largely exports agricultural products to China, said Beijing had damaged workers, owners of farms and businesses.
China, according to Branstad in a statement in Sunday’s Des Moines Register, is now doubling this tyranny by posting propaganda ads in its own free press in the United States.
“By spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is claiming America’s proven tradition of free expression and independent press by switching off paid advertising in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“In contrast, you will find only a limited number of opposing votes at the newspaper kiosks here in Beijing and will not find any real reflection of the different opinions that the Chinese might have about China’s disturbing economic development, given the fact that the media is firmly in the hands of the Communist Party of China,” he wrote.
He added that one of China’s best-known newspapers did not accept the offer to publish his article, but did not mention the name of the newspaper.
Republicans baffle women voters in midterm elections with Kavanaugh debacle, observers warn
As many of the most influential Republicans support and defend Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh in the face of multiple allegations of sexual violence, observers have warned of a counter-reaction during the upcoming midterm elections, which could come especially from women.
The mood in this regard was extremely tense, and most Republicans have already mentioned that they are proceeding with a vote.
"Such things can't be reversed," Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, told The Hill for an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted Senator Jeff Flake’s last-minute advance was sufficient for an FBI investigation to appease annoyed voters.
“Women don’t forget what happened yesterday, they don’t forget it tomorrow and they don’t forget it in November either,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, first adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn.
On Friday morning, protesters in the Senate hallway shouted “November is coming!” when the Republicans who control the Justice Committee decided to hold Kavanaugh’s nomination, despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford’s statement, Mic reported.
Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are an extremely important topic, Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political observer, told the news site.
“People say it’s already high, that’s true.
But it could be higher, especially with suburban voters and younger voters, people between 18 and 29 who, although they don’t like the president, often don’t vote.”
Even before Ford’s public statement detailing her allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court candidate, observers suggested that a counter-reaction could be the result if Republicans advance the confirmation.
“This situation is a mess for the GOP,” Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, told NBC News earlier this week.
“It’s not just about the vote of the panel, the final vote or the Kavanaugh review; it’s also about the way Republicans have handled it and how they’ve treated it,” Guy Cecil, director at Priorities USA, a group that supports the election of Democrats, told the news channel.
The Americans, however, seem to disagree on who they should believe because of Ford and Kavanaugh’s statements, with a slightly larger share on the latter’s side.
A new YouGov survey found that 41% of respondents were definitively or probably convinced of Ford’s statement, while 35% said they were definitively or probably believing Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% said they believed Kavanaugh likely or definitively lied in his statement, while 30% said the same about Ford.
According to Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford and at least one other plaintiff, Deborah Ramirez.
Ford made an oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that she was attacked by the drunken Kavanaugh at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court exposed his genitals to her when she was at a party during her time at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet to oppose Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is currently launching a startup with the aim of establishing competition with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, Inrupt, is a company based on Berners-Lee’s open source platform Solid.
With Solid, users can choose where their data is stored and who gets access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee gave the best that the intention behind Inrupt was the “world rulership”.
“We need to get active now,” he said on the topic of startups.
“This is a historic moment.”
The app uses Solid’s technology, allowing users to create their own personal online data store or POD.
It can include contact lists, task lists, a calendar, a music library, and other private and corporate tools.
Similar to Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify, all content is available in one browser and at the same time.
The special thing about the personal online data store is that the user can decide who can access which data.
The company describes this concept as personal reinforcement and development through data.
According to the company’s CEO, John Bruce, the idea behind Inrupt is that the company deploys resources, processes, and related capabilities to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently includes Berners-Lee, Bruce, some developers hired to work on this project, as well as a community of volunteer programmers, and an IBM-acquired security platform.
Beginning this week, technology developers around the world will be able to build their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team will not talk to Facebook and Google about whether to make a comprehensive change that will completely reshape their entire business models overnight.
“We don’t ask for your permission.”
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt has the task of providing commercial energy generation and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new, solid-based web.
In 1994, Berners-Lee redesigned the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been instrumental in the debate about net neutrality.
Even with the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee remains the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m extremely confident about this new era of the web,” he added.
Priest Bernard Vann, bearer of the Victorian Cross in the First World War, was honored
The only clergyman of the Church of England to be awarded the Victorian Cross during World War I was honored 100 years later in his hometown.
Lieutenant-Colonel and Priest Bernard Vann won the award for his involvement in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt on 29 September 1918.
However, he was killed four days later by a sniper and never learned that he had won the highest British war award.
His two grandchildren unveiled a memorial stone on Sunday at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of the grandchildren, Michael Vann, said that this act was full of symbolic power, as the memorial stone was revealed exactly 100 years after the heroic act for which his grandfather was awarded.
According to The London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin; through dense fog and under heavy firing from field guns and machine guns.
Later, he pushed forward to the line of fire, leading the line forward with the "greatest courage" before moving forward with a field weapon alone and shutting down three of the military units.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was shot by a German sniper on October 4, 1918; just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather’s actions were something he could never do justice to, and at the same time something that makes you humble.
Together with his brother Dr. James Vann, he placed a wreath after the parade under the direction of the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann stated that he feels very honored to be able to participate in the parade, adding that the bravery of a real hero will be made visible above all by the support of many people.
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, instead there was Peppa Pig
Imagine you stayed up all night to watch an exciting Bellator 206, and then you can’t watch the main event.
The San Jose bill contained 13 fights, including 6 on the main map, and was broadcast live throughout the night in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for their fight, the viewers in the UK weren’t astonished when suddenly Peppa Pig was seen.
Some remained untouched after staying awake until the early hours of the morning to see the fight specifically.
A fan on Twitter described the switch to the trick-film character as somehow a bad joke.
“Due to government regulation, these contents are classified as non-juvenile, so they had to be switched to a children’s show at 6:00 a.m.,” said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president of marketing and communications, when interviewed for the broadcast.
“Peppa, the pig, exactly.”
Bellator’s board of directors, Scott Coker, said the company will revise the schedule to consider viewers from the UK in the future.
“I think the problem could have been solved by the repetition game,” he said.
“But it’s 6 a.m. on a Sunday with viewers in the UK, and we won’t be solving the incident until Sunday our time, Monday local time there.
But we're staying.
The change was communicated quite a lot. It went very well and everything was not always nice.
We tried to solve the problem and assumed it was a technical malfunction.
Which was not the case, it was a problem on the part of the government.
I promise, this won't happen again.
We're going to reduce the whole thing to 5 instead of 6 fights, as usual, and we've tried to give the fans the best possible experience.
The whole situation is quite regrettable."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley ‘feels inferior’ to sexuality
Tom Daley, who participated in various Olympics as a water jumper, says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone else because of his sexuality, but that feeling motivated him to become so successful.
The 24-year-old said he had only realized in high school that he was different from others.
In the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs with Lauren Laverne, he said he had spoken out on gay rights to encourage others.
He also said that since becoming a father, winning the Olympics is no longer so important to him.
The actual host of the long-running show, Kirsty Young, pauses due to illness for a few months.
In Laverne's first show, he said he used to consider himself inferior to others because love for boys and girls was socially completely unacceptable.
He said, “To this day, feeling inferior and different from others is reason for my power and strength and ultimately for my success.”
He wanted to prove that he is a very special personality so as not to disappoint anyone when his sexual orientation became known.
The two-time Olympic bronze medal winner is now a prominent LGBT activist and used his appearance at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to advance the decriminalization of homosexuality in other countries.
He said he has spoken out on this issue because, fortunately, he can live without restrictions and without discrimination and wants to give courage to others.
The three-time world champion fell in love with American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013. The realization of falling in love with a man was an absolute surprise to him.
Daley married the 20-year-old Oscar winner in the previous year, but he shared that the age difference has never been a topic.
He thinks that if as a child and a teenager you had to go through so much – he took part in the Olympics for the first time at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later, it’s hard to find someone at the same age with similar experiences.
The couple has had a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley since June, and Daley believes his entire outlook has changed since.
Last year, it was all about gold medals.
But for him, there are now more important than Olympic gold medals.
His son Robbie is now his main gain.
He bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain tumor.
Daley said his father did not accept the imminent death, and one of the last things he asked for were tickets to London in 2012, as he wanted to be at the forefront of it.
“I couldn’t tell him he wouldn’t be there anymore,” he said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and it was only afterwards that I finally realized that he was not invincible,” he continued.
The following year, Daley won the bronze medal at the 2012 Olympic Games.
“I just knew it had always been my dream to dive in front of a local audience at the Olympics – that was madness,” he said.
His first selection of songs – Proud by Heather Small – was also influenced by this. He heard the song before the Olympics and still cared for goose skin.

Mickelson, who is currently out of shape, sits on the replacement bench at the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record for his 47th Ryder Cup game on Sunday, but he has to make a lot of effort to keep the whole thing from becoming a debacle.
Mickelson, who is playing at the event for the 12th time, was sent to the replacement bench by Captain Jim Furyk for the Fourballs and Foursomes on Saturday.
Rather than being the focus of the event as usual, the five-time major winner spent his day inspiring others and working on his game in the hope of fixing the problems that burdened him.
Even at the height of his career, the 48-year-old Mickelson was never the most direct golfer and therefore not an ideal occupation for the narrow Le Golf National golf course, where misguided balls are regularly penalized.
And as if the place itself wasn’t discouraging enough, Mickelson meets perfectionist British Open champion Francesco Molinari in Sunday’s ninth game, who has teamed up with Tommy Fleetwood, newcomer to these tournaments, to win all four games this week.
If the Americans lag four points behind in the 12 singles, Mickelson’s game could prove to be absolutely crucial.
Furyk spoke confidently to Mickelson and could not add much to it either.
“He was completely clear about his role today, gave me a slap on the back and put his arm around me, thinking he was ready for tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He has a lot of self-confidence.
He’s one of the world’s best-known personalities and he’s done so much for these teams in the past and this week.
I didn’t think he was in two games.
I had imagined more, but that’s how it went and that’s what we expected.
He wants to be there, like everyone else.”
Mickelson will reach Nick Faldo’s record for most Ryder Cup games played on Sunday.
It could mean the end of a Ryder Cup race that never quite matched the highlights of his personal record.
Mickelson can record 18 wins, had to score 20 defeats and reached seven half-times, although Furyk announced that his presence alone has enriched the team.
“He’s funny and sarcastic, original and likes to play a few games, and he’s a great person who’s popular with the whole team,” he said.
“I think the younger players were happy to get to know him a little bit more this week. It was fun to watch them.
He’s a really interesting person who gives a lot of impulses.”
Captain Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn knows the lead may be over soon
Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that a big lead that leads to the last singles in the Ryder Cup can quickly become an unpleasant situation.
The Dane made his debut in Valderrama in 1997, where a team led by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but came just over the finish line and led with the smallest possible lead, winning a 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2–131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“The thought remains that we had a big lead in Valderrama, we had a big lead in Brookline where we lost, and in Valderrama where we won, but that was scarce,” Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn said (pictured in the photo) after winning 5–3 of the Class of 2018 at both Golf and National at 10 yesterday.
The experience shows me and all the team members that it is not over.
Tomorrow is going to be a good day.
Get in the way and do the right thing.
The whole thing is over only when the points are on the dashboard.
We have a goal. We want to win this trophy, and that's where our focus is.
I’ve always said that I’m focusing on the 12 players on our side, but we’re fully aware of what’s on the other side: the best players in the world.”
Glad about the performance his players have made on a difficult golf course, Bjorn continued: “I would never overdo it.
Tomorrow will be a different caliber.
Tomorrow, individual services will be at the forefront, and that is a completely different matter.
It’s great to work with a partner when things are going well, but when you’re out there alone, you’re tested to the limits of your golfing abilities.
You have to make it clear to the players: get the best out of you tomorrow.
Now you’re leaving your partner behind and he has to get the best out of you, too.”
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent Jim Furyk will make sure his players individually score better than in the team, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have won three out of four points.
Furyk himself stood on both sides of that great turnaround on the last day of the tournament, standing on the winner side in Brookline before standing on the losers side after Europe's "Miracles of Medina".
“I remember every damn word,” he replied to the question how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, motivated his players before the last day.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you would like to take off the quick start you saw in Brookline and Medinah.
When the momentum hits in one direction, it puts the middle games under a lot of pressure.
We set up our team accordingly and send our guys out as we feel, you know, we’re trying to spell tomorrow.”
Thomas was assigned the task of catching up in return, he has to compete in the top game against Rory McIlroy, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the other Europeans in the top half of the ranking.
“I chose the guys in this order because I think it covers everything,” Bjorn said of his selection for the singles.
Germany's new warship delayed again
The newest frigate of the German Navy should have been put into service already in 2014 to replace warships from the Cold War years, but it will not be delivered until next year, according to local media, due to faulty systems and rapidly growing costs.
The commissioning of the “Rheinland-Pfalz”, the flagship of the brand new frigates of the “Baden-Württemberg” class, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the time, which referred to a military spokesman.
The ship should have been put into service already in 2014, but the ambitious project was plagued by disturbing problems after delivery.
The four ships of the Baden-Württemberg class, ordered by the navy in 2007, are to replace the old frigates of the Bremen class.
They will include a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft missiles and sea targets, as well as camouflage technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic reflection.
Another important feature is longer maintenance periods; it should be possible that the newest frigates do not have to return to their home ports for up to two years.
However, the ongoing delays may result in the state-of-the-art warships, which Germany is supposed to represent as a naval power, already being obsolete at the time of their commissioning, according to Die Zeit.
The frigate F125, haunted by the accident, hit the headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to take the ship and gave it back to the shipyard Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to the shipyard after its delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but German media cited a number of significant "software and hardware errors" that would have rendered the new ship unusable in a combat situation.
Software problems are particularly serious, as ships of the Baden-Württemberg class are served by a crew of only 120 sailors, only about half as many as on the older frigates of the Bremen class.
It has also been known that the ship is far too heavy, leading to performance losses and preventing the Navy from carrying out upgrades in the future.
The 7000-ton “Rhineland-Palatinate” was apparently twice as heavy as ships of a similar class used by Germany in World War II.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project, including the training costs of the crew, became a problem.
Apparently, the cost rose to a staggering <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion, compared to the <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion originally planned.
The problems with the latest frigates are particularly significant given the recent warnings that the German navy is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the German Bundestag’s defense commissioner, confirmed that the navy “is leaving the ships that can be used.”
Bartels said the problem grew with time as old ships were taken out of service but no replacement ships had been deployed.
He complained that none of the frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class could be taken from the navy.
National Trust listens to the secret life of bats
New research is being carried out on a property in the Scottish Highlands to show how bats use the landscape in their search for food.
It is hoped that the results will provide further insight into the behavior of these unique flying mammals and help guide future nature conservation activities.
The study, conducted by researchers at the National Trust for Scotland, will track dwarf and mosquito bats as well as brown longhorn and water bats in Inverewe Garden in Wester Ross.
Special recording devices are placed at key positions on the plot to record the activities of bats throughout the season.
NHS employees and volunteers will also conduct mobile examinations with portable detectors.
In a sound analysis of all recordings by experts, the frequency of butterfly exclamations is determined and determines which species does what.
Subsequently, a map and a report of the habitat is created to create a detailed picture of their behavior at landscape level.
Rob Dewar, Nature Conservation Advisor for the NTS, hopes that the results will show which areas of habitat are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This data will help determine the benefits of habitat management measures, such as creating meadows, and show how to preserve forest areas for bats and other related species.
Butterfly stocks in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom have declined significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work, which has an impact on sleeping places and leads to loss of habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, as can flycatchers and the chemical treatment of building materials or even attacks by domestic cats.
Butterflies are not really blind.
However, because of their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use sophisticated echo sounding to detect insects and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS responsible for the care of over 270 historic buildings, 38 significant gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout Scotland takes the issue of bats very seriously.
He has 10 trained experts who regularly conduct surveys, inspect sleepers and sometimes rescue operations.
The organization has even set up Scotland’s first and only bat reserve at the Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland’s 10 bat species.
Property manager David Thompson explains that the property is the ideal habitat for them.
“Here in Threave we have a great area for bats,” he explains.
“We have the old buildings, many old trees and an excellent habitat.
But there’s a lot we don’t know about bats yet, so we’re doing these work here and on other goods that will help us learn more about what bats need to feel comfortable.”
He stresses the importance of excluding the presence of bats before maintenance work in the goods, as it is possible that the unintentional destruction of a single nest site could kill up to 400 females and juveniles and exterminate the entire population on site.
Fleas are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass or destroy them or their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the population to help.
“We still have a lot to learn about bats and many of our species don’t know what their populations are like.”
Ronaldo denies allegations of rape, while his lawyers want to sue the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called the rape allegations against him “fake news” and said people want to be “famous” by using his name.
His lawyers are planning to sue the news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The striker of the national team of Portugal and Juventus Turin was accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He allegedly paid her $375,000 to buy her silence about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
In an Instagram live video to his 142 million followers, 33-year-old Ronaldo called the reports just hours after they were released as “fake news.”
“No, no, no, no, no.
What they reported today: Fake News,” the five-time winner of the Ballon d’Or told the camera.
“They want to profile themselves by using my name.
That's normal.
You want to be famous by my name, but that's part of the job.
I’m a happy man and everything is good,” the player added smiling.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue the mirror on charges they called “inadmissible reporting of privacy suspicions,” according to Reuters.
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player demanded compensation for “moral damages at an amount equal to the severity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personality rights in recent years.”
The alleged incident took place in a suite of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas in 2009.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went to the player's room, where he allegedly raped them anal, according to documents filed with the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo went to his knees after the alleged incident and told her that he was "99 percent a good guy" who was "one percent down".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the two had sex, but said it was consensual.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and took photos of her injuries in a hospital, but later entered into an out-of-court agreement because she was “fearful of retaliation” and worried about being “publicly humiliated.”
The 34-year-old said she is now trying to cancel the deal as she is still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of switching from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged incident and switched this summer in a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million deal to the Italian giant Juve.
Brexit: The UK would “eternally regret” the loss of car manufacturers
The UK would “forever regret” losing its status as the world’s leading automaker after Brexit, Economy Minister Greg Clark said.
He said it was "worrisome" that Toyota UK told the BBC that it would temporarily halt production at the Burnaston plant at Derby should the UK leave the EU.
“We need a deal,” Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of border delays on a no-deal Brexit could lead to job losses.
The Burnaston plant, which produces Toyota’s Auris and Avensis product lines, produced nearly 150,000 vehicles last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“I am convinced that in the event of an uncontrolled Brexit at the end of March, we will experience production stoppages at our plant,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s Managing Director in Burnaston.
Other UK automakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have also raised concerns about a tough EU exit without an agreement and its impact on cross-border trade.
For example, BMW says it will close its mini-factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns, according to the car manufacturers, are linked to risks within the supply chain in the event of a hard Brexit.
Toyota’s manufacturing facility is operated on a “just-in-time” basis, which means that the parts are delivered every 37 minutes by suppliers from both the UK and the EU to make the cars on-demand.
Should the UK leave the EU on March 29 without an agreement, there could be interruptions at the borders, which, according to the industry, could lead to delays and bottlenecks in the parts.
It was impossible for Toyota to maintain a stockpile at the Derbyshire plant that lasted more than a day, the company said, explaining why production had to be stopped.
Clark said May's Chequers plan on future relations with the EU was "precisely designed to avoid such border controls".
“We need a deal. We want the best deal that allows us, as I said, not only to enjoy the current success, but also to seize this opportunity,” he told BBC Radio 4.
“The findings not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers show that we need to be able to continue the very successful supply chains so far.”
Toyota could not specify how long production would have to be interrupted, but warned in the long term that additional costs would reduce the plant’s competitiveness and eventually lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been employed in Burnaston for 24 years and is the highest official of the Unite union at the plant, said that his members are increasingly concerned: “In my experience, these jobs will never come back once they are gone.
A government spokesman said: “We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.”
Trump's planned meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, according to the White House
Donald Trump's important meeting with deputy justice minister Rod Rosenstein could be postponed "for another week" as the dispute over Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversaw the work of Special Investigator Robert Mueller, who investigated Russia’s election meddling, links between Trump’s advisers and Russia, and a possible obstruction of justice by the president.
The question of whether Trump would fire the deputy justice minister and thereby jeopardize Mueller’s independence has been the subject of rumours in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein addressed the possibility of secretly recording his conversations with Trump as well as the president’s dismissal using the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
However, he went to the White House last Monday, while new reports of his alleged resignation became known.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was at the UN General Assembly in New York at that time, was announced for the upcoming Thursday,
Trump said he would prefer not to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid colliding with the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which both Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, accused him.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, further delaying the full Senate vote.
Trump’s spokeswoman, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “A date has not yet been set for this; it could be this week, but I can also imagine that it will be postponed by another week, given all the things that are currently going on with the Supreme Court.
It will show up, but I always like to keep the press up to date."
Some reporters would argue that Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10.
Moderator Chris Wallace asked her for the reason.
Sanders explained that the low frequency of the press conferences did not lie in an aversion to the TV reporters' "effect-chasing", but admitted: "But I would not deny that they are practicing effect-chasing."
She then claimed that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
The president is doing more question-and-answer rounds than any president before him,” she said, without providing any precise evidence: “We’ve looked at these numbers.”
There will still be press conferences, Sanders said, however, “when the press has the opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly questions, but far better than talking to me.
We try to do this often and you have seen that we have done this often in the last few weeks, which will take the place of the press conference if you can speak to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly accepts questions when he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Press conferences with him alone are rare.
In New York, the president may have shown why this is so when he made a run-off and sometimes bizarre appearance in front of assembled reporters.
Minister of Health writes about Brexit concerns to EU workers of the Scottish NHS
The Minister of Health addresses people from the EU-foreign who work in Scotland’s National Health Service (NHS) to express the country’s gratitude and wish to remain in the country even after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before the UK left the EU.
The Scottish government has already agreed to bear the cost of applying for a residence permit for EU citizens working in Scotland’s decentralised public service.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: “During the summer, the withdrawal negotiations between the UK and the EU have continued and decisions are expected this fall.
However, the UK government has also stepped up preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I am aware of the disturbing times these have to be for all of you.
That is why I would like to reiterate how much I value the contribution of each and every employee, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service and thus benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is full of your home and we would be delighted if you would stay here."
Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christion Abercrombie has undergone emergency surgery following a head injury he suffered Saturday in his 31-27 defeat against the Vanderbilt Commodores.
Rod Reed, the head coach of Tennessee State, told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before the half-time break.
“He came to the sideline and it just collapsed there,” Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff supplied Abercrombie with oxygen on the sidelines before putting him on a stretcher and being transported away for further investigation.
A Tennessee State spokesman told Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie left the surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "no details on the nature or extent of the injury are yet known" and Tennessee State is trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a so-called redshirt, plays for Tennessee State in his first season after moving from Illinois.
Before leaving the game on Saturday, he recorded a total of 5 tackles, increasing his total number to 18 tackles during the season.
Foreign investors will have to pay higher stamp duty for buying real estate in the UK
Investors from abroad will have to pay a higher stamp duty in the future for the purchase of real estate in the United Kingdom. The additional income is expected to benefit according to the new plans of the Conservative Party Homeless
This step aims to curb the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s campaign for young voters
The increase in stamp duty will affect all those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The Treasury Department expects up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million in revenue per year to help homeless people
Theresa May is announcing today that foreign investors will have to pay a higher stamp fee if you buy real estate in the UK, with the additional income to benefit the homeless.
This step is an attempt to curb Jeremy Corbyn’s success with young voters who promise to provide more affordable housing and target top earners.
The increase in stamp duty will be imposed on individuals and businesses who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, and the additional revenues will be added to the government's campaign against homelessness.
The surcharge, which will be levied in addition to the current stamp tax and including the increase introduced two years ago on second homes and residential properties for rent, could amount to up to three percent.
The Treasury Department expects additional revenues of up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year.
An estimated 13 percent of newly built properties in London are bought by investors who are not based in the UK, boosting prices and making it harder for first-time buyers to catch up in the real estate business.
Many wealthy areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become "ghost cities" due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the UK.
The new strategy follows just a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a stamp tax cut to allow more young people to own their first home.
He accused construction companies of keeping property prices high by buying land without using it, and urged Theresa May to give up quotas on affordable housing to end Britain’s “housing shame.”
Opposition leader Corbyn announced an eye-opening series of proposals for housing reforms ranging from a lease-price binding to a ban on evictions for no valid reason.
He also wants to give city councils more powers to build new homes.
May said: “Last year I said that I would dedicate my time as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream that life should be better from generation to generation.
And that means repairing our broken housing market.
The UK will always be open to people who want to live and work here and build a life.
However, it may not be right that it is as easy for individuals not living in the UK as it is for companies based abroad to buy real estate as it is for hard-working British citizens.
The dream of owning a home has become too far away for too many people, and the unworthiness of homelessness continues to be a problem.”
Jack Ross: ‘My biggest goal is to manage Scotland’
Jack Ross, the head of Sunderland, says his “greatest goal” is to become the manager of the Scottish team at some point.
The 42-year-old is enjoying the challenge of bringing new life to the club from north-east England, which is currently in third place in League One and lacks three points at the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St. Mirren back into the first Scottish league last season.
“I wanted to play as a player for my country.
I made it to the bank and that’s it,” Ross told BBC Scotland’s Sportssound.
“But as a child I have often seen Scotland play in Hampden with my father and that is something that always draws me back.
However, this opportunity would only come if I were successful in club management.”
Ross's predecessors in the role of manager of Sunderland include Dock Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of Alloa Athletic said he was not afraid to follow in the footsteps of such established names at such a club after having previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
My success will be measured by whether I can bring the club back to the Premier League.
Given the structure and possibilities in this club, he is undoubtedly part of the Premier League.”
“It’s not an easy task to get him there, but I would probably only consider my time here a success if I brought the club back there.”
Ross has a three-year management career, after a period as deputy manager at Dumbarton and a 15-month career as a coach at Hearts.
Then he helped Alloa recover from relegation to the third league and helped St. Mirren from the edge of relegation to win the championship the following season.
Ross says he is now feeling more comfortable than ever in his playing career with Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
“It was probably a real crossroads,” he recalls as he took over the responsibility of Alloa.
“I really think management was the right thing for me, more than just playing.
It sounds funny because I didn’t get a bad job, could live well with it and experienced some very pleasant high stages.
But playing can be hard.
There are a lot of things you have to go through every week.
I’m still doing this through stress and pressure in my job, but management feels right.
I’ve always wanted to manage and now I’m doing it. I’ve never felt so comfortable in my skin in my whole life as an adult.”
You can listen to the full interview on Sunday, September 30 between 12:00 and 13:00 BST at Sportssound on Radio Scotland.
The perfect time for a glass of beer is on Saturdays at 5:30 p.m., according to a study
The heatwave in the summer has missed a boost in revenue from Britain’s crispy pubs, while restaurant chains fell under greater pressure.
Pubs and bars saw revenue growth of 2.7 percent in July, but revenues at restaurants declined by 4.8 percent, according to statistics.
Peter Martin of CGA, who compiled the figures, said: “Persistent sunshine and England’s longer-than-expected ongoing participation in the World Cup meant that July followed a similar pattern to the previous June, but pubs still saw revenue increases of 2.8 percent.
The decline of 1.8 percent recorded by the restaurant industry in June continued to increase in July.
Pubs and bars with a focus on beverages showed by far the best performance, with area-adjusted revenue development rising higher than it fell at restaurants.
Pubs focusing on food also suffered in the sun, but not as drastically as the restaurant operators.
It seems like people just want to go out for a drink.
In the managed pubs and bars, beverage sales increased by 6.6 per cent per month, while food sales decreased by three per cent.
Paul Newman, of the RSM Recreation and Gastronomy Analysts, said: “These results continue the trend we’ve been seeing since the end of April.
The weather and the influence of important social or sporting events remain the biggest factors for sales in the out-of-home market.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to struggle with problems, but revenue declines of 4.8 percent over the previous year will be particularly painful in addition to continuing cost pressure.
The long, hot summer could not have come at a worse time for operators of companies focusing on food, and it remains to be seen whether the more moderate temperatures in August will provide the much-needed respite.”
Total revenue growth for pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the decline in brand rollouts.

One in five children owns secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents
A study shows that one in five children, some as young as 11 years old, have secret social media accounts that keep it secret from parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 pupils in secondary schools found an increase in so-called “Fake Insta” pages
The message fuels fears that sexual content will be posted
Twenty percent of students said they had a “main account” to show it to their parents
One in five children, some as young as 11 years old, creates social media accounts that can keep it secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 students at secondary schools showed a rapid increase in so-called “Fake Insta” accounts, a reference to the photo-sharing website Instagram.
The message fuels fears that sexual content will be shared.
Twenty percent of students said they have a clean “main account” that they can show their parents, but also private accounts.
A mother who bumped into the secret side of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager who urged others to “rape me.”
The study, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Independent Schools’ Headmasters’ and Headmasters’ Conference (HMC), found that 40 percent of 11- to 18-year-olds had two profiles, with half admitting to owning private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, chairman of HMC, said: “It’s disturbing that so many teens are being lured into creating online spaces where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle becomes the "Voice of Athletes" in the Scottish Sports Council
Eilidh Doyle was elected as a non-executive member of the Scottish Athletics Roofing Association.
Doyle is Scotland’s most honored athlete, and Chairman Ian Beattie described the election as a great opportunity for sports officials to benefit from their extensive international experience over the past decade.
“Eilidh is respected in the athletics community of Scotland, the UK and the world and we are sure that athletics in Scotland would greatly benefit from their election to the council,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I look forward to acting as the voice of the athletes and hope that I can make a real contribution and lead the sport in Scotland.”
The American, who won over 200 and 400 metres at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, claims a total of four Olympic gold medals and now often appears as a BBC expert, could no longer run after a temporary bleeding disorder.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't walk anymore.
The doctors say that no one can tell if or how far I will heal.
It was hard work, but I completely recovered, learned to run again and do agility exercises today!
Thank you for the encouraging news!”
An advertisement for milk pumps that compares mothers to cows creates excitement on the net
A manufacturer of milk pumps caused excitement on the net with a commercial clip in which breastfeeding mothers are compared to milking cows.
For the launch of the “world’s first low-noise portable milk pump”, consumer technology manufacturer Elvie has released a not-so-serious music video to emphasize the freedom that the pump gives to nursing mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a hay-filled barn with cows in the background to a song that contains lyrics like, “Yes, I’m milking myself, but you don’t see a cock on me” or “If you haven’t noticed, it’s not Euther, it’s my breasts.”
“Pump it out, pump it out, I feed the babies, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my ladies.”
However, the advertisement posted on the company’s Facebook page has sparked controversy on the net.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video encountered mixed reactions from viewers, many of whom say it was harmless to the dairy industry’s “fears.”
“It was a very bad decision to promote this product with cows.
Like us, they must become pregnant and give birth to a calf to produce milk, with the difference that their young will be taken away from them within a few days of birth.”
Elvie's milk pump fits discreetly into a still bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment read: “Identifiably traumatic for mother and baby.
But hey, why don’t we use them to promote a milk pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their babies?”
Another person added: “This is such a non-reality advertisement.”
Others defended the advertisement and a woman admitted that she found the song "urcomical".
“I think that’s a brilliant idea.
I would have bought one if I was still breastfeeding.
When I was pumping, I felt like a cow.
The clip is a bit crazy, but I'm not trying to overinterpret it.
This is a great product,” one person wrote.
Another person commented: “This is a funny advertisement aimed at mothers who use milk pumps (often at work or on toilets) and feel like ‘cows’.
This is not advertising for or against the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, the group reveals to women that everyone danced with the discreet pumps in their bra.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the realization that many women who use milk pumps claim to feel like dairy cows.
However, Elvie’s pump is completely silent, has no wires or hoses, and discreetly fits into a still bra, giving women the freedom to move, hold their babies or even go out during the pumping process.
Ana Balarin, Partner and ECD at Mother, said: “Elvie’s pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative market launch.
By comparing nursing mothers with dairy cows, we wanted to focus on milk pumps and all the associated challenges, and at the same time, in an entertaining and understandable way, present the incredible feeling of freedom that the new pump allows.
This is not the first time Elvie’s pump has hit the headlines.
During London Fashion Week for designer Marta Jakubowski, a double mother appeared on the catwalk while she was using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children were quietly and quietly taken to a tent town on the Texas border
The number of migrant children interned is as high as never before, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively equal, among other things, as tightened rhetoric and measures by the Trump administration have made it harder to accommodate children with caregivers.
Traditionally, most caregivers themselves were illegal immigrants and are now afraid to even become the target for deportation when they report to take a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential caregivers and other adult members of their household would have to give their fingerprints and share this data with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, told Congress that the authority had arrested dozens of people who had applied for care of unaccompanied minors.
The authorities later confirmed that 70 percent of the detainees had no previous criminal records.
“Almost 80 percent of people who are either a caregiver themselves or a member of a caregiver’s household are illegally staying in the country, and a large proportion of them are criminal aliens.
That’s why we will continue to track these people,” Albence said.
In order to be able to handle the cases of the children more quickly, the officials introduced new rules, which, according to accommodation staff, require some children to appear in court within a month instead of 60 days after detention, which was previously the standard.
Many will appear via video and not in person to appear before an immigration judge for their legal status.
In case of negative decisions, the person is quickly dismissed.
The longer these children remain in custody, the more likely it is, according to accommodation staff, as well as reports made known from the system in the past month, that they become anxious and depressed, which can lead to violent outbreaks or attempted outbreaks.
Defenders say these concerns are aggravated at a larger institution like Tornillo, as there are signs that a child is having problems that are easier to overlook due to their size.
They also explained that it can amplify traumas that many of the children are already suffering from if they are taken to a tent town without emotional preparation or enough time to say goodbye to friends.
Syria Calls on US, French and Turkish “Occupational Forces” to Withdraw Immediately
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, although the country’s civil war is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also deputy prime minister, said the foreign forces are illegally on Syrian soil under the pretext of fighting terrorism and are being “treated accordingly”.
“You must withdraw immediately and unconditionally,” he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the “war on terror is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions more have been displaced from their homes.
He said Damascus “will continue to fight this sacred battle until all Syrian territories are cleared” of both terrorist groups and “any illegal foreign presence.”
The United States has deployed some 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and advising both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs deployed against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 ground troops in the war-torn country.
Regarding the refugees, Moualem explained that the conditions for their return have been given, accusing "some Western countries" of "spreading irrational fears" that prevent refugees from returning home.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to make it possible to return home,” he said.
“They are politicizing a purely humanitarian matter.”
The United States and the European Union warned that no build-up assistance would be provided for Syria as long as there was no political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats said the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold of Idlib was an opportunity for political talks.
The deal between Russia and Turkey turned a broad-based offensive of the Russian-backed Syrian forces against the province of three million people.
Moualem stressed, however, that the agreement has “clear deadlines” and expressed his hope that military action will be taken against jihadists, including fighters of the Nusra Front allied with al-Qaeda, which will be “exterminated”.
UN Representative Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon be able to convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of government and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem cited the Syrian government's conditions for participation in the committee, declaring that its work should be limited to "revising the articles of the current constitution" and warning of interference.
Why Trump will win his re-election
With this logic, Trump would win his re-election in 2020 if, as many liberal spectators presumably hope, a resignation or scandal would end his presidency prematurely.
This would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic finale of a presidency of all time.”
So far, there are no signs that the audience is tired.
Since 2014, CNN’s best broadcast time switching rates have more than doubled to 1.05 million and MSNBC’s nearly tripled to 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen, Fox News averaged 2.4 million viewers at its best broadcast time, compared to 1.7 million four years ago. MSNBC’s “The Rachel Maddow Show” led the turn-on ratings with 3.5 million viewers on evenings with important news.
“It’s like a fire that magically attracts people because it’s something we don’t understand,” said Neal Bear, showrunner of the ABC drama series ‘Designated Survivor’ about a cabinet member who becomes president after an attack destroys the capitol.
Nell Scovell, an old-time comedy writer and author of the book “Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys’ Club” has a different theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he would choose Trump.
She asked him for the reason.
“He said, ‘Because he makes me laugh,’” Scovell told me.
The chaos is entertaining.
Of course, the stories from Washington, in contrast to everything that can be found on television, can determine the future of the principle decision on abortions Roe v. Wade, the possible reunification of families and the health of the global economy.
Turning off is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet it goes beyond being an informed citizen if one becomes aware of having already watched six hours of a round of experts discussing Bob Woodward’s use of sources from the so-called “deep background” for his book Fear, Paul Manafort’s 15,000-dollar self-made bomber jacket from ostrich leather, or Trump’s “Keeping Up on the Trump Post” effect.
I will never be able to see Super Mario with the same eyes again.
“A part of what he does makes it feel like a reality show he presents to you every night,” says Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the series ‘Three from Pfandhaus’, about Trump’s rotating cast and daily plot twists.

When I reached Fleiss this week, it was sunny 27 degrees outside his house on the north coast of the Hawaiian island of Kauai, but he crawled inside and watched MSNBC while simultaneously recording CNN.
He simply couldn’t get away from the screen, not when judiciary candidate Brett Kavanaugh was just about to stand before the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was at stake.
“I remember when we were doing all these crazy shows and people were saying, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Fleiss told me.
“I thought it was kind of a joke, but it turned out they were right.”

Donations flood the tightest races to win seats in congress in midterm elections
It’s little surprise that Pennsylvania’s 17th Electoral District is flooded with donations, thanks to the newly moved boundaries of the electoral districts that led to two incumbents standing in the race for the same seat.
The newly-designated suburban district in Pittsburgh is headed by Democrat Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb opposes another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th District of Pennsylvania, which overlaps strongly with the new 17th District.
The maps were re-drawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts violated the constitution and were manipulated in favor of Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district triggered an exchange of campaign funding between the major financial weapons of the parties, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a highly regarded special election in March around the state's 18th electoral district.
This seat was held over a decade by a Republican and Trump won there with a 20 percent lead.
Politicians give the Democrats an easy lead.
The U.S. reviewed El Salvador’s punishment for its support for China, but then pulled back.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing without encountering much resistance from Washington.
Trump held a friendly meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Valero in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until partners kicked out the Trump Organization’s management team.
U.S. State Department officials have decided to withdraw the heads of all U.S. foreign missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of “the recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan,” U.S. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
However, only in the case of El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, were penalties considered, including for drug control, development and economic aid.
The proposed penalties, including cuts in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings progressed, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity, which should follow a similar gathering in the previous year, and represented a step forward in efforts to keep migrants from moving toward the United States.
In mid-September, however, senior government officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, effectively ending consideration of punitive measures for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now scheduled to speak at the conference scheduled for mid-October, according to diplomats, to signal the importance the government is giving to the assembly.
The three U.S. diplomats have quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without further harsh announcements or sanctions from Washington.
A government spokesman for John Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats who agreed to comment on the internal meetings on condition of anonymity.
Their comments were confirmed by an external analyst close to the government, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
Learn from history
The next big surprise could be Special Investigator Robert Mueller’s report on Trump’s possible judicial disability, for which there is now sufficient evidence in the public eye.
Mueller is also reportedly investigating whether Trump’s campaign team conspired with Russia in his attack on the US election.
Should the Congressional majority change, Trump will face a body that will hold him accountable at the very moment he is preparing to step back in front of the voters; and possibly before a jury injury.
These are many ‘whens’ and I don’t want to say that the case of Donald Trump, or that of his European counterparts, is inevitable.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we must make decisions that will affect how long the fight will last.
In 1938, German officers were ready to carry out a coup against Hitler if the West had merely resisted him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We have failed, and missed a way to avoid the years of barbarism that followed.
The course of history revolves around such turning points and the unstoppable march of democracy is either accelerated or delayed.
Americans are facing a number of such turning points.
What do we do if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who decides on the future of Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been in Devil’s Kitchen since this newspaper reported last year that he proposed to secretly record the president and speculated that he was above unsuitable for office.
Rosenstein denies the New York Times.
“How will we respond if the newly ordered FBI investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if he is confirmed in the office despite credible allegations of sexual abuse and misrepresentation?
And above all, will we vote in the midterm elections for a congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we fail in these tests, we have a long winter ahead of us.
But I don’t think we will fail because of what I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same regime that once occupied my embassy.
She survived, immigrated to America and sent me 60 years later to light Sabbath candles on the table with the hook cross.
How can I not be optimistic about this legacy?”

Graham Dorrans from the Rangers optimistic before the game against Vienna
The Rangers receive Rapid Wien on Thursday in the knowledge that a victory against the Austrians after the impressive draw against Villareal in Spain at the beginning of the month will put them in a good position for the qualification of Group G of the Europa League.
Due to a knee injury, Graham Dorrans could not appear up to the 2-2 draw against Villareal, but he believes the Rangers can use this result as a springboard for bigger.
“This was an important point for us, as Villareal is very good,” said the 31-year-old.
We went into the game with the conviction that we could make something out of it and we drove home with one point.
Maybe we could have won in the end, but overall a draw was probably a fair result.
They probably dominated in the first half, but we worked hard in the second half and were the better team.
Thursday will be another great European evening.
Hopefully we’ll get three points, but it’s going to be a tough game as they scored a good result in the last game, but I’m sure we can get through that with the audience behind us and achieve a positive result.
Last year was definitely difficult, with everything that happened with my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but now there is some kind of well-being factor.
The team is good and the guys are really good at it; the training is good.
Hopefully we can look forward now, leave the last season behind and be successful."
Fear of retirement leads to sleepless nights in women.
Although the survey participants knew exactly how to care for them, few spoke to their family members about it.
Approximately half of the participants in the Nationwide study reported talking to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they don’t take the necessary steps to lead the conversation,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of nationwide life insurance.
You should start with this.
Talk to your spouse and children: you can’t prepare your family to care for you if you don’t express your wishes in time.
Work with your counselor and family to discuss where and how you want to be cared for, as these decisions can be a significant factor in determining costs.
Bring your financial advisor on board: your advisor can also help you find a way to finance these expenses.
Your financial decisions for long-term care can include traditional nursing insurance, hybrid capital-generating life insurance to help cover these costs, or self-insurance with your own assets – as long as you own the money.
Work out your legal documents: Turn off legal disputes at the last minute.
Set up a precautionary authority so that you can entrust a trusted person to monitor your medical care and ensure that the health care professionals comply with your wishes if you are unable to express them yourself.
Consider also a proxy for your finances.
You choose a trusted person who makes financial decisions for you and ensures that your bills are paid should you not be able to do so.
Don’t forget the details: Imagine that your older parent has a medical emergency and is on the way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medication intake or allergies?
Write down these details in a written plan so that you are ready.
“It’s not just the financial issues that matter. Who are the doctors?” asked Martin.
“What is the drug treatment?”
Who takes care of the dog?

Man in Ilfracombe shot multiple times with air rifle
A man was shot multiple times with an air rifle when he went home after work among friends.
The victim, a man in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, belly and hand.
Officials described the shootings, which took place around 02:30 British time, as a “willful act.”
The victim did not see the attacker.
His injuries were not life-threatening and the police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a strong earthquake and a tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, authorities said, with the death toll expected to rise.
Due to the failure of communication systems, aid workers were unable to obtain information from the Donggala government district, an area north of Palu, which is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated in Palu after the disaster.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi Province and is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was just celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a government district in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi that extends over a coastal stretch of over 300 km (180 miles) in length.
In the government district, an administrative unit below the province, lived an estimated 299.200 people in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main sources of revenue for the economy of Central Sulawesi, especially the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but it mainly focuses on Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been victims of earthquakes and tsunamis several times over the past 100 years, according to Indonesia’s Disaster Protection Authority.
In 1938, more than 200 people were killed by a tsunami that destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
West Donggala was hit by a tsunami in 1996 that killed nine people.
Indonesia is located on the seismic Pacific Ring of Fire, and is regularly plagued by earthquakes.
Here are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A strong earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra triggered a tsunami on December 26 that hit 14 countries and killed 226,000 people in the coastal areas of the Indian Ocean, nearly half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes shook the west coast of Sumatra between the end of March and the beginning of April.
Hundreds of people died on the Nias Islands off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake shook the south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami that hit the south coast and claimed nearly 700 lives.
2009: An earthquake of magnitude 7.6 struck the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake shook one of the Mentawai islands off Sumatra, triggering a tsunami of up to 10 meters high that destroyed dozens of villages and claimed about 300 lives.
2016: A light earthquake shook the government district of Pidie Jaya in Aceh, causing destruction and panic when people were reminded of the destruction of the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time no tsunami was triggered, but over 100 people died due to collapsed buildings.
2018: Severe earthquakes hit the tourist-popular Indonesian island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people on the northern side of the island.
The quake destroyed thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily stranded on the island.
Sarah Palin's son arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and former candidate for the vice-president's office, was arrested on charges of bodily injury.
The 29-year-old Palin from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, obstruction of reporting domestic violence and resistance to state violence, according to a report released Saturday by Alaska Police.
According to the police report, he took the phone from a friend when she wanted to contact the police.
According to KTUU, Palin is in custody at the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and a $500 bail has been raised.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where when asked about his plea, he replied with “not guilty, certainly,” the network said.
Palin is accused of committing three Class A irregularities, which can be punished with up to one year in prison and a fine of up to $250,000.
He is also charged with a Class B irregularity, which can be punished with a day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently pending before the Veteran’s Court of Alaska.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, obstruction of reporting a crime and possession of weapons under the influence of narcotics in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of hitting her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran organizations in 2016 after she attributed her son’s behavior to a post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of his time in Iraq.
Tsunami after earthquake in Indonesia: hundreds dead
At least 384 people died after an earthquake shook the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude quake triggered a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been interrupted and it is expected that the number of deaths will increase in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred just off the coast of Central Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
Videos circulate on social networks from the time the wave hit the land.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal Prosecutor Calls for Rare Death Penalty for Suspects in New York Terror Attack
The New York State Prosecutor's Office is calling for the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the defendant in the New York City terror attack that killed eight people, a rare punishment that has not been imposed in the state since 1953 for a federal crime.
Saipov, 30, is accused of using a rented pick-up from the construction market chain Home Depot for a terrorist attack in October, during which he climbed on a bike path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan while passing pedestrians and cyclists.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov “targetedly” killed the eight Ofer and “consciously” inflicted serious bodily injury, according to the statement of intent for the death penalty claim filed in the southern district of New York.
Both charges could be punishable by death, according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal jury trial of Saipov submitted a 22-point indictment, which includes eight homicide charges against the background of organized crime, usually used by state prosecutors in cases of organized crime, as well as an indictment of force of force and destruction of the driver.
The attack requires “fundamental planning and intent,” according to the prosecutors, who described the manner in which Saipov carried out the act as “abhorrent, cruel and corrupt.”
Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov inflicted damage, pain and losses on the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco.
Five of the victims were Argentinian tourists.
For more than a decade, the Southern District of New York has not pursued a case with the aim of demanding the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers and eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was carried out in New York for a federal offense was in 1953 in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who had been convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union two years before.
Both Rosenbergs were executed on June 19, 1953 with the electric chair.
Saipov, who was born in Uzbekistan, testified in the days and months after the attack of lack of remorse, according to court documents.
He told investigators that he felt good about what he had done, the police said.
Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to do so after watching videos of ISIS on his phone, according to the indictment.
He also demanded that the ISIS flag be hung in his hospital room.
He pleaded not guilty in all 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the public defenders representing Saipov, said they were "of course disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
“We believe that the decision to demand the death penalty, instead of a plea in exchange for a life sentence without the possibility of dismissal, will only prolong the trauma that all involved suffer,” Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked the indictment not to demand the death penalty.
A member of the Conservative Party calls for NIGEL FARAGE to postpone the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage vowed to mobilize “the power of the people” today during a protest action in the framework of the Tories Conference.
The former UKIP leader said politicians “must feel the pressure” of the Eurosceptics, while a Theresa May party MP suggested that Farage should lead the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative back-banker Peter Bone told protesters in Birmingham that the UK would be “already out” if Farage were Brexit minister.
The challenge faced by May in reconciling her deeply contested party was exacerbated by the fact that members of her party, who are in favour of staying in the EU, took part in a separate demonstration against the Brexit that took place in the city.
The prime minister has trouble keeping her Chequers compromise plan on track despite attacks from Brexit supporters, Brexit opponents and the EU.
Allies insisted that despite the backlash, she should continue to try to negotiate a deal with Brussels, thus forcing Eurosceptics and the opposition Labour Party to choose between her package and the “chaos”.
Bone explained at the ‘Leave Means Leave’ demonstration in Solihull that ‘Chequers on the garbage’ belongs.
He suggested that Farage should be appointed as a peer and should be given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he was responsible for it, we would already be out,” he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: ‘I will stand for Brexit, but Chequers belongs to the garbage.’
He stressed his opposition to the EU: “We have not fought in world wars to be submissive.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Bone denounced allegations that public opinion had changed since the 2016 referendum: “The idea that the British people have changed their minds and now want to stay in the EU is completely wrong.”
Conservative Brexit advocate Andrea Jenkyns was also at the demonstration and told reporters: “I’m just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
“The compromise is unpopular in the public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular in our own party and with our activists who actually go through the streets and make sure we get elected.
“Please give up Chequers and start listening.”
In a sharp message to May, she continued: ‘Prime Ministers keep their jobs if you keep their promises.’
Farage said in a speech that politicians need to “feel the pressure” if they are just about to cheat the 2016 referendum decision.
“This is now a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class,” Farage said.
“They’re trying to cheat on Brexit and that’s why we’re here today to tell them, ‘You can’t get away with it.’
He added: “I want you to let our political class, which is just about to betray Brexit, feel the pressure.
“We are mobilizing the power of the people of this country who helped us win the referendum and will never come to rest unless we are an independent, self-managed, proud United Kingdom.”
At the same time, Brexit opponents marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A few activists waved banners from the Tories Against Brexit grouping, a group of Brexit opponents within May’s party that was launched over the weekend.
Lord Adonis, a peer of the Labour Party, joked about the Tories who had security issues with a party app at the opening of the conference.
“These are the people who tell us that they can make sure that the IT systems, like all the technology for Canada Plus Plus, are there for the smooth border, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” said Adonis.
“This is a farce.
There is simply no good Brexit,” he added.
Warren Plans to ‘Precisely Examine’ Presidential Candidacy
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would “examine the presidential candidacy closely” after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future at a meeting with voters in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, an outspoken critic of President Donald Trump, is currently running for re-election to the Senate against Massachusetts's Republican MP Geoff Diehl, who was vice president of Trump's Massachusetts campaign team in 2016.
She was the center of speculation that she could challenge Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke has been her 36th meeting with voters in the so-called Town Hall format since Trump took office.
One of the attendees asked her if she wanted to run for president.
Warren responded that it would be time for women to “go to Washington and repair our broken government and that includes women at the top.”
Arrest after killing LSU players Sims
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, announced on Saturday that a suspect in the case of the deadly shooting of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims was arrested on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced at a press conference that 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson had been arrested at 11 a.m. Eastern Time.
They posted a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help identifying the man to be seen on the footage.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot on Friday morning near the Southern University campus.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and died as a result of this injury," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday, according to the sports media portal 247sports.
Wayde tried to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being at the scene and possessing a gun and shooting at the Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without further incident and taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
The two-meter Sims grew up in Baton Rouge and played in 32 games with 10 starts in the last season, averaging 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Grand Prix of Russia: Lewis Hamilton approaches the World Championship after his team left him the victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas landed in qualifying ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it was clear that Mercedes stablelords would play a major role in the race.
From the pole position Bottas got a good start and it was almost as if he was leading Hamilton as he defended his position in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack his teammates.
Vettel first went into the box and left Hamilton in traffic at the end of the field, a decision that should have been decisive.
The Mercedes went into the box a lap later and landed behind Vettel, but Hamilton overtook him after a narrow wheel-on-wheel maneuver in which the Ferrari driver reluctantly unlocked the inside, with the risk of holding on after two moves to defend the third corner.
Max Verstappen started on one of the backs of the field and was in seventh place on his 21st birthday after the end of the first round.
He was then the fastest for much of the race as he held on to his tyres to finish quickly and overtake Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
He eventually entered the box in the 44th round and failed to take a step in the remaining eight rounds, while Raikkonen finished fourth.
It was a difficult day as Valtteri made an excellent performance all weekend and acted like a real gentleman when he was supposed to pass me by.
The team has done an excellent job of achieving a double win,” said Hamilton.
A case of really bad body language
President Donald Trump made fun of Senator Dianne Feinstein at an election campaign event on Saturday, insisting she hadn’t passed on the letter from Christine Blasey Ford, in which she accused Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse, to the press.
At the event in West Virginia, President Ford did not directly address the Senate Judiciary Committee, but commented that the proceedings in the Senate show that people are “bad, vicious and dishonest.”
“One thing that could happen and the wonderful thing that has happened in the Senate over the last few days is when you see the anger when you see people who are angry and mean and vicious and dishonest,” he said.
“If you look at the leaks and say, ‘Oh, I wasn’t.
It wasn't me."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, were you responsible for the leak?
Think about your answer...Publish the document - "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no, no, no.
I didn’t publish it.”
Okay, one moment, please.
Do we... No, we didn’t publish it,” he added, imitating the voice of the senator.
Feinstein's letter was credited with Ford's allegations against Kavanaugh in July and was published in early September, but Feinstein disputes that the leak originated from her office.
"I have not concealed Dr. Ford's allegations, I have not published your story," Feinstein told the committee.
“She asked me to keep the letter secret, and I answered her request for secrecy.”
Their denial did not seem to go well with the president, who said on Saturday night at the campaign event: “I’ll tell you one thing, that was a very bad body language.
Maybe she didn’t, but that was the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
In his ongoing defense of the judge candidate, accused of sexual assault by three women, the Democrats claimed they would use the allegations for their own purposes.
“They are determined to regain power by all means.
One sees the commonality, the wickedness, they don’t care who they hurt when they get under the wheels in order to retain power and control,” the president said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars made good on Friday's Elite League defeat against the Belfast Giants by a 5:3 win in the return match in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants headed early with two goals, after hits from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the balance to the home team before Dwyer regained the Giants' lead.
Francois Bouchard equalized for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory with two goals.
This was for the men of Adam Keefe, who unexpectedly beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night, the third loss in the Elite League this season.
This was the fourth match of the season between the two teams, with the Giant winning the previous three games.
Dwyer's opening goal came in the fourth minute after 3:35 minutes after a presentation by Kendall McFaull. Four minutes later, David Rutherford delivered the presentation when Beauvillier expanded the lead.
In this exciting opening phase, Sullivan brought the home team back into the game after 13:10 minutes, before Matt Marquardt helped Cownie to his clearing goal after 15:16 minutes.
Dwyer secured the lead of the Giants before the halftime break when he scored his second goal of the evening just before the end of the first half.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard again matched with a power-play hit in the 28th minute.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen lead Dundee for the first time in the game late in the second half, and Nielsen secured his team the victory with a fifth goal after just under half of the second half.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will play at home next Friday at Milton Keynes Stadium.
Air traffic controller died after making sure that hundreds of people on a plane escape from the earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller is celebrated as a hero after he found his death to safely launch a plane with hundreds of people on board.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after the island of Sulawesi was shaken on Friday by a devastating earthquake that triggered a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks are still felt in the region and many people are trapped under rubble in the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues have fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the highly fluctuating control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He stayed to make sure that flight 6321 of Batik Air, which was on the runway at the time, could safely take off.
He then jumped out of the tower when he thought he was crashing.
Agung later died in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, a spokesman for the Indonesian air security service, said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australia’s ABC News.
“We deployed a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to bring it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter could arrive in Palu.
We are deeply affected by this news," he added.
At the same time, authorities feared that the death toll could rise to several thousand. The country's disaster protection authority said that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
“The number is expected to increase as many bodies are still under the rubble, while others cannot be reached,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves up to 6 meters high have devastated Palu, which will hold a mass burial on Sunday.
Military and commercial airplanes bring aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute a new ambulance comes with dead people.
Clean drinking water is scarce.
Supermarkets are looted everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is rushing to help survivors, but we don’t know what they’ll find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday, saying in a speech to the country’s military: “I ask you to work day and night to complete all the tasks that come with the evacuation.
“Are you ready?” said CNN.
Indonesia was already shaken this year by earthquakes in Lombok, which killed more than 550 people.
Air Niugini Reports Missing Airplane Crash in Micronesia
The airline that carried out the flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia is now reporting a missing person after initially claiming that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that they could not say anything about the stay of a passenger until Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew members after the plane crashed into the water while attempting to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Officials said seven people had to be taken to a hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday, but were in a stable condition.
The exact cause and course of the accident remained unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both stated that the plane landed in the lagoon shortly before the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane flew over the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane landed very flat.
“That’s a very good thing,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes explained that he and others were able to wade through deep hip water to the emergency exits on the sides of the sinking plane.
He said the flight attendants panicked and screamed and suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors working near a dock improvement were rushing with an inflatable boat to help bring people to shore before the plane sank in about 30 meters (100 feet) of deep water.
According to the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people died in the crashes of airlines registered in Papua New Guinea, but none of them affected Air Niugini.
Analyst reconstructs the course of the night in which a woman was burned alive
The prosecution concluded its trial on Saturday in the re-trial of a case in which a man is accused of banishing a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett said for hours as an expert in the field of information evaluation.
He explained to the jury how he used phone calls to reconstruct the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on her death night.
Rowlett said she received location data from various phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers on the evening of her death, contradicting his previous statements, according to the newspaper Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his phone was with Chambers during the period he stated to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, police spoke with Sanford.
Sanford appeared on the witness stand on Saturday, saying he had not been in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis had told the truth when he claimed to have been at Sanford’s pick-up that night, Sandford said he had lied “because my pick-up was in Nashville.”
Another objection was that Tellis stated that she had known Chambers for two weeks at the time of her death.
Cell phone records, however, indicated that they had known each other for a week.
Rowlett explained that some time after Chambers' death, Tellis unlocked his phone's messages, calls and contact information.
“He took them out of his life,” Hale said.
The defense is expected to begin its pleadings on Sunday.
The judge assumes that the proceedings will then be brought before the jury on that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip hop?
A hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling its music with positive messages.
The High Breed of Bristol claim that hip hop has distanced itself from its roots of political message and social engagement.
They want to go back to its roots and make socially conscious hip hop again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common recently experienced a renaissance in the UK by artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?!
New York babysitter sues couple over 'racist' text message
A New York babysitter sued a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a misdirected message from her mother complaining that she was “another black woman.”
The couple denied being racist and compared the litigation to “extortion.”
Two-time mother Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman expressed her shock when she found out that the new midwife, Giselle Maurice, was black when she entered her first working day in 2016.
“NOW WITHOUT WITH WITH WITH WITH WITH WITH WITH WITH WITH WITH WITH WITH WITH WITH WITH WITH WITH WITH WITH WITH WITH WITH WITH WITH WITH WITH WITH WITH WITH WITH WITH WITH WITH WITH WITH WITH WITH WITH WIT
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent the message to Maurice twice.
After recognising her fake pass, Plasco-Flaxman released Maurice, claiming that the open-minded African-American midwife had done a bad job and was expecting a Filipina instead, according to the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for her workday and then sent home with an Uber.
Now Maurice sues the couple for compensation for the dismissal, claiming compensation for the $350 per day she was supposed to last over six months for the job she had originally been booked for, but without a contract, and for which she would have lived with the couple.
“I want to show you, look, you don’t do that,” she told the newspaper on Friday, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple rejected the racism allegations, arguing that firing was the sensible step, as they feared Maurice could no longer be trusted after insulting them.
“My wife sent her something she didn’t want to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists,” Joel Plasco told the Post.
“But would you entrust your children to someone who was rude to them, even if it was by accident?
Your newborn baby?
Come on."
Plasco compared the litigation to a “extortion” and said his wife was expecting a baby in just two months and was “in a difficult situation.”
“Do you want to care about such a person?
That’s not very nice,” added the investment banker.
As the litigation continues, the couple was quickly condemned in public and denounced on social media, where they were criticized for their behavior and logic.
The publishers of Paddington feared that readers would not identify with a talking bear, reveals a new letter
Karen Jankel, daughter of author Michael Bond, who was born shortly after the adoption of the book, said about the letter: “It’s hard to get into someone who reads it for the first time before it’s published.
Today, it’s very funny with our knowledge of Paddington’s huge success.”
She said her father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before being inspired by a small toy bear to write the children's book, would have had no problem with it if his work had been rejected, adding that the 60th anniversary of its publication after his death last year was "bitter sweet."
She explained that her father was secretly proud of Paddington’s success, which she describes as a “very important family member.”
“He was a very quiet man and did not brag,” said Jankel.
“Because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a child doing something special: you’re proud, even if it wasn’t really your own performance.
I think he saw Paddington's success that way.
Although he invented and created it, he always gave Paddington himself the responsibility for his success."
My daughter died and I had to say goodbye to her over the phone
After the landing, her daughter was taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where the doctors tried in vain to save her life.
“Nad called regularly to say that it looked really bad and that the doctors gave her little chance,” said Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then I got a call from Nad telling me that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said to her, “Tashi, I love you so much, my dear.”
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications that the doctors gave her to keep her heart pumping slowly sounded off and left her body.
She had died just before and this was the moment when everything went down.
I couldn’t do anything but wait while I knew what was going on.
I couldn’t scream or cry because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by families and other people.
I really had to break up.”
Finally, Ednan-Laperouse, now grieving for the loss of her daughter, went on board with the other passengers, who were unaware of what she was going through.
“No one knew,” she said.
I had lowered my head and tears ran over my cheeks all the time.
It’s hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I felt this overwhelming feeling of sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Saddened women hang cards to prevent suicide on bridges
Two women who have lost loved ones through suicide try to keep others from taking their lives.
On a bridge in Wales, Sharon Davis and Kelley Humphreys hung up maps with inspiring messages and telephone numbers for consulting centers.
Davis’ son Tyler was 13 years old when he began suffering from depression and was just 18 when he committed suicide.
“I don’t want parents to have to feel the way I feel every day,” she said.
The 45-year-old Davis, who lives in Lydney, explained that her son was on the verge of a promising career as a chef and he had a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew him for his smile.
Everyone said that his smile could illuminate a room.”
However, he quit his job before his death because he was “in a really dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler’s body was found after the suicide of his 11-year-old brother.
Davis said, “I’m always afraid that this could have a consequence.”
Davis designed the maps “to show people that there are people you can go to and talk to, even if it’s a friend.
Don’t be silent, you have to talk about it.”
Humphreys, who has been friends with Davies for years, lost her partner Mark, with whom she had been dating for 15 years, shortly after his mother died.
“He didn’t say he felt depressed or depressed,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
On Christmas day, he was at the bottom, and when the children unpacked their gifts, he didn't see their eyes or anything."
She said that his death was a great trauma for her, but that they had to go through it: “It’s a huge hole in the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we all need to continue and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future in the limelight as the FBI begins investigations
“I thought if we could actually get something like that, what he was asking for, so a timely and limited investigation, then maybe we could get a little bit of agreement,” Flake said on Saturday, fearing that the committee would “break apart” in the party political deadlock.
Why did Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters refuse to investigate the FBI?
Their reluctance can be attributed solely to the timing.
The midterm elections on November 6th are only five weeks away, and if the Republicans were to cut back as expected, they would have been significantly weakened in their attempts to elect their husband to the country's highest court.
George W. Bush grabbed the phone to call Senators and convince them to support Kavanaugh, who had worked for Bush in the White House and met his wife Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI submits its report?
There is a vote in the Senate, which currently seats 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear if Kavanaugh can unite at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to decide on voting equality and confirm him for the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean survivors ‘sinks’ under Kim
The number of North Korean survivors to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean politician.
Park Byeong-seug, which relies on data from the South Korean Ministry of Reunification, explained that last year 1,127 survivors were registered, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park cited tighter border controls between North Korea and China, as well as higher prices of human smugglers as the main factors.
Pyongyang did not comment publicly.
The vast majority of North Korean survivors will eventually be offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee over China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Korean states.
China sees the survivors as illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often returns them by force.
Relations between the North and the South, which are technically still at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the two heads of state met in Pyongyang for talks, which revolved around the discontinued denuclearisation negotiations.
This came as a result of the historic meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June, where they generally agreed to work on a denuclearized Korean peninsula.
On Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the U.S. of sanctions for the lack of progress.
"Without being able to trust the United States, we have no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances it is impossible for us to disarm unilaterally first," Mir Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he is not suitable for the office at the Supreme Court
Minority leader in the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi called judge candidate Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was "characterically unsuitable" for the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t deny the impression that a woman who acted in this way would have been labeled ‘hysterical’,” Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh’s statement before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied all accusations that he sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when both were teenagers.
During his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional; sometimes he almost yelled and was about to burst into tears as he spoke of his family and his high school time.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats on the committee, calling the allegations against him a “gross and coordinated murder of reputation” organized by liberals angry at Hillary Clinton’s lost 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believes Kavanaugh's statement proves he can't serve in the Supreme Court because it shows he was biased toward Democrats.
“I think he declared himself inadequate with these statements and the way he treated the Clintons and the Democrats,” she said.
Pelosi hesitated when asked if she would try to remove Kavanaugh from office should he be confirmed and the Democrats should win the majority in the House of Representatives.
“I’m going to say so much: if he doesn’t tell Congress or the FBI the truth, then he’s not only unsuitable for the Supreme Court, but also for his current position as a judge,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Federal Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C.
Pelosi said she was concerned as a democrat about Kavanaugh's possible decisions against the Affordable Care Act or the abortion principle decision Roe v. Wade, as he is judged as a conservative judge.
In his hearings, Kavanaugh omitted questions about whether he would revise certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
“We don’t need any hysterical, biased person going to this court and expecting us to say, ‘Oh, that’s not wonderful,’” Pelosi said.
Women need to use it as a weapon.
It’s a sincere hate speech, months and years of boiling anger and it doesn’t get out without crying.
“We cry when we get angry,” Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think that’s rare, and you?”
She continued: “I was helped a lot by a woman who was a manager somewhere and said she also cried when she got angry but developed a technique. When she got angry and started crying, she said to the person to whom she said, “You might think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry."
And then she just keeps talking.
I thought that was genius.”
Tears are allowed as a valve for anger, in part because they are completely misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories is of a former job, in a male-dominated office, where one day I was crying over an indescribable rage and being packed by an older woman, an undercooled manager I was always a little scared of, and dragged into a staircase.
“Never let them see you crying,” she told me.
“They don’t know you’re stinking.
They think you’re sad and will be content with themselves because they believe you went to the substance.”
Patricia Schroeder, then a congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential nominations.
In 1987, when Hart was caught aboard a ship named Monkey Business in an extramarital affair and then withdrew his candidacy, the deeply frustrated Schroeder thought that there was no reason not to consider the idea of the presidential candidacy himself.
“That wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” she told me 30 years later with a laugh.
There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called the situation “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.”
As the campaign was already advanced, she lagged behind in fundraising and swore not to run if she didn’t get $2 million.
It was a hopeless fight.
She found that some of her supporters who donated $1000 to men only supported her campaign with $250.
“Do they think I’ll get a discount?” she asked herself.
In her speech announcing not to launch an official campaign, she was so overwhelmed by her emotions, gratitude for her supporters, frustration about the system that made raising funds and direct addressing voters instead of delegates so difficult, as well as the anger over sexism, that she resisted the tears.
“You could have assumed that I had suffered a nervous breakdown,” Schroeder recalls the press reactions.
“You could have thought that the handkerchief manufacturer Kleenex was my sponsor.
I remember wondering what they would write on my gravestone.
"She cried?"
Why Beijing Could Benefit from U.S.-China Trade War
The opening ointments of the US-China trade war were daunting. Although the battle is far from over, Beijing could benefit from a ditch between the countries in the long run, my experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump fired the first warning shot earlier this year when he imposed penalties on major Chinese exports, including solar cells, steel, and aluminum.
The most significant escalation took place this week with new penalties on goods worth $200 billion, effectively affecting half of all goods imported from China into the United States.
Beijing retaliated in the same way each time, recently levying punitive tariffs of five to ten percent on US goods worth $60 billion.
China has sworn to respond to any U.S. action and it is unlikely that the world’s second-largest economic power will soon stumble.
Moving Washington to deflect would mean giving in, but a public nod to the United States would be far too disgraceful for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Nevertheless, experts believe that if Beijing plays its cards well, China can benefit from the effects of the trade war in the long run by reducing the mutual dependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a swift political decision in either Washington or Beijing could create the conditions for economic turmoil in both countries is actually much more dangerous than many observers have realized before,” says Abigail Grace, a research fellow at the Center for New American Security think tank in Asia.
Syria is “ready” for the return of refugees, says Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and asks for help to rebuild the country devastated by the seven-year war.
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that conditions in the country are improving.
“Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and safer thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government is rebuilding the areas destroyed by terrorists in order to restore normality.
All conditions are now given for the voluntary return of refugees to the country, which they had to leave due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian government welcomes help to rebuild the devastated country.
However, he stressed that it would not accept conditional assistance from countries that had supported the uprising.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europa won the 2018 Ryder Cup and defeated Team USA with a finish score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National near Paris.
The United States has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won back the crown after the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn reached the 14.5 points it needed to defeat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who had problems over much of the tournament, sank his slack on the 16th track (Par 3) in the water and lost to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari was able to shine in all his rounds and became one of 4 players to score a 5-0-0 since the tournament began in its current format in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was defeated 5:4 by the player with the lowest ranking in Team Europe, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
The world's best-ranked player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2-1 to England's Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
Spanish Sergio Garcia, a veteran of eight Ryder Cups, became the best European Ryder Cup player of all time with 25.5 career points.
“I usually don’t cry, but today I couldn’t hold back.
It was a difficult year.
I am so grateful that Thomas chose me and believed in me.
I’m so happy to win back the cup.
It’s about the team and I’m happy to have made a contribution,” said the emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He continues the torch to his compatriot John Rahm, who won against American golf legend Tiger Woods 2:1 in the singles on Sunday.
“I’m so incredibly proud to have beaten Tiger Woods that I’ve been watching on TV since I was a child,” Rahm said.
Woods lost all his four games in France and now has a Ryder Cup record of 13-21-3.
A strange statistic for one of the greatest players of all time, who has won 14 important titles and is only surpassed by Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had trouble finding the fairways all weekend, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who performed high-profile performances throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk said after a disappointing performance of his team: “I’m proud of the guys, they’ve fought.
There was a time this morning when we had put pressure on Europe.
We didn't do anything about it.
Hats off to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All of his 12 players performed well.
We’ll regroup, I’ll talk to the PGA America and our Ryder Cup committee and we’ll look forward.
I love these 12 guys and I’m proud to be their captain.
You have to pull the hat.
We were defeated.”
