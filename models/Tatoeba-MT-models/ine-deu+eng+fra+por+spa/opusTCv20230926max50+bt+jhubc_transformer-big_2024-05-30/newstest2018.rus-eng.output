Russian President Vladimir Putin has signed a law on the introduction of administrative responsibility for violation of the time and order of payment of goods (works, services) when carrying out purchases for state and municipal needs.
This law is designed to solve the very acute problem of non-fulfilment of their obligations by customers in the implementation of public and municipal procurement.
Two years ago, the situation where entrepreneurs could not receive payment for already executed state and municipal contracts was widespread.
At the same time, the President of Russia instructed the Prosecutor General’s Office to take the problem under special control.
Because the businessmen themselves could not cope with dishonest customers who concluded unfunded contracts, tried in every way to evade the commitments made to pay and included illegal terms in the contracts.
The problem was systemic in the country as a whole.
Since 2015, in order to protect the rights of entrepreneurs to receive payment for public orders, the prosecutor’s office has submitted 9.7 thousand submissions, as a result of their consideration, 4,5 thousand officials have been brought to disciplinary responsibility, 533 administrative officials have been appointed to investigative bodies for organizing procedural checks, 75 materials have been submitted to them.
As a result, debts to entrepreneurs in the amount of more than 66 billion rubles were repaid.
And these huge amounts have accumulated far from being the result of the non-payment of multi-billion contracts.
Numerous, systematic delays in the payment of services to entrepreneurs for far more modest amounts have led to fabulous debts.
This is a typical case.
The head of a small company won a contest for the provision of social transport services for several million rubles.
The man invested all his working funds, fully fulfilled the obligations, but did not receive the money on time.
The result is a growing financial coma of debts on salaries, taxes, and loans that would have led to bankruptcy if the entrepreneur had not sought help from the prosecutor’s office.
In a number of regions, the problem has now been leveled as much as possible.
However, as of the first half of 2017, the total amount of debt under state and municipal contracts identified by the prosecutors of the Russian Federation entities amounted to about 27.4 billion rubles.
In regions where debt indicators continue to reach critical values, the Prosecutor’s Office operates in a manual anti-crisis management mode.
The Attorney General personally holds visits with representatives of the local authorities, at which all violations disclosed by the prosecutors are dealt with and measures taken to remedy them immediately.
Such operational meetings have already been held in Yaroslavl and Yekaterinburg this year.
Qualitatively to improve the payment discipline of public contractors will be able to implement the Federal Law No. 189-FZ "On Amendments to the Code of the Russian Federation on Administrative Offences in the part of establishing the administrative responsibility of the contractor's officials for violation of the time and order of execution"
The draft law was developed by the Ministry of Economic Development of Russia at the initiative of the Prosecutor General’s Office.
The new law will supplement the Code of the Russian Federation on administrative offences with an article, which provides for a fine of 30 thousand to 50 thousand rubles for violation of the term and procedure of payment of goods, works and services in state and municipal procurement.
And if an official has already been subjected to administrative punishment for a similar offence, then he is expected to be disqualified for a period of one to two years.
All prosecutors of the subjects of the Russian Federation have already been instructed to ensure the application of these legislative novellas in practice.
Civil Rights Protection Group Announces Alert on Movement in Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People has issued a warning for colored people travelling to Missouri because of discriminatory state policies and attacks on racist grounds.
The group’s statement reads as follows: “Warning for Travellers of the National Association for the Advancement of the Colored Population, valid until August 28, 2017, calls upon all African-American travelers, guests and citizens of the state of Missouri to be especially careful and to be cautious when traveling.”
According to the National Association for the Promotion of the Progress of the Colored Population, the announcement of a warning on the movement of the group was prompted by a recently passed law in Missouri, which made it harder for people to win claims related to discrimination, as well as the fact that law enforcement representatives of the state often disproportionately choose their own.
“Your people are subject to human rights violations.
They are stopped on the roads because of the color of their skin, they are beaten and killed,” Rod Chapel, president of the National Association for the Advancement of the Colored Population of Missouri, told the Kansas City Star newspaper.
“We hear complaints more often than ever before.”
This is the first warning of its kind issued by the organization against the US state.
The group cited incidents such as the humiliation of black students on racial grounds at the University of Missouri and the death of twenty-eight-year-old Tori Sanders, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died under suspicious circumstances earlier this year after he ran out of gas while traveling through the state, and Missouri State Police arrested him without prosecuting him for the crime.
The warning also mentions a recent report by the Missouri State Attorney General’s Office that the likelihood of being stopped on the road for black drivers is 75 percent higher than for white drivers.
“The goal of the warning is for people to be aware of the situation and to warn their relatives and friends and colleagues about what could happen in Missouri,” Chepel said.
“People need to be prepared in one way or another, whether they take the money with them for bail or tell relatives that they are traveling through the state.”
According to the latest data from the FBI’s hate crime reporting program, there were 100 hate crimes registered in Missouri in 2015, making the state’s 16th state in terms of such violations.
The Motion Warning is also a response to the new Missouri law, which would make it more difficult to bring a case against a legal entity for housing or employment discrimination.
Earlier, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) announced warnings for travelers across Texas and Arizona after these states passed new immigration control laws, which required local law enforcement to arrest people for violating immigration laws, which, according to the ACLU, should have increased the number of arrests.
Movement warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but recently public organizations have resorted to this measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States.
Two people killed in shooting at police patrol in Egypt
Unknowns fired at a police patrol in the Egyptian city of Isna, Reuters reports citing Egypt’s Interior Ministry.
During the shooting, two people, including one police officer, were killed and three people were injured.
All the wounded were taken to the hospital.
According to the agency, police stopped the car, after which two armed men in the car opened fire on law enforcement officers.
One of the attackers was detained, the other managed to escape.
Rosturism supports law on cancellation of free baggage for non-refundable air tickets
The head of Rosturism Oleg Safonov said in an interview with the TV channel RBC that he "positively" refers to the adoption of the law on the cancellation of free carriage of luggage with non-refundable air tickets.
"It is necessary to create conditions under which a person who does not have luggage can buy a ticket cheaper than one who has luggage," he said.
At the same time, Mr. Safonov noted that, despite the fears of citizens, it will not be necessary to pay for the carriage of upper clothing and mobile phone in hand luggage.
“It would be right to reassure all our citizens and tourists and say that it is not about tops, umbrellas, mobile phones, iPads or even computers,” he said.
Earlier, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a law providing for the right of airlines to exclude the norm of free luggage transportation with a non-refundable airline ticket.
This means that airlines can determine the number of seats and the weight of the luggage included in the non-refundable fare.
Vladimir Putin ordered to eliminate the pollution of the Baikal
Russian President Vladimir Putin at a meeting on the protection of Baikal said that in recent years, significant areas of the lake have been subjected to extreme pollution.
He instructed to identify sources of funding, plans and implementers for the elimination of pollution.
Mr. Putin also instructed to carry out a full re-cultivation of contaminated areas.
"It is necessary to deal with the facilities that continue to work here, the cleaning facilities of most of them are worn out," - quotes RIA Novosti of the president.
He also added that the General Prosecutor’s Office of Russia should conduct a check on the identification of environmentally harmful activities.
According to him, in the area of the lake there are problems associated with the appearance of natural landfills and a number of violations in the sphere of ecology on the part of the organizers of recreation.
"I want to emphasize this: not to check everything in a row, here too, the measure needs to be known, but specifically - illegal and environmentally harmful activities and take appropriate measures," he stressed.
Earlier, the Prosecutor General's Office reported a reduction in fish stocks in Lake Baikal and proposed to increase the number of facilities subject to environmental surveillance.
Recall, on June 15, Vladimir Putin in the course of the direct line stated the need to change the legislation to ensure the rights of citizens living in the natural territories of a special regime of protection.
The inhabitants of the island of Olkhon, which is part of the Baikal Natural Territory, informed him about the problems with the conduct of economic activities.
The Head of the Ministry of Nature Sergei Donskoy immediately proposed to solve the problem by clarifying the boundaries of the water protection zone of Baikal, but the Government of Buryatia reminded that such a change is not enough, since the restrictions are related to a number of regulatory acts.
Previously, the Ministry of Economy proposed to solve the problem by amending the Land Code and the law on environmental protection.
A new temple will be built in Yugoslavia.
In the village of Sosva, members of the community from representatives of the indigenous minorities of the North "Rakhtynya", together with the inhabitants of the Berezovsky district, take part in the construction of an Orthodox temple in honor of St. Nikolai Miraculous.
Its location is a river bank, the temple will be well visible from a distance, so it will serve as a beacon for fishermen.
According to the representatives of the community, construction work will be completed as early as this year, domes are now installed, church bells are available.
The Igrim REB fleet provided transport accompaniment.
The temple is named after St. Nicholas the Miracle Maker, because he is revered by the Orthodox Church as the patron saint of travelers, including fishermen.
In Sosnowiec, fishing gives the settlers work, feeds them.
Locals wait for the temple to open its doors, and children even write about it in school papers as a local attraction.
Disneyland with the death penalty.
Why are the laws in Singapore enforced?
I'm talking to a local businessman, Chang, sitting in an open-air diner.
Commenting on the situation in Singapore, Chang smokes one cigarette after the other, while the smoker carefully stores an iron box in his office.
At the end of the conversation, the businessman goes to the nearest urn - up to it a hundred meters - and throws the bulls there.
The fine for garbage in a public place is $500 local, - reports Chang.
You know, since I was a child, I just developed a reflex: you can't throw a candy fan from the candy on the bridge, you'll be immediately punished.
Now there are cameras everywhere.
And indeed, Singapore’s sidewalks in the city centre are as clean as a museum.
Three months ago, the 18-year-old son of his neighbor painted a graffiti wall of an old colonial building.
The court found the man guilty of vandalism and sentenced him to be beaten.
What?!
Imagine that.
He received ten blows with a wooden stick on his buttocks and spent a week in prison.
Physical punishment is not uncommon.
How in Singapore the highest standard of living and incredibly harsh laws are combined, the reviewer of "AiF" understood on the spot.
No one here thinks about abolishing the death penalty, explains lawyer Victor Lee Hong.
And the government has long cared about the opinion of both the European Union and the United States on this issue.
If a person carries a large batch of drugs or trades them - he is hanged.
In 2002, a 22-year-old Australian was detained at Changi Airport with 400 grams of cocaine.
He was defended by the Australian prime minister, threatening sanctions, international human rights defenders and even the Pope.
In the end, the man was hanged.
After that, the drug couriers carefully travel around our country.
The thing is this: in Singapore it is assumed that the laws are required to be observed by EVERYTHING in a row, not just the humble and impoverished people.
It doesn’t matter who you are – a millionaire, a deputy prime minister, a famous artist or a resident of the European Union.
The only option in this case is if you find a pound of cocaine, you'll be hanged.
When you walk around Singapore and everywhere you meet signs with a lot of warnings, you simply wonder - how many prohibitions in this city-state!
For example, chewing gum is sold only in pharmacies, and you can buy it strictly on a prescription (!) of a doctor.
A tourist on arrival will not take away the gum, but it is worth sticking "rubber" in the metro, a fine of 1 thousand local dollars will be added.
In four days, I met two people with white plates on their necks: "I'm rubbish."
For thrown past the urn, the squirrel is often sentenced to a "reference to the courthouses": a week to clean the parks and beaches.
6 thousand rubles is paid by the "criminal", who forgot to wash water in the public toilet, and when trying to make a small need in the elevator of a residential house, a special detector is activated - the doors are locked and a signal is sent to the police.
Among the very exotic laws - the prohibition of feeding pigeons on the street, the public performance of songs and even excessive watering of the indoor plant (!): it is believed that the abundance of water attracts mosquitoes.
To avoid fires, smokers should not carry lighters in the subway, otherwise they will be fined 5,000 Singaporean bucks.
In general, there is a thought: no matter how hard you try, you will definitely break something.
That’s not at all the case,” Mohammed Kabir-Kajaria, the owner of the local travel agency, is trying to dissuade me.
Especially fantastic laws exist only on paper, and in the last twenty years I have not seen anyone attracted for their violation.
Why are they preserved?
So that the citizens do not relax.
Compliance with the basic rules is closely monitored.
For example, if a minor is sold cigarettes in a kiosk, then everyone in the chain will be punished: the owner of the store will pay a huge amount, the offender himself will be hit with sticks at the "back", and the seller will also be expelled and put in prison.
It is because of such harsh laws that crimes in Singapore are very rare.
Is that justified?
Back in the seventies, there was chaos on the roads - motorists ignored traffic lights, drove as they wanted, sat drunk behind the wheel.
After the introduction of the fines for the year everything calmed down.
Now the driver, after drinking a serving of whiskey, knows: if they stop, the policeman will not let go for a bribe, they will impose a fine in the amount of the apartment and for years will be sent to prison.
To many foreigners, a city-state in Southeast Asia seems like a kind of concentration camp.
In 1993, American writer William Gibson called Singapore "Disneyland with the Death Penalty" - a visitor from the United States terrified the general wealth of residents, "a terrifyingly clean airport" and "cultured nature."
To say that such things are unnatural, look artificial, and in principle should not be.
The first days in Singapore and you are rightly afraid to throw the paper on the sidewalk, you get excited if you get on the subway with ice cream.
But then you come to the "Little India" area, and suddenly there is a "pattern break": the bus stop is filled with plastic cups.
“How is that?” you wonder.
That's it, the Singaporeans laugh.
It's all happening.
Not every such "crime" will be caught on the spot, but you should know: if you are counted, you will not revenge - because you have broken the law.
Most often, this is enough for a person to behave normally.
Of course, the power in Singapore is quite authoritarian.
But you know what?
In Vietnamese Ho Chi Minh City, I moved very cautiously – motorcyclists often take smartphones and cameras out of the hands of tourists.
In the center of Paris is full of dirty bastards and beggars.
Not everyone in our streets tries to throw trash into urns.
Singapore has become the quietest, cleanest and safest city on Earth thanks to a set of draconian fines and relentless (up to the death penalty) laws.
You'll think.
This is the human nature: remember, and in Russia no one clung to the wheel until they began to be fined.
Although the main thing in Singapore is not fines, but voluntary compliance with the laws.
And it should be thought that in Russia, too, people would be happy with clean streets, the absence of garbage in the subway and would welcome the arrest of those who confuse the elevator with the public toilet.
Here's the bodily punishment - thank you, don't.
At the same time, Singapore’s laws are at least worth watching.
Nothing holy?
The White House is now targeting the Statue of Liberty.
The most reliable sign of a regime change is when it starts fighting statues.
Americans understand this no worse than everyone else - hence the deliberate theatrical demolition of the statue of Saddam Hussein on Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the Trump administration’s key ideologists, undoubtedly knew what he was doing when he put a symbolic axe on the Statue of Liberty during a fierce dispute with CNN journalist Jim Acosta over the president’s proposals for a drastic reduction in legal migration.
To be honest, Miller didn't try the statue itself.
The shelves of boat owners and artists depicting the Statue of Liberty would lynch him if he tried to do so.
But he tried her meaning, and especially the meaning that was attributed to her in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, when the poems of Emma Lazarus were added to the pedestal.
As Miller whispered to Acosta, “I don’t want to go deep into history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.
The poem you are talking about was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty.
Miller made the facts right, but as he himself said, it’s not really about history.
This is about the current sound of the astonishing words of Lazarus, the only ones in which the state invites not any immigrants, but the poorest: "Your tired, your poor, / your crowds dreaming to breathe freely, / Unhappy wastes of your plentiful shores".
“Unfortunate waste” has never been so visible on our screens.
Miller did not study literature - he made it clear that these people are not waiting for Trump in America.
This dispute over the meaning of the statue is part of a wider political and cultural war: it is indeed a dispute about the meaning of America.
Lazarus — and her friends who struggled to put her words on the basement of the statue after her death — understood very well that they were committing a completely political act.
The sculpture was intended to mark the connection between the French and American republics with the help of a banal classical figure - the female image of Freedom.
Lazarus changed her meaning: in her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract, she has a voice.
And she was given a completely different name: Mother of the Exiled.
The combination of poetry and image was a brilliant feminist move and a crushing attack against American nativism.
And how Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the right though to change it back.
The noisy Rush Limbo, a kind of John the Baptist, who announced the arrival of Trump, in 2010 reasoned that Freedom invites no one, rather it is an early neocon, carrying the flame of America lying in the dark world: "Freedom is coming.
It carries the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch is not needed to light the way to the United States.”
Against the norm, Limbo really hit the point here.
The meaning of the statue depends solely on the angle of view.
The great creative achievement of Lazarus was to see it as it would be seen by the exhausted, unhappy but hopeful people on decks of ships after a long and often difficult voyage.
It literally means looking at the world through the eyes of people seeking refuge and a chance for a better life.
Her statue responds to them with words of hope and hospitality that they dream of hearing.
And, of course, this is not the prospect that Miller and Trump will ever want to acknowledge.
Their torch is needed not to light the way, but to incite hatred, which is the only source of their strength.
World Cup 2017: Neil Blake praises the Scottish team members of the UK.
Eileed Doyle remembers a time when there were only two Scots in the U.K.
Neil Blake, the British Athletics Federation’s game director, said a 16-man Scottish team would make a “significant contribution to the team’s game.”
A record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for the 2017 London Championships, which will begin on Friday.
Blake believes that something special is being born in Scotland and the UK Athletics Federation should take this into account.
“We know that and we’re trying to understand it and we’ll support it as long as they have the potential,” Blake said.
“I’ve spoken to people at the Scottish Sports Institute and they think it’s because of what they’ve done.
The Scottish Athletics Federation thinks that what they have done should work.
The British Athletics Federation: what they have done, you have to work.
People on the street think the same.
I don’t know why the circumstances are so, but it’s brilliant.”
Some of the Scottish lightweight athletes are claiming medals, including Laura Moore and Andrew Bachert - who will compete with Sir Moe Farrah in the 5,000 m distance; and Eileed Doyle's team has chosen their captain.
"Eileed is modest.
Her captain's speech was great," Blake said.
"Many athletes, whether Scots or not, and from where they live or train, have left this room, feeling proud and inclined to win.
The passion and sincere feelings that Eileed put into it were wonderful.”
The Commonwealth Championship silver medalist, who will run 400 metres with obstacles at her fifth World Championship, says that 16 Scots in the British national team are "incredible".
The previous record for the number of Scots in the World Cup was seven, in 1983 and 2005.
Laura Muir, who specializes in middle-distance running and broke five British and two European records last year, is ahead.
She'll run 1,500 and 5,000 meters.
Chris O’Hare, who will compete in the 1500 m race, is another Scottishman to note: behind him is a successful season, in which there were victories in the qualifying competitions of the British national team and in the Annual Competitions.
Doyle remembers his first World Cup, when Lee McConnell was the only Scotsman on the team.
The captain of the team says she is "incredibly proud" that so many of her compatriots have not only entered the squad, but in some cases will claim medals and fight to reach the final.
"The captain of the team is chosen by other members of the team, so it was a huge honor anyway, but to know that your teammates voted for you and chose you is a very special thing for me," she added.
"I am very proud of all the Scots who have joined the squad.
It shows how much we have achieved.
And they are all athletes who will strive to get to the pedestal of honor.
What about my captain's speech?
Yeah, I think she was good.
I just noticed that we were very lucky to host the World Cup at home.
So it’s just about how important it is to get support from the fans and take advantage of the fact that we will be in the Olympic Stadium again.
I got another chance to get into his arena and take part in the competition, and the atmosphere there will be just amazing.”
Facebook Critics Block: You Don’t Need to Apply for a Public Position Unless You’re Ready to Hear Criticism from Voters
The founder of our country understood what a critical press is.
The Americans loved George Washington, but that didn’t stop them from criticizing him for everything from domestic politics to his political principles.
Criticism of course annoyed him.
He didn’t shut his mouth to his critics.
Because back in 1783, Washington said: “It is possible to take away freedom of speech and we, deaf and mute, will be led like sheep to the slaughter.”
Now I'm going to go to Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, who should try to be more like Washington.
Hogan's subordinates blocked and deleted posts of at least 450 people who expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.
And this week the American Civil Liberties Union sued him for it.
The governor's subordinates called the lawsuit insignificant, and the commentary on the Internet was written in the spirit of "well what."
“It’s just Facebook,” a lot of people say.
But that's important, too.
And this is especially important when it comes to a guy like Hogan.
He is a surprisingly popular Republican governor in a democratic, predominantly state.
It ranks second in the approval rating among 50 governors of the country.
Hogan is not a stubborn reactionary.
He demonstrated a strong hand in the management of the state and a commitment to its principles.
He also cleverly uses Facebook as a primary way of communicating with his constituents and jokingly demonstrates on his page his bald head after chemotherapy.
Therefore, blocking people who come to the governor’s page – which is declared as an official public forum and is run by the administration’s employees on taxpayers’ money – is unnecessary and ultimately harmful.
In an interview with the Washington Post, spokeswoman Amelia Chess defended the governor’s actions, claiming that blocking comments is simply their moderation.
But it’s too easy to use the image of trolls, spammers and haters harassing the internet.
"Post" spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.
And these are real people, not trolls, - a teacher, a businessman, a pastor, who turn to their chosen leaders.
They all say that their comments were respectful, substantive and not rude.
The pastor quoted the Bible, appealing to Hogan as a Catholic.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramana from Bowie, Maryland, did not express hatred, but asked about hate crimes.
“I wrote a polite comment that I was disappointed by his lack of response to hate crimes and other recent news,” she wrote in the comment section of the post.
“I also hate the idea that when a lot of people leave comments on the same topic, some immediately say that it’s a so-called turnaround, instead of admitting that they’re dealing with a large group of dissatisfied citizens.”
What the governor’s subordinates call a “concentrated spam attack,” others would probably call an “active life position.”
In the era of Facebook, it’s easy to edit your image by simply blocking critics or erasing negative comments.
This is much less dusty work than it used to be when it required sending people, collecting and burning newspapers with critical leads, or arresting and shutting up protesters.
But that’s exactly what’s happening now, only in numbers.
Hogen is not the first official to be criticized for not wanting to listen to Facebook and other social networks.
President Trump has been sued by Twitter users who have been banned from his Twitter account.
One of the first, pivotal decisions on this topic was made this week in Virginia.
According to U.S. District Judge James C. Casheris of Alexandria, the chairman of the Laudon County Supervisory Board violated the First Amendment by banning a voter from his Facebook account.
And in Kentucky, Republican Governor Matt Bavin filed claims with the American Civil Liberties Union for his behavior on Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be that hard.
In Washington’s time, the era of affordable postal spending was about the same as the Internet today.
From 1776 to 1800, the number of newspapers quadrupled, and the authors of anonymous letters severely overthrew his authority.
And even then, Washington was dealing with anonymous trolls.
People under the pseudonyms "Yuricola", "Valerius", "Belisarius" and "Portius" wrote letters to newspapers ridiculing Washington's decision.
According to historical documents compiled by the George Washington Documents online project, his office was flooded with petitions criticizing his position on the Treaty on Friendship, Trade and Navigation.
But he did not try to silence them.
Freedom of speech, dissent and speech is at the very heart of our state.
And true leadership means agreeing to it.
Ronan Rafferti hopes for home amenities at the Renaissance club
Former European champion Ronan Rafferty hopes for home amenities for the next three days, when the Renaissance club in East Lothian will host the twenty-fifth Scottish Open Golf Tournament for senior athletes.
A native of Northern Ireland, who led the neighborhood at Archerfield Links and moved towards the final round last year until losing to Paul Ils, is attached to the new venue and serves as the tournament's representative on behalf of the club's founder and director Jerry Sarvadi.
“I’ve seen the building of the Renaissance club, and we’re watching it succeed at this event,” Rafferty said.
“The players will see this field at its best, it is in great condition.
Jerry did a great job arranging this place.
He is a fierce supporter of this game and proud of his achievements here.
It’s a great demonstration for this field.”
The Englishman Iles is looking forward to the opportunity to defend the championship title for the first time, despite the fact that during his 32-year career he won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour.
“It’s a really special feeling,” said the Southport player.
“I couldn’t try to win the Extremadura Open again because it was removed from the schedule a year after I won it.
Going back to this part of the world is magical.
This is a great place to play golf.
The memories of last year are coming back, and for me and my wife, Sharon, it was a very special impression to win last year.
It was a really special time and we will always remember it.”
He returns to battle in his homeland, Gary Orr, who joined the European Senior Athletes Tournament after turning 50 earlier this year.
This event will be his first public appearance in Scotland since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
“When you play at home, it’s always a little more important,” said Helensboro Orr.
“You want to perform well, but you feel that extra burden.”
I was very happy to play again, and I showed good golf.
I’m happy with how things are going so far.”
On the field, the trio will be joined by former Masters winner Ian Wushnem and senior majors champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are two of the six Scots on the field; the others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Participation in the tournament is free, and parking costs <0xC2><0xA3>5 per hour if one person is in the car, and <0xC2><0xA3>10 if a person is two or more.
All proceeds go to the British Prostate Cancer Foundation.
British roads will learn how to absorb harmful emissions
Tunnels above highways capable of absorbing the carbon dioxide emitted by cars are already being tested on UK roads.
The country's transport agency, according to the publication Autocar, reported on the positive results of tests of a 100-meter tunnel installed on one of the highways in the north of the country.
The 6-metre-high tunnel is built from some of the latest polymer materials that are able to absorb harmful substances contained in car exhausts.
However, the creation of a whole network of such tunnels is only part of the large-scale measures that the UK authorities are going to take to improve the atmosphere.
In addition to a network of tunnels, the British are going to expand the network of charging stations for electric vehicles, implement a number of measures to reduce the traffic flow on the roads, expand the use of commercial transport on electric traction and modernize the fleet of heavy trucks.
According to official statistics, a quarter of all atmospheric pollution is due to transport, and unsatisfactory air quality causes up to 40,000 premature deaths per year.
Mosgorsud changed the punishment of disabled Mamayev to a fine
The court changed the sentence of the disabled Anton Mamayev, sentenced to four and a half years in a colony, to a fine of 200,000 rubles.
This is reported by TASS.
Earlier, the prosecutor’s office had asked the court to replace the term with a parole, explaining its request by the fact that Mamaev’s disease “prevents him from being in prison conditions”.
28-year-old Anton Mamayev was sentenced to four and a half years in prison in a colony of the general regime for robbery, the victim of which was a former special forces fighter.
On July 19, a court at a court hearing in the SIZO released the man from custody.
Poverty and Death in Indonesia's "Golden Land"
When dinner is ready, Bardina Degei doesn't use a stove.
It is rarely used even in pots.
In her wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of Paniai county in the rebellious Indonesian province of Papua, a housewife usually simply places a sweet potato, which here is called a “note,” right in the hearth.
After half an hour, the charred tuber is caught and eaten with impatient, unwashed hands.
Degei sits on the ground floor – she has no furniture – and this is where she does her homework, such as washing clothes with cloudy water from a nearby swamp.
The toilet serves a bucket in a room without a roof.
She is the youngest of her husband’s four wives, so she was not assigned to work in the field.
The multiplicity is widespread here.
Of course, working late can be dangerous: many men in this village are unemployed, many drink, and there are also soldiers.
“No one decides to walk around the village after five in the evening,” she says.
This is a rare opportunity to look at everyday life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was annexed to Indonesia in 1969 after a dubious referendum when only 1,026 elders were forced to vote, publicly raising their hands in front of the occupying troops.
The existing movement for independence from the Netherlands quickly turned its anger against the government of Jakarta, which maintains strict control over the region, preventing foreign journalists and human rights defenders.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and Western Papua, and the independent state of Papua New Guinea occupies the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is a city as far away as it is abandoned; the road here includes a half-hour flight from Jayapura, the administrative center of the province, to Nabire, and then a five-hour hiring car shake.
There is no public transport here.
The city with a population of about 19,000 consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences; corrugated steel roofs are painted with rust in a variety of reddish shades.
Few Indonesians arrived here, not to mention journalists, and almost none of the foreigners.
Before the arrival of Christian missionaries, the papuas mee pago worshipped a god named Uga Tamee.
There have been other changes.
“It was unusual for us to wear these clothes,” Degei says, pointing at her bright, woven hand turban, dark skirt and bright shirt.
"We used to wear only leaves on the body."
Papua is Indonesia’s poorest province, with 28% of its population living below the poverty line, and child mortality and literacy rates among the worst in Asia.
But it's also Indonesia's golden land.
The world’s largest and most profitable gold mine, Grasberg, owned by Phoenix-based Freeport McMoran, is just sixty miles from Pania, a highland province about the size of New Jersey, home to 153,000 people.
In 2015 alone, Freeport mined gold and copper for approximately $3.1 billion.
In addition, Papua can boast of forest reserves, which are estimated at $ 78 billion.
These fortunes, however, bring one misfortune to the Papua, ensuring that Indonesia’s powerful armed forces maintain their suffocating presence here.
According to an investigation by the New York Times in 2005, between 1998 and 2004, Freeport paid local military personnel and units nearly $20 million, including up to $150,000 per officer.
The demands for greater autonomy on the part of the Papuas threaten the existence of this golden age and are relentlessly suppressed.
According to human rights defenders, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed by the Indonesian military since 1969, and thousands more have been raped, tortured and deprived of their liberty.
According to the Asian Commission on Human Rights, the mass killings of indigenous people in the highlands of Papua in the 1970s can be considered genocide.
Last year alone, Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters in the region.
“We’ll lose everything,” a report published in 2016 by the diocese of Brisbane, contains evidence of atrocities committed in the previous year, such as executions without trial, torture – especially frequent, as claimed in another report, rape, and defeat by electric torque.
“It’s hard to count the number of victims because incidents happen every week,” said Andreas Harsono, a researcher in Indonesia, to Human Rights Watch.
Nuts have been delayed as Papua’s resources have attracted the influx of displaced people from other parts of Indonesia.
The province’s 3.5 million population is 83% Christian, but demographics change as Muslim economic migrants arrive from the densely populated Indonesian islands of Java, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese bars, "warungi", sell fried chicken and a mixture of "gado-gado" vegetables served with peanut sauce.
Locals are trying to keep up with the competition.
“Migrants started selling chicken and vegetables at a traditional market cheaper than the natives of Papua,” explains Abet You, a 24-year-old Paniai native who moved to Jayapura, the administrative center of the province, for work.
“Because of this, the indigenous people of Papua – the mother-mother (women) of Papua – have lost their market.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, popularly known as the Jokowi, vowed to address inequality and rights violations in Papua during his 2014 presidential campaign.
On his way to the Presidential Palace in Jakarta, the former carpenter enlisted the support of 27 of the 29 districts of Papua, including Paniai.
But in Papua, almost nothing has changed, and the locals feel loyal.
“Our hearts are broken because in 2014 we voted for the Jokes, expecting him to fulfill our hopes of restoring justice,” Yoo said.
In fact, just two months after the inauguration of Djokovic, Paniai survived the tragedy.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children were outside singing Christmas anthems at the fireplace in Enarotal, when two Indonesian soldiers on a motorcycle broke out of darkness.
The frightened children told them to turn on the headlights.
According to local pastor Javedt Tebai, one of the soldiers was offended by their tone and after a while returned with four soldiers.
According to victims and eyewitnesses, the soldiers who were drunk chased the children and beat them with rifles.
Then one of the soldiers shot a group of children.
One child, sixteen-year-old Julianus Aimo, was beaten so badly that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, someone set fire to the nearby government building of the electoral commission, and the next day the situation worsened.
About a thousand Papuan men, women and children gathered on a football field in front of the local police station and military command center to demand justice.
They brought with them ritual hunting bows and performed waita, a dance of the Papua tribe mee pago: they ran around and portrayed the singing of birds.
Some protesters began throwing stones at the police station and the military base.
When the situation got hot, internal radio soldiers were ordered: “If the crowd resists more than three times, shoot them,” as it sounded, according to an official document seen by TIME magazine correspondents, but not published in local media.
Fifty-six-year-old Jeremias Kayame, head of the Kego Koto district in Anarotali, felt the danger approaching and called for calm, calling on the crowd to disperse around the houses.
No one wanted to listen to him.
“When I turned around, I suddenly got a bullet in my left wrist,” he told Time magazine, standing on the porch of his brightly painted wooden house.
Kayame still does not know who shot, but says the bullet flew from the ranks of the assembled soldiers.
“There was a crowd, there were a lot of shots,” he adds.
A local resident, Alfius Jou, was hit three times, according to his cousin, who witnessed the shooting.
“I ran up to him and examined his body to make sure it was him,” Johannes, who, like many Indonesians, uses only one name, told Time magazine.
“I saw that he was dead...I kissed him.”
General Yotje Mende, Papua’s senior police inspector, told reporters that his officers were simply “protecting” their base because it was under attack.
“We have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us,” Pujo Sulistio, a Papua police spokesman, said in 2015.
“It’s a matter of life and death.”
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many more were injured.
The news of the killings reached Jakarta only the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokovi delivered a fiery speech in Jayapur, in which he expressed his condolences to the families of the victims and vowed to address the issue of historical abuses of power in Papua.
“I want this situation resolved immediately so that it will never happen again in the future,” he said.
In October 2016, Security Minister Viranto said he would set up a non-judicial organization to end historical human rights violations.
But there were excuses almost immediately.
“Most of the violations occurred a long time ago.
Some of them took place in the 1990s or early 1990s.
The fact is that we certainly want to deal with these violations, but there are procedures that need to be passed,” he said.
Viranto then gave up his words, speaking to TIME magazine on June 5 in Jakarta, and said he did not plan to set up an organization to deal with complaints in Papua.
Instead, he said, “Everything will be decided through a court of law.”
Viranto, who has been accused by the United Nations of “crimes against humanity” in connection with the deaths of more than 1,000 people during the bloody vote for independence of East Timor in 1999, said 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua have already been resolved, including the incident in Paniaia.
The families of the victims from Paniai met with such statements with bleak mistrust.
“I have been questioned four times in the last three years, but there has been absolutely no change,” says Johannes.
“I am tired.”
He says that years later he still lives in fear.
“I’m scared,” he says.
"I'm afraid I'm going to be arrested by the military, I'm afraid I'm going to be shot."
His brother Jacobus also expressed the view that the residents of Paniai are afraid to discuss the incident.
He said he was beaten by the military after he helped bury four victims.
“After we buried the bodies, the military came after me,” he says.
The shooting didn't stop.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police fired at villagers in Paniai district of Deiyai.
In a clash between villagers and a manager of a construction company who refused to help take a man unconscious to the hospital, one person died and another 17 were injured, including children.
A man, twenty-four-year-old Ravianus Dow, who drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died on the way to the hospital.
Angry villagers protested in front of the office of the construction site owned by the company.
According to police, the villagers threw stones at officers, who in response produced warning shots.
But locals claim that a mobile brigade (Indonesian special forces) began shooting at the crowd and killed one person.
“We were so panicked, we were afraid of retaliation,” said 29-year-old Domingu Badii, who lives near the hospital and saw the wounded hurriedly delivered.
“I’ve been at home for two days.”
The Deiyai parliament demanded that officers involved in the incident be called for an answer and a mobile police brigade recalled from the region.
Paniyai has always been a sick spot for the Indonesian government.
The lack of significant development is caused by the discontent of the Mei, Moni, Dani and Damal tribes scattered throughout the green-covered central highlands of Papua.
Many have joined the Free Papua Movement (OPM), an insurgent army that claims to defend the rights of the Papuas by arranging sporadic attacks and raids with abductions on Indonesian soldiers.
Some of OPM’s top executives come from Pania, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Judas Kogoya.
In response, in recent years thousands of people have been arrested and unfoundedly detained by the military under the pretext of “defence of national independence.”
Some of them never came back.
Among the population of Papua Panyai is considered a "sad, forgotten place".
Poverty increases discontent.
A small portion of rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for the locals.
Bread is not available to the same extent.
People here grow everything they eat: mostly nuts, as well as some fruits and leafy vegetables.
Agriculture is the work of women, each of whom can take care of four or five fields of sweet potatoes.
They usually keep most of the crop for the family, and the rest is sold in the local market.
Ten tuber notes are worth just 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, the economic inequality between indigenous Papuans and new migrants, who arrived in large numbers after the introduction of new flights to Nabire airport, has increased.
Few existing vacancies usually come to more educated and wealthier migrants.
Papayas rarely have enough money or the necessary skills to run their own competitive business.
“Young people don’t want to stay in the village ... because there is no work or money here,” said John Gobai, chairman of the Paniai Tribal Council.
Isolation keeps Papua away from the views of the rest of the world.
In addition, the restrictions on the work of the international media remain strict.
Earlier this year, French journalists Frank Escudy and Basil Lonshan were deported from Papua for "insufficient coherence with relevant organizations" despite being granted rare permissions to conduct the video.
According to Felim China, deputy director for Asia at Human Rights Watch, the promises made during Jokowi’s election campaign to lift restrictions on media work in order to promote transparency and development have not been fulfilled.
“Foreign journalists trying to report from the rebellious eastern provinces of Indonesia, Papua and Western Papua are now facing new dangers: refusals of visas and blacklisting,” he said in a statement.
The lack of media attention means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely limited to Papua's immediate neighbours.
In March, six Pacific states – Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands – appealed to the UN Human Rights Council to investigate “diverse and widespread violations” in Papua, including the shooting in Paniai.
The same countries have supported OPM in the past.
A spokesman for the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Arramanata Nasir, drew back from the group’s statement, telling reporters in Jakarta that “Indonesia still has a democratic system and there is a free press, so concealing evidence of human rights violations would be difficult.”
Locals want more foreign governments to pay attention to the situation.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, headed by Dutch Human Rights Ambassador Kees Van Baar, visited Jaipur on May 4, local residents broke the silence, please: “We want freedom,” as a source who was also present at the meeting, but wished to remain unconscious.
Indonesia will hold a new presidential election in 2019, but the Papuas say they are unlikely to vote for Djokovic again.
“The Jokovs are a man of good intentions, but they are surrounded by those involved in the shooting in Pania,” said Gobai, chairman of the tribal council.
He wants the Jokovs to know that the Paniai people, besides living in the shadow of a greedy army, are in poverty, and their education and health care are in a miserable state.
Gobai says that the inhabitants of Paniai, like the other papayas, consider their vote, given to Jokowi, a debt that he must pay.
“They don’t want money, they just want justice,” he says.
Despite threats and intimidation, the families of the victims of the shooting in Paniai carried out the last symbolic act of disobedience: they buried the body of one of the victims on a plot of land directly opposite the police and military station.
Knowing that justice will probably never prevail, they will at least not allow the culprits to forget their crimes.
“They killed a member of our family,” Jacobus says, without raising his head.
“What else were we supposed to do?”
The fire for the second time covers Dubai skyscraper "Fackel"
The fire engulfed one of the world's tallest residential skyscrapers in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of residents to rush out of the 70-story structure at a height of 337 meters.
This is the second fire to hit a high-rise building – which coincidentally is called “Fackel” – in two years.
The building was evacuated, no casualties were reported, and there was no operational news of the cause of the fire.
“We slept and woke up from the fire alarm and the screams of people.
We ran down the stairs, and it took us about ten minutes to get down from the fiftieth floor,” a resident of the skyscraper, named George, told Reuters.
According to the city's civil defense department, firefighters extinguished the fire at around 4:00 local time (00:00 GMT) and cooled the building.
The government said it was working to provide asylum to the victims.
The incident could bring the safety of materials used in the exteriors of tall buildings around the world back on the agenda.
In the course of an investigation by the administration of "Fackel" after the fire there in 2015, it was found that the plaster was the most affected - the external panels used for decoration and insulation.
In the United Kingdom, police said they believe the insulation system and plaster panels of the Grenfell Tower building in London could have accelerated the spread of the June fire that killed about 80 people.
The growth of tourist flow in Ida-Virumaa in June was minimal
According to the data obtained by the Russian portal.err.ee in the Department of Statistics, in June 2017 a total of 20,519 local and foreign tourists used the services of hotel enterprises in the North East, which is 125 people or 0.6% more than in the same period a year ago.
At the same time, the number of local tourists decreased, and foreign tourists - increased.
Thus, the foreign tourist flow increased in June by 7.3% (544 people) to 7,994 tourists.
And the number of local tourists decreased by 3.2% from 12,944 to 12,525 people.
The most noticeable increase in the number of Russian tourists in the region - by 8.9% or by 318 people compared to June 2016.
In June 2017, 3885 guests from the Russian Federation stayed in Ida-Virumaa hotels.
Andrey Malakhov made it clear to fans who is to blame for his departure
Andrei Malakhov hinted to his fans on Instagram who are to blame for his departure from the "First" channel.
So far, he has not commented on the rumors, but today posted a fragment of the article of the newspaper "Vedomosti" for August 1.
Photo Malakhov signed the tag "boss milkshake".
An article on how to prevent an employee's "burning out" and pay attention to his condition.
If we remember the numerous reports that the host was unable to find a common language with the newly arrived producer, who began to reformat "Let's Talk", it becomes clear what he so transparently hinted at, writes "KP".
As reported, the TV presenter Andrey Malakhov is currently on vacation and did not sign a notice of dismissal from the First Channel.
The situation with the dismissal can be clarified in the coming days.
In Afghanistan, five soldiers were killed in the explosion of a car
At least five soldiers were killed in an explosion in the Afghan province of Helmand, reports RIA Novosti.
According to police, on the eve of the night near the military blockade in Girishk county, a mine-mined car exploded.
There are about 20 dead.
On Friday morning in Girishka there was a new CP.
Armed criminals attacked a currency exchange point.
Shooting between the attackers and security forces continues.
A diver took a video of a shark biting his camera
Diver and researcher Greg Skomal recorded a shark in a video that bit his action camera GoPro.
The video was posted on Facebook by a division of the U.S. Marine Fisheries Agency in Massachusetts, an employee of which is Skomal.
The incident took place on August 2 off the coast of the Cape Cod Peninsula in the northeastern United States, according to the Necn portal.
The man during the submarine attempted to remove the shark from the camera, which he held on a special stick.
After noticing the man, an animal more than three meters long sailed towards him.
The shark began to bite the camera, while not trying to attack the scientist.
Scomal explained that the predator did this to determine whether the gadget was edible.
The researcher added that the shark could easily destroy the device.
He also noted that such behavior of a marine animal turned out to be novel for scientists.
The cause of mass fighting in the Ural military center became known
A working group of senior officers of the Central Military District arrived at the Yelan Training Center, where a mass clash took place, to investigate the circumstances of the incident.
Some details of this battle have already been revealed.
According to the Mash audience, appearing on the page "VKontakte", contractors of the Ural military unit number 31612 fought violently because of an unfilled bed.
It all started with the fact that a sergeant named Sayan demonstratively ignored the officer's orders to fill the sheets.
On the side of the officer stood the soldiers from the sixth company.
Sayana supported the first company.
Within half an hour, 140 young men were crushed in the barracks beds and sinks, knocked out the glass.
More than ten people were injured in the mass fighting.
The CCO denied the information about the footage.
The study found that at least one-fifth of passengers in the U.S. carry prohibited items on a plane.
The study found that more than 20 percent of air passengers deliberately or accidentally carried prohibited items on board the plane through U.S. Transportation Security Administration inspection posts, including at least 6 percent boarded the plane without an inspection carrying prohibited knives or other sharp objects.
Nearly 1 per cent reported that they later discovered that they accidentally carried firearms, ammunition or explosives.
A study conducted by the charter company Stratos Jet Charters, Inc. and covering more than 1,000 people also found that young passengers were more likely to break the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted that they deliberately tried to fly something that was banned by ATB, 19.7 percent were millennials compared to less than 15 percent of Generation X members.
Consciously past the employees of ATB most often carry food and water.
More than 3 per cent admitted that they had specially inspected sharp objects, and 2.2 per cent of female and 3.7 per cent of male respondents admitted that they had deliberately inspected prohibited drugs.
The company said it was studying passengers across the country to find out how many of them were accidentally smuggled through inspection at airports, and how many were doing it deliberately.
It is expected that most often – consciously or unconsciously – smuggle through inspection those who fly the most.
According to the company, the rules of ATB are quite complex and confusing.
People often don’t know exactly what fluids they can carry and how much.
Therefore, it is not surprising that most of what ATB selects are prohibited liquids.
Some time ago, people thought that ATB might consider it forbidden to carry a book.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but not on international flights.
EPA chief Pruitt refuses to postpone implementation of Obama-approved emission reduction rules
The day after the 15-state lawsuit, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency cancelled his decision to postpone the implementation of the Obama-approved rules aimed at reducing emissions of air pollutants and smog-producing substances.
Pruitt explained his decision by the fact that his agency now listens more than in previous administrations to the needs of the environmental regulators of individual states.
He did not mention the lawsuit against his previous position filed with the Federal Court of Appeal.
The dispute revolved around the October 1 deadline, by which states must ensure compliance with 2015 ground-level ozone standards.
In June, Pruitt announced that he would postpone their compliance by one year to give his department more time to study the plan and avoid “discordance with local decisions or obstacles to economic growth.”
Pruitt, who before being appointed by President Trump to his current position, was the attorney general of the state of Oklahoma, has long been known as a consistent opponent of tightening environmental norms.
After moving to Washington, Pruitt repeatedly blocked or delayed the introduction of norms opposed by the chemical or gas-oil industries.
The unexpected change of course on Wednesday is another legal defeat of the course taken by Pewitt to return to the previous norms.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled that the head of the EPA overstepped his powers in an attempt to delay the Obama administration’s rule requiring oil and gas companies to track and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement released Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested that by drastically changing the course of ozone standards, he was simply fulfilling the EPA’s obligation to cooperate with states in the complex process of timely implementation of new standards.
"In previous administrations, the EPA was often unable to settle on time, then waited for claims from activist groups and others, and discussed deadlines during the settlement of the case," Pruitt, who filed more than a dozen claims against the EPA in his previous post, said in a statement.
“We don’t believe in regulation through trials, and we take the deadlines seriously.
We also take our charter and the authority it gives us seriously.”
However, the EPA said in a statement that Pruitt could at some point again use his “authorities to postpone and other authority given by law” to make sure that the “jcyjdfys rules on a clear course and on all available information.”
Republicans in Congress are pushing for a broader review of the rules on ozone.
The bill, approved by the House of Representatives last month, aims to postpone compliance with the 2015 rules for at least eight years.
The Senate has not yet voted on the matter.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who headed a coalition of states that filed lawsuits against the EPA this week, said the group intends to continue legal pressure.
“The EPA’s change of course – following our claims – is an important victory in the fight for health and safety for 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smog covering their cities,” Schneiderman said.
California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington, as well as the District of Columbia, joined the lawsuit.
Earth-level ozone occurs when conventional pollutants from machines, power plants, oil refineries and chemical plants, and other sources, enter the atmosphere in reaction with sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause serious breathing problems in people sensitive to it, leading to thousands of premature deaths per year.
Healthcare and environmental advocates welcomed Pruitt’s sudden change of course.
“It’s hard to think about how much pressure it took to take this completely logical step from a person tasked with protecting the air we breathe,” said Lori Ann Bird of the Center for Biological Diversity.
“We must continue to resist the Trump administration’s ideological campaign and protect those who pollute the air and their special interests.”
Congress of the IAAF extended the suspension of the All-Russian Federation of Athletics
The Congress of the International Association of Athletic Federations (IAAF) voted to extend the suspension of the All-Russian Athletics Federation (IFLA).
Congress thus supported the IAAF’s Board of Reconstruction, which issued a report on Monday recommending that the suspension remain in effect.
166 people voted for the extension of the suspension, against - 21, TASS reports.
The IAAF Board report said that the IFLA had made significant progress in meeting the conditions set by the Restoration Board, but these conditions had not yet been fully met.
Due to the disqualification of the IFLA at the World Championships in London, Russian athletes were forced to perform under a neutral flag.
The team included 19 people admitted to the IAAF championship.
The IAAF was permanently disqualified by the IAAF in 2015.
A report by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) independent expert Dick Pound was then published, which referred to numerous violations of WADA regulations committed by Russian officials and athletes.

Offensive defeat
As part of the 3rd round of the Fonbet Championship of Russia among the teams of the PFL, the Novomosk "Khimik" held an outfield match against FC "Kaluga".
A little more than 10 days ago, the rivals played each other in the Russian Cup, but this time the picture of the game was completely different.
The "chemist" did not give way to the opponent, but the second relaxation at the end of the match led to an offensive goal and a fiasco.
After the recent defeat of the Kaluzhan with a score of 0:3 many predicted in advance the easy victory of the masters.
However, from the beginning of the meeting, the Novosmoskians forced themselves to count and acted from the defense, but from a position of strength.
In 1 time, the Kaluzhans were more built and had an advantage in possession of the ball.
Another very high-quality match was played by Alexei Sirotin, who repeatedly reflected dangerous blows and gave confidence to the partners with his actions.
Unfortunately, in the attack "Chemistry" lacked the effort and luck to stall the defense of "Kaluga" and score the first goal at the exit.
After the break, the game began to take place on the opposite courses.
The Novosmoskians were more active in the attack.
An alarming call for our team was the mistakes in the defense, which allowed the kalu<0xC5><0xBE>an to create a number of sharp moments.
Ten minutes before the end of the meeting, the "Chemist" seized the territorial advantage and carried out several dangerous attacks.
But the experience of kalu<0xC5><0xBE>an played a role - they more competently and coolly led the ending, waiting for their moment to take the gate.
After a dangerous attack "Chemist" transferred the ball to the corner, the feed of which the masters of the fields without resistance were transferred to the gate.
The author of the nude was Yuri Dubrovin.
In the report meeting "Chemist" demonstrated a good game, but suffered an offensive defeat.
In front of our team awaits another departure - on August 11 at 7 pm in Moscow at the "Torpedo" stadium named after Eduard Streltsov, the Novomoskovskayas will fight with the favorite of the group "Center" FC "Ararat", which includes Roman Pavlyuchenko, Maratko Izmailov, Igor
Come and support the chemist!
The meeting place and time of the Novosmosk people - 18.30 min. near the store "Magnolia" (Eastern, d.2, Corp.
Composition of "Chemistry": Sirotin, Manokhin (k), Romashchenko, Shayunov, Chomutov, Gogiya (Oreshkin), Dudaity, Ryzhov, Sviatov, Belyanin (Adoevtsev), Andreychenko (Lygin)

According to published decryptions of telephone conversations, Trump pressed Mexico about the payment of the wall at the border
The Washington Post published decryptions of telephone conversations between U.S. President Donald Trump and the leaders of Mexico and Australia.
On January 27, during a phone call with Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieta, Trump insisted that he stop publicly stating that he would not pay for the planned border wall.
The U.S. president rebuked him for publicly speaking against the wall and, according to leaked information, told him, “You can’t tell this press.”
Trump began his election campaign with a promise to build a wall along the southern U.S. border and vowed to force Mexico to pay for the project.
In a published decipherment of his first telephone conversation with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, a hot mob was also found.
Trump told Turnbull that the agreement that the U.S. should accept refugees heading to Australia was “ridiculous,” “disgusting,” and “stupid,” and insisted that because of the agreement made by the Obama administration, he would look like an idiot as he intended to stop.
Trump ended the conversation, telling Turnbull that “this was the most unpleasant conversation in the whole day.”
The bodies of the dead in Abkhazia tourists sent by plane from Sochi to St. Petersburg
The plane, belonging to the airline "Russia", on which the bodies of Russian women killed in Abkhazia are on board, flew at 20:15 Moscow time from Sochi to St. Petersburg, TASS reports.
At the place of the final point of follow-up, the board will meet employees of the ritual agency, as well as representatives of the city's mayor, the Deputy Minister of Resorts and Tourism of Abkhazia Astamyr Ahba told reporters.
Earlier, representatives of the Ministry of Health of the Republic said that all the costs associated with the delivery of bodies back to Russia was borne by the government of Abkhazia.
In addition, the official Sukhum intends to pay the families of the deceased compensation in the amount of 500,000 rubles.
According to Ahba, the leadership of Abkhazia expressed readiness to pay the relatives of the victims of the explosions of tourists flight and residence in the republic, but the relatives sent to the republic only credentials on the right to the local authorities to act in accordance with the established procedure.
On August 2, at about 16:20 Moscow time, in the village of Primorsky Gudautsky district in the warehouse of missile and artillery weapons of the Ministry of Defense of the Republic, two explosions occurred, after which large-calibre shells and other ammunition stored there began to detonate.
As a result, there was a fire in the storage room, which provoked uncontrolled explosions of shells of various modifications.
As a result of the accident, two Russian citizens - Elena Polyakov, born in 1970, and Elena Timofeeva, born in 1962, who were on vacation near a source of hydrogen sulfide, died.
64 people, including 35 citizens of the Russian Federation and 29 citizens of Abkhazia, with injuries of varying severity were taken to medical institutions of the republic.
There are currently seven people in the hospital, the rest have been discharged.
A large jury will study the Russian influence on the U.S. elections
Special Prosecutor for Russia Robert Mueller has convened a grand jury in Washington to study Russia’s influence on the 2016 U.S. presidential election, The Wall Street Journal and Reuters reported.
The grand jury is a group of ordinary citizens who gather evidence of potential criminal offences and are entitled to question witnesses under oath.
The Special Prosecutor will examine the collected materials and decide whether they are sufficient for the prosecution.
The convening of a grand jury gives Mueller additional authority to collect witnesses.
One of the subjects of the investigation of the jury, which began its work a few weeks ago, will be the details of the son’s meeting of then-presidential candidate Donald Trump with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya.
To check the details of this meeting, which took place in June 2016, Mueller himself previously promised.
They've already been investigated by the FBI.
At the end of July, it was reported that Donald Trump Jr. had expanded the staff of his lawyers.
Trump Jr. had previously said that he had been waiting for a compromise from his meeting with Veselnitskaya for the candidacy of Hillary Clinton, but no revealing documents were submitted, and in the end it was about adoption.
In early August, a number of media outlets reported that Trump Jr.’s statement about his meeting with Veselnitsa was literally dictated by Trump Senior.
The White House clarified that the president did not dictate anything, but simply used his authority, which any father would do.
Vice Mayor of Penza detained at work
Deputy head of the administration of Penza Irina Shirshin is detained for 48 hours on orders of the Investigative Committee in his workplace, reports RIA Novosti.
Official reports from law enforcement agencies on the matter have not yet been received, but the press service of SU SK assured that they will follow soon.
There are no comments on what has happened in the city of Penza.
Irina Shirshina is one of the five deputy heads of the Penza administration.
She has been in charge of urban development and land relations since April 2015.
Prior to that, she worked for a long time as the head of the department of the State Civil Engineering Inspectorate for the Penza region.
Irina Shirshina raises three minor children, it is noteworthy that once again became a mother a year ago, she gave up maternity leave and returned to work.
Of course, there is no spaceport or rocket launcher in Mexico.
But there is a space agency established in 2010 and a desire to develop its own space program.
And the installation of the bust of Yuri Gagarin is a tribute to the first person who visited space.
Unlike the monuments of the Soviet period, which are demolished in some countries, the monuments of Gagarin, on the contrary, "walk around the planet".
In 2012, a monument was erected in Houston near NASA's former headquarters.
In London, a monument on the territory of the Royal Observatory was erected in honor of the 50th anniversary of the first flight into space.
There is a monument to Gagarin in Germany in the city of Erfuth, where our astronaut visited in 1963.
The monument in Karlovy Vary (Czech Republic) escaped demolition in 1992 due to public protests and was moved from the city center to the square in front of the local airport.
In the year of the 70th anniversary of Gagarin, a monument to Yuri Gagarin appeared in Riga.
This is the name and surname of the first astronaut in Latvian, and it looks like he was 70 years old.
Murder at Morse Ford: Activists Lose Lynch's Courts on Stage to Call for Justice
The 1948 Ford Mercury passed by spectators in Monroe Village, Georgia, and rushed roaring to the small Morse Ford Bridge.
When a car carrying four black passengers and a white driver approached the bridge, a group of white men with guns blocked her way.
The chief - a middle-aged man in a suit in a thin stripe - pulled a cigar and looked through the windshield.
The people inside trembled with fear.
"We need this nigger, Roger!" the man whispered.
"Get him out of the car!"
The screams broke the silence when a young black man was pulled from the front seat.
Fortunately, this awful scene that took place on July 22 is just a staging.
But when they put a loop on Roger's neck, almost all the viewers and really hid their breath.
Since 2005, activists have returned to the Morse Ford Bridge to lose again on the night in 1946 when the Dollclowns lynched two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and May Murray Dorsey.
No one has been convicted of these murders.
"It's amazing that no one has been arrested in all these years - although we see them next to us; although we know who they are," says Tyrone Brooks, who helped organize the production.
“It’s a stain on our history and it’s a stone on our souls.”
71-year-old Brooks is a former member of Georgia’s congress who has been fighting for human rights his entire life.
For him, the show is a dramatic call to action and an annual reminder to Monroe residents that the injustice has never been corrected.
“We want investigations, we want completion, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we have to get justice,” he said.
“We can’t move on to healing and reconciliation until we get justice.”
The coroner covers the body of one of the victims of the lynching at Morse Ford on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI materials obtained by NBC News, more than 50 people in Monroe and neighboring counties were suspected of participating in the lynchage.
But no one has ever been charged.
Although the suspects have been at large for decades, human rights defenders say the city has always known two related lynching motives: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a Supreme Court ruling allowed black citizens to vote for the primary, which was to take place that summer.
About the same election, according to the FBI, black exploiter Roger Malcolm struck Barnett Hester, a white landowner, in a fight apparently because of a woman.
Brooks says that, according to rumors spread in the city, Hester slept with Malcolm Dorothy's wife, and that the child she was supposed to have was not from her husband.
According to the FBI, on July 25, 1946, Loi Harrison, a major white landowner, paid $600 in bail to free Malcolm from prison.
He went to prison with Dorothy and their cousins May Murray and George Dorsey.
But as they drove out of prison and came to Morse Ford Bridge, a mob of lynchmen surrounded the car.
"It turns out that he organized and commanded the murders of Harrison," the FBI said in a statement.
“It is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between the state and city law enforcement agencies, which not only took part in the murders, but also destroyed the evidence and hid the identity of the witnesses.”
Brooks calls it shorter.
“It was an attempt on the right to vote,” he said.
“They were all killed to send a signal to black people in the city: if you register and vote, you will be the same.”
For nearly a decade, Cassandra Green has been leading an annual show that reproduces the lynchpin at the Morse Ford Bridge.
Her show is watched, it captures the viewer and tells about the deep racism that, as many would like to believe, is no longer in America.
It’s hard to see and even harder to turn around, but Green thinks that’s the main thing.
“We don’t want to talk about Lynch’s courts because they show us our own uglyness,” she says.
“But I can’t build a relationship with you unless you hear me or hear what I’ve been through.”
This year's rehearsals began in June, and on the first day nearly 30 actors - a dozen whites, the rest blacks - gathered in the room and listened to the polished over the years review of the play.
Wade Marbo was the director with Greene.
He played the role of the chief member of the clan for several years, but says the role has not become easier.
“I feel like I’ve gotten dirty because he’s not the person I am,” Marbo says.
“But I think it’s very important to remember this story because we don’t want to go back to that time.”
In the room, Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascon, who play Roger Malcolm and Barnett Hester, repeat their roles.
The show begins with Malcolm, angry that Hester is sleeping with his wife Dorothy, screaming and pushing him.
"I said, nigga, get out of my house!"
He yells at Rascon in response.
It's a blow.
And at the same time, everyone (at least all black actors) is outraged.
Green laughed the louder.
"What is it?" asks Ascona.
He's worried and embarrassed.
Am I overplaying?
“No,” Green said, laughing.
“I just don’t think the whites said ‘nigga’ at the time.”
"Yes, yes," laughed one of the black men.
"You must pass a solid 'r'."
And so does the energy in the room: discomfort is replaced by a sense of companionship.
Everyone should do everything right, not only for the play, but also for the memory of the four people killed.
The scene starts first.
This time, when Rasconna says the word on the letter "n", it turns out to be clear and sharp.
No one laughs.
The show ends violently and quickly.
Shouts, shots, and then silence.
A woman in a sad black dress stands over the bodies of actors and performs the sad Billy Holiday song "Strange Fruit".
His voice was interrupted by the word.
Hundreds of yards away from her, hundreds of spectators wipe tears and sweat from their eyes.
There are almost equal numbers of blacks and whites among the audience.
A couple came from Ithaca, New York to watch the show; many live very close by.
They all endured Georgia’s heavy spirits for almost eight hours while Brooks led them on a pilgrimage to Malcolm’s and Dorsey’s graves.
Until then, the murders were only a story, but now that they are standing in the same place where people were lynched, it seems that their ghosts are waving right in the air.
When the last note of the song fades, Green invites people to come closer and inspect the bodies.
Children lean to their heads, touch the paint depicting blood, and immobile bodies, and whisper something to each other.
"They're not really dead," one little boy whispered, as if to remind himself.
After a few minutes, Green thanks the audience, and all of a sudden it's over.
The actors throw the ropes from the neck and wipe the tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbo, the man in the costume who played the main puppeteer.
Nick Rascone hugs two other actors and suddenly, crying, falls into their arms: the emotional load of the show finally fell on him.
"It's all right," one of the women whispered.
“We know you have a good heart.
You had a reason for that.”
Later, the audience sat down to dinner with the actors.
At one table, a white couple from Atlanta is discussing a lively show with a black couple they have just met.
Deniza Daplinsky finds it hard to find the words to describe how she feels after the performance.
“It’s hard to listen to these horrible, horrible words and actions... people who look like you and who do it because they look like you,” she says.
"After that, I think lynching is still happening," she adds, "only now it's called what the police are shooting at."
In the other corner of the room, the general attention was captured by Tyrone Brooks, who recalls his work as a human rights defender behind the food.
He says he has already started planning for next year’s show.
“The setting inspires us because it not only describes the horror of what we have experienced, but also teaches us,” he says.
“Because if you don’t learn this lesson, it can happen again.
Those who do not study their history, those who do not know their history, are doomed to repeat it.
The court fined Navalny for violations on the "agitation Saturday"
The Simonovsky court of Moscow fined Alexey Navalny 300,000 rubles for violating the order of the organization of the rally.
The opponent was found guilty of committing the administrative offence provided for in Section 8 of Article 20.2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of the Russian Federation "Recurrent violation of the order of the organization of the rally".
Earlier, the judge of the Simonovsky court of Moscow, Khyzyr Mussakayev, has completed the administrative case against Leonid Volkov, the head of the opposition's staff, Alexei Navalny, who was prosecuted under the same article as Navalny.
Wolfov was found guilty and sentenced to a fine of 300,000 rubles.
In such an amount, Judge Mussakayev appreciated the distribution of leaflets on the "agitation Saturday", which supporters of Navalny held in Moscow on July 8-9.
Having seen the agitative materials, the policemen who followed the participants of the Saturday thought that the organizers of the event deliberately concealed its true essence - public action (for the conduct of which it is necessary to ask the permission of the capital authorities in advance).
Leonid Volkov and his lawyers Ivan Zhdanov and Aleksandr Pomazuev petitioned for the cessation of administrative proceedings due to the absence of the composition of the offence and indicated that the police made certain mistakes in the drafting of the protocol.
Volkov was not detained on the very "promotion Saturday", but he received an order requiring him to appear at the police station to talk about the event held with his active participation.
The same orders were given to Navalny himself and another associate of the opposition - Nikolai Lyaskin.
In Mordovia arrested the shooter of the bride and three wedding guests
A court in Mordovia arrested a local man who shot four people at the wedding, including the bride.
This was reported in the Republican Office of the Investigative Committee.
The incident took place on the evening of July 29.
During the quarrel, a 42-year-old resident of Saransk shot several times at the guests of the events that came to the rural pond to bathe.
As a result, three women and one man were injured.
A criminal case has been initiated under paragraph "a" of part 1 of Article 213 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation ("Hooliganism"), part 3 of Article 30 and paragraphs "a", "e", "i" of part 2 of Article 105 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation ("An attempted murder of two or more persons, committed in a generally dangerous manner, on hooliganic grounds").
According to Interfax, local media reported that the man opened the shooting because the guests of the wedding, decided to bathe, walked through the territory of his site to the water reservoir.
Ministry of Energy to tighten requirements to suppliers of turbines for power plants
The Ministry of Energy of the Russian Federation will update the rules for providing information to suppliers of critical equipment, in particular turbines for power plants.
When launching gas turbines, turbines, oil pumping and oil production facilities, equipment suppliers will be obliged to share data on access to it with the Ministry of Energy and the Federal Service for Technical and Export Control.
The draft government decree has already been prepared and submitted for public discussion.
The new requirements will only concern “critically important energy equipment” supplied to Russia.
Potential threats in the document are mentioned such phenomena as obtaining information and access to the management of the facility by foreign intelligence services, criminal elements and structures, dishonest partners and hackers.
The European Union has extended anti-Russian sanctions because of Siemens
The EU press service said on August 4 that anti-Russian sanctions were extended due to the scandal surrounding the supply of Siemens-produced turbines to the Crimea.
This was previously reported by "Arguments of the Week".
The press service of the Council of the EU said that the sanctions against the Russian Federation have been extended due to the scandal with turbines produced by Siemens, which were allegedly delivered to the Crimea in order to circumvent the sanctions.
Today, the Council of Europe considers all possible complaints and proposals of member countries on the extension of anti-Russian sanctions.
Earlier it was reported that the final decision will be made until the end of the current day, and now the decision has been made, sanctions against Russia have been extended.
Pearson cuts another 3,000 jobs and cuts dividends to bring business back to life
On Friday, the Pearson Education Group announced that it would cut another 3,000 jobs and cut preliminary dividends by 72 percent in connection with the launch of another restructuring program aimed at tackling the challenges facing their business.
These job cuts, which, according to CEO John Fallon, will mostly occur in late 2018 and early 2019, are in addition to the 4,000 jobs cuts in the previous restructuring.
Pearson announced plans to cut spending by another <0xC2><0xA3>300 million ($394 million) in May during its third spending cut program to try to bring back to life a business hit by a rapid transition to digital learning.
The company, which last month agreed to sell its stake in Penguin Random House to its partner, Bertelsman Group, said its forecasts for the year remained unchanged after announcing a 1 percent increase in sales of the main commodity in the first half of the year.
Attack on a convoy in Kabul: NATO soldier killed in suicide bombing
According to official sources, the suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital, Kabul, killing one NATO soldier and wounding several others.
Five soldiers and a translator were wounded, NATO said in a statement.
According to unchecked local sources, three civilians were also killed in the incident in the Karabakh district.
The blast is the last of the bloodshed in Afghanistan this month: more than 30 people were killed in a blast at a mosque in Herat on Tuesday.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
According to NATO, the explosion, which occurred in the evening of Thursday, occurred when a joint convoy with the Afghan army was attacked with the help of a “man-carrying homemade explosive device.”
All the wounded are reportedly in stable condition and undergoing treatment at a U.S. military hospital near Bagram Airport.
Reporters report that the growing power of the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State (IS) in Karabakh is the main source of concern for NATO forces stationed near Baghram.
According to the UN, in the first half of 2017, there were at least 1,662 civilian casualties in Afghanistan, and about 20% of them in the capital.
At the end of July, a suicide bomber blast in a car killed at least 30 people in the Shia district of Kabul.
The Taliban said the attack was carried out by them.
On May 31, a powerful explosion in the city centre killed more than 150 people, the most serious attack in the country since the United States-led Taliban was removed from power in 2001.
The violence highlights the unreliable situation in Afghanistan, while U.S. President Donald Trump is evaluating whether to increase the number of U.S. military forces providing assistance to troops and police in the country.
According to reporters, the terrorist attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also created a crisis of public confidence in the government, its conduct, and especially the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
The Environmental Protection Agency cancels the decision to postpone the adoption of the law on air pollution
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has cancelled the decision to postpone the adoption of an Obama-era law that states should limit air polluting emissions a day after 15 states sued the agency over the move.
On Wednesday evening, the Environmental Protection Agency announced its decision to implement the so-called "ozone measurements - 2015", stressing that this step shows the agency's willingness to cooperate with states.
“We believe in dialogue with our partners in the states and responsiveness to them,” said Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency.
In June, Pruitt announced the Environmental Protection Agency’s intention to delay measurements of ozone, in which existing air pollution is measured in different parts of the country, to determine where it needs to be reduced to meet the more stringent air purity standards of 2018 by one year.
On Tuesday, a group of 15 states, mostly democratic, along with the Federal District of Columbia filed a lawsuit alleging that the intent was illegal.
The administration of President Donald Trump is trying to roll back a wide range of environmental regulations introduced by previous President Barack Obama as part of a broader program aimed, according to Trump, at bright economic growth.
But actions in this direction have sparked resistance from Democrats and environmental organizations concerned about the possible impact of large emissions on public health.
The Environmental Protection Agency’s website says the use of ozone-containing air for breathing “may worsen lung function and aggravate respiratory symptoms,” such as asthma.
European Business Association opposes new anti-Russian sanctions
The European Business Association has expressed its disagreement with the economic sanctions of the United States against the Russian Federation.
According to the AEB, such measures could lead to a serious reduction in production and the number of jobs.
The AEB statement said business is one of the important linkages between countries and people, so the principles of free trade cannot be restricted.
The European business unites more than 500 companies from the European Union and the European Free Trade Association.
The association calls on the heads of state and government of the EU, the US and Russia to develop a new line of behavior that would separate business from politics and find a common, mutually acceptable solution in the spirit of peace and harmony.
Deputies ask the police to restrict the movement on the waterfront in Pskov
Pskov People’s Elections sent an appeal to the head of the Ministry of Interior for the city of Sergei Surin about the problem of movement along the embankment of the Great River.
Deputies of pride Konstantin Bolotin, Grigory Storenkov and Valery Lesnikov believe that motorists prevent people from walking and resting in this place.
In their opinion, the control of the drivers will help make this territory more calm and safe.
The problem is that the offenders ignore the signs of the “walking path” and ride freely on the waterfront.
It turns out that major repairs and improvements have been carried out in vain.
Sports and children's playgrounds due to cars become uncomfortable.
As noted by the Pskov Information Agency, in the evenings the central promenade is patrolled by PPS motor patrol personnel and companions.
Thanks to them, the number of passing cars becomes less, but the entire traffic does not stop.
Putin urges investigative authorities not to remove hard drives
Russian President Vladimir Putin has proposed banning investigative authorities from removing servers and hard drives from work computers in enterprises.
This was stated by the head of state at the meeting on investment programs for the development of the Far East.
According to the president, it is necessary to "exclude the application in the interest of the investigation of measures leading to the suspension of the activities of enterprises, including the removal of hard drives from working computers and servers".
Putin noted that if investigators have such a need, "it is enough to take copies, assure them and use them during the investigation".
The head of state added that it is not possible to "create conditions that impede the continuation of the activity of the enterprise until the impossibility of paying taxes".
Olga Buzova told how much she wanted to call her ex-husband
TV host Olga Buzova admitted that she really wanted to call her ex-husband - footballer Dmitry Tarasov.
Currently, the celebrity is in the United States, where he deals with work issues.
On the eve of her visit to Las Vegas, Olga decided to publish a post on the social network Instagram.
She reported that she was not married, did not get new tattoos, and did not name her ex-husband with words that he had ruined her life, although she was very keen to do so.
Buzova said that she will remember this trip forever, because she had a great time.
British actor Robert Hardy has died
British actor Robert Hardy, who played the minister of magic Cornelius Fadge in the screening of a series of novels about Harry Potter, has died at the age of 92.
This was reported by the newspaper “Independent” on Thursday.
The actor's death was reported by his relatives.
According to them, he lived a "huge life, achieving success in film, theater and television over 70 years of career."
Hardy was born in 1925 in the English resort town of Cheltenham.
In 1959, on the stage of the Royal Shakespeare Theatre, he played with Lawrence Olivier in The Tragedy of Coriolanus.
Hardy has also been remembered for repeatedly playing the roles of Prime Minister Winston Churchill, including in one of Agatha Christie's screenplays of Miss Marple.
For his role in the BBC television drama Winston Churchill: The Wilderness Years (1981), he was awarded the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA).
Robert Hardy has also played the role of U.S. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt on several occasions.
Something rotten in the Danish state: Prince Henry, and in fact Henry Marie Jean André, Count de Laborde, refused to be buried with his wreath-bearing wife, Queen Margrethe.
This year, the couple has a "golden" wedding, but on the couple's agenda - not preparations for celebrations, but a heated argument.
His Majesty renounced the title of Prince Consort, while he pleaded with the Queen that she had never claimed him the title of King Consort.
Henry lives in France, although he remains officially the Queen's wife.
Russia's Foreign Ministry urged Washington to stop shelling Moscow
The Russian Foreign Ministry responded to the statements of Mike Pence, who accused Moscow of trying to destabilize the Balkans.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement in this regard some time ago.
In his commentary, the Foreign Ministry pointed out that the United States is increasingly using the stamps of the Cold War, inadequate to modern reality.
In addition, Russian diplomats urged the US authorities to stop shelling the Russian Federation.
U.S. Vice President Mike Pence accused Moscow of trying to destabilize the Western Balkans and organizing a failed coup d'état in Montenegro.
Mikey Garcia and Vasily Lomachenko meet for the first time, there is a conversation about the possibility of a decisive fight
Vasily Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who seemingly are steadily moving towards having the most exciting boxing match weighing up to 147 pounds in the near future, met for the first time on Thursday.
They occupied separate rooms in the offices of the ESPN channel in Los Angeles until Garcia, the undefeated World Boxing Council lightweight champion, walked the corridor to greet Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization’s champion in the second round.
After Garcia’s unanimous victory over former world champion Erien Broner in the four weight categories on Saturday on Showtime, both boxers are in the top five regardless of the weight categories.
Garcia stretched out his right hand and said, “How are you, champion?
Good luck to you.”
Lomachenko defends his belt in a fight with Miguel Mariaga on Saturday at seven o’clock on ESPN.
When the boxers posed for the photo, Lomachenko manager Egis Klimas noticed that a potential decisive battle between them would be the very first.
“I used to be half light,” Garcia recalled.
“I got into the category for the Bronner [up to 140 pounds], but I’m not that big.
I'm not good for 140.
I want to go down to half-light.
And he has to climb to half-light [up to 135 pounds], and then we'll have a fight.
That's what the fans want.
Let’s make it for them.”
Lomachenko agreed.
“Boxing needs this fight.
Klimas asked whether the fight should be broadcast through the PPV service, as part of the strategy that he adheres to, so that Lomachenko spent his debut fight in weight 135 later this year, to appoint next summer a meeting with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts), who is also interested in battling the victory.
“The fight may be on the PPV because all the fans have asked for it,” Garcia said, later expressing his readiness to fight on the channel that will offer the best financial conditions.
“We are the main names.
No other name will be of such interest.
As soon as they are ready...”
Garcia said he considers Lomachenko a “great boxer” and may visit his Saturday match.
But Lomachenko did not immediately sprinkle Garcia with praise and said that, in his opinion, the three-weight champion from Riverside looks "very slow, sorry, Mikey ... you asked for a knockout".
Garcia said he focused on showing the force of the blow, and then boxing.
They both said they felt the tension rising before their own fight.
“This fight has to take place.
No other fight has caused so much interest and conversation.
I’m more than happy to work on it,” Garcia said.
Lomachenko said: “I was expecting someone from the top boxers, and here he is, Mikey.
It will be a great fight.”
On several central streets of Moscow will block the movement for the weekend
This weekend, August 5 and 6, the movement will be restricted in the capital on the section of Tverskaya Street from Nastasyinsky Avenue to Triumphal Square, as well as the movement on the 1st Tverskaya-Yamskaya Street.
In addition, the trip will be closed on Leningrad Avenue, from the Third Transport Ring to the 1st Tverskaya-Yamskaya Street.
In all areas, the closure will operate on both lanes, according to the information center of the Moscow Department of Transport.
Streets will be closed from midnight on August 5 to 5 a.m. on August 7 due to their improvement.
Also on the weekend, traffic will be closed on the section of the Moskvoretskaya embankment.
There continues the construction of the park "Zaraziye".
Putin instructed the Prosecutor General to check Baikal
Russian President Vladimir Putin instructed the Prosecutor General’s Office to conduct an inspection of the territory of Baikal on the facts of illegal and environmentally harmful activities.
“I ask the Prosecutor General’s Office to inspect the Baikal Territory for the facts of illegal and environmentally harmful activities,” Putin said at a meeting on environmental development issues in the region.
In addition, the Russian leader asked to take action if the facts of the violations are revealed.
New test results for assessing the age of asylum seekers in Sweden published
Recent test results from asylum seekers in Sweden, who have been subjected to a new method of medical age assessment, show that more than 80 percent of the tested have been evaluated as persons over the age of 18, but not everyone trusts the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish National Agency for Forensic Medicine (Rättsmedicinalverket) began testing earlier this year.
They were designed to make the age assessment in the asylum process more accurate after the Swedish Migrationsverket criticized it for failing to determine the actual age of some refugees who claimed to be minors.
To date, the Migrationsverket has submitted 6,880 cases for testing, and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of 2,481 tests for the period between mid-March and 31 July 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) of those tested were assessed as being 18 years of age or older, and in another 25 cases, the Forensic Medicine Agency assessed that the person tested was “probably 18 years of age or older.”
In the case of 432 cases, the conclusion stated that the person “probably less than 18”.
Tests are only carried out in cases where the age of a person raises doubts.
According to Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results are consistent with the results of the past few months.
“We don’t see much difference with the statistics over the past months, the numbers are quite appropriate,” he told The Local.
The high proportion of cases in which people were assessed as over the age of 18 does not necessarily indicate that asylum seekers lied about their age.
In May, the agency published the results of 581 tests and reported that in 442 cases “most likely the age of 18 years or older”.
However, looking at 581 published results, the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet found that in 243 cases, the person openly stated that he was 18 this year.
The method of medical age assessment, consisting of x-raying wisdom teeth and tomography of the knee joints and giving them for analysis to dentists and radiologists, has also been criticized in some instances.
One of the skeptics is an endocrinologist from the Claude Marcus Karolinska Institutet, part of whose work is assessing the biological maturity of people to determine whether they have gone through sexual maturation earlier or later than normal.
“I had reason to think about it, and I don’t think we need to use the measurement methods that are being used now.
The biological age is thus determined very inaccurately.
If we can’t determine it with certainty, we shouldn’t pretend we can,” he told Metro.
However, Göranssen of the Forensic Medicine Agency said in favor of the accuracy of the tests: “In general, it can be said that the risk of mistakenly taking a child as an adult is small.
The greatest risk we face is when a person is soon 18, in which case he is about 10 percent.”
I'm wondering if I'll run for president.
During his work trip to Buryatia, Vladimir Putin said he was ready to consider whether he would run for the post of president of Russia in the 2018 election, Interfax reported.
This statement was a response to the request of residents of the village of Cheremushka of the Buryat region.
During a video conference dedicated to the elimination of the fire in Buryatia and Irkutsk region, the interlocutor addressed Putin with the words: "Vladimir Vladimirovich, we have a request to you: when the next presidential election will be, we all ask you to run for this post again."
“Okay, I’ll think about it, thank you,” the president said in response.
On July 28, the press secretary of the President of Russia Dmitry Peskov commented on the statements of some media that the election staff of Vladimir Putin will be headed by the head of the administration of the President of the Russian Federation Anton Vino.
Peskov called these assumptions “unfounded, hypothetical reasoning.”
"There are no headquarters yet, far from the establishment of headquarters, far from the election campaign," Peskov said.
"Until it is not on the agenda," Peskov said.
Governor of West Virginia says he is moving to another party
West Virginia Governor, Democratic Party spokesman Jim Justis announced Thursday at a rally involving President Trump that he is moving to another party.
"Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have moved away from me," Justice said.
“Today I say to you with many prayers and many reflections...Today I say to you, the people of West Virginia: I can no longer be useful to you as a Democratic governor.”
The rally exploded with applause.
“So tomorrow I’m going to change my registration to a Republican,” Justice added.
“As a coach, I would tell you that it’s time to play differently.”
Earlier, Trump promised that an important statement will be made at the rally in West Virginia.
Trump won West Virginia with a 42 percent lead, and Justin did not support Democratic Party candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, who according to Forbes is the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states since he inherited the coal business from his father.
His fortune is estimated at $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee issued a statement Thursday night that “Governor Justin’s transition to another party is another blow to the Democratic Party, which is more of an obstacle than a work to make our country great again.”
“Given only 15 governors and control over the smallest number of state legislatures in history, Governor Justin’s statement is just another rejection of a party that has no leaders from above and is unable to find a positive, unifying message,” the party’s spokeswoman said in a statement.
A cat named Mr. Beautiful found a home thanks to social networks
A nursery in the city of Pittsboro (North Carolina, U.S.A.) built a cat named Mr. Beautiful that weighed more than 14 kilograms after it became famous thanks to the Internet.
This is reported by Mashable.
At the end of June, a photo of the cat was posted on Facebook asking to find its owner, because "it was clearly someone fed it before."
In the comments, users noted that the expression of the animal's whiskers could become a new meme.
The post received more than 3,200 likes and 15,000 comments.
In the comments, dozens of people expressed the desire to host Mr. Beautiful.
As a result, he was handed over to Angela Frazee, who promised to take care of his excess weight.
In an interview on WNCN radio, the American woman said that she had already had a similar experience: she took home a cat weighing about 10 kilograms, and now it weighs just over five.
In July, Reddit users turned their attention to a cat from Australia with unusually long paws.
A post with a photo of the animal gathered more than 68,000 views.
The commentators noted that she could well have made a career in the modeling business.
Coe praised Russia's "sincere" apology over doping scandal
International athletic specialist Sebastian Coe on Thursday praised what he called a sincere apology from Russia over the doping scandal, but reiterated that this is not the right time to allow the country to participate in sports competitions again.
Russian representative of the federation of athletics Dmitry Shlyahtin announced at the congress of the International Association of Athletics Federations, which took place on the eve of the World Championship of Athletics, that the removal of his country from the sports competitions was fair and that he is determined to fight.
He apologised to “all the athletes whose gold and silver medals were stolen in competitions.”
Despite his comments, Congress of the International Association of Athletic Federations voted to maintain the suspension imposed in November 2015 after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) published a report on evidence of state-funded doping.
“It seemed to me that today’s response, today’s report, was very sincere,” Coe, president of the International Association of Athletic Federations, told reporters.
“All the council and all the congress liked ... that the Russian Federation itself recognizes that it was going through extremely hot times and is now doing everything possible to take care of the restructuring of the federation.”
Kow said he also “liked” that Russia had agreed to the criteria for its recovery.
“I think it was a very constructive day and that we are moving forward, but Congress supports the recommendations of the special commission that this is not the time to restore Russia to its rights,” Cow said.
“In the next few months, we have to do everything we can to resolve this situation.
Our guiding principle was our desire to separate clean athletes from the stained system,” he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes, meeting the strict criteria of the International Association of Athletics Federations, will participate under a neutral flag in the World Athletics Championships, which will begin on Friday in London.
The head of the special commission of the International Association of Athletic Federations, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that a number of requirements have yet to be fulfilled for the reconstruction of Russia.
He told reporters in London after a report made on the board of the International Association of Athletic Federations, narcotics testing is still not carried out on a sufficient scale, and the suspended coaches are still doing their job quietly.
The court arrested the Ukrainian journalist, suspected of stateism
Detained by the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), journalist Vasily Muravitsky has been detained for two months, the SBU reports.
An employee of the Internet publication "Journal of Zhytomyr" is suspected of state treason by posting his publications on Russian websites and in an attack on the territorial integrity of Ukraine.
At the same time, Russia does not support the measures taken by the Ukrainian authorities against the journalist, considering it to be a “barbaric policy” against the media.
Two years after the peak of the migration crisis in Europe, Italy decided to undertake a limited military operation in the Mediterranean.
The patrol ship Commander Borsini entered Libya’s territorial waters to then, together with the country’s navy, stop the influx of illegal migrants.
The decision to start the operation was taken by the Italian parliament on Wednesday.
Rome agreed with the internationally recognized government of Libya, which, however, does not control much of the country.
The opposition cabinet and Tobruk-based Libyan parliament has accused Italy of violating Libya’s sovereignty.
The commander of the Libyan National Army, Field Marshal Haftar, ordered his subordinates to counter the Italian ships.
In Rome, however, they said they do not believe in these threats and intend to send another warship to Libyan territorial waters.
The situation was discussed last week at talks between Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni and the head of Europe-recognized Libyan cabinet Faiz Saraj.
The Italian authorities have set up a maritime mission to combat illegal migration after the statistics on the number of illegal migrants arriving in the country from Libya were published in July: 95,000 people since the beginning of the year.
The government said that the resources for the reception of migrants were exhausted.

Users on Thursday, August 3, began sending massive complaints to the developers of the program.
Microsoft stressed that experts are already actively working to solve the problems faced by residents of Europe and North America, RIA Novosti clarifies.
In June of this year, Skype also experienced a failure.
Users have not been able to receive and send messages for some time.
Two leaders of the Ukrainian national team in athletics suspended from participation in the World Cup
Olga Zemlyak and Olesya Povh, who specialize in short-distance running, are excluded from the Ukrainian national team at the 2017 World Cup in London.
This is reported on the website of the Federation of athletics of the country (FLAU).
This decision was taken by the Executive Board of the organization in connection with the initiation of the International Association of Athletic Federations (IAAF) disciplinary proceedings in respect of athletics.
Trainer Sergei Basenko was also excluded from the Ukrainian delegation.
According to Sportarena, the IAAF suspects an athlete in the use of doping.
Powh is the bronze winner of the 2012 Olympics and the 2011 World Championship, the 2010 European Championship in the relay of 4 to 100 meters, Zemlyak is the winner of the 2012 European Championship in the relay of 4 to 400 meters.
The World Athletics Championships in London will be held from 4 to 13 August.
How the financial rules of football will affect Neymar’s move to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing unlimited spending by European football clubs will not prevent the world record transfer of Neymar from Spanish Barcelona to French Paris Saint-Germain.
Whatever the consequences may come further along the chain, for Paris Saint-Germain by UEFA, the governing body controlling European football, in whose power to ban teams from participating in the prestigious Champions League tournament.
From the financial fair play rules introduced by UEFA in 2011, it follows that PSG will eventually have to show that the transfer of Neymar was financed without major losses.
Barcelona paid 222 million euros ($262 million) just to free the Brazilian from the contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will reach tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some financial aspects of Neymar’s move to France.
PSG can certainly do well to hire Neymar and add him to the galaxy of other stars, given the team’s funding from Qatar’s energetic ruling family.
Clubs have the right to spend large sums on the acquisition of players, but they have to balance them at the expense of legitimate sources of income in order to reach the threshold of profitability in their football business.
FFP introduced Michel Platini after he was elected president of UEFA in 2007.
A former French footballer believed that clubs incurring huge debts in their pursuit of success were essentially cheating and risking ruin if banks or owners stopped funding.
In 2011, FFP stopped focusing on club debt and instead switched to tracking their losses.
As a result of this change, the business model originally used by Roman Abramovich in Chelsea in 2003 – to buy a club with good potential, and then seriously spend it to improve the team and create a global brand – became a difficult plan.
During the current three-year assessment period, which is exciting in 2018, clubs can incur losses of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>30 million.
And despite the fact that Platini was shamefully removed from the presidency in 2015, his successor in UEFA Alexander Ceferin is still determined to restrain excessive spending.
“Of course, FFP is alive and we will tighten the rules as we move forward,” Andrea Traverso, who controls FFP in UEFA, told Associated Press last week.
Although PSG will pay for the redemption of Neymar’s contract at the same time, he can allocate this amount for accounting purposes throughout the duration of his contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so the transfer value can be shown in the annual report as costs of 44.4 million euros over the next five years.
During the first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 against PSG, as well as the Abu Dhabi-owned Manchester City, severe sanctions were applied.
PSG was fined <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>60 million ($82 million at that rate), which was later reduced to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>20 million, and was ordered to limit the composition of its team in the Champions League during the 2014–15 season by 21 players instead of the usual 25.
UEFA is tracking clubs that may try to override its financial inspections by inflating their revenues at the expense of companies affiliated with the club’s owners.
Although the Qatari company could have sponsored PSG, if the amount of funding was considered higher than the standard market rates, UEFA would not allow it to be considered a legitimate income.
This is exactly what happened in 2014 when UEFA decided that the amount of funding from the Qatar Tourism Authority was inflated.
It was reported that part of Neymar’s earnings at PSG could come in the form of payments from the organizational committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.
But PSG and Qatar 2022 deny that Neymar will be the ambassador of the World Cup, and such a maneuver could easily be detected by UEFA inspectors.
Past sanctions imposed on PSG mean that UEFA will be even more attentive to any attempts to circumvent the rules.
According to figures familiar with the situation on Thursday, UEFA did not conduct preliminary discussions with PSG about the transfer of Neymar.
They spoke to the Associated Press on condition of anonymity, as they are not authorized to discuss the position of PSG.
According to the latest published report, in 2015-1016, PSG received more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>10 million in profits with a turnover of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>542.4 million.
The report for the last financial year has not yet been published.
PSG expects the arrival of Neymar to be a favorable ground for sponsorship deals, the sale of attributes and T-shirts with the team’s logo.
The club expects the turnover to grow by at least 30 percent as a result of hiring a new player.
Undoubtedly angry at the departure of one of the best footballers, the Spanish league tried to prevent Neymar’s transfer, saying that PSG would violate the financial fair play.
"This is an obvious case of 'financial doping', with the club and the state," La Liga president Javier Tebas told the Spanish newspaper AS, bearing in mind that the ultimate owner of PSG is Qatar.
Arsenal coach Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by the American sports mogul, shares La Liga's doubts about the club's funding by the state.
“It’s all the consequences of participation, and it has completely changed the football landscape over the last fifteen years,” Wenger said on Thursday.
“When the club belongs to the country, everything is possible.
It becomes very difficult to observe financial fair play, because the country can have many ways and many reasons to be represented by such a serious player.
The order and place of the oath will be determined by the President
Where and how new Russian citizens will swear allegiance to the Russian Federation will be determined by the President - such amendments to the second reading of the relevant law have been developed by the State Duma Committee on Law and State Administration.
A week ago, deputies planned to directly determine the procedure for making an oath in the law.
Children under 18 years of age will be released from the solemn oath, as well as incapacitated, follows from the revised text of the amendments to the draft law "On the citizenship of the Russian Federation" (at the disposal of "News"), which the committee will consider on July 11 before the second reading at its meeting.
The idea of introducing an oath at the time of becoming a citizen of the Russian Federation instead of formally signing the documents was supported by President Vladimir Putin on June 6 during a meeting with State Duma Speaker Vyacheslav Volodin.
The deputies issued this idea in the form of an amendment to the second reading of the draft law, the 2nd law, which provides for the abolition of the decision on the issuance of citizenship to those who were subsequently convicted of a number of crimes of a terrorist or extremist nature: for example, for public appeals to terrorism or its public rights.
According to the draft law, its logic was this: by issuing documents for citizenship, a person signs under the promise to comply with Russian legislation - he has taken the path of extremism, he violates this promise.
The bill was submitted to the State Duma in April by the leaders of the Duma factions Vladimir Vasilyev ("United Russia"), Gennady Zyuganov (KPRF), Vladimir Zhirinovsky (LDPR), Sergey Mironov ("Fair Russia") and the speaker of DG Vyacheslav.
On May 19, the deputies adopted it at first reading.
Last week, the Committee of the DG on State Construction and Legislation approved the text of the draft law for second reading, but now it has been revised again.
Now it says that the procedure for taking the oath will be established by the President of the Russian Federation.
Earlier, parliamentarians were going to describe the procedure directly in the law "On Russian citizenship", indicating that the ceremony should be held in a solemn setting in front of the state coat of arms and the flag of Russia in the presence of a representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
However, it was not clear from the text of the bill where such an event should take place - the list of places where it is possible to place the coat of arms of the Russian Federation, is regulated by the relevant federal constitutional law.
These include courts, offices of heads of state bodies of entities, municipal entities, judges, prosecutors, heads of federal executive bodies, etc.
Most likely, it could also be ZAGS.
Those wishing to obtain Russian citizenship will take a solemn oath after officials have verified their documents.
But the Russian passport a person will receive only after making an oath, follows from the revised text.
A week ago, the draft said that the oath should precede the signing of the decree.
The updated text says that Russia will be sworn in from the age of 18, not from 14.
There remains a rule that those who are incapable or limited in their ability to act, as well as those who cannot pronounce, read or hand-sign the text of the oath, will be exempted from taking the oath.
In addition, the President of the Russian Federation has the right to exempt from this procedure and "other persons",
Also, the updated draft law stipulates a special procedure for receiving Russian citizens from residents of Ukraine, who are considered to be native speakers of the Russian language.
They will have to officially renounce Ukrainian citizenship by submitting a corresponding application to the authorized body of Ukraine.
A notarized copy of the application will need to be transmitted to Russian officials.
A waiver of "foreign" citizenship, as it is now, will not be necessary if it is provided for by an international treaty or if it is not possible "for reasons beyond personal control".
The corresponding amendment to the law was proposed by a group of deputies, among which the first Deputy Speaker of DG Ivan Melnikov (KPRF), Natalia Poklonskaya, Pavel Krasheninnikov and Ayrat Farrakhov (all - "United Russia").
I think many of you know that getting a certificate from Ukraine is unrealistic, just impossible.
Accordingly, many people are waiting for the decision of their fate on the citizenship of the Russian Federation, - explained the head of the Duma Committee on State Construction and Legislation Pavel Krasheninnikov (ER).
In addition, the text clarifies that restrictions on the occupation of certain positions for foreigners will not apply to those who in writing refused the "other" citizenship and handed over the former passport to the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs, but "for reasons not dependent on it" it did not cease to be considered a citizen of another country.
Foreigners are now prohibited from occupying positions in the municipal service, to be hired at facilities and in the organization whose activities are related to ensuring the security of Russia.
Also, a person with dual citizenship or residence permit of another country may not become a deputy of the State Duma or a member of the Federation Council.
It is planned that the law should enter into force from 1 September 2017, by that time the necessary sub-legislative acts should be ready.
Nostalgia becomes a niche in "Hot American Summer" and "Friend of Detective"
The current iteration of history is nostalgically reminiscent simultaneously of the glorious days of the characters in the 80s; of the era of grunge in the 90s (approximately at a time when the prominent masters David Wayne and Michael Schowalter made a comedy sketch "The State" for MTV; and of the very
As a fact of culture, it is at the same time the rise and embodiment of our era with its constant reminders from Facebook.
But as a franchise, it seems like an anachronism.
“First Day at the Camp” was surprisingly good, and not just because of the absurdist humor (including the original story of a talking jar of vegetables voiced by H. John Benjamin).
The result doubles the main joke: middle-aged actors play sexually preoccupied children who have just reached adulthood; as a result, the inability to return to becomes part of the joke.
Ten Years Later, where adults played adults, has less deep emotional roots, and its parody is more unsystematic and includes riffs from stalker movies of the 1990s like Hands swinging the cradle.
In one episode, the character gets an Apple Powerbook, four-wheeled roller skates and "a bunch of other things from 1991".
Many of the storylines are the same.
Good Coop (Shawalter), now a writer, has not yet achieved reciprocity from Katie (Marguerite Moro).
Victor (Ken Marino) still hasn’t broken up with virginity.
And then there’s the mad and vicious conspiracy involving Ronald Reagan (also Shawn), who is now instigated by George Bush Senior (a tried-and-tested parody by Michael Ian Blake).
As always, the best part of the franchise is the withdrawal from it.
It’s especially funny to see the eternally young Rudd singing Matt Dillon’s song from The Lonely Ones, whose character, former big man Andy, now looks like an old woman.
This franchise could bring success to random insanity in the spirit of a type of recursive series "Seven Up" until it reaches what I think would be its logical conclusion: "Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later", where in the last scene "the whole company would go to the movies".
"Detective Comrade" on the Amazon addresses another type of nostalgia: memories of the Cold War from the "Americans", "Explosive Blonde" or even "Gloss" with her images of fighting East and West.
This comedy, created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka and directed by Rees Thomas, depicts a television film: a Romanian police drama of the 1980s about two policemen in Bucharest fighting for truth, atheism and the Marxist-Leninist path.
The main roles – Gregor’s life-seeker and idealist Joseph – are played by Florin Piersick Jr. and Cornelius Ulic, and their dialogues were voiced in English by Channing Tatum (the same executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
That's a brilliant idea.
But only an idea.
There are a few visual jokes (police officers spend time watching a chess game as Americans could watch football).
A team of famous voices behind the scenes - among them Jenny Slate, Nick Oferman, Mahershala Ali and Chloe Sevigny - allows you to play an interesting "guess the voice".
But "Detective Comrade" so clings to the credibility of the clumsy propaganda drama - there's even a killer in Ronald Reagan's mask - that often looks like it.
Six long episodes are lengthy, and funny is not very and not often.
If it were to be shortened, "Comrade Detective" could have done better with his satire in the spirit of agitprop; for example, every time Gregor and Joseph come to the American embassy, two fat people sit in the lobby, swallowing a bunch of hamburgers.
To the imaginary communist spectator, this image tells us that Western culture is capable of making a gluttony out of anything.
The fictional Romanian authors of the film are not so wrong: we do this even with our own recent history, and with them too.
The prize fund of the match for the Super Cup of Russia for football between "Spartacus" and "Locomotive" will be about 30 million rubles.
This was reported by the President of the Russian Football Premier League (RFPL) Sergey Predkin at a press conference.
According to the head of the RFPL, the winner will receive 70% of this amount, RT reports.
He also added that so far there are almost no tickets left for the match.
The Spartak-Lokomotiv match will take place on Friday, July 14, at 21:30.
According to TASS, Spartak is the current champion of the Russian Federation, and Lokomotiv is the owner of the Cup of the country.
Two young Ufims cleaned the furniture shop for 200,000 rubles
The other day, a 37-year-old Ufimet, who has a furniture company, contacted the police.
The man claimed to have stolen expensive tools from the workshop, which caused serious damage to his production.
Prey of thieves became tools with a total cost of almost 200,000 rubles: two welding machines, a perforator, a hydraulics, a winch.
The security guards began to search for the criminals and soon came out to the inhabitants of the Blagoveshchensk district of Bashkortostan, friends of 23 and 24 years.
According to the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Republic, accomplices penetrated into the territory of the enterprise, broke into the front door and took out the tools.
Immediately after that, the guys sold the stolen equipment to the first auto service.
A case of theft has already been initiated against them, and law enforcement officers have managed to return only part of the stolen instruments to the legitimate owner.
The State Department commented on Medvedev's words about the relations between Russia and the United States
The United States and Russia should be able to work with each other.
This statement was made by the official representative of the State Department, Heather Nauert, in response to the words of the Prime Minister of the Russian Federation, Dmitry Medvedev, about the relations between the two states.
Earlier, the head of the Russian government said that, by adopting new anti-Russian sanctions, the United States put an end to the hope of improving bilateral relations and declared the Russian Federation a full-fledged trade war.
Commenting on these words, Nauert acknowledged that Russian-American relations are at a "low level", but noted that it is necessary to look for "areas for interaction".
"Look at the ceasefire in southwestern Syria, which has been observed for almost a month."
"And this is an example of good cooperation between the United States and Russia," the diplomat told RIA Novosti.
At the same time, the representative of the foreign policy department refused to comment on the statement of the Russian prime minister that the sanctions are equivalent to a trade war.
The bill on new sanctions against Russia, Iran and the DPRK President Donald Trump signed last Wednesday.
He admitted that the document was unsuccessful and was contrary to the US Constitution.
Dior "grows" roses from amethyst and quartz
The jewellery division of the French fashion house Dior - Dior Jewellery - has complemented the collections of Rose Dior Bagatelle and Bois de Rose.
There were five new rings and three chokers on velvet ribbons.
The Rose Dior Pré Catelan line features two new rings and a pendant made of amethyst, pink quartz and diamonds, made in the technique of gliptics (hand carving on stone) and veneration and dedicated to the 70th anniversary of the house.
The head of Dior Jewellery, Viktor de Castellan, was inspired by the roses that Christian Dior, a fashion designer, grew on his estate in Granville, and the Parisian gardens of Bagatelle and Pre-Castellan.
Trump has found the culprits of the deterioration of relations with Russia
U.S. President Donald Trump has spoken out against members of Congress.
According to the American leader, their actions led to the deterioration of relations with Russia.
Our relations with Russia are at an unprecedentedly low and dangerous level.
“You can thank Congress, these same people can’t even give us medicine,” he tweeted.
The day before, Donald Trump signed a law on new sanctions against Russia, Iran and the DPRK.
In particular, they will affect Russian banks and energy companies.
Subsequently, the White House disseminated a statement by the president, in which he indicated that the law would not allow the United States to conclude profitable deals and would bring Russia, China and North Korea even closer.
Belarusian entrepreneur refuses to buy Ukrainian daughter Sberbank
Belarusian entrepreneur Victor Prokopenya has withdrawn from the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) an application for the purchase of a subsidiary of Sberbank.
The businessman explained his decision to RBC with the intention of "concentrating on our other planned investments and projects on which we are working".
According to Mr. Prokopeni, such a move will be a “better investment of time”, despite the investment attractiveness of the purchase of Sberbank’s daughter.
Mr. Prokopenya became the main contender for the purchase of the Russian bank in Ukraine after the NBU in July rejected the application of the NorvikBank consortium Grigory Guselnikov and the Belarusian company Said Gutseriyev.
Russian banks began to leave the Ukrainian market after President Petro Poroshenko imposed sanctions on their subsidiaries in March.
One of these financial organizations - in addition to VTB and Vnesheconombank - became Sberbank.
Novak called the reason for the blackout in Crimea
The Ministry of Energy of the Russian Federation called the reason for the blackout in Crimea.
The head of the department, Alexander Novak, made clarifications about the incident.
According to him, the peninsula was without electricity due to a traffic accident on the territory of the Krasnodar region.
The truck hit the power line, resulting in the disconnection of the Cuban and related Crimean networks.
Failures in the electricity supply of major Crimean cities were recorded last week.
The specialists solved the problems within a few hours.
Initially, it was reported that the cause of the blackout could be abnormal heat.
Bank of England to keep interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will not change after weak economic growth and weakening inflation have silenced rumors of a possible rise.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain steady and has left interest rates unchanged amid rising pressure on family income.
Experts from the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted 6-2 to keep rates at 0.25%, with fewer committee members this month in favour of the rate increase because weak economic growth weakened support for the increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the bank limited its forecasts to an increase of 1.7 percent in 2017 and 1.6 percent in 2018 and warned that pressure on family incomes would continue, while inflation is still expected to rise to about 3 percent in the fall.
However, the bank warned that interest rate hikes over the next few years would be needed to control Brexit-induced inflation, and said borrowing costs would likely have to rise more strongly than expected in financial markets.
The committee also voted to abandon part of the huge set of economic development measures launched a year ago as a result of Brexit.
Starting next February, the bank will close a short-term financing plan under which it provides banks with cheap loans, although he has announced that he will now have to provide another <0xC2><0xA3>15 billion under this plan - up to <0xC2><0xA3>115 billion.
In the interest rate decision protocol, the bank said: “According to MPC’s main forecasts, gross domestic product (GDP) growth remains slow in the near future, while pressure on real household income continues to affect consumption.”
On the issue of interest rates, he reiterated that to halt inflation would require “some tightening of financial policies” to “a little more” than markets expect.
At the moment, markets predict the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.
But the bank stressed that all promotions will be “gradual” and “limited”.
The bank’s forecasts for an increase this and next year are lower than the forecasts made in May, which were equal to 1.9% and 1.7%.
The bank kept its forecast unchanged at 1.8% in 2018.
After this news, the sterling fell against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell by 0.5% to 1.31 US dollars and by 0.4% to 1.11 euros.
The decision not to change the rate was taken after the recent disappointing growth indicators weakened the rising expectation was an increase; GDP then rose by 0.3% in the second quarter from 0.2% in the previous three months.
According to the representative of the bank, growth seems to remain at the level of 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will start to increase slightly at the end of the year.
The bank’s latest inflation report gave little reason to rejoice for households, which were hit by high inflation and very minor wage increases: according to the bank, the pressure will increase before it decreases.
The bank added that the financial policy "cannot prevent" earnings over the next few years, but expects wages to "significantly" recover by the end of its three-year forecast.
The economy is also set for growth as a result of growing demand for British goods, due to the low exchange rate of the pound, which offsets part of the lowered consumer spending.
The decision came a year after rates were cut to 0.25% last August after the shocking results of a referendum on leaving the European Union, which resulted in a drop in the pound.
The bank estimates that it will likely take four years to fully impact prices and the economy.
Before the bank made its latest rate decision, there was a rush around the expected rate hike, as inflation put more pressure on households already under strong pressure: three of the experts on the committee asked to raise rates to 0.5% in July.
Inflation fell to 2.6% last month from 2.9% in July, although, according to the bank, this fall was expected and will be compensated again in the coming months.
According to the bank, the higher rate compared to the planned 2% is entirely due to the low exchange rate of the pound.
Andrew Montlake, director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: “Given the recent fall in swap rates, the mortgage market is likely to become even more competitive again, as lenders demand business opportunities and expect a good end to the year.
The market seems particularly favourable for those who are approaching the end of their existing contracts, as refinancing loans, often with the possibility of no commission, as well as low interest rates, is becoming more popular than ever.
The State Health Service will prescribe the controversial drug from HIV 10,000 people
Starting in September, patients will get access to a “revolutionary” drug for HIV prevention after the battle in the High Court on the issue of financing the drug from the State Health Service.
The National Health Service of England has announced that pre-exposure prevention of HIV (PrEP), a pre-sex pill that has been shown to reduce the risk of infection in people at risk by an average of 86 percent, will now be provided by health care.
She agreed to fund the trial after the appeals court backed a High Court ruling last year that argued that the National Health Service had the option to pay for the PEP, despite her claims that it should be funded by local authorities.
The move, which was announced Thursday, was dubbed “the most important innovation” by the president of the National Health Service of England Simon Stevens, and the National AIDS Control Authority (NAT) called it “a turning point.”
Before the full launch of the program across England by April 2018, venerological dispensaries in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to register people, and even more dispensaries will join the program in October.
Pre-exposure prevention (PrEP) is a course of HIV medications taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Studies have shown that PEP significantly reduces the risk of HIV infection among people at risk.
When taking PEP before sex in the human body, a sufficient number of certain drugs to prevent infection with HIV infection.
Such drugs can be taken daily or no later than two hours before sex.
Patients entitled to the drug include homosexual and bisexual men, transgender men, and people whose partners are HIV-positive and do not receive successful treatment.
Dispensers will select suitable participants who have agreed to participate in the study, including men, women, transgender people and people whose partners are not known whether their HIV status is restrained by antiretroviral therapy.
People living and assigned to a general practitioner in England will also be able to apply for potential participation in the nearest venerological dispensary participating in the program.
The program will cost <0xC2><0xA3>10 million, and the National Health Service of England this week after an international procurement tender signed a drug supply agreement.
The study is built in such a way as to evaluate all the possibilities of PEP by collecting clinical data on who is the target audience of the drug, its digestibility and its use on a large scale.
“This is a critical innovation that should complement and strengthen the large-scale and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
This is another milestone in more than three decades of success in tackling one of the greatest health threats facing humanity.
Deborah Gold, president of the National AIDS Control Board (NAT), said: “This is a turning point in the fight against HIV.
PEP, if properly targeting people in need of help and at risk, gives an opportunity to change the situation with the HIV epidemic in England.
Starting in September, people at risk for HIV, thanks to this study conducted in England at the expense of the National Health Service, will have access to a new opening-up tool, the use of which can be controlled by a person without discussing it with many partners, which will lead to a loss.
We warmly welcome this news.”
Ian Green, president of the Terrence Higgins Foundation, said: “Now, first and foremost, we need to make sure that the trial runs quickly across the country and that no one in the HIV risk group is forgotten.
Now that we are equipped with the experimental PEP drug, we are going to protect more than 10,000 people at risk for HIV.”
Shadow Health Minister Sharon Hodgson said: “We very much welcome the start of the PEP test, it is very late due to months of delays and delays on the part of the government.”
The data demonstrate how revolutionary this drug can become as part of our approach to preventing HIV and stopping the transmission of this fatal infection.
This test will bring us one step closer to a full understanding of the benefits of PEP.
It is now important that the trial be deployed nationwide as soon as possible to protect people at risk for HIV and move us one step further towards stopping the spread of HIV in society.
The World Congress of Tatars adopted a resolution on the support of the Treaty of Tatarstan and Russia
The Sixth Congress of the World Congress of Tatars (WTC) adopted a resolution in which it noted the importance of maintaining the post of president in Tatarstan.
According to the document, the post is “a positively established form of organization of the supreme state power in the republic and expressing the national interests of the entire Tatar people”.
In addition, the Congress stressed in the resolution the importance of the treaty on the separation of powers between Russia and Tatarstan.
According to the document, he "played a positive role in the ethno-cultural, socio-economic and socio-political development of Tatarstan and the Russian Federation as a whole".
The contract between Moscow and Kazan, which has been in force since July 24, 2007, has been concluded for 10 years.
On July 11, deputies of the State Council of Tatarstan appealed to the President of Russia to extend the agreement and retain the title of head of the region.
Tatarstan is the only subject of the federation that has a contract with Russia.
The head of the region is the only one whose position is called "president".
In Russia, there were difficulties in obtaining international driver's licenses
GIBDD units are experiencing a shortage of international driving licences (IDLs).
To get such rights, you have to wait in line for several weeks, which has become a real problem for vacationers who want to go on holiday abroad in their car or rent it there.
It is worth noting that the situation with international driving licences remains controversial.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs was introduced to make it easier for the foreign police to understand what was written in the national certificate, as the information in it is explained in five languages.
The requirements of international law are enshrined in the 1968 Vienna Convention on Road Traffic, but in countries that have ratified the Vienna Convention, Russian rights are recognized as such.
However, in fact, it all depends on the specific police or rental offices: some require the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and some enough national rights.
To insure, drivers still receive international rights, but it should be borne in mind that in countries that have not ratified the convention (for example, the United States, Spain, Mexico, Indonesia) the authorities have the right not to recognize either national rights or the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
Now there is a problem with forms in almost all units of GIBDD, reports Kommersant, conducting a study in a number of regions.
Thus, in Moscow, in the units of UGYBDD, card holders are simply not issued, the forms are missing for four months.
You can register for the reception on the website of state services, but there the turn has already extended until mid-August.
In Krasnoyarsk, it is impossible to obtain the Ministry of Internal Affairs "for technical reasons", without going into details, in the Samara region honestly say that there are no forms, a similar situation arises in other cities.
Many Muscovites have already faced the problem, such messages appear more and more often in social networks:
Irina Burmistrova: "Guess why in Moscow you can't get international rights?"
That's right, because all the GIBDD departments have finished the forms.
Elena Podkolzina: "A Question to Knowing People!"
We need international law urgently.
In Moscow, all the time stuck far ahead, on the spot the cards are not issued at all (there is a button, but the card can not give).
Apparently, the public service portal shows that in Spb free time before fig.
Has anyone tried to get it in another city?
Will it work?
As explained in the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation, the requirements for forms of international driving licences have changed, so new forms are delivered to the units of the State Inspectorate.
This may be related to the deficit, although it is unclear what changes are in question, this has not been reported before.
Forms are purchased by the Center for Special Purposes in the Field of Road Traffic Safety (CSN BDD) of the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs and then delivered to the units of GIBDD.
In recent years, all contracts were concluded with JSC "Goznak": in 2014-2015, almost 200,000 forms of the Ministry of Internal Affairs were produced, in 2016 15 thousand forms were purchased, in 2017 - 90 thousand, but the last contract was concluded on July 18 with JSC "First printed court" 70.
There is a version that CSN simply did not have time to hold the tender in time, which is why there was a deficit.
However, there are other versions of the shortage of forms: because of the crisis, many people began to travel independently not to Europe, but to cheaper Asian countries - China, Thailand and so on.
What rights are accepted there, until the end is unclear, so people are reinsured, therefore, there was a hectic demand for international "steps".
It has recently become known that professional drivers will have to pass an exam to confirm their qualifications.
That was the proposal made by the Ministry of Transport.
The new model’s International Driving Licence (IDL) is valid from May 31, 2011.
The Minister of Justice of Ukraine refused to believe in the construction of the Crimean bridge
Ukraine’s Justice Minister Pavel Petrenko said he does not believe in Russia’s ability to build a bridge to Crimea.
About this on Friday, August 4, he said in an interview with the portal "The Observer".
No self-respecting international company will even put a bolt or nut in there, because it risks losing its business in the EU, the US, Japan – in countries that have joined the sanctions against Russia in relation to Crimea.
"That is, in my deep conviction, the prospects of this project are virtually not there," Petrenko said.
He added that he believes Russia is unable to implement a large infrastructure project on its own.
Russia cannot normally build smaller-scale facilities.
I know that after the Olympics in Sochi have already begun to destroy entire stadiums.
“Therefore, I think the best tool in this situation is sanctions against companies that have proven to be so short-sighted as to join this project,” the official said.
On July 31, the builders completed the construction of the arch arch of the Crimean bridge.
On the Kerch coast, the enlarged assembly of the road arch of the Crimean Bridge has been completed: its arch will be closed at a height of 45 meters from the base of the structure.
"At the same time, the bridge builders have prepared a railway arch to be installed on the railings," the project's information center said.
In April, the head of the Ministry of Transport Maxim Sokolov informed the President of Russia Vladimir Putin that the construction of the facility is ahead of schedule.
The Crimean Bridge will connect the Crimean Peninsula and Krasnodar Region.
In Spain, an official who has not been to work for 10 years has been fired.
What kind of angelic patience (or absolute indifference to public service) should the head of the Spanish official, Carlos Resio, have had?
The permanent walk stretched for 10 long years.
However, Mr. Resio was dismissed.
But not his immediate boss.
That’s not what happens in the bureaucracy world.
Residents seem to have long been accustomed to all the jokes of "people's servants".
And yet, officials are always able to surprise those on whose taxes they live well.
This time the "sensation" complained from Spain.
There, the Valencian Archives employee, Carlos Resio, managed to stay out of work for ten years.
He was regularly paid a salary.
And the whole solid - 50,000 euros per year.
And now Mr. Resio's "strange times" are over.
He was dismissed by the Legislative Assembly of Valencia.
The investigation revealed that an angry walker came to the office every working morning at 7:00 a.m. to celebrate in the electronic system.
And I went home right away.
Once again he appeared in the workplace at 4 p.m. to again mark in the system that he had left.
That's 10 years.
It also became known that all the free time the walker devoted to drawing comics at home.
Now the deputies of the Legislative Assembly of Valencia are thinking about how to punish and direct the head of Mr. Resio, who could not but know how to "actively work" in his workplace his subordinate.
Judges are to be protected from presidents.
The Presidential Council on Human Rights (HRC) on behalf of Vladimir Putin has developed proposals to strengthen the independence of the judiciary branch of power.
The OHCHR proposes to limit the powers of the presidents of the courts and to introduce their election.
For courts of appeal and cassation instances, the OHC wants to introduce special districts that will not be bound by administrative-territorial division in the Russian Federation.
His proposals within the framework of the presidential mandate should also be submitted by the Supreme Court.
The OHCHR has completed the development of proposals that will strengthen the independence of the Russian judiciary.
This work was carried out on the orders of Vladimir Putin of January 3, 2017, which the president gave after a meeting with the members of the council.
The meeting with the members of the council on December 8, 2016 discussed, among other things, individual cases of judicial arbitrariness, as well as problems of public control in places of detention of citizens (see "U" of December 9, 2016).
The work of the HRH resulted in 25 proposals, which concern both the independence of judges and the detection of judicial errors, as well as the financing of courts and legal education.
One of the ideas of the Kremlin human rights defenders is to limit the powers of the presidents of the courts to increase the independence of the other judges.
If the candidate for the position of judge has successfully passed the competition and received the support of the judiciary community, the President of the Court, in the opinion of the OHR, should submit it to the appointment, without having the right to refuse, as now allows the law.
It is also proposed to deprive the Chairperson of the right to distribute cases between judges.
To do this, experts allow, can be a specially written computer program.
Also in the HR believe that the chairman is not entitled to "prescribe the results of the qualification assessment of the judge, initiate his involvement in disciplinary responsibility, to make decisions on the establishment of additional material payments".
At the same time, the presidential council considers it necessary to move to "election of the presidents of the courts by the judges themselves" and "assign their powers for a relatively short period with mandatory rotation".
Now all the presidents of the courts (from republican to district) are appointed for six years by the president on the presentation of the president of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation.
In order to protect judges from the pressure of regional administrations, the OHR proposes a new way of organizing appeals and cassations in the courts of general jurisdiction.
Now their structure is tied to the administrative-territorial division in the Russian Federation.
The OHCHR says that "it is necessary to ensure the organization of individual courts of appeal and cassation instances not at the level of regional judicial bodies in subjects of the Russian Federation, but in judicial districts".
Experts take as a basis the practice of arbitration courts.
There are “judicial districts” that do not coincide with the administrative division in the Russian Federation, but that guarantee greater independence from regional officials who find it difficult to use the “telephone right”.
The OHCHR proposes to strengthen the people’s judges in order to consider some “categories of civil and administrative cases” with their participation.
For example, about deprivation of parental rights, about recovery at work, about protection of honor and dignity, about deprivation of driver's license, etc.
"These are only our proposals," explained "U" member of the OHCHR, the judge of the Constitutional Court in the resignation of Tamara Morschakova.
She also recalled that the President’s mandate applied not only to the OHCHR, but also to the Supreme Court (Supreme Court), which has not yet disclosed its proposals.
There is still time for the Air Force (among the co-executors - the Prosecutor General's Office and the Commissioner for Human Rights in the Russian Federation).
To report to Vladimir Putin on how effectively the independence of justice is ensured in Russia, the President of the Russian Armed Forces Vyacheslav Lebedev must by September 1.
Living a high life: a half-floor and cunning design techniques turned this small apartment in Earls Court into a spacious dwelling
Joan Lee, a former banker interested in real estate repairs, moved from a spacious house in Knightsbridge to an apartment in Earls Court in 2014.
The apartment is located on the ground floor of a cute Queen Anne style typical house, and in favor of the new design suggests that Joan has not packed her things and moved again.
“I used to live with my ex in Knightsbridge on a much larger area,” says Joan.
“I was looking for something comparable for my money.
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and there were the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with her and offered her a price on the same day.”
From the moment of the first viewing, the apartment with an area of 1000 square feet has undergone a complete reconstruction.
Initially, it was a one-bedroom apartment with a complex layout – to get into the bedroom, you had to go through the kitchen – and Joanna wanted to add storage space and a half-storey to get the most out of the generous height of the ceilings.
“I wanted high ceilings, big windows, lots of light.
Those were my demands,” she said.
For this purpose, she hired Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill’s architectural design studio “Duck & Shed” to use 12.5-foot-high ceilings and create a home that would not only be a successful project, but would suit Joan for life.
The ceiling was not high enough to accommodate two rooms one above the other, so the architectural task was to create a half-story where you could stand in full growth.
Erfan had to think creatively to cope with the brief.
“Working with steel structures is very difficult,” he explains.
“We had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were one above the other, and we didn’t have to bend.
It was not just necessary to build a simple platform, but to bend the structures so that they were at the right height and allow the use of the rooms above and below.
This decision allowed Erfan to arrange two full-sized rooms one above the other in the space allocated – and a lot more interesting.
From the semi-floor through the vintage copper light window from "Retrouvius" opens a view of the chic living room at the bottom.
Mirror furniture with a golden finish, silver accents and vintage lighting fixtures from Serge Muja set the style of the project.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding spectacle, space and light.
The short corridor is framed by mirrors to make it appear longer.
In the kitchen, a mirrored protective panel looks like a window to another room.
Mirror cabinets at the entrance serve to store all Joan's dishes.
To create a sense of more luxurious space, the beauty of the living room can enclose the kitchen when it is not used.
There is nothing new in folding kitchens.
The uniqueness of this kitchen is that it is a sliding door, like in a garage.
"The engineering art was involved here," Erfan will tell about the reinforced steel of the wood-fibre shield door.
“It’s equipped with a counterweight, so when you push the door up, it slides very easily.”
Thanks to the reasonable use of space and storage space, Joan received an additional 16 square meters, an additional bedroom and improved layout.
“At the end of the day, the floor area is exactly what you’re going to sell, that is, what your property is valued for,” Erfan says.
“Roughly speaking, a real estate agent will come in and make calculations based on the floor area.”
Here they were able to increase the floor area, using quality materials that give the space a nuance of luxury.
“Materials are what we touch, so they help create an emotional connection with the home,” Erfan says.
“No one falls in love with electrical wiring in the walls.
It’s important, but it doesn’t hit the strings of our hearts.”
This serves as a testament to the fact that with a good design and increased footage, the apartment can turn from something ordinary into something amazing.
In fact, like Joan, you can decide to stay.
The Government has approved the establishment of a cultural policy commission
The Russian government has approved the creation of a commission on state cultural policy.
The decree was published on the Government website.
According to the document, the main task of the commission will be to develop and adjust strategic approaches to the implementation of cultural policy.
The Commission will also develop draft cultural policy strategies, clarify objectives and prepare new programmes for its implementation.
The head of the commission appointed the Deputy Prime Minister of the Government of the Russian Federation.
The composition of the committee will be approved separately.
In 2016, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev approved a plan to implement the strategy of state cultural policy until 2030.
The plan includes 193 events and includes measures to expand the influence of Russian culture in other countries, to preserve a single cultural space and cultural heritage, and it will also contribute to the creation of conditions for the development of culture in the country.
G20 Inflation Reduced to Eight-Year Minimum
Consumer prices in the G20 countries have fallen to their lowest levels in eight years, The Wall Street Journal reports, citing data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).
According to the OECD, inflation rates in June 2016 were 2% – lower values were observed in October 2009, when the price growth index reached 1.7%.
Earlier, Rosstat reported a decrease in the Russian consumer price index by 0.1%.
Thus, the department recorded the first weekly deflation in 2017.
The target of inflation in Russia, according to calculations of the Ministry of Finance, is 4.1%.
The Ministry of Economy, however, believes that the target value has already been achieved - according to this department, the figure is 4%.
Putin warns against illegal removal of Baikal taiga
Russian leader Vladimir Putin, during a meeting on the environmental development of the natural Baikal territory, warned against the illegal destruction of forests.
In the course of the event, Minister of Natural Resources Sergey Donskoy noted that a bill had been prepared earlier.
It allows deforestation during the elimination of fires, and the government plans to adopt it as early as the fall.
In turn, the president said that this project should be monitored so that in the process of cutting "not everything is cut out in a row".
Donskoy noted that this bill involves control by the Ministry of Health and Surveillance.
Media: Air Force fighters secretly from the command are negotiating with the militias of the Donbass
Regular telephone communication has been established on the line of armed confrontation in Donbass.
Fighters of the opposing parties are constantly communicating with each other via mobile phones, and do not know about this communication in the headquarters.
Soldiers of the Armed Forces and militias of the Donbass established communication via cell phones secretly from their high command.
This was reported on August 4 by "Strana.ua" with reference to the participants of the military operation in the Donbass.
According to the publication, the commanders of the units perfectly know the names of their colleagues on the opposite side of the front and communicate with them daily by phone.
Communication is not at all domestic: the commanders are trying to reach some "tactical arrangements".
Often, as a result of such talks, there is a truce in a certain area of the front.
Journalists became aware of cases when birthday greetings were given to one or another officer because of the front line, from his formal enemy.
Armed Forces and DPR and LPR militias have been sitting in trenches on the demarcation line since the spring of 2014, when Ukraine launched a combat operation against Donbass.
Foreign Ministry resented the blocking of statements of the UN Security Council about attacks on the Russian embassy
The Russian Foreign Ministry is outraged by the actions of some Western diplomatic representatives, who block statements by the UN Security Council in the press condemning the terrorist shelling of the Russian embassy in Syria.
This is reported by the Russian Foreign Ministry.
The ministry recalled that the territory of the Russian embassy in Damascus on August 2, the third time in a month was subjected to mortar shelling by terrorist groups "Heyat Tahrir Al-Sham" (formerly "Jabhat al-Nusra", banned in the Russian Federation) and "Filak Ar-R".
Taking into account that the international community unanimously qualifies "Nusra" as a terrorist organization, and resolutions of the UN Security Council call for counteracting this structure, the Russian Foreign Ministry noted that "it would seem, of course, that the terrorists of "Nusra" should not be considered as a representative of the universal, unconditional and decisive
However, as emphasized in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, "for the third time in a month the diplomatic representatives of the United States, the United Kingdom, France and Ukraine in the Security Council of the United Nations, in turn, varying the tonality of the objections, covering the arguments about the alleged lack of the necessary information, blocked the proposal of the Russian Federation.
Let the reluctance to show diplomatic solidarity with us remain on the consciences of these delegations.
"The most disturbing thing is that the Security Council's inability to condemn the acts of terrorists encourages them to new provocations and terrorist attacks, makes them feel impunity," the Foreign Ministry said, adding that "it would not be desirable for these barbarians to be persuaded by the Council."
Vladimir Putin advocates limiting the number of unplanned business checks
Russian President Vladimir Putin at a meeting on investment projects in the Far East said that the number of unplanned inspections of entrepreneurs should be reduced to 30% of the planned number, and also said the need to limit the time of inspections to ten days.
“Explanatory checks are carried out, as a rule, without appropriate agreement with the prosecutor’s office; only 2-3% agrees with the prosecutor’s office, everything else goes on its own,” the president quotes TASS.
Vladimir Putin also said investigators should be banned from removing servers and hard drives at enterprises.
In addition, according to the president, business associations should be given the right to defend the interests of their members in court.
"This, I hope, will bring a certain positive to the consideration of cases related to business activity, or related to violation of the law in the sphere of business," - said the head of state.
As reported by "U", due to the action of a moratorium on the conduct of planned inspections, the number of other types of inspections of entrepreneurs is increasing.
In May, on the order of the business ombudsman under the President of Russia Boris Titov, 15% of the respondents were carried out by 195%, as a result of which it was found that the replacement of the planned checks by the unplanned (the share of those confronted with them increased from 21.9% in 2015 to 30.8% in 2016), by the public prosecutors (from 16.9% to 21%).
More about the checks of the business in the material "U" "Small business went on the other side".
Brothers Fight for a $500 Million Real Estate Empire
The two brothers fight for one of Victoria’s largest real estate empires worth more than $500 million — forty years after their Italian ancestors founded a dynasty.
Former director of the Carlton football club and developer Colin de Lutis lives in the Turac Palace through three doors from his younger brother Paul, who filed a lawsuit against him in the Supreme Court for the division of property and assets.
Paul wants to quit the family business since 2014, but the Supreme Court is currently facing a bitter dispute over the terms of the divorce.
Together with their mother Anna, the brothers own 87 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, bought since their family bought a shop on Smith Street in Collingwood in 1973.
There, the family founded Westco Jeans, which grew into a network of 160 outlets.
It was sold in 1999 for $85 million.
The money was invested in real estate, and the list of properties of the De Luís family today includes office buildings, construction sites in Brunswick and Sorrento, apartments on the Gold Coast and in Mount Buller, and shopping centers in the suburbs.
By agreement with his late father, Colin - whom Paul describes as the "main driving force and dominant personality" of the De Lutis family - owns about two-thirds of the company's assets, and Paul owns about one-third.
According to the court, this means that Colin’s property is 316 million, and Paul’s is 176 million.
The division of property and money became a stumbling block for Paul.
“The section proposed by Colin gives him, in my opinion, the best parts of the property,” he wrote in his first testimony in 2015.
On Friday, after several unsuccessful attempts at reconciliation, the first hearings in the Supreme Court took place.
The brothers are now arguing about who will control the existing business – from which, according to Paul, Colin excluded him.
Colin claims that this is not true, but accuses Paul of incompetent management of some facilities.
In the testimony given by Colin at the start of the trial, he says he hopes for a settlement of the dispute.
“My Italian roots make me consider the family a top priority,” he wrote.
The trial costs are growing like a snowy coma: the case involves hundreds of pages of testimonies, emails and reports from companies such as Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer; both sides have attracted the most famous lawyers, including Royal Attorney Allan Myers, and more.
Mrs. De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were immigrants from Italy; from the late 1950s they ran dairy bars and gastronomers, and in the early 1970s they bought a store in Brunswick.
Under financial guarantees, they bought a store in Collingwood, where Colin opened the first family jeans store.
Colin says he started Westco when he was "in the last grades of school, and Paul was a boy then (about 10 years)."
Anna De Lutis says they and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to hand over their possessions to their sons without conflict.
“Luigi has often told me that he doesn’t want the brothers to settle in court,” she wrote.
The other two brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lucis group of companies; Colin says Mark received $10 million when he quit the business, and Luke 26 million.
According to Paul, both Luke and Mark were “dissatisfied with the financial conditions of their office.”
Colin was not a public figure, although he was a former member of the board of directors of the AFL club and, according to the 2015 biography of Eddie McGregor, the best friend of the TV star.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul and their lawyers on Friday.
Only Colin replied with a text message that, since the case had not yet been heard in court, "I really have nothing special to say."
"I am very, very sorry that my brother Paul decided to sue me and to shake our family's name in court," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in his testimony that he was trying to meet his brother's demands.
“Our father wouldn’t want to see Paul and I arguing in court,” he said, adding that he “still hopes for a settlement of the conflict.”
On Friday, that hope was shattered.
“The decision on our case will soon be taken by the court,” Colin wrote.
The new head of Trump’s apparatus plans to limit the receipt of information to the president.
Others tried to do it and were defeated.
Maybe John F. Kelly will do it.
In that case, he will be the first.
The new White House chief of staff plans to limit the flow of information coming to President Trump, including news reports from the media, in hopes of keeping the head in a calmer state.
This is reported by reporter Josh Dawsey.
“At a meeting held by the new White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly with the head of the White House on his first working day, he pointed out the main problem in the White House under President Donald Trump that he hopes to solve: poor channels of receiving information to the president.”
Kelly told officials that information should pass through him — in paper form or through briefings — because the president would be better at making decisions if he received the right information.
Kelly’s diagnosis is absolutely true, but others have already failed in trying to appease Trump by tracking information received from him.
President Trump’s relationship with television began decades ago — and now that he’s in the White House, his habit of watching TV is still strong.
“When Trump, as a candidate, was outraged by unfair coverage of the campaign, it was helpful to show him that he was getting fair coverage in newspapers that could be persuaded,” Politico’s Sam Nanberg, a former campaign advisor, said in February.
Tara Palmer wrote in Politico that “according to six former electoral staff members, in order to keep Trump’s habit of tweeting under control, it was necessary to ensure that there was a constant flow of praise in the information he received personally.”
All right. Okay.
But the idea that Trump’s habit of tweeting has ever been “controlled” is just ridiculous.
Perhaps these election staff members know something we don’t know, such as that if it weren’t for them, Trump’s tweets would have been even more provocative.
We may never find out about tweets that Trump hasn’t posted.
If his staff saved him from trouble at least a few times, their efforts were not in vain.
But no one has always been able to keep Trump from pouring oil into the fire.
Part of the problem is that in the White House, divided into rival factions, people are constantly trying to advance their agenda by providing Trump with material — reliable or not — that confirms their views.
“Politico” – just about this story – wrote in May about the tendency of the advisers to constantly trick the president into dubious information.
Here is an example described by reporter Shane Goldmaker:
“Trump’s current and former employees say Trump can react very sharply to negative press reports, especially those containing dangerous leaks, and won’t calm down until he finds out who was behind them.
This happened at the end of February, when someone handed the president a printout of an article from GotNews.com, an Internet provocateur website by Charles C. Johnson, in which deputy head of state Katie Wales was accused of “standing behind a series of leaks” in the White House.
It doesn’t matter that Johnson is forever banned on Twitter for aggressive behavior, that he didn’t present specific facts, or that in the past he made false accusations and then turned them down.
Trump read the article and began to question staff about Wales.
Goldmacher adds that the then chief of staff Raines Pribus and secretary of staff Rob Porter “tried to build a system to control the flow of papers that Trump receives and document them.”
How did it work?
Three months later, Kelly tries to do the same.
Perhaps he will prove to be a more effective manager than Pribus, but Trump still has an impulsive nature and his aides are still fighting each other for influence.
These constant factors make Kelly’s task very difficult.
Tyumen Prosecutor's Office Fights HIV Dissident
The prosecution challenged the order of the Kalinin District Court of Tyumen, which terminated the criminal case against a local resident whose young daughter died of HIV.
According to the investigation, the child died because the mother was an HIV-dissident and refused treatment.
However, the court acquitted her of her liability in connection with the reconciliation with the injured father.
The prosecution believes that the crime cannot be left unpunished in order not to set a precedent for other HIV dissidents.
The case against the resident of Tyumen was initiated under Article 109 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (cause of death by negligence) in April - after her three-year-old daughter died from HIV infection in stage 4B.
According to the prosecutor’s office, the mother herself is HIV-infected.
"The woman did not treat herself and refused to treat her daughter, believing that HIV infection does not exist," the prosecutor's office of the Tyumen region explained.
The criminal case was brought to the Kaliningrad District Court of Tyumen, which on July 25 decided to terminate it.
The petition was filed by the father of the deceased girl, explaining that "he pardoned his wife, has no claims to her, she smoothed the damage and apologized".
The Prosecutor ' s Office disagreed with the court ' s decision and appealed, demanding that the order to terminate the case be cancelled and referred for a new review.
The girl died, and the damage caused by the crime can not be remedied.
The HIV-infected mother, contrary to the recommendations of the doctors, refused to examine the baby and treat her for a dangerous infection," the prosecutor's press service said.
The Authority believes that it should be punished, otherwise other HIV dissidents will follow its example.
As told in the Tyumen AIDS Center, now in the Tyumen region about 12 children, suffering from HIV, do not receive medical care because of the refusal of parents.
"And this situation has already improved - in the year of work of the special group, half of the parents who categorically refused to treat children for HIV, changed their opinion - allowed to make a diagnosis, began to take drugs," - said the spokeswoman of the Center for AIDS Elena Loseva.
According to her, it is impossible to influence parents in a legislative way, and as a result, not all HIV-infected children can be detected - mothers do not allow them to be examined, hide, flee with children from hospitals.
What are the dangers of HIV dissidents?
At the end of last year, St. Petersburg sociologists presented the results of Russia’s first study of the so-called HIV dissident movement.
HIV dissidents are people who deny the existence of HIV and refuse to take medication.
Doctors and activists of AIDS-service NGOs call such views anti-medical, and in their spread see a serious threat.
The horrific photo shoot, which ended in tragedy, took place on Thursday, August 3, at the Grechana railway station in Khmelnytskyi.
A cheerful company of young smokers was walking on a bridge over the railway tracks, where the freight train was standing.
One of the friends had the idea to take a spectacular selfie on the roof of the car, reported "FACTAM" in the police communication sector in the Khmelnytsky region.
The guy began to descend from the bridge to the train, but because of his carelessness clung to the power line and immediately received a shock.
Fortunately, this case became known to the station manager, who immediately called an "emergency".
Before the arrival of the doctors, the victim was moved to a safe place, and then hospitalized in the burn department of the Khmelnytsky Regional Clinical Hospital.
The man was diagnosed with torso burns of 1<0xE2><0x88><0x92>2 degrees.
His condition is now assessed by doctors as stable.
Law enforcement officials recall that in recent times, extreme selfies on multi-storey roofs, bridges, moving transport have become increasingly popular.
The police urge people to be vigilant and not allow such photo sessions, especially among children and adolescents.
Scientists Allow Oceans to Exist on Ancient Venus
There may have been oceans on ancient Venus.
This is what French scientists have suggested.
Experts have created a computer model that demonstrated the process of water formation on the surface of planets, writes Science News.
It turns out that on Venus, at the beginning of its history, oceans formed, in which there was 10% more water than now on Earth.
Previously, Arguments of the Week wrote that, according to scientists’ hypothesis, the ocean could have existed on Mars 4 billion years ago.
During their research, foreign experts concluded that the water object was located in the northern hemisphere of the Red Planet.
Three people injured in shooting at park in San Francisco
In San Francisco, three people were injured in the shooting, reports the Associated Press.
The incident took place in Dolores Park, where a significant number of visitors were present.

One of them grabbed a gun and started shooting at people.
The appearance of the attackers could not be considered, as they had everything but their eyes closed.
Another was given medical care, after which he was released.
The third wounded is a minor, there are no details about his condition.
Located on the hill Dolores Park is a popular destination among locals and tourists.
On July 1, at least 17 people were injured during a shooting at a nightclub in Little Rock, Arkansas.
A few more visitors were injured while trying to leave the room.
Rock band Louna to release new album in Barnaul
The concert of the rock band Louna will take place in Barnaul on October 17.
The musicians will present their new album "Wonderful New World", which has become one of the most anticipated releases of the year.
The group is preparing a concept show that will be the brightest in the group’s concert history.
"Wonderful New World" is the fourth album by Russian rock band Louna.
Its name is related to the famous novel-anti-utopia of O. Huxley "O Wonderful New World".
The new songs do not retell the book, but tell about a society that lives by the law of anti-utopia, "blind faith in propaganda and imposed values."
To raise money for the recording of the album the group was helped by the audience: on the website "Planeta.ru" the project was supported by more than 1200 people.
Her first album, "Make a Voice!", was released by Louna in 2010.
Two years later, the musicians released the album "Time X", and in 2013 recorded the album "We are Louna" (2013).
In the fall of 2015, Louna performed with a symphony orchestra at Crocus City Hall with the program Songs of Peace.
In the band Lucine Gevorkian (vocals), Vitaly Demidenko (bass guitar), Ruben Kazarian (guitar), Sergey Ponkratiev (guitar), Leonid Kinzbursky (drums).
The concert will take place at the Barnaul Club "Pharaon" on October 17 at 19.00.
Ticket price: from 1200 to 2600 rubles.
Louna is one of the most popular bands on the Russian rock scene.
The team was founded in 2008.
Their debut concert took place in 2009.
The group won several times in different nominations of the "Devil's Dozen" hit parade.
Gypsies overcame the trench and returned to the "street of millionaires"
Some of the wealthiest homeowners in the West Midlands are once again clashing with determined gypsies who have overcome a ditch dug by municipal authorities to reoccupy the field next to their homes.
Gypsies parked 20 homes on wheels in a field bordering the rich Solihull street, which was given the joking name of “Millionaire’s Street.”
Bringing with them horses, infants and many houses on wheels, they returned after being driven out no further than in May, and they were not hindered by the trench dug by the municipal authorities to prevent their invasion.
This tactical company found a breach in the defensive structures and squeezed their vehicles through a section that was left unfenced to leave room for the trail.
Angry residents attacked the municipality of Solihalla, saying it was "unable to solve this problem".
An anonymous local resident said: “They came here in the evening on Monday after being driven out of Bentley Heath, where they threw stones at passers-by.”
The municipality should be embarrassed and forced to act, because they are completely unable to solve this problem.
The Gypsies were here in May, they were driven out, and here they are again.
There were more gypsies last night, and maybe more today.
“Birmingham Municipality knows how to solve this problem, they are getting long-term court orders to protect their parks,” she added.
I live on Streetsbrook Road, and I don’t like that I continue to pay municipal taxes, and the municipality can’t even put an end to that.”
One local resident, wishing to remain anonymous, said: “It’s funny, we just saw these gypsies leave the last time, and here, please, this attack continues.”
This time there were more of them, and we even saw a horse grazing on the meadow.”
A Solihalla Municipality spokesman said: “We are aware of an illegal camp on the ground near Streetsbrook Road and are cooperating with Solihalla Police; we are taking the necessary legal action to drive them out as soon as possible.”
To help us collect evidence, it is very important that as many locals as possible report any anti-social or criminal behavior to the police by calling 101.
This makes it possible to get an idea of the situation that the court will consider when we present our case to them.
Crimea activates the champagne factory "New World"
The SGP of the Republic of Crimea "New World Champagne Wine Plant" has decided to take action, by converting it into OJSC "New World Champagne Wine Plant", following the order of the Minister of Property and Land Relations of Crimea Anna Anyukina.
100% of the company’s shares will remain in the state ownership of Crimea.
The registered capital of the joint-stock company will be 595.5 million rubles and will consist of 5.955 million ordinary shares with a nominal value of 100 rubles each.
The Ministry of Agriculture of Crimea stated that if within the next three years there are no funds for the modernization of the enterprise, there will be a threat of stopping the plant.
The wear and tear of the capital at the enterprise is about 60-70%.
The modernization of the enterprise requires 1.2 billion rubles. Due to the peculiarities of the organizational and legal form, it is obliged to give 50% of the profit to the income of the budget.
What remains is not enough to implement the modernization plan.
"Getting money from the owner is problematic, talking about attracting loan funds from large credit organizations is difficult," Deputy Head of the Ministry of Crimea Sergey Petelin said in April this year.
The Crimean Parliament has included the company in the planned privatization plan for 2017.
It was proposed to hold its shares and put up for auction.
The source of "Interfax" in the authorities of Crimea estimated the possible cost of the sale of the enterprise at $40 million, the investment of the investor in the modernization - another $30 million.
“New World” in 2016 increased the production of sparkling wines by 2.8% compared to the level of 2015 - to 1.52 million bottles.
In 2017, New World planned to release 1.6 million bottles.
The company was founded in 1878 by Prince Lvov Golitsyn as a plant for the production of sparkling wine in the Noviy Svet estate he acquired.
The plant is located on 11 hectares of land.
Nizhny Novgorod High School Students Defeated More Than 40 Tombs
Employees of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Nizhny Novgorod region identified the identities of citizens who destroyed 46 tombs at the cemetery of the city of Lyskovo.
The attackers were third-class students.
The first statement that the grave slabs were damaged by unknown persons was received by the Russian Ministry of Interior in the Lyskov district on June 27.
A total of 24 people contacted the police about this.
As a result, a criminal case was initiated under Article 244 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation "Destruction, damage or defilement of burial places".
As a result of the investigation, the police identified the suspects, they were two schoolchildren aged 8 and 9.
The juvenile offenders told the police that they were interested in watching the monuments fall, which prompted them to commit hooliganism.
Preventive measures have been taken with children and their parents.
Italy is tightening the tone for NGO ships rescuing migrants.
Italy has warned NGOs who own rescue ships in the Mediterranean that they will not be able to continue their work unless they comply with the new rules governing their activities.
"If NGOs do not comply with the new code of conduct, it is difficult to say whether they will be able to continue their activities," Interior Minister Mario Minniti told the daily newspaper Stampa in Turin.
Minniti’s warning came the day after Italian authorities confiscated a ship owned by German humanitarian organisation Jugend Rettet on suspicion that its crew was actually cooperating with human traffickers and facilitating illegal immigration.
The humanitarian organization, which had only worked for a year, declined to comment on the substantive details of the charges brought against it by the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
"For us, saving human lives is and will remain a top priority, so we are very sorry that we cannot continue to work in the search and rescue zone right now," the organization said in a statement.
“We will only be able to assess all the accusations made now, once we have gathered all the information and are able to assess the situation.”
The Italian authorities have been monitoring the Juventus vessel belonging to Jugend Rettet since October.
His crew is suspected of taking on board entire lifeboats of migrants, which human traffickers sent directly to them, and allowing smugglers to leave along with boats that they could reuse.
At least one such meeting is expected to take place just 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the allegations, the contents of which were published in Italian media.
The crew is suspected of violating the regulations of the Italian coastal authorities, who control rescue operations in the area, rather out of humanitarian zeal than for any other reason.
The Code of Conduct mainly envisages that Juventus-type vessels will have an Italian police officer on board to monitor their activities.
So far, only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have agreed to abide by the code: Save the Children, the Maltese MOAS and Pro-Activa Expanded Hugs from Spain.
She said on Thursday that she considers the new rules unnecessary, but acceptable, provided they do not cause any "significant changes or disruptions" to her rescue operations.
Among those who refused to sign is the Nobel Prize-winning organization Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
Meanwhile, Minniti said the sharp decline in recent weeks in the number of migrants arriving in Italy as a result of rescue operations indicates that efforts to support the Libyan coast guard and cooperation with local mayors are bearing fruit.
“In recent days we have started to see light at the end of the tunnel,” the minister said.
He reported on plans for further negotiations with Libyan mayors on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
“In Libya, we do not want to associate with either side of the conflict.”
The Russian authorities have recently significantly intensified their policy in the Libyan direction, and with visits to Moscow attended delegations of opposing Libyan parties.
The head of the Russian contact group on intra-Libyan settlement at the Russian Foreign Ministry and the State Duma, the assistant to the head of the Chechen Republic, Lev Dengov, told "U", what goals Moscow is pursuing in this region and on whom he is betting.
Almost nothing is known about the contact group on Libya that you head.
Here, let’s say, the contact group on Ukraine – everyone knows about it.
And here's the curtain of mystery.
What exactly do you do, what goals do you pursue?
The contact group was created on the initiative of the Russian Foreign Ministry and the State Duma.
Its activities are supervised by Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov and Adam Delimkhanov (Deputy of the Duma from Chechnya. - "U").
The latter is authorized to work in the Libyan direction by State Duma Speaker Vyacheslav Volodin.
The impetus for the creation of the group was the detention in Libya of the Russian tanker "Mechanic Chebotarev" (in September 2015, there were 11 people on board. - "U").
We've been thinking about how to help the crew.
At that time, a contact group of military specialists, representatives of the State Duma, was created, our work was supported by the head of Chechnya, Ramzan Kadyrov.
How did it come to be that you led her?
Since I have been working in Libya since 2008, I have been asked to lead the group.
Our activity was not limited to the release of sailors from the "Mechanics of Chebotarev".
We were able to establish contacts with representatives of all the major groups opposing each other in the Libyan conflict - and from Tripoli (where the UN-recognized government headed by Faiz Saraj is based. - "U"), and with Tobruk (the residence of the parliament that opposes the government, the Hafti and supports the marshal.
Thanks to the active participation of Ahmed Metiga (Deputy Prime Minister of Libya - "U"), we were able to quickly agree on the release of Russian sailors.
Then it was decided to make more effective use of these contacts, to create a contact group.
Its task is to analyze the situation, identify key factors and players, dialogue with all sides of the conflict.
In Libya, we do not want to associate with either side of the conflict, we are in dialogue with all.
How many people are in the contact group and how many of them are permanently in Libya?
There are now five people in the contact group.
Among them are people who have experience working in forces, including in the Ministry of Defense.
We also want to include in the team of specialists for the region, representatives of the Institute of the Middle East RAS.
None of our employees are permanently in Libya, and there is no need for this yet.
Whether there are Russian military advisers, instructors in Libya now.
If so, on whose side?
There are no Russian military specialists in Libya.
All conversations and publications about this are not true.
But your contact group's ex-military...
Yes, and their presence is necessary.
For example, when we visit hot spots.
Or cities that were closed to us at some point, such as Misurata (where militia units are based, which played a role in the overthrow of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 and have significantly intensified in the following years.
We arrived in Missouri in January of this year.
We were frightened, we were told that there were Islamists, terrorists.
But it was important for us to assess the situation there ourselves, to analyze the real military potential, who is responsible for what, why such rumors are going on, what is the role of Islamists there.
In Missouri, we met with all the representatives of the detachments that were involved in the destruction of ISIS in Sirte (in December 2016, this city on the Mediterranean coast was taken from the militants of the banned in Russia "Islamic State" - "U").
We wanted to look at them, get acquainted with these people, check the information that they were the ones who played a decisive role in the destruction of ISIS in Libya, not Khalifa Haftar, who attributed these merits to himself.
And what conclusion did you come to?
Isn’t the Islamic State in Libya defeated by Haftar?
He didn't do that.
Haftar conducted operations on the other front, in Benghazi.
And ISIS in Sirte fought the structures that were subordinate to the government in Tripoli.
And, by the way, we invited people who conducted this anti-terrorist operation to Russia.
And they came - the visit lasted from April 19 to 23 this year, the Libyan delegation was accepted in the Federation Council, in the Duma, the Foreign Ministry and the Rosgvardia.
You, as we understand, are in all regions of Libya and probably imagine the moods of local elites and field commanders.
Do you think it will be possible to implement the agreements on a ceasefire, on the holding of elections, which were reached at the end of July in Paris by Khalifa Haftar and Faiz Saraj?
Or again, as has happened repeatedly in the past, the agreements will be broken, the fighting will resume, the parties will try to seize power alone?
For us, a good signal was already the fact that Saraj and Haftar agreed to another meeting, not so long ago it was impossible.
In the recent past, both leaders have reacted extremely negatively to each other.
Regarding Russia's position...
They often write and say that Moscow actively supports Haftar, many believe it.
We faced this situation when we were in Missouri, and Haftar was on board the Russian aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov on that very day.
It was a coincidence.
But in Missouri, they didn't believe in coincidence.
We were told, “You must be very brave people to come to us today.”
But our task is precisely to show that we are not just supporting Haftar, we are in dialogue with all the key parties to the conflict in Libya.
You and Haftar talked.
Does the fact that he studied twice in the USSR facilitate mutual understanding with Russian partners on a human, emotional level?
And, by the way, does Haftar speak Russian?
Russian, if he knows, is very relative.
But what he learned from us, of course, facilitates the dialogue with him.
And not just with him, by the way.
When we communicate with the military in Tripoli and Missouri, we meet generals who have studied either in Russia or in the Soviet Union.
And here they are, they speak Russian very well.
And they tend to Russia, to some extent they feel nostalgia for it.
Do you believe that the immediate lifting of the arms embargo on Libya is likely?
Are your Libyan interlocutors interested in delivering Russian weapons?
They are interested, of course, but, as I have said, we do not occupy the side of anyone in this conflict and do not want to arm some to the detriment of others.
We would like everyone to be in roughly equal positions.
As far as the arms embargo is concerned, the Libyans are constantly calling for Russia to somehow facilitate its lifting.
The process of drafting a constitution is now actively advancing in Libya.
We hope that the parties will come to compromise solutions, an internal consensus will be reached.
Then the elections should be held, as was said at the meeting of Sarajevo and Haftar.
If the elections take place and the legitimate power is finally elected (and now neither side has such a status), then the question of lifting the arms embargo can be asked in the UN Council.
To raise this question now is meaningless and dangerous, it will only lead to an escalation of the conflict.
Recently, the media reported that Italy, faced with the problem of floating African refugees from Libya, feels abandoned by allies of the EU.
Can Moscow help Italian partners in this situation by using its ties with the Libyans?
How realistic is it, for example, that Haftar’s forces will take control of the coast and put an end to the business of smugglers moving immigrants to Europe?
A very timely question.
We are actively working on this.
The Italians need the support of Russia, because Moscow is in dialogue at the same time with Haftar, with Sarajevo, with Missouri and with the south of the country.
And in this matter, the tribes in southern Libya play a major role, and they are ready to cooperate with Russia.
Is it about the Southerners interrupting the flows of migrants on long-distance approaches?
That is, conditionally speaking, they rolled back the buses in which Nigerian migrants are going?
That's what we're doing.
But it's not easy.
Some clans and groups are interested in keeping these streams going.
We hope to help bring the South together in the negotiating process between Sarajevo, Haftar and the tribes of the South.
But first, we would like to see unity of opinion on this issue between Haftar and Sarajevo.
The head of government in Tripoli, Faiz Saraj, is considered an Islamist, a supporter of the introduction of Sharia norms in the country.
How radical do you think he is?
Will this not be an obstacle to building relations with Russia or the West?
I will give my personal opinion about him.
In my opinion, he is, on the contrary, an opponent of radical Islam.
But there are Islamists in his coalition.
Yes, but he himself holds the position that Libya should be an absolutely normal country – moderately Islamic, open to the world.
He is also actively fighting against terrorists.
Why does he have such a reputation?
It was created by those countries that are not interested in Russia communicating with Tripoli.
Tripoli is the capital, there is legislative, executive and judicial power.
There is a national oil corporation, a national bank and other state structures.
Of course, some countries were interested in us not going there.
And we mixed all the maps and began to actively communicate with both Tripoli and Tobruk.
And we are already reaping the fruits of this work: Rosneft has concluded a cooperation agreement with the state oil company of Libya - NOC.
The Director of NOC Mustafa Sanalla, with whom the head of Rosneft Igor Sechin concluded the deal, himself directly from Tripoli.
And two weeks ago, the first shipment of the Libyan oil company Rosneft took place.
What will Russia do with it?
I guess I'll re-sell.
What are Russia’s economic interests in Libya?
It plans to re-sign the contracts signed under Muammar Gaddafi.
We are talking, in particular, about the previous agreements in the field of transport (railway construction), energy (electricity) and a number of others.
Do the Libyans have anything to pay for?
Well, they have oil.
That is, as in the case of Iran, it is about the scheme of “oil in exchange for services”?
I do not know what the scheme will be, directly I do not deal with these issues.
In fact, the economy for Russia in Libya is not the main thing.
We are, in fact, doing peacekeeping work there.
For us, the most important thing is to stop the bloodshed, to help the Libyans come to terms with each other so that they can establish order and Libya ceases to be a favorable environment for the development of terrorism.
For Russia, this is precisely the main task - to help the Libyan people and to expel terrorists from there.
Do you have data on the presence in Libya (now or earlier) of radical militants from Russia or other countries of the former USSR?
One of the tasks of our contact group was to find out.
I met with a representative of the Libyan State Security Committee, who said that to date no one from Russia and other countries of the former USSR is there.
He said that he has about 50,000 recordings of phone calls from representatives of Islamist and radical groups (in Libya - "U") and the Russian language does not sound there.
Which states are these militants from?
I would not like to go into that detail.
Let’s formulate the question differently.
How many of the Islamist militants in Libya are Libyans themselves?
There are practically no Libyans among them, no more than 5%.
The rest are foreigners.
Can Moscow hold intra-Libyan talks on the example of Paris?
There are plans like that.
We are in active talks with the Libyans, several delegations from Libya have already visited Moscow, and have said that they are ready to come again - to Moscow or to Grozny.
When can such negotiations take place?
It's hard to say now.
Several visits are yet to take place, and I hope that there will be clarity about the time and place of the negotiations.
In the Chekhov Museum, charities collected money for an expensive gift to a sick boy
In the Moscow museum-reserve "Melihovo" nine-year-old boy Sasha Matsola, who has DCP, brain hydrocephalus and complete blindness, on August 5 will receive as a gift a specialized treadmill.
The useful presentation will be presented to Sasha by the Minister of Culture of the Moscow Region Oksana Kosareva and the director of the museum Konstantin Bobkov.
The money for the trainer was collected during the charity marathon "Do not tire of doing good", which took place in Melihov on July 15 on the Day of Remembrance of Chekhov.
On the eve of the marathon at the museum, Sasha, who lives in the village of Manushkino Chekhovsky district, received a letter: "I don't have eyes at all, so I asked my mother to write this letter."
“I’d really like to get a running track as a gift so that my legs would be strong, and I’d learn to walk a little bit.”
This is Sasha's dream come true!
After the presentation in the museum-reserve will be held "Concert-postscriptum" - a famous pianist, the well-deserved artist of Russia Alexander Gindin will perform popurri from popular classical works.
During the charity marathon in Melihov, the choir of the Ascension Davydova Desert, the bell towers of the Ilya Drozdikhina workshop, students of the Moscow Conservatory named after P.I. Tchaikovsky and the Russian Academy named after Gnesiny, artists of the Melihov Theatre "Czech".
For visitors, auctions were held, a book fair and a charitable sale of souvenirs with the marathon logo were organized.
The Museum-Reserve "Melihovo" took the initiative to make the Day of Remembrance of Chekhov on July 15 a single day of charity in all the museum of Moscow.
A 30-year-old resident of Olewsk Zhytomyr region near the local football stadium shot several times in the direction of the teenagers who were there.
According to the suspect, he was angered by the noise, reported "FACTAM" in the communication department of the police of the Zhytomyr region.
After that, the man went into a cafe located nearby.
In the building he had a conflict, during which the man used a device to shoot rubber bullets, injuring one of the visitors.
The 34-year-old was given the necessary medical care, there is no threat to his life.
Police and ambulances arrived at the scene of the incident, but the shooter had escaped by this time.
Police identified him and detained him on the same day, August 2.
The man could not explain his actions.
He has a device for shooting rubber bullets, which is sent for examination.
According to this fact, criminal proceedings under Article 296 (hooliganism) of the Criminal Code of Ukraine have been initiated.
The detainee is threatened with imprisonment for 3 to 7 years.
Recall, in Kiev on Lukyanovka in the area of Tatarskaya Street on the night of July 28, there was a shooting attack.
Michelle Carter Convicted of Reporting Conrad Roy's Suicide
A Massachusetts woman was sentenced to two and a half years in prison for inciting her boyfriend Conrad Roy to commit suicide by texting and calling.
Michelle Carter, who is now 20 years old, will have to serve 15 months in prison and another five years in probation.
Carter was convicted in June of the unintentional murder of Conrad Roy, who committed suicide on July 13, 2014.
Roy’s father said at the hearing Thursday: “My family is saddened.
My son was my best friend.”
Carter was allowed to remain at liberty until appeal.
She was threatened with a maximum term of 20 years, but her lawyers said she and Roy both suffered from mental disorders.
Carter, dressed in red trousers and a cream blouse, listened to the verdict standing, squeezing her hands and lowering her eyes.
"She killed Conrad Roy with her actions," the prosecutor told the court.
“She interrupted his life to improve hers.
She did not accept responsibility,” she said.
"She didn't show any remorse."
But attorney Carter said it was “a tragic case that she deeply regrets.”
However, Judge Lawrence Monis said that he believed her "age, maturity, or even mental illness did not noticeably affect her actions."
The prosecutor read a statement from Roy's mother, Lynn Roy, saying: "No day has passed that I would not mourn the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I am doing – I try to support his sisters, despite all the pain that will remain with us forever.”
Sister Roya Camdin Roy said she was insecurely haunted by the idea that she would never be able to attend his wedding or become the aunts of his children.
“To lose a man who has been with me ever since I was born is a pain that will remain with me for the rest of my life,” she said.
This case appears to be a legal precedent, as there is no law in Massachusetts that would provide for the responsibility for advising a person to commit suicide.
In 2014, when Roy was found dead in the car with symptoms of carbon poisoning, Carter was 17 years old.
The case drew the attention of the entire country when it became known that he had been pushed to suicide by Carter's message.
"You can hang up, jump off the roof, stab yourself with a knife, I don't know there are many ways," she wrote in several messages sent two weeks before his death, when he was resting with his family.
A few minutes before her suicide, she wrote, “You have to do this, Conrad” and “You just have to turn on the ignition, and you will be free and happy.”
Judge Monis said Carter wanted to get attention through Roy’s death, and forbade her from communicating with the press to prevent her from getting what she wanted.
The views of the lawyers on this matter were divided.
One of the few who defended Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted in 2007 of the murder in Italy of her British apartment neighbor and acquitted two years later.
30-year-old Knox published her own opinion in the Los Angeles Times, claiming that "Michele Carter deserves sympathy and help, not prison."
Yevgeny Bogachev: "I let Langford go like a bird of high flight"
One of the best basketball players in the VTB Singles League, 33-year-old Keith Langford has left UNIX.
The departure of the American defender "Izvestia" commented on the president of UNIX Yevgeny Bogachev.
The whale made this decision on the basis of family circumstances, - said Yevgeny Bogachev.
He has a small child, his wife, who did not want to move to Kazan.
Keith wants to be closer to home.
I decided to go to meet him.
Of course, I could have said no and extended his contract, but he deserved a different relationship.
He played in UNIX for three seasons and in each match showed a high level, put on 100%.
So I let him go like a high-flying bird.
We thanked him.
We wish him success in his family life and playing career.
Keith Langford played in the Kazan club for three years, winning silver in the 2015/16 Singles League.
In the 2016/17 season, he received the award for the most successful player of the Euroleague season.
He scored an average of 21.75 points per game.
This is the second since the award was established in 2004.
Langford, who also won the award in 2014, became the second player in the history of the Euroleague to receive this award more than once.
In the near future, Langford will sign a contract with China's Shenzhen, according to Eurohoops.
The American is expected to sign a two-year contract worth $5 million.
Langford will be the second Euroleague star to enter the Chinese Championship in July.
Earlier in the Chinese CBA moved ex-center "Panathinaikos" Yannis Burusis.
A sun-burnt tourist from Moscow was evacuated by helicopter in Adygea
The Adygean rescuers today evacuated by helicopter from the mountainous region of the Republic of Moscow a tourist who received the strongest sunburns.
The man rested in the shelter "Fisht", located at an altitude of 1,600 meters.
The 27-year-old tourist had increased pressure, as well as difficulty breathing.
Preliminary diagnosis is a serious allergic reaction.
Rescuers were contacted by the head of the tour group, who said that the burns the man received in the campaign.
Audi to Modify Up to 850,000 Diesel Cars
The day before the announcement, BMW said it would offer to update the software for more than 350,000 cars.
BMW’s chairman said the company believes there are “more intelligent roads than driving restrictions,” referring to European cities – including Munich, where BMW is located – that have been considering banning or limiting the use of diesel cars.
Daimler said on Thursday it would modify three million Mercedes cars in Europe to reduce their diesel emissions.
None of the companies called their move a recall.
European automakers have actively promoted the use of diesel cars in Europe and the United States to promote compliance with carbon emissions regulations.
But nitrogen oxides that are emitted by diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.
The cost for car manufacturers to install equipment that neutralizes diesel car exhaust is also rising, and maintaining a competitive price for cars becomes difficult.
While German automakers are under close scrutiny, Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government has also been accused of inciting influential automakers and ignoring signs of the problem.
The companies try not to repeat the mistake of the Volkswagen, which concealed the use of so-called “defeat devices”, which during testing could correct the amount of harmful gases emitted to comply with the rules, and under normal driving conditions turned off.
In the United States, several Volkswagen executives have been convicted and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, a former head of the thermodynamics department of the Audi engine development team was arrested in Germany.
The former manager, Zacqueo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and therefore unprotected from extradition and may be tried in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi came under German criminal investigation involving Volkswagen after authorities accused Audi of installing a system to circumvent European emission rules and expanded the investigation, which had previously focused on the United States.
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation can create serious problems for Volkswagen: the manufacturer of luxury cars is a source of disproportionately large share of Volkswagen’s income.
In Astrakhan, a coffee shop visitor paid with fake money
The police received a message from the employee of the branch of the bank about the discovery when recalculating the money received from the point of general board, a suspicious banknote with a denomination of 5 thousand rubles.
A study conducted at the Expert Forensic Center found that it is a fake.
According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia in the Astrakhan region, the banknote was paid by one of the visitors of the café, who bought a shaurma.
It is worth noting that the cash register was not equipped with a device for determining the authenticity of banknotes.
Currently, the police are identifying persons involved in the manufacture and sale of a fake ticket of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation.
Such crimes are punishable by imprisonment for up to 8 years with a fine of up to 1 million rubles.
The Regional Office of the Ministry of Internal Affairs encourages residents of the Astrakhan region to be careful when conducting financial transactions; employees of commercial facilities are encouraged to install devices to verify the authenticity of the funds received.
Astronomers have found a "hell" planet, on which even iron can melt
After first studying the properties of the stratosphere of a giant exoplanet called WASP-121b, astrophysicists were greatly surprised by its temperature, which is able to evaporate iron and other metals.
The experts noted that the water molecules are so heated by the light of the star that they emit infrared radiation.
The Hubble Telescope has captured the glow of water molecules on this gas giant: this high temperature causes water in the planet's atmosphere to shine in the infrared range.
WASP-121b refers to the so-called "hot Jupiters" - gas giants, in size and mass comparable to the largest planet in the solar system, but located dozens of times closer to the parent star.
Because of this, the year on the exoplanet lasts only 1.3 "earth" days, and its gas shell is tempered to almost 2,500 degrees Celsius.
Climate change threatens lavender in Provence.
It has become a symbol of Provence and the south of France, but now there are concerns that it is threatened by climate change.
Lavender began to grow worse due to drought and disease-carrying insects; this caused constant headaches for scientists and farmers trying to find a solution.
Eric Shes, an expert at the CRIEPPAM agricultural research institute in Provence, says: “Lavender in Provence is really under threat because in recent years this plant has been experiencing the effects of climate change: the spring and especially the autumn rains have become much less.
This affects the life of lavender.
And there are also small cicadas jumping on the leaves of insects carrying micro-bacteria; in very dry weather, they become very many."
There is a lot on the map.
Lavender not only attracts vacationers; lavender oil is in high demand in perfumery and cosmetology.
Eric Sess says: “Instead of very long clusters with a large number of large flowers, we have small, underdeveloped, weakened or absent at all.
Therefore, we have fewer parts containing essential oil.”
Solutions currently under consideration include improving water distribution and slowing down evaporation from the soil, as well as spraying plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and yielding varieties more resistant to drought.
Ambassador of Winter Universiade-2019 met with Krasnoyarsk schoolchildren
Twice world hockey champion, Ambassador of the 2019 Winter Universiade Alexander Semin met the day before with beginner hockey players and handed out autographs to fans.
The meeting was held in the tent of the Winter Universiade-2019 as part of a thematic week dedicated to hockey with a wash.
Any visitor to the tent could skate on a pitch with artificial ice.
In addition, relays, quizzes and games were organized with a draw of souvenir products of student games, warm-up from the aerobics federation.
Fifty schoolchildren participated in the event.
Alexander Semin advised the boys to do as much as possible on the sports grounds and emphasized that the most important thing at the initial stage of training - hard work and a huge desire to play hockey.
“It is great that there is such a venue in Krasnoyarsk as the tent of the Winter Universiade 2019, where novice athletes can directly ask questions to the coaches of the teams,” the champion said.
It should be noted that the ambassadors of the Winter Universiade 2019 help to promote student sports and a healthy lifestyle among the Reds.
The Universiade tent will operate throughout the summer season until September 25, according to the press service of the Winter Universiade Directorate-2019.
In the State Department commented on the words of Medvedev
U.S. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert, commenting at a briefing on the words of Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, said the need to find "areas for interaction" with Russia.
According to her, such areas must be found in order to "improve bilateral cooperation".
Nauert called the ceasefire agreement on Syria an example of such successful cooperation.
We are two nuclear superpowers.
“And people around the world agree that the United States and Russia should be able to work with each other,” the diplomat said.
At the same time, Nauert refused to comment on Medvedev’s claim about a full-fledged trade war between Russia and the United States.
"If Russia said that, of course, it has the right to say it, but there is nothing more I can say about it," the State Department spokeswoman said.
Earlier, US President Donald Trump signed a bill to tighten sanctions against the Russian Federation.
Commenting on the new package of sanctions, the head of the Russian government Medvedev said that Washington has declared a full-fledged trade war with Moscow, putting an end to the hope of improving bilateral relations.
Medvedev also said U.S. sanctions would last for decades.
In addition, the prime minister believes, the American establishment "cleanly defeated" Trump.
Missing bodybuilder found in the suburbs of Moscow on someone else's dacha lost memory
Bodybuilder Shamil Hanmetov disappeared on the road in Noginsk on July 25 under very spicy circumstances: he came out of the interior of the car to go to the toilet.
For seven days he was searched unsuccessfully by acquaintances and local residents.
And found Shamil in another mansion in Ramensky.
He was found naked in the bathroom by the owner.
The Dagestan athlete could not explain how he came here and what happened to him.
He couldn't even remember his name, and his passport was missing.
His disappearance was helped to establish his identity.
The doctors who arrived on the phone recorded Hanmetov's partial memory loss and brain injury, Mash reports.
Probably, the athletes are waiting for other surprises.
The intruders who abducted Shamil have probably already visited his apartment, from which the keys were also stolen.
Oil and gas revenues in July exceeded the forecast by 7.4 billion rubles
In fact, the received oil and gas revenues as of July 2017 exceeded the estimate by 7.4 billion rubles, the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation reports.
The excess, the agency explains, was mainly due to the higher exchange rate of the U.S. dollar to the ruble compared to the June average used for the estimate, as well as due to the excess of the actual volume of gas production and the volume of oil exports at the projected levels.
"The deviation of the oil and gas revenues of the federal budget from the monthly estimate, corresponding to the Federal Law on the Federal Budget for 2017-2019, in August 2017 is projected to be +40.2 billion rubles," the Ministry of Finance said in a statement.
Thus, the total amount of funds sent for the purchase of foreign currency in the domestic currency market between August 7 and September 6, 2017 amounts to 47.6 billion rubles.
Accordingly, the daily volume of foreign currency purchases will amount to the equivalent of 2.07 billion rubles.
The Bank of Russia will be involved in the purchase of foreign currency transactions by the Russian Ministry of Finance.
Each working day during the specified period, the Central Bank will conclude transactions for the purchase of foreign currency on the Moscow Stock Exchange’s organized trades evenly during the trading day.
The foreign currency purchased will be credited to the Federal Treasury accounts at the Central Bank.
The murder of a journalist underscores that in Mexico it is becoming increasingly dangerous.
Employees of the Riodosse weekly newspaper usually meet on Wednesdays to discuss plans to shed light on recent violent crimes in the state of Sinaloa related to organized crime, corrupt officials, or the ongoing war on drugs.
But today, overwhelmed by their own tragedy, they met to talk about security.
They were told they had to change their habits.
Two senior journalists discussed what seemed safer: taking the children to the office where they had already thrown a grenade in 2009, or leaving them at home.
Security experts wrote on a board hanging in the room, three words: enemies, neutral people, allies.
They asked journalists to name names for each column – no evidence is needed, suspicions and internal feelings will be enough.
These are drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of being held by the government or cartels, a whole list of scoundrels who make the work of lighting up the chaos in Mexico dangerous.
Violence is not taking a breather, and among the bodies that are multiplying in the country, more and more journalists: according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, no less than 25 since President Enrico Peña Nieto took office in December 2012; 589 people after attacks and threats are under federal protection; and this year it is already under fire.
Among the latter - their publisher and inspiration, the co-founder of "Riodose" Javier Waldes Cardenas.
“The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist,” Valdez wrote in one of his many books on violent drug-related crimes.
His absence is felt very acute, although his presence everywhere - a large photo of Valdez showing the middle finger, with the inscription "Justice" hangs on the facade of the building "Riodose"; two reporters of his 30 years, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, are wearing football.
The seminar takes place less than two months after his death; journalists discuss their general trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecutor's office was set up in 2010 to investigate journalistic cases, only two cases have been investigated so far, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists.
As with most of the thousands of murders committed each year in connection with drug trafficking and organized crime, journalist murderers rarely appear in court.
Riodosse journalists insist that they will write about the violence in Sinaloa, although they are killed by grief, although around now much more dangerous.
Without information about the killers, without justice from talks about security at meetings, there is little use," Ibarra says.
“It’s silly to waste time at this workshop,” he says.
“Until we know the reason, we suspect everyone.”
On the morning of May 15, Valdes left the Riodosse office in the state capital of Culiacan.
He managed to drive only a few blocks before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men; he was pulled out of the car and shot 12 times, probably because of the title of the newspaper - which means "Twelfth River".
The shooter left his car and crashed it nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He has a wife and two grown children.
Rumors usually spread quickly across Kuliakan.
But almost everyone is silent about Valdez.
Since Guzman was arrested and extradited to the U.S. in January last year, Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest battlefields in the country as rival factions struggle to fill the void.
Let’s not say that one or more people are killed every day in the streets of Sinaloa, or that the cemetery is filled with decorated two-story mausoleums of drug kings, which are more than the homes of many living people.
Let’s forget for a minute that the state of “quietness” is just when one of the cartels takes control of the coastal state with important ports and narcotics routes leading to the US.
Despite this and the fact that Valdez was well aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bohorkes, a 60-year-old co-founder and director of Riodosse, was overwhelmed by a sense of guilt for failing to protect his friend.
He thinks the murder was aided by two mistakes.
First, an interview was published in February with Damaso López, the leader of one of the rival factions of the cartel, which is fighting Guzman’s sons.
The publication may have angered the sons; people who were allegedly members of the gang bought all copies of the publication as soon as they were delivered to the kiosks.
The second mistake was that he did not force Valdes to leave the country for his own safety after another newspaper that wrote about the same story was captured.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder was seen as another milestone in the development of violence against journalists in Mexico.
He had been away from danger for so long, his friends and colleagues thought he would always be.
He was an experienced reporter at Northwest and in 2003 together with five colleagues founded Riodose, selling his 50-dollar shares.
In Sinaloa, it was “impossible to do journalism without touching on the topic of drugs,” Bohorkes said.
Over time, the newspaper earned a reputation for a bold and honest publication, sales and advertising revenues grew.
Journalists liked that they could publish bold reports without fear of censorship, and readers were attracted to the fact that in this edition they could read about something no one else dared to write about.
Eight years after its founding, Riodosa received the prestigious Maria Moores Cabo Award for her reporter work in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez won the International Prize for Press Freedom for his courage in investigating Mexico’s drug trafficking wherever it led.
He admitted frankly that he was afraid.
“I want to live on,” he said at the CPJ awards ceremony.
The drug trade in Sinaloa is “a way of life,” he said in an interview with Rompevento TV last October.
“You have to take on the tasks that lie with you as a journalist – either that or you’re just being a fool.”
I don't want to be asked, "What were you doing when there were so many deaths around... why didn't you tell me what was going on?"
The Riodosse staff misses Valdes, a joker who argued like a shipper in the harbor, a friend, generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to sneak around alive.
They relied on the order they had set up.
He always had to wear his hat.
He was supposed to go to El Guayabó, the bar opposite the office, and always sit there at the same table.
Now they ask: was he destroyed by the love of the once-established order?
His death also caused them to doubt in their calculations about how to do their job better and stay alive.
“They don’t like it when you’re dealing with their wives, their children, their legal business, and their underground drug airfields.
“These things were behind the line,” Bohorkes said.
The result, even in better times, was a high level of self-censorship and self-preservation.
You have to trust your instincts.
Stay away from anything that smells bad.
The problem, says Rio de Janeiro editor Andrés Villareal, is that “the deception can be cheated... and then what happened to Javier happens.”
The old rules, he says and others, no longer apply in Sinaloa – as they do in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states, where there is a poisonous mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak state institutions and corrupt officials.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the room where Rio de Janeiro staff gathered for security training, it was suddenly forbidden to bring in cell phones: a few days before it became known that spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments, is being used in Mexico to monitor journalists and public activists.
Outside, two policemen hide in the shade of a tree from the heat of 104 degrees (40 degrees Celsius).
They were tasked by the state government to guard the Riodosse office, which is located in a four-story building in the bourgeois district of Kuliakan.
Some journalists were half jokingly asking whether these policemen were among the 50 percent of law enforcement officials the governor himself said they could not be trusted.
A few months ago, journalists went to a mountainous area, which is de facto controlled by gangs of drug dealers.
In the next issue "Riodose" counted on three main topics.
This is the Sinaloa murder of the brother of former boxing champion Julio Cesar Chavez.
They also had the disclosure of government spending concentrated in the governor’s hometown.
And there was a group abduction of people in one of the most expensive restaurants in Kuliakan, a block from the prosecutor's office.
It was not officially announced who was abducted or how it happened, so it was necessary to be cautious when it came time to write about what everyone in the city knew: that it was the favorite restaurant of both drug dealers and authorities.
One of their journalists learned from open databases that the restaurant was registered in the name of a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which has dominated all levels of power for almost the entire past century.
Recently, several governors from PRI have been charged with corruption.
Villareal asked journalists to write about previous incidents at the restaurant, including when Guzman’s son El Chapo escaped from the military.
A few months ago, readers would have searched for Valdez' column with the most accurate information about the kidnapping.
“We would have known what happened before,” says 46-year-old Villareal, nicknamed “El Flaco” for his artful body.
“Today, all communication channels with our sources are broken.”
Valdez’s cabinet is now used as a warehouse for posters and stickers protesting the killings of journalists because employees have become what they never thought they would become: activists speaking on behalf of the press.
Journalist Miriam Ramirez took several posters and went to a demonstration at the local prosecutor’s office the next morning dedicated to another journalist.
El Salvador Adame disappeared in the state of Michoacan in the west of the country three days after Valdes was killed.
They found the burnt body, and the authorities said it was him, based on DNA tests.
Across the country, journalists began to speak louder, organize protests and write "SOS Press" on the sidewalks and walls of houses.
On that day, Director Bohorkes was in Washington, D.C., trying to secure international support in demanding justice in the Valdez case.
At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa the day after the murder of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and ordering their killings for telling the truth.
She then asked her not to be given any more tasks to shed light on the activities of the Government, fearing that anger would damage her objectivity.
Valdes has said many times that journalists in Mexico are “surrounded” by organized crime, its accomplices in government and indifferent society.
In his latest book, Narco-Journalism, he wrote that reporters are not just killed by gangs of drug traffickers; they do so on the orders of politicians and security services colluding with organized crime.
The Article 19 Press Protection Committee believes that half of the attacks on journalists last year were committed by order of police and government officials.
“In Mexico, you die because they want to shut you up,” Ramirez said.
Of course, murder scares people.
Everyone remembers the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Masias six years ago in the northern border state of Tamaulipas.
On her body was found a note supposedly written on behalf of the Zetas cartel: "I'm here because of my articles."
The computer keyboard and headphones lay next to her cut-off head.
Some newspapers have preferred to shut down as El Norte newspaper in the northern border state of Chihuahua after its correspondent Miroslav Brich was killed in March.
Others continue to hold on to the role of "El Manjana" from Nuevo Laredo after the assassination of her leader in 2004.
In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly approached drug cartels with an editorial on the front page titled "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have left their home states or the country in general.
It's a painful decision.
In exile, it is difficult to find a job, and they still see danger on the streets.
And sometimes they are killed, as apparently happened with photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was killed in 2015 along with four women in an apartment in Mexico three months after fleeing from Veracruz.
Those who stay and continue to work balance between risky decisions on a daily basis.
Ibarra – who once dreamed of being a poet – admits that he is afraid to write about drug trafficking.
“Mexico is going to hell, and that’s why I became a journalist,” he says.
Last Friday, at midnight, when the last issue was already ready for printing, Rio’s publishers were sitting on the sidewalk next to the office and drinking beer when their phones suddenly rang at the same time.
A series of shootings between opposing gangs and security forces near the resort town of Masatlan left 19 dead, according to confirmed data.
The war continued to erupt, as promised in a series of messages from cartels discovered in the area.
Sitting on the sidewalk, they posted the news on the Riodose website via a mobile phone.
The next day I had to rewrite the first page.
Sirens shouted nearby - another shooting in the vicinity.
Bohorkes looked to see if the police guards were ready to defend them.
If they were scared, they didn’t show it.
Sitting beneath a huge portrait of the deceased founder of their newspaper, whose middle finger was put on display for the entire Sinaloa, Riodose employees continued his work.
"How can you think about closing down," said Bohorkes, "if on the very day Javier was killed, an intern asked me to send her out to do a report?"
Dinosaur used camouflage to avoid enemies
At first glance, it looks like a statue, though terrifying.
The researchers said the first remains of an incredible rhino-sized creature discovered by a Canadian miner survived so well that experts called it “Mona Lisa among the dinosaurs.”
It was so well preserved that they were even able to determine that the color of his flaky skin was reddish-brown – and say that he had, in a way, a “dark past.”
In a report published in the journal Modern Biology, it was described as “the best-preserved of the Tyreophore in history and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world.”
This fossil is a recently found specimen of a nodosaur that lived in the middle of the Cretaceous period, between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
His incredible good condition has stunned researchers who call him “really wonderful.”
This herbivorous thyrophore is the best-preserved fossil of its kind in the history of the findings, according to articles in the National Geographic magazine.
He was found by Sean Funk when he was working at the Sankor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
He stumbled upon something that seemed to be different from the surrounding breed, and decided to take a closer look.
The fossils he discovered were sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
For the next six years, work was carried out to detect an animal inside an earthy depth of 2,500 feet (1100 kilograms).
Now that all this hard work has been done, the finished result can be demonstrated.
"It's only worth a little bit of squatting, and you can almost believe that he's sleeping," said lead author Caleb Brown, a research fellow at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology, where the creation is being demonstrated.
“He will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best-preserved specimens of dinosaurs – Mona Lisa among dinosaurs.”
By examining its skin, the researchers found that it was herbivorous, despite the fact that it was covered with an armor and resembled a walking tank, apparently exposed to significant danger from carnivorous dinosaurs.
This powerfully armored dinosaur used red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a protective technique known as protective paint, which is also used by many animals today.
This would allow him to merge with the environment faster and avoid encountering enemies, experts say, assuming he was hunted by larger dinosaurs.
The 110-million-year-old creature, belonging to the nodosaurus family, was widely featured in the press in May and is now on display at the Royal Tyrrell Paleontological Museum.
Scientists have already studied the animal and named it Borealopelta markmitchelli in honor of museum lab worker Mark Mitchell, one of the members of the group who spent more than 7,000 hours on its meticulous excavation.
The amazing preservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of the shells and armor plates on his body.
They found a protective color, a common method of protection in the animal kingdom, which means that the top of the creature was darker than its bottom.
Although protective dyeing is common, the discovery was a surprise because the size of the dinosaur Borealopelta significantly exceeds the size of the now-living animals with protective dyeing.
It can be assumed that this dinosaur was so actively hunted by carnivorous dinosaurs that evolution preferred to mask confrontation as a way of survival.
But most modern protective-colored animals—such as deer, zebras, or armored vehicles—are much smaller and more affordable prey, indicating that nodosaurus had to seriously fight for survival.
“The serious threat from predators to a massive, powerful dinosaur armor shows how dangerous the predatory dinosaurs of the Cretaceous period were,” Brown said.
The chemical analysis of the organic compounds in the dinosaur’s peel also suggests that its skin was supposed to be reddish-brown.
Scientists continue to study the animal, looking for information about his life, including the preserved contents of his digestive tract, to find out what he ate during his last meal.
They believe that when the dinosaur died, it fell into a river and was taken to the sea, where it sank and lay back down to the bottom of the ocean.
At the time, Alberta was as warm as it is now in southern Florida, and rivers and oceans were likely to spread much further into the depths of the land than they are now.
“This nodosaurus is truly remarkable in that it is completely covered with the remaining peeled skin, and at the same time has been fully preserved in three dimensions, while preserving the original shape of the animal,” Brown said.
“As a result, the animal now looks almost the same as it did then, in the Early Cretaceous period.
You don’t have to use your imagination to recreate it, it’s just a little bit of a trick, and you can almost believe that he’s asleep.”
The Cretaceous period is the era when giant theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs standing on two legs, roamed the Earth.
Although the most remarkable of them, the tyrannosaur rex, lived millions of years later than Borealopelta, one of his formidable ancestors could have hunted the tyreophorus.
These include the acrocantosaurus, a monster 38 feet (11.5 meters) long and weighing six tons.
Scientists, whose latest findings are published in the journal Modern Biology, believe that Borealopelta was taken to sea after his death and mummified in Ile.
The creature was found by Sean Funk when he was working at the Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
According to the museum’s staff, it is the best-preserved thyrophore in the world, along with skin and armor, and it’s all about, from the buttocks to the thigh bones.
On average, these creatures reached about 18 feet (five meters) in length and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1300 kilograms).
Their characteristic feature was two twenty-inch spikes protruding from their shoulders.
Researchers believe that this herbivorous thyrophore was hard at work in what is now Canada until a spilling river carried it into the open sea.
But the dinosaur's underwater burial has preserved its shell with precision to the smallest detail.
The fossilized remains of this particular specimen have been so well preserved that the skin remains still cover the bluish armor plates along the dinosaur skull.
As Michael Greshko wrote in an article for National Geographic magazine, such a degree of preservation is “rare as winning a lottery.”
The longer I look at him, the more amazing he seems.
The fossilized remnants of the skin still cover the bluish armor plates sowing the animal's skull.
His right front leg is stretched along the side, five fingers on it are turned upwards.
I can count the peels on his sole.”
Mikhail Saakashvili managed to get to Poland without documents
Mikhail Saakashvili, who previously headed Georgia, and then the Odessa region in Ukraine, flew to Poland.
At the same time, he did so without having documents proving his identity and citizenship.
The arrival of Saakashvili is reported by the Polish edition Telewizja Republika, which posted a video of his performance on his YouTube channel.
Saakashvili spoke at an event in honor of the anniversary of the Warsaw Uprising against Hitler's troops in 1944.
Since the politician does not know Polish, although he tried to start speaking in that language, he had to speak English through a Polish translator.
During his speech, the politician touched on the topic of cooperation between Georgia and Poland, and also spoke about Ukraine.
The fact that the migration service of Ukraine deprived him of his citizenship, the opal politician learned, while in the United States.
Exactly how he managed to make a transatlantic flight without documents is not yet known.
Former Governor of the Odessa region Mikhail Saakashvili said that his signature on the questionnaire for obtaining citizenship of Ukraine was forged.
The politician stressed that he did not fill out any questionnaires.
The deadline for the investigation in the case of Weinzicher and Olchowitz extended until January
The term of preliminary investigation in the case of the co-owner of the Renova group of companies Evgeny Olkhovich and the head of the energy holding company "T Plus" Boris Weinziher has been extended until 2 January 2018.
On Thursday, August 3, the Basmann court is considering the issue of extending the accused's house arrest.
The representative of the SC at the meeting announced the decision to extend the period of preliminary investigation for the last time.
"The particular complexity and duration of the investigation is due to the need to seize and conduct an examination of a large number of documents, as well as conducting investigative actions on the territory of several Russian entities," the investigator said.
He added that the suspects regularly gave bribes to the Komi leadership.
Their total size is estimated at least one billion rubles.
According to the investigation, Wienziher, Olkhovyk, as well as the former head of JSC "Complete Energy Systems" Mikhail Slobodin, who until September 5 led the company "Vympelkom", transferred to the highest officials of the Republic of Komi electro bribes for the establishment of the most advantageous tarifs.
Weinziher and Olkhovich were detained, staged in Syktyvkar and arrested for two months, Slobodin escaped the investigation and was declared a federal search.
How did one activist find out the answer to the question “Whose streets?”
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shocked to the depths of her soul.
Just a day after arriving in New York City as part of a tourist trip, a native of St. Louis sat on a bed in an apartment rented through Airbnb, looking at a Facebook tape on her phone.
She bumped into someone from high school.
“Police just killed an eighteen-year-old boy and he’s still lying in the middle of the street.”
Noting that no one else on her tape posted this information, puzzled, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
There were a lot of user posts in her tape with a nickname <0x40>TheePharoah.
A Greater St. Louis rapper tweeted the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old black teenager killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He posted a photo of Brown’s lifeless body lying in the middle of the street, where it will be for four hours.
“It’s wild,” Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new to her and her circle.
She dropped the phone and later in the evening returned to tweets about people going to Canfield Drive.
There were pictures of the signal tape and screaming people and the man claiming to be Brown’s father holding a poster saying, “A Ferguson policeman just killed my unarmed son!”
She watched a live broadcast as a police officer stood in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
In another video, another policeman, she said, raised a gun and shouted, “I’ll kill you all...animals!”
“This is an unusual situation,” Ferrell said, according to her own memories.
“It’s not a murder like the ones we’re used to and that we can call typical.
At that moment, I felt a chill.
I was angry and crying.”
She took a return flight ticket and flew home the next day.
After landing at 11 p.m., she took her six-year-old daughter from her father’s house and decided that they would both go to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson over the next nearly three years became the subject of a new documentary film, Whose Streets?, to be released on screen on August 11.
It is a story about survival and protest, about love and loss, strength and resilience from the point of view of people living in the community and filling the streets, demanding answers.
While Ferrell was on her way to Ferguson with her daughter dressed in a flower dress and a wreath of color, they remembered a conversation that had led to that morning countless times, “about the experience of the blacks and their situation.”
She recalls saying, “Remember how I told you about how black people had to fight for what they believed in?
“We’re going to Ferguson now because a police officer killed an eighteen-year-old boy, and that was wrong.”
“I couldn’t help but take it,” Ferrell later said.
“What’s happening today is the culmination of what happened before.
She needs to know about it, see it, and be educated about it.
It must not only understand activism and organization well, but also understand the different levels of experience of blacks and their positions and what we must do to become free in order to be free.
Even if I manage to provide her with an environment in which she herself will not face obvious racism, she is no different from any other black girl.
I feel like I would have done her a bad service if I had kept her away from it.”
When they arrived at Ferguson, they made their first stop at South Florissant Road, at a site across the road from a police station that had become something of a tent camp, while activists waited for reports of Officer Darren's final acquittal.
There, Ferrell and her daughter joined a local entrepreneur who was preparing lunch packages.
They collected packages and helped distribute them to the protesters.
Little by little, Ferrell took form in his mind a new type of activism.
"My activism has completely changed since August 9," she said, noting that as a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, she was the president of the Association of Health Students, representatives of national minorities, and engaged in food justice and health inequalities among black communities.
“I didn’t have the organizer’s experience.
It came by itself.”
A few weeks later, at an evening demonstration, Ferrel met Sabaa Folayan, one of her co-directors.
Folayan said she and her chief operator, Lucas Alvarado-Ferrer, “just wanted to document” the events.
Ferrell came up with the question: “Do you want to document, or are you trying to find a story to play on?”
This skepticism was instigated by numerous people, often white, who came into the community in order to benefit from his pain and endurance.
As Folayan explained in a recent interview, “We heard that the voices of people who were born and raised in Ferguson are not in the spotlight, and we wanted to do it differently.”
By that time, Folayan had already teamed up with her co-director Damon Davis, a local artist known for his activism on the issues of those sentenced to death.
His involvement aroused sympathy for the project from Ferrell and six other locals with whom the Whose Streets project team had been in touch for years after Brown’s murder.
“In this documentary, no one speaks for us or with us, we speak for ourselves,” Davis said.
“It was the most important thing for me how these people will be represented, because that’s how I will be represented myself.”
And while the goal of the project was not to focus on Ferrell’s experience at all – in an effort to show that the movement “is not about the leader being saved, but about how the community is united,” as Folayan said – it turned out to be the most open of the film’s participants.
As a result, Whose Streets? reveals unexpectedly personal aspects of Ferrell’s life, such as how she fell in love and got married to his wife.
“I felt naked,” Ferrell said, laughing at how she saw the finished product for the first time.
“But I realized that when you do that kind of work and humanize black people, there has to be some level of vulnerability.”
In addition, Ferrell’s story once again discusses and emphasizes the role of a black homosexual woman in the wider context of the “Black Lives Matter” movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement — those who created the #BlackLivesMatter tag on social media after the 2012 murder of black teen Trayvon Martin — classify themselves as homosexual.
“Black gay women in leadership positions support all of this movement,” Ferrell says, “and all because we’re constantly fighting on multiple fronts.
“Black gay women have to bear all this burden.”
Folayan agreed with this claim, noting that “the movement is in fact supported by black women and many gay black women.”
However, she insists that "this is not a case of positive discrimination", and that Ferrell was not chosen as the central character of the film because of its distinctive features.
“She was the person who awakened that energy,” she said.
“On the other hand, it’s not a coincidence that she was in the foreground because when”
You can feel her energy through the screen.”
Ferguson, meanwhile, hasn’t had a camera for a long time, but complex racial ties remain between the community and the police.
Ferrel will be on probation for another two and a half years for blocking the highway during the demonstration.
It describes the socio-political atmosphere of the place, which it calls home, simply: "Bardak".
She's still holding on to the speech she learned when she took to the streets of Ferguson three years ago.
We must fight for our freedom.
We have to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose but our chains.”
Two Salvadoran footballers disqualified for biting U.S. players
El Salvador national team players Henry Romero and Darwin Serene received long-term disqualifications for unsportsmanlike behavior.
During the quarter-final match of the Gold Cup of the Confederations of Football of North and Central America and the Caribbean (CONCACAF), Salvadorans bit American players.
The first was defending champion Henry Romero.
The Salvadoran bit the attacker Josie Altidor, then pinched him to the chest.
Then the midfielder Seren, when submitting a corner in his penalty area, bit the US defender Omar Gonzalez.
As a result, Romero was disqualified for three games and Serena for six.
The meeting itself ended with the victory of the Americans with a score of 2:0, reports Goal.com.
Appearance of similarity: artist creates portraits with the help of Chelsea Manning DNA
In the center of the hall in the Friedman Gallery in New York from the ceiling on the wire hanging faces of people - white, black and brown, all something elusively similar to each other.
These 30 portraits were created by artist Heather Dewey-Harborg from cheek sweeps and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent clippings from the prison of Fort Levenworth, where the former intelligence analyst is serving a 35-year sentence for the famous transmission of confidential diplomatic telegrams on the WikiLeaks website.
The new exhibition, which closed on August 2, is called “The Emergence of Similarity”.
This is the result of a two-year correspondence between Dewey-Harborg, whose art combines technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transgender woman and famous dissident whom Barack Obama softened his sentence just three days before the end of his presidency.
By analyzing the DNA obtained from Manning's computer program and using it to create three-dimensional portraits of people with such a genome, Dewey-Harborg created a profound, though not easy to perceive, manifesto of the non-DNA data, not only about the plasticity of their DNA, but also about the differential between them.
Manning, who was born with the name Bradley Edward, but since adolescence has openly said she considers herself a woman, was convicted of 20 episodes in 2013, including six violations of the Espionage Act, computer fraud and theft.
Her photographs in prison were unavailable, so only one photograph of her was known: a grainy black-and-white selfie on which Manning in a platinum-toned wig, clearly feeling embarrassed, sat behind the wheel of the car; with this photograph she began to be associated.
In 2015, Dewey-Harborg successfully completed her 2012 project Visions of Strangers.
In it, the artist created portraits of unknown people using forensic evidence such as smokes and chewing gum, emitting DNA from this garbage and creating images of what these people might look like.
And then she received an e-mail from Paper Magazine.
"They interviewed Chelsea Manning in prison and wanted some kind of portrait to illustrate the article," Dewey-Hagborg explained at the preliminary screening of the new press exhibition.
Chelsea could not be visited and photographed at the time, so they contacted her and asked if she wanted to get a portrait made from her DNA.
In such an unusual way, the artist and her prison muse became friends by correspondence and exchanged several letters for two years.
They even wrote a comic book "Suppressed Images" illustrated by Shoeley Canungo, which depicted how in the future the president would mitigate Chelsea's punishment and allow her to attend the exhibition in person.
That Obama really decided to release Manning just a few days after the book was released was a pleasant surprise after seven difficult years in the Kansas military prison.
There’s something deep and strong about the show being opened right now, as Donald Trump declares war on people revealing secret information to the government, and invents new ways to fuel the enmity he’s meant to mitigate on Twitter.
When Dewey-Harborg was asked about the coincidence of all this over time, she said that "coincidence does not happen".
In a statement written on the gallery wall, Manning’s huge signature at the bottom (with a heart instead of a point above the “i” in her surname) calls for an end to “automatic separation based on gender, race, sexual orientation and culture.”
On the opposite side is her mitochondrial DNA, a long caterpillar of pencil C, G and A.
By including 200 letters (or nucleotides, as the artist exquisitely expresses herself), Dewey-Harborg hoped to show how surprisingly similar we all are, at least in our biological structure.
"I hope to explain to people that our genome does not define what we are, how open the genetic data is to interpretation and how subjective it is," Dewey-Harborg said; her 2007 video work, Fake Memories, is also featured here.
“DNA data can tell us a lot of different stories, and 30 of those stories are here.”
The last part of the exhibition, which fits in one room, is the above-mentioned comic book novel.
On it, a King-Kong Manning appears above the U.S. Correctional Barracks building with a loudspeaker in hand.
“If they kill your speech, they will win,” it says.
“Never be silent.”
“This is a direct quote from a letter she wrote to me,” says the artist, welcoming us from Philadelphia.
"I still have ants on my skin when I talk about it."
Manning has not yet seen the exhibition in person – as it was cleverly depicted in the comics – but when it arrives, it will be greeted by masks in the middle of the room, its own genomic simulators, gathered like crowds of protesters.
This is also done intentionally, like everything at the exhibition up to the height (5"2, Manning's height), on which the genetic haplogroups were drawn by pencil.
“I used to hang them on the walls, but now I wanted them to look like a crowd of people,” Dewey-Harborg says of the portraits.
“I wanted them to be like the mass movement that was formed around Chelsea, like the movement that was behind her liberation.”
Northwestern University professor and Oxford University employee searched for by police on murder charges
According to police, there is a national assault on a Northwestern University professor and an Oxford University employee, who are being searched for as suspects in connection with the fact that a man was found mutilated to death in a luxury room in Chicago.
According to the minutes of the Cook County Court, on Monday, detention warrants were issued for the premeditated murder without the right to be released on bail of forty-two-year-old Windem Latham and fifty-six-year-old Andrew Warren in connection with their alleged involvement in the death of Mr. Corinth.
According to the documents, the twenty-six-year-old Cornell-Duranlo died after being inflicted multiple stabbing injuries.
A warning issued by the Chicago Police Department said the body was found on July 27.
The police received a call, they arrived at the Grand Plaza apartment complex and found the victim with several wounds on the body.
Officials said Cornell-Duranlo was declared dead at the scene, and now detectives are investigating the death from knife wounds, considering it a murder, while police are searching for two suspects.
Latham has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cabbage, the university’s vice president of communications, said in an emailed statement that Latham was on administrative leave and was barred from entering the Northwestern University campuses.
“This is a criminal case that is being investigated by the commissioners, and the Northwestern University is cooperating with the investigation,” Kabbagh said.
Warren is a senior financial officer at the University of Oxford.
A spokesman for the University and Somerville College said in an emailed statement: “We have contacted the UK police and are ready to provide any necessary assistance to the U.S. investigative authorities.”
The statement also said Warren’s colleagues were shocked and wanted him to surrender.
Chicago Police Department Liaison Officer Anthony Guglielmi said he strongly advised suspects to surrender to the authorities.
"The police have assumptions about their whereabouts, but our attempts to find them are increasing," Guillemi said.
According to Guillemi, local, regional and federal authorities are helping in the search for the suspects.
According to Guglielmi, the police were called by the administrator of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received a mysterious message that something had happened in room 1008.
Police said the scene of the crime was horrific.
Guillemi said it was unclear whether the incident itself occurred on July 27.
According to him, video footage confirms that Latham and Warren were in the building.
“We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship,” Guillemi said.
The Grand Plaza leadership issued a statement to the attendees, in which it was reported: “Currently, the police are working on the chronology of the incident, collecting information about the victim and considering a number of motives, including a possible household accident.”
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko: "We will meet the requirements of the WADA roadmap in the near future"
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said that the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) conditions set for the resumption of work of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) will be fulfilled in the near future.
“A certain stage in fulfilling the requirements has been passed, RUSADA has been given the right to plan and conduct tests together with UKAD (the UK anti-doping agency).
WADA’s road map has been updated accordingly,” Mutko said on Thursday.
The Prime Minister commented on the second part of WADA’s roadmap to restore compliance with the Code, which lists the conditions for the resumption of RUSADA’s work and was recently published on the WADA’s website.
According to Mutko, it does not contain anything that could present difficulties for Russia.
“Everything has been announced, everything will be done.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future,” he added.
However, one of the requirements included in the list implies that Russian anti-doping structures must publicly acknowledge the results of the WADA-ordered investigation of Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren, which claimed that doping in Russian sport is controlled by the state.
Regarding this issue, Mutko said: “We are conducting an investigation because our anti-doping system has failed.
All measures have been taken.
But there were no government programs, and we will not recognize what was not.”
Mutko repeated the words of Vitaly Smirnov, head of the Russian Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission.
In an interview with the Russian newspaper “Rsport”, Smirnov acknowledged the problems that had previously occurred in Russian anti-doping structures, but added: “We have repeatedly said that the report contains certain controversial positions and positions.
Unconditionally, no one is going to accept this report," Smirnov added.
WADA removed RUSADA from doping control in November 2015 following a doping scandal.
However, in June of this year, he was allowed to plan and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and the British Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD).
After a visit to the organization’s Moscow office in July, WADA CEO Olivier Niggli said that RUSADA is “moving in the right direction” to resume its work.
Fire breaks out in 79-storey tower in Dubai
A major fire that occurred in one of the tallest residential buildings in the world, The Torch Tower, was extinguished, Reuters reports.
It is noted that the firefighters managed to cope with all the fires by 4.00 local time (3.00 MSK).
Local authorities said no one was injured as a result of the incident.
During the fire-fighting, the streets adjacent to the skyscraper were closed.
The reasons for what happened are unknown.
Earlier it was reported that the 79-story residential skyscraper The Torch is burning in Dubai, which is one of the tallest buildings in the world.
All the residents were evacuated on time.
Unimaginable dress Buzz shock fans: pants that do not cover the panties
The scandalous reality show "Dom-2" Olga Buzova struck the audience of the festival Europa Plus Live with dancing in panties.
In front of thousands of fans, the newly revealed singer duet with Nastya Kudri performed the song "We will be hot".
Both girls went on stage in provocative "pants", sewn in such a way that appeared underwear of the singers.
On the trousers were made inscriptions Buzova and Kudry.
Previously, it was reported that changes in the appearance of Buzova commented on the specialist of one of the Moscow clinics of plastic surgery.
Stoltenberg admits deteriorating relations between NATO and Russia
This was reported on Friday, August 4, the news service "Radio 4" with reference to foreign media.
According to him, the Russian authorities are responsible for the deterioration of relations between the West and Russia.
In an interview with CNN, NATO’s secretary-general also criticized Russia for the situation with Crimea and “the destabilization in eastern Ukraine.”
At the same time, Stoltenberg assured that dialogue with Russia, however, is possible, and further escalation of the situation will not benefit any of its participants.
Earlier on Thursday, U.S. President Donald Trump said U.S.-Russia relations were at a dangerously low level, and blamed it on the U.S. Congress.
The Metro of Yekaterinburg masters a new method of payment
In October, the trip in the metro of Ekaterinburg will be possible to pay with a bank card, said the general director of JSC "I-Net" Pavel Vedernikov in an interview with "Oblastnyi Gazeta".
Our goal is to introduce to the 2018 World Cup the same system of payment for metro rides as in other major cities: Moscow, St. Petersburg, Nizhny Novgorod and Novosibirsk.
"We want fans from other countries, guests of the World Cup, to be able to use the metro with their bank cards, without buying tokens and not standing in line," he said.
Startups that will help your company not to become the next “Uber”
Amy Errett wanted to assess the level of satisfaction among employees of her e-commerce startup, but the surveys did not work.
The answers were often vague, useless, or worse, insincere.
And even though she promised anonymity, some employees did not trust the process.
“He’s never been consistent and objective,” said Errett, who runs a 75-person, San Francisco-based e-commerce company called Madison Reed.
He then turned to third parties for help.
Now there is a new kind of start-ups in the field of work with staff that help companies find out how their employees feel.
By developing and licensing software designed to measure employee engagement, they allow companies to make express enquiries, address specific teams and demographic groups, offer employees anonymity and hotlines for complaints, and in some cases, allow whistleblowers to contact them.
“We now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for health monitoring, but where is Fitbit for your company?” says Jim Barnett, co-founder and president of Redwood City’s Glint startup, whose analytics programs are used by companies to measure employee engagement.
Errett said she has gained a greater understanding of what her employees think and feel over three years of using Glint.
In addition to the express surveys and questionnaires of certain teams, the product offers a company thermal map and shows in a visual form which units have the most complaints and which managers have a low approval rating, allowing it to understand why.
Companies are slowly realizing that they need to control the situation in the workplace, otherwise they will become the next “Uber”, which was implicated in the scandal when a former employee posted a blog post describing an aggressive situation in which those who expressed dissatisfaction were punished.
For startups like Glint, it’s a desire to control the situation – an opportunity for a profitable business.
According to estimates by the Internet portal Let’s Talk about Payments, dedicated to financial technology, the global governance, regulation and compliance industry could cost more than $118.7 billion by 2020.
The Denver, Colorado-based startup Convercent, which helps companies prevent and detect bad behavior, noted a slight increase in interest and activity earlier this year against the backdrop of Uber’s reputation dropping.
Convercent has nearly 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Recently, Uber has appeared among customers.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to send custom-made staff opinion polls, collect confidential responses in real time, and view thermal maps of problem areas.
It also provides a hotline for anonymous text messages that allows employees to report bad behavior.
And if the top manager is affected, the complaints go directly to the directorate.
“The public opinion court seized power from the inspectors,” said Patrick Quinlan, founder and president of Convercent.
If it turns out that the company is mishandling employees or behaving unethically, even if the inspectors do not intervene, the company may face costly consequences in the form of customer boycotts, employee outflows and lawsuits, Quinlan said.
Ruby Tuesday, a network of restaurants with more than 25,000 employees in 500 establishments, has used Convercent for over a year to make sure employees are aware of the rules and procedures, and to offer an easy way to contact the company’s headquarters.
Previously, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to look for a phone number or a head office email, file a formal complaint and hope that it would be taken seriously.
It was often a frightening and awkward experience, said James Vitrano, the head of Ruby Tuesday’s law firm, who said there was no normal way to track employee complaints.
Now that the company is using the Convercent service, problems that were previously hidden from managers sitting in offices in other cities or states – such as discrimination, harassment and unfair pay – can be quickly detected and addressed.
“I can approach a holistic, comprehensive understanding of the situation of employees,” said Vitrano, who heads the Ruby Tuesday network’s risk management team.
“And we protect our shareholders from lawsuits with employees.”
According to Quinland, the companies began to take employees’ ethics, values, and engagement more seriously in 2002, after Arthur Andersen’s accounting firm collapsed due to ethical breaches as a result of the Enron Cases.
But it wasn’t until “social media got massively spread” that companies realized they couldn’t keep their dirty underwear from viral spreading online.
“Before using technology to control ethics, people used hope as a strategy,” he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service, charging companies a regular fee for the use of their products.
This is a business model and an opportunity that has received the approval of venture investors who have supported both startups.
In February, Convercent received $10 million in funding from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, bringing the company’s total capital to $47 million.
Glint received $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners, resulting in the company’s total capital of $60 million.
These investments are hardly surprising given the interconnected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
A growing body of research shows that today’s employees expect more from their jobs than they used to.
In fiercely competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high wages and interesting projects, this is just the minimum required.
Employees want to feel that they are welcomed and appreciated, and that they dedicate their time to the company with a positive mission.
“When people are happy to work at a company, they feel that they are being heard and that the work they do brings results, they are more trying to make such a company successful,” says Nina McQueen, vice president of global benefits and employee satisfaction at LinkedIn, where Converlincent and LinkedIn are also used.
Investors earn income when the business of companies from their portfolio is going well; the business of companies is going well when employees are committed and involved.
If third-party analytical tools promise to increase employee loyalty and engagement, it’s no surprise that they find support.
According to the experts on culture in the workplace, it is important to have data on employee involvement.
But the data is useless until the company’s trustees take action.
In fact, if a company asks employees for feedback, it can create the impression that changes are coming.
And if the changes don’t come quickly enough, or don’t come at all, disappointment may develop, and employees will lose interest.
“If you’re going to ask for 4,000 offers, you should be prepared to have 4,000 interviews,” says Russell Rat, president of consulting at management firm Kotter International, which has had to see companies make a mistake by relying too much on data collection.
“Because if you don’t go to the end, the employees will say, ‘Did you really hear me?
You don't care?
And if you don’t care, why shouldn’t I care?”
According to Errett, Madison Reed, which now conducts monthly employee surveys, is able to take action the same day someone reports a problem with Glint.
And, after gathering feedback from employees dissatisfied with the speed of decision making and quality of communication, she was able to reorganize several teams within the company and introduce communication training to solve problems.
Ruby Tuesday is gaining new knowledge about its employees and hopes that in the long term, this knowledge will help it to retain employees more effectively in an industry known for its high workforce flow.
“If you don’t try to create a culture of transparency, you’ll lose people,” Vitrano said.
If you lose people, you lose customers.
If you lose customers, you lose companies.
In Barnaul open a new asphalt on the avenue of the Red Army
In Barnaul, drastic measures were taken to eliminate the cause of the failures of the asphalt on Krasnoarmeysky Avenue.
The place where pits appeared twice on the recently paved road (crossing from the street Molodezhnaya), it was decided to "open".
Recall, the collapse of a small section of the road near the tramways occurred due to the fact that the land moved in the area of the homeless unexplored network.
According to the Deputy Chairman of the City Committee on Road Economy, Improvement, Transport and Communications Ivan Garmat, for a detailed investigation and elimination of the prerequisites for the collapse will carry out a detailed investigation.
Depending on its results, the necessary measures will be taken.
It is assumed that it will be necessary to restore the shelling of homeless communications and their concrete.
This is reported on the official website of the regional capital.
The Bruins team has to work out longer because the National Student Sports Association has cancelled training twice a day.
Time is approaching eleven o'clock; a crowd of footballers from the University of California, Los Angeles is delayed to chat on one side of the team's new training grounds located on campus.
Some of them pulled off their t-shirts, bare their backs, shining from sweat after a tense first day of sports camp.
For many players on the team, these minutes of inactivity are a break in the middle of the day.
Players enrolled in summer classes will return to the hostels after three hours of training to prepare for the final exams, and the next morning they will return to the Wasserman Football Center for a meeting at 6:30.
Shortly before Monday turned into Tuesday, Bruins coach Jim Mora said, “These guys are going to have a meat grinder for the next three days.”
The fact that the National Student Sports Association canceled workouts twice a day, which was invented to reduce the workload for players, actually extended their working day – at least until the end of the exams on Friday.
Therefore, the start of the first three training sessions of the team at the University of California at Los Angeles was scheduled for 7:15 p.m. to fit into the already tight schedule of players.
The side effect of the absence of two workouts a day has been more days with one workout, and Bruins moves the start of the camp almost a week compared to last year and carries out training during the summer school for the first time in the six seasons of Mora in Westwood.
According to the schedule, they will have to conduct 18 training sessions until August 20 inclusive, before starting official preparations for the first game of the season against the Texas University A&M team in September.
Mora said he supported a change in the rules from the National Student Sports Association, despite the fact that another item appeared in the tight schedule of players because of it.
“For three or four days we are giving them this huge load, this is a serious test,” Mora said.
“And they just got over it, they work, they’re great guys.
I think when we live through Saturday and we have more time, it’s going to be really great.”
When the camp is over, the University of California at Los Angeles will make the trainings closed; this is not an easy task, as its fields are in direct view from the adjacent parking lot and from the neighboring Laskin Center, a dear hotel that has already been bombed by a football network.
The Bruins players are expected to occupy the hotel starting this weekend, but Mora admits that when the rooms are free during the season, there may be a problem.
“We will have security,” Mora said.
“This is a serious problem, and I don’t exaggerate the danger by assuming that someone can take a room, sit there and record a workout on video.
If you have a training video, it’s very serious.
But we'll have security there and there'll be security at parking lot number eight.
We will do everything we can with what we have.
I won't worry too much about it.
We have a plan.”
All the victims of the terrorist attack in St. Petersburg were discharged from hospitals
All the victims of the attack on the St. Petersburg subway in April were discharged from hospitals.
This was reported in the press service of Deputy Governor Anna Mityanina.
According to data at the end of July, three people remained in the hospitals, reports TV Center.
Recall, the explosion in the metro of St. Petersburg erupted on April 3 of this year.
The bomb was blasted by suicide bomber Akbarjon Jalilov.
As a result of the attack, 15 people were killed, as well as the perpetrator himself.
In the criminal case, 11 people, including the alleged organizer Abror Asimov, have been arrested.
Recall, on the eve of Rospotrebnadzor recommended the Petersburg Metro to review the plan of measures to ensure transport safety, in particular, increasing the number of metal detectors.
Facebook strengthens fact-checking in the fight against fake news
Facebook will be more likely to send suspicious texts to independent experts and show their findings under the original posts, the world’s largest social network said on Thursday, trying to fight so-called fake news.
In a statement on its website, the company said it is starting to use improved machine learning algorithms to recognize possible mystifications, send them for verification, and possibly show fact-checking results under the original post.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main ways to spread so-called fake news, which many believe has had an impact on the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
This issue is also being actively debated in Europe after French voters were misled by false messages ahead of the May presidential election, and in Germany ahead of the September election, they said they supported a plan to penalize social media if they did not promptly remove hate posts.
On Thursday, in a separate German-language statement, Facebook reported testing a new fact-checking algorithm that was launched in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
“In addition to seeing what messages are being challenged by independent reviewers, people want to have a broader context to make informed judgments about what they read and what they share,” said Sarah Sue, Facebook’s news feed manager.
She added that Facebook will continue to test the “related articles” feature and work on other changes to the newsfeed to address the issue of fake news.
Create a comic book: One Castle in English History
In the recent past, Scotty's tiny castle was filmed in the music video "Squeeze", and in the 1970s and 80s served as a harbour for Margaret Thatcher.
But 700 years from his cozy spot in the Bull River Valley in Kent, he watched the tumultuous history around, and now inspired Jamie Rhodes, a Yorkshire man with a land hair and a tendency to historical documents, for a novel-comic book.
“I think it’s so beautiful to look at the handwriting of a man who died 300 years ago,” he says with enthusiasm.
“You feel so personal when you hold that letter in your hand.”
"The Castle in England" spans the period from the Middle Ages to the Edwardian era and tells about families who lived in Scotland; each story illustrated by one of the young British artists - Isaac Lenkevich, Brian May Smith, William Axley, Becky Isle.
This is not Rhodes’ first book, which is based on archival data: in 2014, he wrote “Dead Man’s Teeth and Other Stories” – a collection of documents from the British Library; this project unexpectedly touched him to the depths of his soul.
“I could have just been fingerprinted on the edge of a letter written in the 1700s by a double agent working for the Jacobites,” he says.
"This is his fingerprint."
And the letters always smell like smoke, because at that time the lights were lit.
And in 300 years, in the future, you feel like you're there, too.
"I love the archives!"
For a person so passionate about old papers, getting support from the National Foundation and the English Arts Council and living in a castle for four months ("To be honest, I've been a little over there") seems too good to be true.
Rhodes spent all day studying the "new" Victorian castle, walking through the archives and looking at the numerous treasures of the estate and ancient things - for example, the heads of the hyenas on the walls or bottles, centuries lying in the ditch.
He walked through the park and the ruins of the old castle, talking to foresters, gardeners and sometimes artists working on illustrations of his book.
Then at night he “drank whiskey and sat down to write.”
The history of Scotty Castle is not very well understood, because the National Fund received full access to it only in 2006, when the last heir, Elizabeth Hassey, died.
When Rhodes arrived ten years later, the staff were only beginning to deal with the archives, which he describes as “something that the aristocrats have thrown down on the attic for centuries.”
Diaries, letters from the times of the British Empire, maps showing who owned what: "You think land disputes are boring," says Rhodes, "but two families fought for this birch.
That's how it is, guys!"
In some of the collection's stories, the castle becomes a starting point for broader discoveries in English history: for example, in The Worker, the hero leaves the newly built castle to join the Peasant Revolution of 1381.
“There is information about a rebellion that took place in the castle in 1380, in a book called The Knights of Kent and Sussex,” Rhodes says.
“The peasant uprising began in these places, and I thought the uprising was a proper beginning.
“Maybe they were tied up?”
Other plots are closely related to the castle's history - for example, "The Priest", which tells about a Jesuit priest, whom the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or "The Smuggler", about eighteenth-century smuggler Arthur Darrell, who is believed to have staged his own funerals by filling the tomb with stones (this was discovered a few years later when the tomb was dug up).
The Darrells are Rods' favorite family of all who inhabited the Scotties: "The gentlemen seem to have been a perfect fraud, forever indebted and spending money on things they couldn't afford.
In different generations, Darrell men have solved their debt problems by marrying rich older women – I imagine them as a company of cute guys who are able to care for the heirs of great fortunes.
After finishing work at Castle Rhodes is looking for other opportunities to get a unique writing experience.
He lived for two weeks in the Finnish forest, where he wrote a graphic novel about Elyamyanmyaki, a place where there was a sanatorium at the beginning of the 20th century, and then it grew again in the woods.
But Scotty remains a special place for him.
“I was sad to leave,” he says.
“I felt like this: Damn it, I have to go back to real life again.”
Fifteen of the largest banks choose "Russia"
The conflict in the Association of Russian Banks (ARB) is developing: following Sberbank, VTB, VTB-24, Alfa-bank, Gazprombank, Rosselkhozbank, Binbank and FC "Otkrytie", seven other credit organizations are going to leave the company.
Thus, at least 80 per cent of the market will be represented by the organizations leaving the ARB.
But this is not just a way out - all the banks that have declared a break with the ARB, are negotiating with another public organization that unites credit institutions - the Association of Regional Banks "Russia", which is headed by the famous politician Anatoly Aksakov, the chairman of the State Duma Committee on the Financial Market.
The conflict within the ARB began during a discussion in the Federation Council, when the Interregional Banking Council considered new bills, in particular, implying a new classification of banks depending on the size of the statutory capital.
Then Garegin Tosunyan, president of the ARB, said that, in the association’s opinion, this bill is being passed in the interests of the largest banks, which are thus trying to limit the capabilities of small and medium-sized banks in the regions, intercepting their clientele.
Among other claims, there was criticism of the Central Bank, which, according to Tosunyan, does not always justify the withdrawal of licenses from some banks, which, it is true, was followed by an objection from the representative of the Central Bank: many managers of bankers, in particular, Vneshprombanka.
Apparently, this exchange of mutually exclusive opinions in the very sensitive to the relationship with the main regulator of the banking environment and became a visible reason for the fifteen largest banks, declaring disagreement with the policy of the ARB, began to prepare for joining the association of "Russia", noted that "Affects of Russia"
Investors will be better.
What's the deal?
We will immediately answer the main question that arises with the slightest failure or conflict in or near the banking sector: depositors are not threatened, rather, on the contrary, the reliability of the banking system will increase.
Heads "Russia" Anatoly Aksakov, known for his scrupulousness in all things related to the interests of banks and their clients, a high-level professional who is highly appreciated in the Central Bank: almost all the management of the Central Bank is present at the annual events of the Association of Initiatives, and all the important laws
In terms of personnel and organization, obviously, there are also no special shocks.
Undoubtedly, the ARB finds itself in a difficult financial and management situation after losing such powerful and influential participants with their contributions and lobbying opportunities.
However, in this oldest - established in 1991 - organization advocating the interests of the banking community, there is considerable potential to continue to improve banking legislation and the sphere of monetary circulation as a whole.
It is not possible to say that in the association of "Russia" with open arms are ready to accept new members under any conditions, judging by the reaction of its head, Anatoly Aksakov ("maybe too much will"), who on July 21 at a briefing in the press center of the Parliamentary newspaper, said that the
Their proposals are to strengthen the voice of bankers on the Association Council, as well as to pay more attention to new banking technologies.
The negotiation process is underway, the proposals of both sides are being studied, the agenda of the extraordinary congress of the association is being prepared, which will be held in Sochi in mid-September within the framework of an international banking forum.
That's where we'll figure it out.
Also, Anatoly Aksakov, stressing that "not holding the chair", called a possible new head of the renewed association "Russia" Georgi Luntovsky, who leaves in September the post of Vice-President of the Central Bank, highly characterizing his business and human qualities.
On August 18, Anatoly Aksakov, who is now vacationing in Crimea, plans to interrupt his vacation for one day and arrive in Moscow, for an extraordinary meeting of the Council of the Association "Russia", where it is planned to consider the agenda of the extraordinary congress "Russia".
The entry of gasoline-powered cars into major Russian cities will not be restricted
Deputy head of the Ministry of Transport and Communications Nikolay Asaul said that, contrary to media reports, the entry of cars with a gasoline engine to the major cities of Russia will not be restricted so far.
This is a more radical form of our concept.
Our concept is that we need to gradually raise the environmental class.
And there is the concept of immediately switching to zero emissions.
I don’t think we are technically ready for that.
The question is, from what year?
It's the same phrase at the slogan level - let's ban it.
Where and when?
Tomorrow? Tomorrow?
Do we shut down the whole city?
“In 20 years – I don’t know, maybe that will happen,” Prime quoted the minister as saying.
Earlier, the newspaper "Izvestia" reported that by August 17, Deputy Prime Minister Arkady Dvorkovich was tasked with examining proposals on possible options for state support for electric transport, submitted to the government by the General Director of PJSC Kamaz Sergey Kogogin.
Among the suggestions, according to the newspaper, is the use of cars with ATVs in major cities and resorts.
Washington is changing the rules for obtaining a green card.
According to the media, President Donald Trump said that a new U.S. immigration plan will be adopted, according to which the rules for obtaining a green card will change.
The plan includes reducing the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, tighter rules for temporary work visas and restrictions on family visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republican Party and supported by the President.
The bill will be discussed in two chambers of Congress.
“This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save taxpayers billions of dollars, and it will do so by changing how the United States issues green cards to citizens of other countries.
The law will reduce chain migration and replace the existing scheme.
“The new filing process will provide benefits to candidates who speak English, have the monetary resources that allow them to maintain themselves, and have skills that will benefit our economy,” Trump said.
The emergence of sex robots is real, and it should worry us
We did not have time to think that 2017 could not get worse, a new report on technological advances in the production of sex robots.
Yeah, yeah.
Sex robots are in the spotlight.
The Responsible Robotics Foundation (FRR) recently released a report on the development of sex robots in the next 5-10 years.
According to Noel Sharky, a distinguished professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at Sheffield University and co-founder of FRR, we should take their appearance seriously.
Users will be able to choose the color of the eyes of the robots, the shape of the nipples and the type of nails.
“People are hiking about this, but firms are already sending them to consumers in large numbers, and soon we will see them much more,” Sharky said at the presentation of the new report.
Modern sex dolls have evolved from their inflatable counterparts into robots with silicone skin warm to the touch, and with almost human replicas driven by artificial intelligence.
Users can also "customize" their robots to their taste, choosing everything from the color of the robot's eyes and nipple shape to the shape and color of their nails.
But the fact that many robots have a “personality” compared to which the Stepford Woman would seem very progressive is even more troubling.
Modern sex dolls have become robots with silicone skin.
For example, the RealBotix robot company allows users to customize the quality of robots they find attractive, such as shyness.
There are also Roxxxy Gold sex robots, developed by "True Companion", which come with an already programmed personality - for example, "Cold Farrah" makes the impression shy, and "Wild Wendy" has a "courageous" character.
“Roxxxy Gold has a character that fits perfectly with yours,” True Companion said in a statement.
So she loves what you love, doesn’t like what you don’t like, and so on.
She changes her mood throughout the day, like a real person!
She may want to sleep or talk, or she may “be in the mood”!
In the emergence of sex robots, much is worrying – not least because they replace real human relationships – but the most worrying is the subordinate image of a woman, the association with rape that causes the takeover of the Cold (read: resisting Fa).
On the site "True Companion" Roxxxy compared with a vibrator, only for men.
“If a woman (sic!) can have a vibrator, why can’t men have Roxxxy?”
But these sex robots are not just fetishes or just new sex toys.
Their emergence and increasing complexity indicate something darker and deeper in our culture, a departure from the ideal of gender equality towards the desire for sex with subordination as an optional supplement.
Most men will certainly not buy sex robots, and while FRR notes their growing popularity, they remain on the periphery of consumer culture.
But what is brought to us from the periphery can be very instructive in relation to the meanings of the era in which we live.
And many people are not stupid or aggressive until the free market gives them the opportunity to do so.
It’s no coincidence that these complex sex robots emerged precisely when women’s rights around the world were under threat, when the White House had a president who boasted about what was right for women.
The most frightening thing in the TV series "The Tale of the Maid" is not graphic images, twisted bodies and squeezed eyes, namely how realistic this vision seems.
The Republic of Gilead is an exaggeration, but it doesn’t seem that big now.
The goal of the sex robot industry is to achieve such a physical resemblance to real women (only with the proportions of porn stars), as technology allows.
Their creators want them to appear human to the touch, to copy the movements of the human body.
But it is precisely by their “characters” that robots do not resemble real women.
They can’t break up with their partners or leave them.
They have neither their life nor their biography—nothing that could indicate independence or anything else that could destroy the illusion of complete dependence.
In other words, they are beautiful slaves.
Or, as they say in 2017, maids.
Los Angeles native Eugene (Push) Jeter, who has been playing for the Ukrainian national team since 2013, will not help our national team at the European Basketball Championship, the final part of which will start on August 31.
This was reported in an interview with the BeBasket portal by the general manager of the Blue-Yellow Andrey Lebedev.
We tried to make a deal with Jeter, but unfortunately, he won't come because of family circumstances.
We will go to Eurobasket without a naturalized player, because we do not want to take someone we do not know.
“This situation will provide opportunities for the development of our young players,” he said.
I would like to remind: with the direct participation of Jeter, the Ukrainian national team took the record sixth place at Eurobasket 2013 and for the first time got to the basketball world championship, in which the "yellow-blue" could not overcome the group stage, and the native of the United States scored 3 points, an average of 15 for the game.
Jeter has stopped playing for the Ukrainian national team since he left the position of head coach of our national team, Mike Fratello, who left this position in 2015.
The men’s Eurobasket 2017 will be held simultaneously in four countries: Turkey, Romania, Israel and Finland.
The Ukrainian team will hold their matches of the group tournament on the promised land.
Evgeny Murzin will have five matches in Group B: Germany (August 31), Italy (September 2), Georgia (3rd), Lithuania (5th) and Israel (6th).
As part of the preparations for the tournament, our men's team held two control matches, in which it ceded to the Dutch and Belarusians.
Trump's great achievement?
To portray Mitta Romney seems very reasonable.
In the Trump era, the commonplace was the fact that the political controversies that polarized the American electorate had broken up some families at the micro level.
Between Thanksgiving and Christmas, U.S. newspapers were plastering with columns on how to deal with the terrible relatives who voted for Trump.
I think we're all so tense that we're about to explode.
Less is said about Trump’s ability to connect families.
I’m writing about it because my cousin, a left-wing Chicago poet who’s long been stabbed with Republicans in her family, came to me in New York this week.
She reminded me that uniting against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
With Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including her Republican brother, with whom she has been arguing about politics for decades, suddenly and strangely ended up on the same side.
At dinner it is undoubtedly good; but I can’t help but think that in a broader context it can be quite dangerous.
Trump has breathed strength into the left flank, but the deforming effect of his rule can move us all to the right.
When we talk about Trump and “normalization,” we mean the improbable possibility that one day we will stop being struck by his outbursts.
There is, however, an even more questionable scenario in which Trump “normalizes” the most right-wing Republicans, who, against his standards, will unexpectedly appear to be a model of common sense.
I caught myself missing today the old-fashioned insanity of Mitt Romney — with a dog on the roof of a car and a 14 percent income tax (but we at least knew what his tax return looked like) — compared to Trump and that, and the other seems very small.
When Trump leaves, the next Republican candidate will just have to be in his mind to see a huge step forward.
When my cousin went downtown, we went with the kids on a carousel in Central Park – the largest carousel in the New York State Parks Department’s economy and the best way in town to spend three dollars if you don’t need caffeine.
The horses are terrible and huge, the fiberglass pictures on the central drum - masking clowns and animals, who, when bent, look at their backs in horror - are extremely sinister, and the ringing music, strangely, delights.
So many famous things in this city are disappointing: views from the skyscrapers are obsolete, the silhouettes of the buildings are too much to shake, and the reality of the city does not succeed in the dream.
Thirty-five years have passed, and I am still experiencing the day when I learned that the Swiss Cottage district is not actually a Swiss chalet (theme pub "Ye Olde Swiss Cottage" is not included), but a large circular crossroads in North London.
A carousel in Central Park is still an unusual, magical place where a two-year-old child, an eleven-year-old child and two women over forty can have a great time.
If I could rate a carousel, I would rate a five, but fortunately no one asked me to.
And in the department store this week, I was asked before spending a card on the terminal, to evaluate my "experience" of shopping on a scale of one to five stars.
In the coffee shop on the corner of my street still the same plus the option to accompany the assessment with a tip of 15 percent is for the order at the counter.
As a result, not only does the idea-neutral interaction slow down, but you also have to bring a personal attitude to a situation that does not involve it.
The poor saleswoman at the department store smiled confusingly while I was tired of appraising my experience of giving her a five-star credit card.
Oscar Pistorius transferred from prison to hospital for chest pain
Pistorius is leaving prison for a second visit to the doctor.
Last year, he was transferred to a hospital for treatment of wrist cuts, which, according to the prison administration, he received as a result of falling into a cell.
Pistorius was convicted of intentional murder after the prosecution appealed an initial conviction for unintentional murder.
He killed Steencamp early on Valentine’s Day in 2013, shooting her several times through the door of a toilet in his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius said he took his girlfriend as a night thief hiding in his bathroom.
The prosecutor’s office said it intends to file another protest, this time against Pretoria’s six-year term, which it said was too mild.
The Prosecutor General’s Office has said it will appeal to the South African Supreme Court and the appeal will be heard this year.
Pretorius' term could be extended by 15 years if the prosecutor's office succeeds.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
Suspected in the beating of NTV journalist selected subscription on non-departure
The metropolitan law enforcement officers chose a measure of restraint in the form of a non-exit subscription for a man who committed an attack on the journalist of the NTV channel Nikita Razvozhaev during a live broadcast from Gorky Park on August 2.
This is reported by TASS with reference to the official representative of the Russian Ministry of Interior Irina Volk.
"In the framework of the investigation of the criminal case initiated under Article 116 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation ("Battles") against a 32-year-old man who struck the person of a correspondent of one of the television channels in the Central Park of Culture and Recreation in the name of Gorky, the suspect was not selected by the detention and detention measure in the form of a signature.
The representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs added that an administrative protocol for disobedience of the police had been drawn up for the suspect.
On Wednesday, August 2, during the live broadcast of the Air Force Day, a sober man approached the correspondent and hit his face.
As it turns out, the bully has nothing to do with the Air Force.
According to Rozvozhaev himself, the paratroopers, on the contrary, tried to detain the Moscow man.
Two Bulgarians Arrested in Greece for Illegal Tent Parking
According to the Bulgarian Foreign Ministry, two Bulgarian citizens have been detained in Greece for illegally parking tents.
On the morning of August 1, a group of people who had set up tents in an abandoned place, including two Bulgarian citizens, were detained in Sithonia.
They were released on the same day, while the investigation is still underway.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs told BTW that Bulgarian citizens were later released.
The Greek authorities have tightened control of free camping and are already imposing serious fines on anyone caught while parking in an undesignated place.
Inspections will be conducted throughout the season.
According to the Ministry, the court may impose a fine.
Russian Foreign Ministry accuses US Vice President of rhetoric of the Cold War
Statements made during the European tour of US Vice President Michael Pence have been criticized by the Russian Foreign Ministry.
“It is regrettable to note that Washington is tilting deeper and deeper into the primitive ideological stamps of the Cold War era, which are completely detached from reality,” the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
Thus, the Foreign Ministry reacted to the words of Pence about the "Russian threat" and the attempts to forcefully cross the borders, he said in Podgorica.
The Russian Foreign Ministry pointed to the destructiveness of the choice "either with the West or with Russia" and the obscurity of the thesis about the supposedly unalternative accession of all South-Eastern Europe to NATO.
Russian diplomats also recalled that it was the United States that violated international law by using force to repel Kosovo from Serbia and thus created another center of tension.
“We call on our American counterparts to stop slamming Russia and its foreign policy line, which is invariably based on respect for partners and readiness to work together constructively, on mutual consideration of interests,” the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
Feldsher was injured in an accident with a "quick" in Moscow
The accident occurred in the Moscow suburb of Stupino, as a result of the collision of a foreign vehicle with the ambulance "Ambulance" suffered a fieldsher.
Today, around 08:10 a.m., a Mitsubishi car collided with an ambulance in the city of Stupino in the Moscow region.
"As a result of the collision, the car "quickly" turned around," TASS said in the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Moscow region.
At the scene of the accident, law enforcement officials work, the circumstances of the incident are found out.
In the Odessa region, a woman threw her newborn son on the construction site, wrapping him in a cellophane bag.
On the evening of August 3, the Split police department received a report from a local resident that he found a package with a baby in an unfinished private house.
"Law enforcement officers and doctors who promptly delivered the child to a medical institution went to the scene of the incident," the head of the Odessa National Police said.
Doctors determined that the boy was born a few hours before his discovery, as evidenced by the presence of umbilical cord.
During the priority operational and investigative activities, the identity of the midwife - a 36-year-old local resident was established.
It is also found that the woman has three other young children.
As noted in the chapter, in the eyes of law enforcement officers, the family had not previously fallen and was not included in a special account.
The circumstances and reasons that prompted the woman to do so are currently being established by the police, after which a procedural decision will be taken.
The baby is now under the supervision of doctors.
As reported earlier, in Nikolaev, a 21-year-old woman threw her premature baby into a garbage dump.
Grigory Leps: "I'm in a fight, although 55 is not 30"
One of the most successful artists of the Russian stage Grigory Leps will celebrate his 55th anniversary on Sunday.
Before the celebration, the singer communicated with the reviewer "Izvestia".
I remember when you said, "Sweetheart."
A special tent in Luzhniki, Gloria Heynor sang for the anniversary, a powerful salute over the Moscow River.
You must have pretended to spend your next five years.
Did the plans come true?
Speaking of profession, it was a good time.
I worked hard, toured the country three times, gave 120-130 concerts a year.
I have released two good albums.
Of course, I’m not the same person I was 20 years ago.
The biological clock is not fooled.
Singing like I sang in my 30s is getting harder.
I'm still fighting, I don't want to stop.
And I'm with new people, I think I'm going to a different level.
You're recording a new album with them, the first in three years.
Yeah, work on it is underway now.
Actually, we've already recorded it all in my studio, and now we're sending it to Los Angeles for a briefing.
It’s called “Why Are You So Serious?” after the song of the same name, which was co-written with Timothy.
It's not quite ready yet, so we haven't put it anywhere yet.
We'll do it later when we make the video.
And the album will be presented in November - to the series of my anniversary concerts in Moscow "Crocus City Hall".
Your new record was handed by cool American drummer Chris Coleman.
Do you think you wanted to include him in your tour?
In my opinion, Coleman is one of the most outstanding drummers in the world today.
He came to me in the studio, recorded his plays.
I offered him to join my band, and Jeremy Coulson (a well-known drummer involved in various projects. - "Izvestia") offered.
But for long-term work in Russia, they put forward, to put it mildly, excessive conditions.
It was about fees from <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>35,000 to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>45,000 per month.
Then I thought that in the post-Soviet space I would find worthy musicians.
And found a great drummer Max Malyshev.
It’s better to feed them (smile).
Sometimes I want to fight one of them, not for anything.
For example, guitarist Fedor Dosumov is highly rated internationally.
Western music magazines write about him, he is invited to various guitar festivals.
Steve Wai, listening to his play, said that "a new generation of guitarists has come, with another performing technique."
Your album is being produced in Los Angeles, American musicians are working with you, but you still can't come to the United States yourself?
Are you trying to lift this ban?
Honestly, I'm not doing anything right now.
There are a number of lawyers who deal with this issue.
“As a musician, I’m really sorry that I can’t go to America.
I’ve said many times that I’m studying there.
The more you communicate with real professionals, the more useful.
We don't fool them, but we don't have that experience, school.
In front of our performers of popular music for 70 years, absolutely not the tasks that have always been solved by American musicians.
They strived for the highest quality sound.
I try to follow the same principles.
Now, for some reason, the UK has refused me entry for ten years.
But I will still apply for a visa to the British embassy every year to be allowed to go there again and most importantly to work there.
The rest of Europe treats me favorably.
And already in August you are planning a concert in Monaco, not a custom, but a poster, right?
Yeah, there's a good Sporting Hall in Monte Carlo, I've been there before.
Now they are invited again, and as far as I know, all tickets to the concert are already sold out.
Will you go to "Random Lyma Waikula", which will start on July 20 in Jurmala?
She invited me, and I, of course, responded.
Lyma is a wonderful singer and a wonderful woman, able to serve herself and beautiful vocals, and even whisper.
After the tours and anniversary concerts, as far as I know, you want to turn to the work of Vladimir Vysotsky.
You already have two albums with his songs in your discography.
When will the third come out?
Probably next year.
But it will be done in a completely different way.
I want to record about 80-90 songs of Vysotsky in about the same feed as he did himself.
Just the voice and the guitar.
No other arrangement at all.
I will be accompanied by our famous musician Timur Vedernikov.
I will try to get Alexander Jakovlevich Rosenbaum to participate in the album.
I talked to him about this, we have a good relationship, but he's a busy man, so let's see how it goes.
You and the songs of Boris Grebenschikov gradually entered your repertoire.
Why don't you write down an album of his stuff later?
Boris Borisovich is a wonderful man and a great musician.
I crossed paths with him several times and asked, “Can I sing one or the other of his songs?”
He replied, "Grigorius, I write songs so that they will be performed."
Please try it, sing it.
I think it’s interesting to record an album like this.
So far I don’t have such a task, but in the future, in a year or two, if Boris Borisovich doesn’t object, I might do such a project.
Unless you focus entirely on the business of your production center.
I'm guessing before you realised his potential, you signed contracts with all the artists you're interested in?
There are a number of performers I would have dreamed of having under my wing, but they are independent, accomplished people.
You mean Sergei Lazarev?
Sergej is a brilliant singer, I invited him.
I may disagree with his repertoire, but he is a professional and he has his own development strategy.
And in my center now there is Alexander Panayotov, whom I led in the "Voice".
We made a deal with him and we're working.
In our pop music, such singers are rare.
It will be a real shame if he doesn’t reach the heights he deserves.
I'm trying to get him a repertoire, I'm taking the clips.
I hope for a good result.
I also try to promote other artists in my center: I buy them songs, I cry for poets, sometimes their tracks get into the rotation of TV and radio channels.
If they do not reach great heights, I will still bring our cooperation to a logical conclusion.
At the exit they will receive a recorded album, several clips.
And then, if they want to, they can go their own way, and I will not insist that they return the money invested in them.
Although I would be happy if one of them would be commercially successful and pay me the interest we agreed on in the contract.
But if that doesn't happen, I'm not going to overwhelm anyone with oxygen.
Let everyone work, break through, prove it, as I once proved it.
If tomorrow you are offered a tour of Ukraine and guaranteed entry into the country, will you go?
I'm still being invited there.
These are mostly closed-ended events.
As for the big tour...
I am a man of my own country, a Russian, I flew to Syria on the same plane that then crashed.
If tomorrow they say that you have to fly to another point in the interest of the state, I will fly.
I don’t care what other bloggers and critics think of me.
I sincerely regret that this situation has worked out for us with Ukraine.
Because I think we are one people and we must be together.
I'm sorry that this is unlikely to happen, at least in the near future.
And before that, I gave 40-50 concerts in Ukraine for a year.
We met like nowhere.
A very grateful audience.
And he has collaborated with several Ukrainian artists: Ani Lorak, St. Loboda, Artem Loik...
There are a lot of talented people in Ukraine, and it is a real pity that now they cannot fully spread their talent to a wide Russian audience.
Music has to bring people together and entertain them.
I would love to invite some great Ukrainian performer to Russia, for example, Slava Vakarchuk, and do a concert with him.
But at the moment, I think it's unlikely...
Andrei Okhlopkov transferred from the cosmodrome
As “U” became known, the technical director of the Vostochny Andrey Ochlopkov cosmodrome began work at the State Space Science and Production Center (SSCCC) named after Khrunichev.
Previously, he was de facto engaged in the construction of the Vostochny spaceport, but due to disagreements with the management of the Center for the Operation of Land and Space Infrastructure (CENKI), he was transferred to the enterprise in Moscow, where he will coordinate production.
Mr. Okhlopkov will not have a substitute: the post of technical director is likely to be abolished, and the functionality is scattered across the units of the CENI.
The fact that the technical director of the East and the deputy general director of the CENI on technological development Andrei Okhlopkov has moved to work in the Khrunichev-named GKNPC, "U" said the top managers of several enterprises of the space industry, as well as an employee of the government apparatus.
"He has been working in the new position for several weeks," the interlocutors of "U" in the industry said.
It was not possible to get an operational comment from the CENKI on Thursday, and Mr. Ochlopkov himself was not available for comment.
However, the information "U" was officially confirmed in the GKNPC.
He decided to move to the post of Director of Production Coordination, - they said at the enterprise. - Andrey Okhlopkov, the task set before him to provide a launch minimum for the first launch on the Eastern spacecraft fully fulfilled.
Mr. Ochlopkov moved to work at the CENKI in 2013, having a service in the space forces, in particular in Baikonur, and in Plesetsk - on the "northern" cosmodrome held the position of the first deputy commander in the rank of colonel.
In 2009, Andrey Okhlopkov became a figurehead in a criminal case.
The investigation accused him of bribery: allegedly, from his submission, regional merchants received state orders for retaliation, but did not comply with the commitments made to clean up the detached parts of the carrier missiles in the Arkhangelsk region and the Republic of Komi.
In 2012, the jury found him innocent.
The responsibilities for technological development entrusted to him in CENKI were extended to various projects, but the main one was the construction of the cosmodrome in the Far East.
The then head of the Federal Space Agency, Oleg Ostapenko, in an interview with "U" said that the situation in the East "was critical already in October 2013".
The fact is that during the planning, a strategic error was made: the completion of the construction and the first launch of the Soyuz-2.1 carrier rocket were planned for the same time - the end of 2015.
To carry out the launch by the end of the year, the construction was decided six months earlier and the deadlines were moved from December to July 2015.
To speed up the process, we had to go through a trick: CENI specialists began to conduct parallel installation of technological equipment on unfinished facilities.
The main proponent of this idea was Andrey Okhlopkov.
Despite the risks and still the transfer (instead of December 2015 "Soyuz" flew only on April 28, 2016), this idea was justified, says the source "U" on the spacecraft: "Otherwise, we would not have made a single launch from the East, but would have engaged in construction".
Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin, who supervised the creation of the cosmodrome, jokingly called Andrei Okhlopkov his "Space Susanin", but it was he who almost always asked for information about the progress of the construction.
Mr. Ochlopkov recalled directly: for example, in an interview with "U", he proposed to deprive the Federal Agency for Special Construction (Specstroy) of the status of the sole contractor in the East and directly work with subcontractors: "Why do we have to lay all the eggs in one basket?"
This idea was supported by the government.
Since 2017, CENKI has assumed the responsibilities of a general contractor in order to complete the construction and installation work on the starting and technical complex by the planned launches in the fourth quarter.
According to "U", the reason for the transition of Mr. Okhlopkov to the new workplace were disagreements with the management of the CENI on the ways of completing the construction of structures and complexes of the cosmodrome, as well as the methods of working with subcontractors.
“It was decided that this would be better for everyone,” says one of the top managers involved in the construction of the East.
An employee of the government apparatus, in turn, calls the decision strange: "He was one of the best specialists, finding an equivalent replacement for him will not be easy."
According to "U", this will not be necessary: the post of Technical Director of the spaceport will be abolished, and its functions will be scattered among the units of CENCI.
In music schools there will be a program of training for two specialties
In the future, students of children’s music schools will be able to receive two specialties at the same time.
According to the Deputy Director of the Department of Science and Education of the Ministry of Culture Svyatoslav Golubenko, for this, it is possible to reread repeating disciplines to the students, and the issue with the payment of other classes on the second specialty to solve with the help of special grants, reports RIA Novosti.
"The Ministry of Culture has taken this issue under control, and together with the expert community we will develop a mechanism that will allow to master two specialties, but at the same time will not contradict the current legislation in the field of education," - said Golubenko.
Last Friday, during Vladimir Putin’s “Non-Child Conversation” with pupils of the children’s center “Sirius”, the student Maria Andreeva reported that she was forced to pay for repeating subjects in the second specialty at the CMSH at the Moscow Conservatory.
The girl said that she is studying violin and piano class and has awards competitions in both directions.
The head of state recognized her issue as very relevant and promised to help.
In Mexico detained 17-year-old Russian climbed on the wall to the skyscraper
In Mexico detained 17-year-old Russian Kirill N., who climbed the wall on the roof of a high-rise building, reports the portal El Universal.
The incident took place in the capital city of Mexico.
The young man, with the help of two unknown men, crossed a three-meter fence into the territory of the Nestle office building complex and entered one of his towers on his own.
At the same time, he did not use any special equipment, insurance and rope.
The young man was already on the roof.
Officials of the Ministry of Public Security landed him on a helicopter.
He was then sent to the National Institute of Migration.
They find out if the young man is legally in the territory of the country.
Meanwhile, the video of a young man climbing to the top has become popular on the Internet.
Users called the boy a “spider-man.”
According to the media, such experiments are a hobby for him.
Red meat, dairy products, and chocolate can help alleviate BPH.
Red meat and chocolate are considered a nightmare for your digestive tract.
But recent research suggests the opposite: a diet rich in meat proteins and dairy products can help alleviate symptoms in those suffering from inflammatory bowel diseases.
This incurable disease, which affects approximately 1.3 million people in the United States and 300,000 in the UK, leads to colic and bloating, chronic or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
Usually, to alleviate symptoms, patients are advised to avoid meat and dairy products, but researchers from the University of Washington have found that the main amino acid protein tryptophan promotes the production of immune cells that increase intestinal tolerance.
Lead researcher Dr. Marco Colonna explained that the immune cells in the intestines make sure that the harmful microbes that come with food do not penetrate the body.
Cells capable of triggering the inflammatory process are balanced by cells that increase tolerance, protecting the body and not harming sensitive tissues.
If the balance is too severely disturbed towards inflammation, it can lead to inflammatory bowel diseases.
Experiments have shown that mice that have a certain bacteria in the intestine have increased cell tolerance.
And this bacteria needs tryptophan, one of the building blocks of the protein, to trigger the appearance of these cells.
Professor Colonna said: "We have established a link between one species of bacteria - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is part of the normal gut microbiome, and the development of a tolerance-enhancing cell population.
The more tryptophan was contained in the mice’s diet, the more of these immune cells they had.”
He suggested that the same would work in humans: a combination of L. reuteri and a tryptophan-rich diet could contribute to a more tolerant and less prone to inflammation in the intestine.
Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barraganvas, studying a variety of tolerance-enhancing immune cells, found that one group of mice had these cells and the other group, which belonged to the same line, but were contained separately, did not.
She suggested that the difference could be caused by mice’s gut microbiomes — communities of bacteria, viruses, and fungi that typically live in the gastrointestinal tract.
The mice’s gut cell DNA was sequenced, and six types of bacteria were found present in mice with immune cells but absent in mice without them.
Mice raised in a sterile environment that did not have a good microbiome and did not develop this type of immune cells received L. reuteri, and immune cells appeared in them.
To understand how bacteria affect the immune system, the researchers grew L. reuteri in a liquid environment and then transferred small portions of the fluid — without bacteria — to underdeveloped immune cells secreted from mice.
Immune cells have turned into cells that increase tolerance.
When the active ingredient was separated from the liquid, it turned out to be a by-product of the processing of tryptophan, known as indol-3-lactic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mice’s food, the number of these cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the level of tryptophan was reduced by half, the number of cells also dropped by twice.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explains that humans have as much cell tolerance as mice, and most of us have L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known whether the by-products of tryptophan from L. reuteri contribute to cell development in humans as much as in mice, but defects in the genes associated with tryptophan have been found in people suffering from inflammatory bowel diseases.
She says: “It’s possible that we need to strengthen the development of these cells, because inflammatory processes on the inner surface of the intestines depend on these cells.
High levels of tryptophan in the presence of L. reuteri could potentially lead to an increase in their population."
According to Jose Mourinho, "Manchester United" hired "genius" in the face of Nemanja Matich
Manchester United have hired a "genius" in the face of Nemanja Mati<0xC4><0x87>, says Jose Mourinho after the midfielder made his debut in a game against Sampdoria on Wednesday evening.
The player, acquired for <0xC2><0xA3>40 million from Chelsea, started with a 2-1 win in Dublin in the last pre-season match of the United before the match of the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid on Thursday and made an impression in the role of a midfielder, a midfielder.
However, since Matic did not take part in the pre-season tour of Chelsea in Asia, he seriously lacked preparation for the game, and he endured only 45 minutes, which, according to Mourinho, requires refinement before the start of the Premier League season.
“He needs time, but his experience, his mind, his genius is how he thinks – he thinks football,” Mourinho said.
“We’ll help him prepare sooner rather than later.”
Like Matich, his new teammates Viktor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku started playing at the Aviva Stadium when Mourinho began forming his main line-up by the start of the next season.
The Independent reported this week that Mourinho wanted to hire three more players, but stressed that the club had already achieved fantastic results by hiring three of the four players he would like to hire in the first place.
"I am grateful to the club for having scored three out of four," he added.
“I’d be even happier if they got me four out of four, but they’ve already done a lot for me.”
Former leaders of Lithuanian Social Democrats persuade them to remain in the ruling coalition
Former presidents of the Social Democratic Party of Lithuania, former prime ministers Algirdas Butkevi<0xC4><0x8D>ius and Gediminas Kirkilas, as well as the former speaker of the Seimas from the Social Democrats, Cheslovas Yurshenas, appealed to the one-party members to remain in the ruling coalition.
As reported by the Parliamentary Gazette, because of frictions with partners - the Union of Peasants and the "Greens" - in the Social Democratic Party, a discussion has been initiated about whether to remain in the ruling coalition.
And here are three senior experienced comrades addressed to the one-party with an open letter, in which, in particular, says: "It is clear the disappointment of the comrades of the party with the results of the elections, but the coalition with the "peasants" created for us not very easy, but still the conditions for further implementation of the program of social goals.
According to the former party leaders, the discussion so far "has taken hold of an emotion-based expression of opinion without specific arguments".
The authors of the letter fear that their reckless actions could lead Lithuania to political, economic and social instability.
Anton Mamayev was fined for his disability
The Mosgorsud reduced the punishment of wheelchair disabled Anton Mamayev from four and a half years of imprisonment to a fine of 200,000 rubles.
Earlier, by a decision of the Timiryazevsky court, the convicted person was released from the SIZO.
At the same time, the Mosgorsud confirmed that the accused is a criminal, as he organized the theft and abduction of a scooter from a former special forces fighter.
By its decision, the Moscow court mitigated the punishment of Anton Mamaev to 200,000 rubles. fine.
"Mamayev is the organizer of the robbery, which also constitutes the composition of the crime, and, accordingly, such a person should be prosecuted," said U.S. press secretary Ulyan Solopov.
In this case, the court took into account the state of health of Mamayev, the actual circumstances of the case, the absence of aggravating circumstances.
In addition, the court applied Article 64 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation, according to which it is possible to assign a penalty below the lower limit.
As for Mamayev’s assistant Vasily Seroshtanov, the court did not establish the circumstances that would be the basis for changing the severity category of the sentence committed and changing the sentence.
Anton Mamayev himself said he was dissatisfied with the decision of Mosgorsud.
I am disappointed with the court’s decision.
The only legal solution would be an excuse, intending to fight for justice.
His lawyer Andrey Orlov did not rule out appealing the sentence in the cassation instance of Mosgorsuda and the Supreme Court.
“We will use all leverage up to the European Court of Human Rights,” he told RIA Novosti.
The 28-year-old Anton Mamayev, suffering from spinal muscle atrophy, became a figurehead of the criminal case in the fall of last year.
The disabled claims that he bought a scooter from friends for 160,000 rubles, to then sell.
However, the owners of the scooter, including a former special forces fighter, said that the disabled man and his assistant Vasily Seroshtanov took their property, threatening to use violence.
On June 30, the Timiryazevsky District Court of Moscow sentenced Vasily Seroshtanov to three years of colony, and Anton Mamayev to four and a half years of imprisonment with serving a sentence in a colony of the general regime (Article 162(2) of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation).
After the immobile disabled person was placed in the SYZO, the Public Chamber, the Prosecutor General’s Office, the Human Rights Commissioner under President Tatyana Moskalkova, joined the case.
As a result, in mid-July Anton Mamayev was released from the SIZO by a decision of the same Timiryazevsky court.
The defense, in turn, appealed the decision of the first instance in Mosgorsud.
ONF will prepare a report on the environment to the President
The final “Forum of Action” of the All-Russian People’s Front (NFF) in 2017 will be devoted to environmental issues, a source in the FNF told Izvestia and confirmed the head of the executive committee of the movement, Alexei Anissimov.
According to him, according to the results of the forum, the "front-runners" plan to prepare a report to the president on the problems of the domestic environment, as well as to propose a strategy to solve them.
Interlocutors of Izvestia in the ONF note that the report of the head of state will contain a "deep analysis" of the situation in all federal districts of the country.
According to "Izvestia", the final forum of the ONF will be held in the autumn.
The exact date has not yet been determined - as a rule, it is tailored to the schedule of the president, who is the leader of the movement and traditionally present at the key events of the ONF.
The Front held several interregional environmental conferences, one for two federal districts - in Rostov-on-Don, Kaliningrad and Kirov.
The result will be a conference in the capital of the Republic of Buryatia Ulan-Ude.
On the basis of the proposals that have been and will be expressed at these events, we will form system proposals for solving environmental problems," the interlocutor at the ONF told Izvestia.
Olga Timofeeva, Co-Chair of the Central Headquarters of the Movement, head of the State Duma Committee on Ecology and Environmental Protection, said that the “front-runners” will report to the head of state about the work carried out within the framework of the Year of the Environment in Russia.
The final environmental forum and the "Forum of Action" of the ONF are likely to be combined.
Over the year, we were surrounded by a powerful team of experts in the field of environmental problems, saw gaps in the legislation, stopped dozens of violations of the law.
All this will be part of the report that we are preparing for the President as the leader of our movement.
In addition to this document, the "front-runners" are also reported on the work on priority projects of the ONF," Olga Timofeeva told Izvestia.
According to her, the special representative of the head of state on environmental activities, ecology and transport Sergey Ivanov will be invited to the forum.
Previously, he had already participated in the work of the ONF Media Forum, which took place in St. Petersburg in April.
In a few months, the Year of Ecology will go down in history, and the most important thing to do today is to launch environmental mechanisms so that they work for years to come.
So that these questions do not fall off the agenda, - added Olga Timofeeva.
Andrey Koliadin, head of the Laboratory of Regional Policy of the Expert Institute of Social Research (EISI), noted that by raising the environmental issue, the ONF is acting in line with the presidential agenda.
Many things they offered as experts in various forums, and these initiatives received the support of the President," Andrei Koliadin told Izvestia.
He stressed that the economic potential of the environmental agenda cannot be excluded to date, which could give the regions an additional impetus for development.
In the future, with the help of the ONF, the regions will be able to pro-lobby not only the solution of their environmental problems, but also the development of ecotourism, - added the expert.
The relevance of the environmental issue was demonstrated by a "straight line" with Vladimir Putin in June.
In particular, the President was asked questions about garbage dumps in Balashikha (already closed) and about coal dust in the port of the city of Nakhodka (already drafted a law on the prohibition of open transshipment of coal in settlements, one of the authors - Olga Timofeeva).
Experts in the field of ecology believe that the legal basis for solving environmental problems in Russia as a whole has been created, the issue is in the further law enforcement practice, as well as in the position of civil society.
We need a clear implementation of the decisions made by the state, - says the head of the charitable foundation "Ecology for all" Leonid Bochin.
Sergey Tsyplenkov, head of the NGO Greenpeace Russia, in a conversation with Izvestia, stressed that a responsible approach of society and business is necessary for a successful solution of environmental problems, only few legislative efforts.
Once society and business realize that solving environmental problems is a much more profitable step in a strategic perspective, the situation will change, - said Sergey Tsyplenkov.
The expert stressed that it is necessary to reverse the trend that violation of environmental legislation is an economically viable solution for business.
A British inventor implanted a microchip to get into a house and car at the stroke of a hand
The British inventor became the first person in the country to have a microchip installed so that he could open the door of his home, enter the office and even start the car with a simple shake of his hand.
Thirty-three-year-old Stephen Northam has implanted a tiny chip between his big and pointing fingers and now through his firm BioTech offers this service to firms and individuals who want to simplify their lives at the expense of technology.
He teamed up with Dr. Jeff Watson, a Royal Anesthesiologist in Winchester, to ensure that the procedure was performed in accordance with medical standards.
The technology is similar to a microchip that is implanted in cats and dogs, and the procedure takes only 30 seconds.
Northam is also replacing locks in homes and cars with chip-compatible locks at a price of <0xC2><0xA3>300 per lock.
The married father of one child has already installed the technology in his home and in his car “BMW Z4”, which starts when his hand is on the wheel.
Requisite for the White House cost taxpayers thousands of dollars
According to the Armed Forces records provided to TIME magazine, the White House’s decision last month to drive a naval helicopter to the South Lawn for an event dedicated to American industrial production cost taxpayers as much as $24,000.
The white-green Sikorsky VH-3D, known as “Marine One” when the president is on board, became the central element of the event held on July 17 in the White House, which demonstrated American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officials surveyed tech products from all fifty states.
The helicopter, produced in Connecticut, was displayed next to a yacht from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin, and a truck from Mississippi.
According to the records of the First Squadron of Marine Helicopters (HMX-1), the department responsible for the control of the helicopter, the Military Department of the White House ordered the presence of the helicopter in a private order, or "FRAGO", just 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Pole.
“I just wanted you to make sure you were aware because this is an unusually widely reported event in the press,” the HMX-1 commander wrote in an email to his chief, the first deputy chief of aviation for the Marine Corps, on the eve of the event.
The letter indicated that the helicopter would arrive at the South Lawn at about 7 a.m. on July 17 to participate in an event scheduled for 3 a.m. and stay there until the lawn is released between 6 and 9 p.m. on the same day.
The letter adds that if departure from the White House is delayed, a second crew will be required for the return flight in accordance with the hours of work restrictions.
The first crew accompanied the helicopter during the event, and the unit's security personnel remained close to the aircraft while it was on the ground.
From the records received by TIME magazine, it remains unclear whether a second crew was required as a result.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes.
According to the records, the HMX-1 clarified whether the event contradicts this decision.
“Among other things, we asked if this was a violation of Hatch’s law, and we were told that it was not,” the commander wrote.
“You seem to have nowhere to go,” the deputy chief replied.
The "Made in America" event was declared by the White House as an official event, and the Hatch Act did not apply to it.
But even the official events have political notes.
During the event, the president made efforts to promote health care reform, which was then in the process of being drafted in the Senate, and praised attempts to regulate government regulations.
The use of aircraft known as “Marine One” and “Air Force One” for political purposes is unlikely to be a new phenomenon.
Presidents are required to use them for travel.
But requesting them only in the interests of photography is unusual.
Trump was already the subject of discussion in February, when a presidential plane went into the background during his first election rally in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account was flooded with complaints about his predecessor’s use of the presidential plane.
“The White House is delighted with the ‘Made in America’ show, which featured products from 50 states made by American workers from American materials,” said Lindsay Walters, deputy White House spokeswoman.
The HMX-1 crews often perform training flights around the Washington Agglomeration and on the South Lawn to train the transport of the President of the United States to the White House with an accuracy of up to an inch.
When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany in early July, the HMX-1 conducted 58 training runs at the White House.
According to one of the officials, the flight, made for the event "Made in America", was counted to the crew at the expense of the necessary training flights for a month.
Helicopters of the unit on that day also encountered 11 additional hours as part of "non-presidential support tasks".
According to the White House, the taxpayers were not charged for any of the other exhibits presented at the event.
A representative of the company "Sikorsky" reported that the company did not participate in the organization of the demonstration of the helicopter on the South Lawn.
The HMX-1 does not take into account the budget for presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact amount spent on the event.
But, according to the hourly rates of the Ministry of Defense for the 2017 fiscal year, the rate of reimbursement of the Ministry of Defense for VH-3D is $ 24,380 per hour of flight.
The unit's records recorded that the aircraft's time in the air was 30 minutes in each direction from its airfield based at the Quantico Marine Air Base in Virginia.
The White House claims that the actual cost of using a helicopter is much lower than this rate.
“Calculating the cost for taxpayers based on the approximate rate of reimbursement is completely wrong,” says Walters.
“These approximate rates include staffing, service, and many other irreversible costs that are included in the annual appropriations.”
According to a study conducted in 2015 by RAND Corporation, the reimbursement rates do not include the cost of personnel, but, indeed, take into account the cost of fuel, service and expenses specified in the contract.
At the time, former White House press secretary Sean Spicer defended the use of the helicopter for the event.
“The idea is to showcase this week the things that have been done in America,” Spicer said.
And I know that Sikorsky and Connecticut are very proud of the fact that they are contributing to national security, and that there are, I suppose, hundreds, if not thousands, of people whose jobs depend on it.
And I think, like most Americans, we are all proud of this helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans have worked tirelessly to create.
So, of course, it’s important to pay attention to that.”
It was unclear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter while inspecting the South Lawn during the event, but he was exactly in the driver’s seat in the fire truck.
Inside the White House, Trump appealed to representatives of the Sikorsky company, joking with the press about his own fleet of products of the company.
“I know Sikorsky well,” the president said.
Moscow will allocate grants for resuscitation departments of urban hospitals
Every year, grants "Saving Lives" will be allocated to resuscitations and intensive care departments of the metropolitan hospitals.
Means do to encourage doctors and nurses.
Mayor of Moscow Sergey Sobyanin visited the City Clinical Hospital named Yudin.
During the examination of the clinic, he handed over a letter of thanks to the traumatologist-orthopedist Victor Prozko, under whose direction the most complex operation for the reconstruction of the foot of the teenager was carried out.
Sergey Sobyanin also spoke about the decision to allocate grants annually to resuscitations and intensive care units of urban clinics.
The funds will be directed to the encouragement of doctors and nurses.
According to the mayor of the capital, the Yudin Clinical Hospital is one of the largest in Moscow to date.
In recent years, the clinic has received new modern equipment, allowing its doctors to carry out unique operations.
The clinic was opened in 1961 on the basis of the Kolomna Rural Hospital.
Currently, the offices of the medical institution are designed to accommodate more than a thousand patients.
In addition to resuscitation and hospital there are dayrooms.
The hospital has 2,800 staff.
The total area occupying the medical clinic is 23.7 hectares.
In February of this year, the medical institution became a participant in the pilot project on the organization of short-term hospital stays (SKP).
They are designed for relatively small operations.
In the process of surgical interventions, advanced medical equipment is used, which allows to significantly reduce the time of rehabilitation of patients.
After the operation in the hospital, they spend only a few hours.
In the first half of this year alone, 36,000 patients were hospitalized at the Yudina Clinical Hospital.
Medical staff of the clinic performed 15,800 operations of varying degrees of complexity.
NBU reported on the absence of buyers of the Ukrainian "daughter" Sberbank
The National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) reported the absence of applications for the purchase of the Ukrainian "daughter" of Sberbank.
About this on Friday, August 4, reports TASS with reference to a representative of the press service of the NBU.
NBU confirms that on August 3, 2017, a package of documents from the citizen of Belarus and Cyprus Viktor Prokopeni for the agreement of the indirect (via Paritetbank) acquisition of 100 percent of the shares of Sberbank was withdrawn.
"Documents from other potential investors for the purchase of Sberbank shares in the NBU were not received," the statement said.
On August 3, Belarusian businessman Victor Prokopenya withdrew the application for the purchase of the subsidiary structure of Sberbank.
On July 28, it became known that the National Bank of Ukraine refused to Russian businessmen Said Guseriyev and Grigory Guselennikov in the acquisition of the Ukrainian "daughter" of Sberbank.
The regulator justified his decision by the fact that the businessmen did not provide the necessary documents for verification of their compliance with the requirements of the legislation of Ukraine.
Sberbank announced the sale of its Ukrainian “daughter” to Norvik Banka and a private Belarusian company in March this year.
The majority shareholder of the consortium was Said Gutseriev, the son of Russian businessman Mikhail Gutseriev.
Sanctions against the “daughters” of five Russian banks in Ukraine, among which was Sberbank, were introduced in mid-March.
During the year, they are prohibited from withdrawing capital from the country for the benefit of mother organizations.

Democracy in Afghanistan depends on the role of women in politics, the UN said.
Elections can only be representative if they involve all members of society, including women, the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan said on Wednesday.
According to Nicholas Haysom, the current head of the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, hundreds of women are running for provincial councils, three women are fighting for the post of vice president, and more than 30 percent of the newly registered voters are women.
"It is impossible to overestimate the role of women," he said in a statement on Wednesday.
Choices can only be fully representative when women are fully involved in them and involved in all stages of the electoral process.
Elections for provincial councils and presidential elections will be held in Afghanistan on April 5.
The Taliban threatens to disrupt the election process, which coincides with the transition of international forces from combat operations to the role of advisers.
In this year’s election, for the first time, power moves peacefully from one democratically elected government to another.
Haysom said that increasing the role of women would contribute to the success of democracy in Afghanistan.
According to the Independent Election Commission of Afghanistan, out of a total of 3.6 million registered voters, 1.2 million are women.
The Prosecutor General's Office approved the indictment in the case of Nikita White
The Prosecutor General's Office of Russia has approved an indictment in the criminal case against the former governor of the Kirov region Nikita Belykh, accused of receiving a large bribe.
About this on Thursday, August 3, reported in the department, reports RIA Novosti.
The materials were transferred to the Presnensky District Court of Moscow for consideration on the merits.
In Venice, tightened fines for tourists for inappropriate behavior
The Venetian authorities have tightened the fines for swimming in canals from 50 euros to 500 euros.
For walks around the city in a swimsuit or with a naked torso will now be fined 200 euros.
For 100 euros will be required from those who arrange a picnic in a public place or ride a bicycle through pedestrian areas, TASS reports with reference to the Association of tour operators of Russia.
In addition, it is mentioned that the authorities provide for a fine for inscriptions on monuments of 400 euros and for garbage of 25 euros.
To inform tourists about the need to comply with the rules of conduct in Venice will be with the help of the special company "EnjoyRespectVenezia" (#EnjoyRespectVenezia) on social networks, as well as through advertisements and posters on the website of the city council, on billboards and in places of the largest crowd of tourists.
The campaign will be conducted in 10 languages.
According to Paola Mar, Venice’s tourism adviser, information about the fines will be transferred to the embassies of the violators’ home countries, in order to warn their compatriots of such mistakes.
“The problem is that Venice is perceived as a beach,” she said.
In April, the administration of the Italian city announced plans to limit the flow of tourists.
Venice already has a successful limit on the number of tourists visiting the city center.
Instead of 100,000 people wanting to watch the Festa del Redentore, only 60,000 guests were admitted to the venue.
In addition, a moratorium has been imposed on the creation of new hotels and fast food restaurants in the historic part of Venice.
Officials of the State Border Service detained 272 illegally at the border with EU countries in the first half of 2017; a total of 1,059 illegal migrants were detained.
This was reported to the State Border Service.
Of these, 314 people were detained for illegally crossing the border, and the rest for violating the rules of residence of foreigners in Ukraine and other offences.

SF dismissed Ozerov from the position of head of the committee
The Federation Council on Wednesday endorsed the statement of the Chairman of the Committee on Defence and Security, Viktor Ozerov, and dismissed him from this position.
He remains a senator from Khabarovsk region.
A statement requesting his release from the position of the Ozerov wrote last week.
He explained his decision by the need for rotation and his desire to “change the rhythm of life”.
The senator also noted that the decision to resign was not immediate.
Victor Ozerov has been representing the Khabarovsk Territory Legislative Assembly in the Russian Federation since 1996.
The Committee on Defence and Security has been chaired by the Senator since 2001.
Electricity is cheaper for both residents and commodity producers of Buryatia
The decades-long efforts of the Soviet and post-Soviet authorities of the Republic of Buryatia (Eastern Siberia) to establish fair tariffs for electricity consumers are beginning to bear fruit.
From 1 September, the cost of low-voltage electricity for industrial receivers will be reduced by 25%.
Federal Antitrust Service of the country in accordance with the Decree of the Government of the Russian Federation No. 2 "On the introduction of changes in the Regulations of the wholesale market of electricity and power and in the consolidated forecast balance of production and supply of electrical energy (power) within the framework of the Unified Energy System of Russia" (Business of the Russian Federation) 17.07
As a result, the cost of electricity for Buryat commodity producers is reduced by a quarter, which will significantly ease the lives of small and medium-sized enterprises and individual entrepreneurs.
For many decades, the heads of the republic overwhelmed the thresholds of the Moscow cabinets in vain attempts to equalize the region in tariffs with the neighboring Irkutsk region with the cascade of hydroelectric power plants in Angar, which flows from Baikal, the main water catchment area for which is the bury.
And it was only this year that the movements began.
In March, tariffs on electricity for the population of the Republic were reduced from 4.24 rubles/kWh to 3.93 rubles/kWh, or by 7.3%.
With the inclusion of Buryatia by decision of the federal government in the List of territories of price zones of the wholesale market, for which the characteristics of the functioning of wholesale and retail markets are established, industrial consumers have come in.
According to analysts, this is only the beginning, as the population of the Irkutsk region pays per kilowatt hour 1.01 rubles.
But no one dares to name at least an approximate date for the new tariff moves towards a reduction for Buryatia.
Scooter was not afraid of the Prosecutor General's Office of Ukraine and flew to Crimea
A legend of electronic dance music, the Scooter group flew to Crimea without fear of threats from the Prosecutor General’s Office of Ukraine.
"The flight went well, and tomorrow I will have a concert," said H.P. Baxter's frontman.
Earlier, the German edition of Bild, citing Deputy Prosecutor General of Ukraine Yevgeny Yenin, said that for arriving in Crimea, which is considered a temporarily occupied territory of Ukraine, musicians could face up to eight years in prison.
Scooter’s performance at a festival in Balaclava, called #ZBFest, is scheduled for August 4.

The National Union of Unskilled, Municipal and Boiler Workers (GMB) is concerned about the investment at McVitie's factory in Glasgow
The union demands guarantees from the managers of the biscuit manufacturer McVitie's in connection with its long-term commitment to produce at the Glasgow plant.
The Scottish branch of GMB reports that the company has circumvented the question of future investments at the Tolkros facility.
The factory, which produces, among other products, Hobnobs cookies and Rich Tea, employs more than 500 people.
Pladis, the owner of McVitie’s, says it has invested more than <0xC2><0xA3>5 million in the facility over the past few years.
The company adds that in the event of any changes in the work of the facility, employees and representatives of the trade union "will know about them first".
In a letter to the head of the company's facility, the Scottish branch of GMB demanded McVitie's response to concerns that funding would not be spent on modernizing production lines.
Senior organizer Drew Duffy said: “Our union members are deeply concerned that we cannot get clarity from the general manager of the facility on business needs and investment plan regarding the future of Tolcross.”
Families have worked here for generations, and the concentration of workers is great in the local society and in the Greater Glasgow area; it is an important pillar of decent work in the area of high unemployment and social deprivation.
Thus, in terms of jobs, wages and prosperity, and against the backdrop of Brexit, rising subsistence levels and a chronic decline in production, East End Glasgow desperately needs the prosperity of production at McVitie's factory.
According to Pladis, “The head of the Tolkross facility only yesterday received a letter from the Scottish branch of GMB, and the company will respond immediately, as we appreciate our constant cooperation with employees and representatives of the union.”
Two months ago, we held a regular meeting in Tolcross with employees and representatives of GMB, at which we openly discussed a number of issues.
We talked to our employees about the fact that, like all companies operating in the most competitive and unstable economic climate, we are constantly reviewing our actions – and this applies to all our facilities and activities – to remain competitive.
“In recent years, we have invested more than <0xC2><0xA3>5 million in our Tolkross facility, especially in production lines and improvements in functional performance.”
We are fully aware of the value of Tolkross as a production facility, and in the event of any changes in the work at this facility, employees and representatives of the trade union will be the first to know about it.”
Putin says authorities will not give instructions to Rosneft and Gazprom
Vladimir Putin said that the Kremlin and the Cabinet of Ministers should be connected to the issue of gas supplies to the Eastern Petroleum Company (EPC), but no one will give instructions to Gazprom, like Rosneft.
Thus, Russian President Vladimir Putin responded to the request of Igor Sechin to assist in resolving the controversies that have arisen.
The head of state drew attention to the fact that relations between Rosneft and Gazprom should be decided exclusively on the basis of market principles.
Earlier, the head of Rosneft, Igor Sechin, at a meeting on the implementation of major investment projects in the Far Eastern Federal District, said that the lack of an agreement with Gazprom on gas for VNHC jeopardizes the project's implementation timeline.
Sechin noted that the dialogue with Gazprom on this issue continues.
Gazprom offers to find gas resources from Rosneft’s perimeter, but we do not have such resources,” Sechin added.
Rosneft has asked for permission to use gas from Gazprom’s Kirin field on the Sakhalin Shelf for the Eastern Petrochemical Company.
In June, Gazprom said that negotiations on the issue were continuing, and “there are no sharp corners there.”
Did PSG warn Barcelona about Neymar’s transition three years ago?
La Liga member may regret his interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not stop chasing Neymar after the club offered <0xC2><0xA3>189 million for his redemption, but did they warn Barcelona of a world record strike three years ago?
The sensational offer revived the summer transfer window when Ligue 1 club was ready to break the world record for the cost of the transition, more than double the previous mark associated with the return of Paul Pogba to Manchester United last season for <0xC2><0xA3>89 million.
When the transition is complete, Neymar will become the most expensive player in the world, as well as the highest-paid professional athlete in the world, as PSG offers him a salary of over <0xC2><0xA3>500,000 per week.
It is known that Barcelona are furious at how the offer was made and how Neymar broke the contract, despite the fact that, as a source close to the Catalan club's leadership insists, the club has always done everything possible for the player since his move from Santos in 2013.
But was not the football world warned of this possibility three years ago by the President of PSG?
When Manchester City expressed an interest in recruiting Bless Mathuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Helaifi issued a harsh warning to any club that would like to lure one of PSG’s best players.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we're going to go against them, we're going to make proposals to their players," al-Helaifi said.
“We respect all the clubs.
But if they try to recruit one of our players, they have consequences.”
Apparently, Barcelona crossed this line when the Spanish club earlier this summer expressed interest in the midfielder from PSG Marco Verratti.
PSG has made it clear that it will not release an Italian team player under any circumstances, and now Barcelona is probably feeling the consequences of its offer in the form of the loss of one of its most valuable players, Neymar.
Putin ordered to deal with the payments suffered by the forest fires.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has instructed to deal with the material assistance that is being provided to the residents affected by forest fires and the construction of new housing.
Today I would like to hear how the work is going.

I have some discrepancy.
"In this regard, I would also like to ask the relevant colleagues about how much money has been allocated," Putin said at a meeting with the leaders of the regions located in Baikal.
On August 4, Vladimir Putin visited the Baikal State Natural Biosphere Reserve.
Putin was accompanied by the authorized representative of the President of the Russian Federation in the Siberian Federal District Sergei Meniailo and the head of the head of the Baikal branch of the FGB "Glavrybvod" Leonid Mikhailik.
They talked about the work on cleaning the lake.
They then showed the malts in an open container next to the container, which they prepared for breeding.
At first, Putin released a few kittens from the puppy.
Then he pulled for a special lever on the lid of the container and released the others.
Also during the trip, the leader instructed to deal with the environmental situation on the Baikal and to build a road on the island of Olchon.
According to the Ministry, one volume is needed, and a supposedly different volume is provided.
"I want to understand what is actually happening there with funding," the Russian leader said.
During the forest fires of 2017, the villages of Buryatia, Irkutsk region were burned, residential houses and commercial buildings were destroyed.

In an interview with Komsomolskaya Pravda, the Russian singer described Manson as “bad” and “a waste”.
According to Loza, foreign artists who allow themselves to make such statements do not need to be invited to Russia.
In addition, Loza believes that Manson should be "put to death" for his words.
