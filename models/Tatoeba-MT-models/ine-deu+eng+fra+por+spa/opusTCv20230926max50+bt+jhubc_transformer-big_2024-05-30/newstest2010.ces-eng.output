Barack Obama is the fourth US President to receive the Nobel Peace Prize.
U.S. President Barack Obama will fly to Oslo for 26 hours to be the fourth U.S. President to win the Nobel Peace Prize.
The Diploma, Medal and Cheque for $1.4 million will be awarded for his outstanding efforts to strengthen world diplomacy and cooperation among nations.
The head of the White House will arrive in the Norwegian metropolis in the morning with his wife Michelle and will be busy.
He first visits the Nobel Institute, where he meets for the first time with five members of the committee, who selected him in October from 172 people and 33 organizations.
The presidential couple then have a scheduled meeting with King Harald V of Norway and Queen Sonja.
In the afternoon, the visit will culminate in a ceremonial ceremony at which Obama will take over the prestigious award.
He will be the fourth President of the United States, but only the third to win the award directly in office.
The White House has already warned that Obama will talk about the Afghan war when he receives the award.
The president does not want to avoid this issue because he realizes that he is taking over the award as a president who is currently at war in two countries.
He stepped up his war effort a few days ago by sending more troops to Afghanistan, which he will not forget to highlight any of his critics.
At the ceremony, Obama will also receive a gold medal, diploma and a check for ten million Swedish kronor (about 24 million Czech kronor).
He intends to donate to charity, but has not yet decided on a specific charity.
The busy program will then introduce the president to a banquet, where, in addition to the Norwegian king and queen, the Prime Minister and 250 other invited guests will also be present.
From the outset, Obama has been more cautious about the price.
He said, for example, that he feels that he does not fully deserve it.
He also repeated several times that it is not just a price for him, but for all who strive for the same values as him.
Immediately after the announcement, he said it was a "challenge to action".
Protector of Nature Accused of Blackmail
The Litom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice police accused the president of the civic association Society of Nature Protectors of Litom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice of extortion.
In several cases in the past year, he has appealed to some construction procedures, for withdrawing the appeal he has asked investors for money for his benefit, said Litom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice police spokeswoman Alena Romová.
The Chairman of the Litom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice Society of Nature Protectors is Lubomír Studni<0xC4><0x8D>ka.
He is now in custody and faces up to three years in prison.
Brno sorting containers do not smell much
In Prague, ordinary people can sort the packaging from drinks, in South Moravian villages you will again find sorting containers at every step.
And in Brno?
There to reserve a few minutes before you find suitable garbage.
I don’t want to say that in Brno waste would not be categorized at all.
But it seems to me that the fact that we are the second largest city in the republic, the councilors are not interested enough in this problem.
Brno is in the forestry league of waste sorting not only by the fact that as citizens we can still throw only paper, glass and plastics into the sorting containers, but above all by the number of garbage dumps on such waste.
For example, have you ever tried to throw a PET bottle into a collection basket in the center?
It's a ready-made cumming, especially it takes time and firm nerves.
The only place I have encountered so far is in Moravian Square opposite Potrefené Huse.
Don't let Mr. Underka and his colleagues get mad at me, but I don't think that's enough.
Not to mention that there is no honey in waste sorting in other parts of the world.
A lot of my friends don't like to sort the trash.
Laziness.
It’s far from the garbage dumps.
I'm not surprised by them.
After the party, I offered to throw away a couple of glass and plastic bottles.
But I didn't see any color garbage in sight on Kounicova Street.
Fortunately, I came to the right place on my way to the shale.
But the garbage flowed out of it.
After all, it is still the center of Brno, which perhaps the city represents most, right?!
But the ecology and some aesthetics of probably Brno socialists are not very interested.
These cities would rather buy an extra hockey league, which would embarrass us throughout the republic, than buy a few extra containers and offer sorting of other raw materials for a cleaner Brno.
I am glad that I was able to confirm my assumption after a moment of browsing the Internet with official statistics.
According to data from EKO-KOM, Brno is really the worst in the whole South Moravian region.
"Paroubk<0xC5><0xAF>v" budget took money for pensions and sickness
After the left has added, despite the government’s opinion, to farmers or officials, there may not be money in the budget for pensions, sickness or construction savings.
But also on interest on public debt or on international court disputes.
This will cause problems for those who will rule in the second half of next year, Finance Minister Eduard Janota said.
When the Social Democrats and Communists pushed for increases to some groups, they relied on the government to borrow extra money on sensitive expenses, pensions, or sickness. "It's just postponing the problems to the future, laying mines," says Janota.
In fact, the money borrowed is paying higher and higher interest, and sometimes it has to be returned.
There is not much to choose from, the state has no choice.
If they do not reduce social benefits or the cost of running the state, they must raise taxes.
To all that the left has now added: firefighters, teachers, farmers.
And later, their children.
People don’t have to worry about pensions or sickness, from whose account 1.8 billion have disappeared, they will get them.
However, at the cost of more debt, the country will not only be missing 163 billion in the treasury next year, but more.
Despite Minister Janota’s efforts, the debt will grow faster and, with it, the cost of interest.
The state will need money to pay for it, and it will no longer be enough to slightly increase VAT or reduce motherhood, as the government did in its deficit package.
Due to the transfers of money in favour of several groups of voters, there will also be a shortage of five billion for the construction of highways and railways next year.
These are mostly already competitive and deployed sections that cannot be redesigned and possibly discounted.
Canned at most, which is also not free.
This means delaying or stopping 30 major construction projects, and also jeopardizing the withdrawal of European money, warns Transport Ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka.
The <0xC4><0x8C>SSD suggested that the loss of money would be solved by salamons – it would reach out to the dividends of the <0xC4><0x8C>EZ, which the state owns for the most part, and from them it would contribute to the transport fund.
The problem is that the amount of the dividend is never certain, and it is no longer a wasteful resource at all.
Last year, 18 billion came from the CEZ to the budget.
Annually, the dividends pay for the liquidation of environmental damage, supplement the pension account or serve as a reserve for the planned pension reform.
Moreover, according to EU rules, this trick increases the real budget deficit to 5.7 per cent of GDP.
However, the carnival does not end.
Nearly three billion dollars have been spent in the budget on various compensations for the victims of communism and crimes, or on expenses for litigation, even for building savings.
Whether the state will survive without this money is not certain.
It's a lottery.
If we lose any international dispute, we will have to pay the same amount, Janota notes.
The minister will then have to save money inside the resort or, in the worst case, reach out to the government budget reserve.
One hundred million is also missing for the two-million-dollar State Treasury project, which is designed to allow online monitoring of what the individual authorities are spending.
The first stage starts in January.
If the finance minister did not find the money elsewhere, the project would have to stop, sanctions will come, warns Janota.
Your next smartphone will be able to handle two operating systems
Americans are expecting a mobile phone in the future, on which the user will switch between different operating systems at the touch of a single button.
The plans revealed sound promising.
Just press one key and from Windows Mobile you will be transferred to Android in a few seconds.
This is exactly what the American company VMware is aiming for, focusing mainly on the development of virtualization software for computers.
We will allow you to manage two user profiles at the same time on your mobile.
You can switch between them, you can divide them into home and work.
Both will work at the same time, Srinivas Krishnamurti of VMware said in an interview with Computerworld magazine.
It was presented in November last year and was presented for the first time a few days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
Virtualization of smartphones is not a fiction.
VMware has already successfully presented a test sample of a smartphone with two operating systems to journalists.
It was a modified Nokia N800 with 128 MB of RAM, on which the mentioned Windows Mobile and Android systems were running at the same time.
The development of new technology for mobile phones is in full swing.
VMware is now partnering with European and U.S. operators to test the virtualization of smartphones, and the devices are expected to reach customers in 2012.
Lack of snow in the mountains affects hoteliers
The bare slopes don't just concern the krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e ski lifts.
The lack of snow also discourages people from ordering ski stays in hotels and pensions.
Therefore, there are still available rooms in the Giant Mountains for all winter dates, including Christmas and New Year's Eve.
We have a lot of visitors to our site.
People go through the offers, find out the prices, but for now they are afraid to order.
And if they call us, they immediately ask if we think Christmas will be in the snow or in the mud this year,” said Martin Jandura, the operator of the information portal Spindl.Info.
If you want a New Year’s Eve stay in Spindleruv Mlyn exactly according to your wishes, you should no longer hesitate to order.
Those who prefer saving money and the quality of accommodation is in second place, he can still try to wait a few days.
So far, Spindleruv Mlyn hotels offer mostly weekly stays on New Year's Eve.
I think they'll try to give them up for a while, but then they'll allow it and go for a shorter time.
And then the free rooms will quickly decline," Jandura said.
Free beds in all winter seasons are still offered by the Ingtours travel agency in Vrchlabsk.
Now we are most interested in the Christmas week, which is not yet sold out.
Half of the seats in our offer are still available.
That is why we have already prepared some cheaper Christmas stays at the last minute," said Petr Schiefert, director of Ingtours.
New Year's Eve in the Giant Mountains can offer the Vrchlab Travel Agency as well, but there are fewer vacancies.
The first fourteen days of February are well on the market, the remaining winter dates are sold on average.
This year, interest in winter stays is negatively affected by the fact that there is still no snow in the Giant Mountains.
People are waiting for him to attack.
No one wants to spend the end of the year in the mountains without snow.
If the slopes are snowy during the week, Christmas will sell out," Schiefert says.
On the contrary, the rooms of the Hotel Horizont in Pec pod Sn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE>kou are occupying slightly better than last year.
We are about five percent better at that.
On New Year’s Eve and Christmas, we have the last few places.
There is a great interest in the Polish holidays in January and it sells well even in February," the director of the best peck hotel Karel Rada said.
Of the eighty percent, New Year’s Eve stays are occupied by the Omnia hotel near the central parking lot in Janské Lázn<0xC4><0x9B>.
On the contrary, half of the beds are still available at the newest Janskoláze<0xC5><0x88> hotel at Christmas.
We were pleasantly surprised this year by the January, which we already have about sixty percent occupied at the moment.
February is a little weaker so far, but as soon as snow strikes, interest in stays in the Giant Mountains will surely increase, said Omnia hotel director Erik Sporysch.
However, on a larger amount of snow, the hoteliers of the Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e must for the moment let their taste go.
It should cool down on Thursday, if there is any rain, then there should be snow in the mountains.
But then the warming will come again, Ji<0xC5><0x99>í Jakubsk<0xC3><0xBD> from the castle work site of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute reported.
USA: Repetition is the Mother of Wisdom
It is funny with what schoolwork Barack Obama, the president with the reputation of the smartest, repeats in the Afghan issue the strategy of his predecessor, whom he himself considered the dumbest.
When he finally dumped his eagerly awaited Afghan doctrine, it turned out that he wrote it over a copycat from Bush’s Iraqi script three years ago.
Not only did he use the word “as in Iraq” several times in the text itself, but he did not even hesitate to use the title of Bush’s January 2007 statement as the title of his own declaration: “A New Way Forward.”
Three years ago, he criticized Bush’s idea of sending fresh military reinforcements to Iraq, afflicted by the civil war, as an “irresponsible and, in its aftermath, catastrophic decision.”
The following months, however, showed that Bush’s strategy, based on the recommendations of the field commanders, was the only possible and highly successful one so far that there is no mention of Iraq in the news reports today.
This did not improve Bush’s reputation, but objectively left his successor with a much more grateful starting point than could be expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes that the miracle will happen again.
He was once again asked by field commanders, notably the commander-in-chief of the Afghan operation General Stanley McCristal, who even, despite his subordinate habit, harshly criticized the hesitant shooters in the White House.
He demanded 40,000 men to break the situation for the better.
The president hesitated for three months, but he did not think of anything better, so at least he cheated the general by 10,000 soldiers.
He was able to squeeze the promise of another 5,000 out of Europe, even though he originally counted at least 10.
The most problematic thing about Obama’s strategy seems to be his intention to start withdrawing troops from Afghanistan in as little as 18 months and to end this process within three years. The entire Obama doctrine raises more questions than it provides answers.
Many doubt that the half increase will yield the same fruit as the progress in Iraq.
Despite the fratricidal wars of recent years, Iraqi society is relatively well organized, its leaders honor the agreements.
The situation in Afghanistan is characterised by the opposite sign - no one is to be trusted and no agreement is to be respected.
Under these conditions, Afghan security forces are ill-prepared, accustomed to changing masters every day according to how they feel.
Political institutions, even if they are formally established, will remain only a posthumous village, for which patriarchal tribal relations will continue to flourish.
Balancing the interests of different ethnic groups is extraordinarily difficult given the opaqueness of the conditions, which further complicate Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Neither does the construction of a "capable state", which is the minimalist goal of the whole operation, seem too realistic.
The time horizon of Obama’s strategy is astounded by his voluntarism.
Over the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only worsened and is now on the brink of an explosion.
To believe that soldiers sent into a war turmoil in order to "quickly return home" will cause a miracle done here can only be a truly romantic soul, not touched by reality.
From a political point of view, setting a date for the withdrawal of troops is pure irresponsibility, as the Taliban will perceive it as an indirect admission of American defeat.
The latest NATO summit showed that the willingness of Europeans to participate in combat operations in Afghanistan is declining.
European politicians cannot and do not want to explain to their voters how the security of Germany or Italy relates to the war in the foothills of the Hindu Kush.
Another factor capable of radically intervening in the situation is the development of events around Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the increased sanctions against Iran do not affect the United States, the question of whether to try to solve the problem by military force will be overwhelming.
It will be necessary to respond to it at the very moment when, according to Obama, America will move towards a victorious withdrawal from Afghanistan.
However, any such solution will also mean a dramatic turnaround in the Afghan situation.
The only patch for Barack Obama is the fact that there are three years left before the presidential election, and therefore there is still enough time to come up with another strategy if it turns out to be a total failure.
Goldman Sachs executives no longer receive cash rewards
Senior executives at Goldman Sachs will not receive cash rewards this year.
This was announced by the company, which responds to harsh criticism of its wage practices.
A group of 30 top managers will receive shares instead of money, which will be sold in five years at the earliest.
In addition, shares can be taken away from managers if they are overly risky.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs is at the forefront of the effort to combine Wall Street rewards with long-term performance.
I think Wall Street is well aware of the broader direction it needs to take, said former JPMorgan investment banker Douglas Elliott.
The problem is in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs has become the target of criticism after putting aside nearly $17 billion (nearly CZK 300 billion) in rewards in the first three quarters of this year.
According to Reuters, the company’s total earnings for the year is likely to exceed $20 billion, despite the measure announced today.
High rewards in the banking sector have become a hot political topic in many countries with the coming financial crisis.
Britain announced on Wednesday that it plans to impose a one-time 50% tax on bankers’ bonuses exceeding <0xC2><0xA3>25,000 (about CZK 712,000).
France is taking similar steps.
This year, women have won the Nobel Prize in all fields except physics.
The record five women in Stockholm today received this year’s Nobel Prize in professional and literature from the hands of King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden.
Among them was the German writer of Romanian origin Herta Müller.
The Nobel Prize in Medicine was awarded to two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, along with their compatriot, Jack Szostak, for research into chromosomes.
The prize for chemistry was awarded to Israeli Ada Jonatha, along with Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishna and Thomas Steitz for clarifying the structure and function of ribosomes.
The Nobel Prize in Economics was awarded to Elinor Ostrom and her compatriot Oliver Williamson for their analysis of economic governance.
The only professional category that went around without a holder this year was physics.
The award was presented today by Charles Kao for optical fiber research and George Smith and Willard Boyle for the invention of the CCD chip, which is the basis of all digital cameras, fax machines or astronomical telescopes.
Each awardee received a diploma, a Nobel medal, and a certificate of earning a financial reward.
This amounts to ten million Swedish kronor (about CZK 25 million) for each category.
If there are more awards in each of them, the reward is divided among themselves.
The most anticipated Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to US President Barack Obama this afternoon in Oslo, Norway.
In his speech, he acknowledged the controversy of his appreciation, as he is only at the beginning of his career and, moreover, he is at the forefront of a country that is fighting two wars - in Iraq and in Afghanistan.
In defense of his policies, however, he added that wars are necessary in a certain situation to make peace, even though the price for it is high.
Minister Janota is considering resignation. Klaus invited him to the Castle
President Václav Klaus will accept Finance Minister Eduardo Janotu on Friday morning, who is considering staying in the government because he does not agree with the form of the state budget for the next year as approved by the House of Representatives on Wednesday.
It is expected that the budget and possibly Janot’s stay in the cabinet will be the topics of their Friday meeting.
The budget is also criticized by Klaus.
According to him, the deficit is too high, further deepening the public finance crisis.
The meeting was reported by the President's spokesman Radim Ochvat.
Janota wants to discuss his next tenure with Prime Minister Jan Fischer on Monday.
According to the budget law, which Klaus will now get to sign, the Czech Republic should manage the deficit of 163 billion crowns.
But on Wednesday, the House approved proposals by the left for money transfers and increased the money for salaries of state employees, for the operation of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government blamed the Social Democracy proposals for secretly increasing the budget deficit.
Between the left, on the one hand, and the government, Klaus, and the right, on the other hand, a sharp internal political dispute arose because of which the question starts to arise about the further action of Fischer’s official cabinet, the formation of which was agreed in the spring by ODS, <0xC4><0x8C>SSD and Stran<0xC3><0xBD>ch.
Critics say the budget, as adopted by the House, is essentially liquidating a package of austerity measures that the Fischer government enforced in the fall and that it is intended to stop the debt of the state.
Klaus, who can but does not have to sign the state budget law, said at a discussion breakfast with businessmen today that politicians had long neglected a “serious problem” that is “unsustainable deficit” of public finances.
He says he no longer has a good solution.
Only a strong government, which could rely on a broader consensus of political parties, could bring about improvements, the president said.
ODS Chairman Mirek Topolánek said the budget is scary and the government should consider further existence.
Petr Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as, Deputy Chairman of the ODS, told <0xC4><0x8C>TK that the concept of an official cabinet with the support of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, ODS and the Greens is clearly no longer working.
In response, Prime Minister Fischer called such words "strong statements".
<0xC4><0x8C>SSD chief Ji<0xC5><0x99>í Paroubek responded by saying that the budget deficit prepared by the former Topolánk government for this year, which will exceed 200 billion kronor, is appalling.
On Wednesday, the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD called the approval of the state budget for next year a success.
The people were also pleased with it.
Clint Eastwood as Morgan Freeman
South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film Invictus: The Undefeated will tell the world a lot about the country, its struggle and victories despite some criticism that the main roles are played by American actors.
It tells the story of sport, race and Nelson Mandela.
A tireless fighter against the racist apartheid regime in South Africa and its first black president, Nelson Mandela, in his life story is portrayed by Oscar-winning American actor Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said 90-year-old Mandela asked him if he could portray him in Eastwood's film.
Matt Damon plays another important role in it.
I said, 'If I play you, I'll have to have access to you.
Twenty-seven-year-old actor, who won the award for his role in Eastwood's drama from the boxing environment Million Dollar Baby, has already portrayed the leader of the movement for the abolition of slavery, who eventually became a slave, the fictitious president of the United States and even a god in the Divine Evan, who is still, but rarely, as a human being.
A former South African statesman has been in prison for 27 years for his active work in ending apartheid in South Africa.
He was released in 1990 and became president of the country for four years.
In 1993, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus is a Latin word for the undefeated and is the name of a poem by English author William Ernest Henley published in 1875.
The challenge was to speak like him.
The film is a true story of how Nelson Mandela joined forces with South African rugby team captain Francois Pienaar to help unite the country. The newly elected President Mandela knows that his nation remains racially and economically divided after apartheid.
He believes that he can connect his people through sport, so he decides to unite the rugby players, who belong worldwide among the outsiders.
The South African team will eventually go to the 1995 World Cup.
Freeman worked for several years to get Mandela's story on the canvas.
“I had no other goal than to play this role so as to bring it as close to reality as possible,” Freeman said.
The biggest challenge, of course, was to speak like him.
The actor said that if he and the world politician were from the same area, he would try to meet with Mandela, have dinner with him, be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing was that he wanted to shake Mandela's hand.
I found that when I pressed your hand, I took over your energy, it was transmitted, and I felt like I knew how you felt, he said.
It's important for me to try to become another person.
Matt Damon stars in the film François Pienaar, the captain of the national rugby team, in which white players prevailed.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in the tough world of rugby.
It was a big surprise for him when he first met Pienaar in his house.
I remember ringing the doorbell, he opened it, and the first thing I said to François Pienaar in my life was, ‘I look a lot bigger in the movie.’
Despite the obvious differences in the characters of the actors compared to their real masterpieces under the direction of director Eastwood, Invictus: The Undefeated has received positive reviews and there is also talk of ambitions for the Oscars.
The Daily Variety critic Todd McCarthy summed up his assessment in the words: "It was a very good story, a very well-made film."
In movie reviews on rottentomatoes.com, Invictus received 76 percent of positive reviews.
The secret of the glow over Norway solved: the Russians tested the missile
Over Norway it was possible to observe a special light effect of unknown origin.
The Russian Defense Ministry said it had tested an intercontinental ballistic missile near the Norwegian border.
But the launch was once again unsuccessful, and a projectile called the “Bulava” type, which was originally supposed to be the pride of the Russian army, is slowly becoming the black sea of Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Even his repeated presence in the missile tests did not have the proper effect on the success of test flights.
Bulava usually did not take off at all or was damaged in the air.
In the Russian newspapers it is already written about "Bulav" as a "missile that does not fly".
A rocket that does not fly but lights up
At the beginning, the 13th attempt was normal.
It was only at the end of the flight that the apparatus was technically damaged again.
Apparently the engine exploded in the third stage of the rocket.
This time "Bulava" launched from the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donsky, which sailed under the surface of the White Sea.
This type of rocket allows launching from a vessel that is in motion and at the same time submerged.
Therefore, it is likely that the mysterious light above Norway caused by a more indeterminate flying object was actually disrupted by the "Bulava".
From the outset, the Norwegians had no doubt that it was a Russian missile.
The generals are defending themselves this time, claiming that one cannot speak clearly of failure.
The first two stages of the missile survived and the accident hit the third.
In the previous cases, the engines failed in the first stage.
Although not a single test start was conducted without any error, only six out of the thirteen considered unsuccessful by the Department of Defense leadership.
The nearly fifty percent success therefore fills the generals with optimism and so still claims that the "Bulava" will fly once without problems and that it will even hijack up to ten hypersonic nuclear blocks with a maximum total weight of 1.15 tons.
Legendary Fetisov signed an annual contract at CSKA Moscow at the age of 51
At the age of 51, legendary defender Vyacheslav Fetisov will once again present himself in a professional hockey match.
The former World Champion, Olympic winner and Stanley Cup holder will help his CSKA Moscow team in need and will probably start the KHL match against St. Petersburg on Friday.
Fetisov, who ended his career at the age of forty in 1998, is currently president of CSKA.
After Denis Kulja<0xC5><0xA1> is injured, we need another defender.
Fetisov regularly trains and agreed to help the team.
We just need to deal with some formal issues, the AP agency quoted Moscow club coach Sergei Nemchinov.
It is not yet clear whether the comeback of the famous hockey player will concern only one match.
I think Fetisov is one of those who can lift the spirits of other players, Germanov said.
According to the AP, Fetisov will become the oldest Russian professional hockey player in the event of a return to the ice.
In the NHL, at age 11, he played the entire season under legendary striker Gordie Howe for Hartford, scoring 15 goals and 26 assists.
The oldest of the famous five Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov is one of the best and most successful hockey players in history.
In the Soviet Union, he won two Olympic gold medals, seven World Championship titles, won the Canada Cup and the Junior World Championship.
In the second half of his career, he achieved success in the NHL, where he raised the Stanley Cup twice in a Detroit jersey.
He has been a member of the Hockey Hall of Fame since 2001.
Hyundai meets the trade unions. Cancels all overtime
Hyundai’s management has agreed with the unions to abolish all overtime.
Due to frequent overtime, the unions announced a strike alert on Monday.
This was confirmed by Hyundai’s spokesman Petr Van<0xC4><0x9B>k.
However, the leadership wants to agree with the unions on another Saturday shift this year.
We cannot resign to our production plan, which is essential, so a voluntary overtime was proposed on Saturday, December 19, with two shifts being made, Van<0xC4><0x9B>k said.
Server Sedmi<0xC4><0x8D>ka.cz wrote that the company of employees who work Saturday shift, offered a bonus of 400 CZK.
It will be back to the public on working Saturday, November 28.
According to Vanek, the company decided to change the way employees are motivated for the proposed overtime.
Either they pay extra for overtime or they can choose a replacement holiday on December 28, and thus extend the Christmas holidays by a day, Van<0xC4><0x9B>k said.
In addition, all employees of the Saturday shift will be paid fares and lunch.
Given that overtime was the most urgent and arduous point in terms of comments and complaints of trade unionists and protesting employees who stopped production fundamentally last week, the management decided yesterday afternoon with immediate effect to abolish all overtime.
By the end of last week, employees were forced to work almost every day after an eight-hour shift, another two-hour overtime.
After the signing of the agreement, the unions will call off the strike emergency
The next meeting between the automaker and the trade unions is scheduled to take place on Friday morning.
Trade union chief Petr Kucha<0xC5><0x99> said on Wednesday that if they agree to meet the requirements and sign a joint document, they are ready to cancel the strike.
The situation in the car worsened last week on Wednesday, when about 400 employees spontaneously went on strike due to constant overtime.
They also protested against poor salary conditions and alleged harassment.
The management argued that overtime must be done by employees to meet the requirements for the delivery of cars.
In their statement on Monday, the unions also demanded that no sanctions be imposed on employees who discontinued production last Wednesday.
In the area of overtime, unions require the company to reduce overtime work to a minimum.
In addition, they want to pay a reward of 5000 crowns this year.
Hyundai now employs 2,000 people.
The company began serial production in November last year.
By September of this year, it had produced about 80,000 cars, its current production capacity is 200,000 cars a year.
Czech discovery: a substance that also affects the 'indicted' HIV viruses
A team of Czech and German scientists is testing new compounds that can slow the spread of HIV in the body.
The main advantage of the enhanced substance is that it also works on viruses that have already gained immunity against drugs.
This fact in some cases prevails over the fact that the compound on a common variant of the virus does not act as strongly as some already available drugs.
AIDS is not yet curable.
However, a mixture of drugs that prevent the multiplication of HIV in the body can significantly prolong the life of patients.
However, their use is accompanied by a number of side effects.
In addition, incomplete suppression of the multiplication of the virus results in the development of so-called resistant viruses, against which drugs are already ineffective.
The work of experts from three institutes of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, from V<0xC5><0xA0>CHT Prague and from the University of Heidelberg opens the way to cope with the resistance of the virus.
They have shown that substances called metallocarbonates act on the protein responsible for the multiplication of the HIV virus.
Metalocarbons are compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block the spread of the virus differently than all drugs used today, and therefore can overcome the problem of resistance.
In their work, scientists come up with new ‘improved’ compounds prepared based on knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their binding to viral proteins.
Metalocarbons have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multiwalled cages made up of boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms are connected by a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
A treacherous and resistant virus
HIV protease is a protein of the HIV virus that is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without HIV protease caused by HIV cleavage, no mature infectious viral particles would have formed.
When we stop HIV protease, we also stop the spread of the virus in the patient’s body, explain the scientists in a press release issued by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In a paper published in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, scientists describe a series of compounds in which two pairs of cages (see table) are linked by a short organic chain that is further systematically altered.
A little weaker, but more reliable
The effect of this series of substances against HIV protease was tested in a test tube and also against its resistant (resistant) variants obtained from HIV infected patients.
The effect of metallocarbonates on the common variant of the enzyme is not as strong as that of clinical drugs, but it does not lose its effect for resistant variants against which the drugs are often ineffective.
The unique mechanism of action as well as their other properties such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of further chemical treatments of metallocarbonates make interesting compounds for further research aimed at the design of effective drugs against HIV, says <0xC3><0x9A>vlín <0xC5><0x9A>r<0xC4><0x9B>zá<0xC4><0x8D>ová, head of the Bio Laboratory.
The fight over the budget. ODS got into Fischer, he's defending himself
ODS chief Mirek Topolánek called the approved budget for next year "terrible" and said Prime Minister Jan Fischer's government should consider further existence.
The Prime Minister described the ODS statements as strong statements.
He says he has time for analysis.
Petr Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as, Vice-President of the ODS, said that the concept of an official cabinet with the support of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, the ODS and the Green Party is clearly no longer working.
According to Necaza, the prime minister must decide whether he intends to rely on a minority in the House to fight the growing deficit, or whether he intends to remain in office with the help of the parliamentary left.
The approach of ODS and social democracy to the issue of public deficits is diametrically different, Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as noted.
The House on Wednesday adopted the 2010 budget, but with left-wing amendments worth more than CZK 12 billion.
The House increased the money for salaries of state employees, for the operation of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government’s move to address the Social Democracy proposals was that they were secretly increasing the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should manage a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
The ODS left the hall before the vote, meeting the wishes of the government so that even the amended budget is a less bad option than the budgetary provision.
Disappointment and vanity
Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and a sense of vanity, Prime Minister Jan Fischer said the government would further assess the current situation.
Ne<0xC4><0x8D>a is convinced that if Janota seriously threatened to step down in the event of the adoption of amendments, the situation might look different.
According to Czech TV, Janota was appointed to the prime minister on Monday after the government.
He said he was considering a further stay in office.
The reason is his disappointment with the budget negotiations.
If Fischer speaks out for a further fight with the budget deficit, according to Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as, the nominees of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD in the government have nothing to do with the changes in the budget.
The prime minister should also make it clear that he will resign if the House approves other deficit-increasing laws, such as those relating to sickness, pensions, or the amendment of the civil service law.
Topolánek: Ministers nominated by the ODS are not to blame
This is a matter for Prime Minister Fischer and the entire government.
The ministers nominated by the ODS did nothing wrong, Topolánek stressed in a text message from the US.
He recalled that in several ministries there are people in deputy offices who are voting for the TOP 09, which voted against the budget.
He said that if Fischer decides to resign from the principle of combating the level of the public finance deficit, "it is absolutely logical and correct to rely on the left-wing majority that is currently in the House".
But he cannot count on the support and tolerance of the Democrats.
I didn’t think about it, and when it’s up to date, I’ll do it,” Minister of Defense Martin Barták told reporters in the House, who was nominated to the government by the civil democrats.
Prime Minister Fischer flew to Brussels in the afternoon for a European Council meeting.
At the request of the Prime Minister, the ODS resigned.
At the same time, he stressed that the ODS would apparently vote against the amended budget on Wednesday in the House if the Prime Minister had not explicitly asked the MEPs to allow the adoption of the budget.
We do not feel like orphans, we are not small children, he then responded to the question whether the ODS did not make it difficult for the president of the party to be absent from parliament and the Czech Republic during the political negotiations on the budget.
I didn't notice my voice was missing.
Already when I gave up my mandate, I knew that in the coming months it would be primarily about the Bolshevistization of the House and the destruction of all the positive, Topolánek himself responded.
Under the new rules, the Czech Republic will have fewer trains for almost the same fare
Czech Railways will abolish or limit some less-used highways and localities from December 13, while other connections will be strengthened.
The total range of transport will be reduced by two percent from the date of entry into force of the new timetable.
Most fares, including basic and customer fares, will not change.
For example, residents of Ostrava will get more options for connecting to the capital, the tracks on this route will add one set of pendolino.
On the contrary, the fast train will stop driving to Bratislava.
Less rapids will also go on the route Prague - Písek - <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice, the direct connections Prague - Letohrad will be substantially limited.
From the regions, the railways are planning the largest reduction in transport in the Královéhradeck<0xC3><0xBD> region, by a total of eight percent, but Prague and its surroundings can look forward to an increase.
Two night trains on the Prague - Tábor - <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice route are also cancelled and the operation of several rapids on the Prague - Písek - <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice route is limited to a few days a week.
The biggest changes include the introduction of a new direct line from Milovic to Prague, today the Milovics have to transfer in Lysá nad Labem.
It is the fifteenth line of the suburban system Esko, its opening is possible thanks to the completion of the electrification of the route from Lysé nad Labem to Milovic.
The long-distance connections to the capital will end at the destination station Prague Hlavní nádra<0xC5><0xBE>í.
<0xC4><0x8C>D will introduce more SC Pendolino connections between Prague and Ostrava and trains to <0xC5><0xA0>umperka/Jeseník will travel at two-hour intervals.
Pendolino to Bratislava will no longer connect passengers from December 13.
This year’s regional railway bill: 200 million more
The rushes are ordered and paid by the Ministry of Transport, a total of four billion crowns will be given to the ladders for the so-called demonstrable losses next year, as well as this year. Locals order the districts, a total of eight billion crowns will be paid for them next year, while less than three billion states will contribute to the districts.
This year, regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
The tracks have a new ten-year contract for locals and highways, so far it has always been a one-year contract.
The tracks are praising the system, which is why they seem to have failed to raise the prices of the vast majority of tickets.
Changes will only occur with one-day network tickets from <0xC4><0x8C>D Net and cheap internet tickets from eLi<0xC5><0xA1>ka.
For passengers without a customer card, the price of <0xC4><0x8C>D Net will increase from 450 kronor to 600 kronor.
The price of eLi<0xC5><0xA1>ka will be taken from the distance taken, until now it was uniform for the journey between any district cities and amounted to 160 crowns.
Philippine Armed Forces still detain more than 50 people, children released
In the southern Philippines, soldiers abducted 75 people, including several elementary school students and their teachers.
This was reported by AFP, which initially reported only 65 abductees.
All 17 detained children were released after eight hours, including one teacher.
The kidnapping took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
Approximately 19 gunmen are reportedly using the hostages as a live shield while fleeing police.
Local negotiators are now trying to agree on the extradition of the remaining hostages.
According to AFP, the militants belong to the New People's Army (NPA), which is an armed component of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AP, police initially persecuted the kidnapper for violence that required the settlement of accounts between two local family clans.
In the south of the Philippines in Maguindanao province, a stalemate was declared because of the recent massacre that killed 57 people.
Among the victims of the November 23 massacre related to the election to the governor's office were 30 journalists.
On suspicion of involvement in the massacre, the governor of this province of the South Philippines and his father Andal Ampatuan, the patriarch of the influential Ampatuan family, were arrested.
Muslim separatists are also active on the island of Mindanao.
But they resumed peace talks with the Philippine government on Tuesday.
The story of JAR is about everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
In the coming days, Clint Eastwood’s new Hollywood film Invictus (the official Czech title is Invictus: The Undefeated), which captures part of the life story of former South African President Nelson Mandela.
The role of the world-famous fighter against apartheid was played by Morgan Freeman, whom Mandela himself was said to have chosen for his portrayal years ago.
The supporting male role of legendary South African rugby champion Francois Pienaar was played by Matt Damon.
With the introduction of the film to the cinema, they emerge from the reactions of critics and the public
Nelson Mandela 's
Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela was born on 18 July 1918 in Mveza, South Africa.
In 1988, he received the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought, and in 1993, he and de Klerk received the Nobel Peace Prize.
He was the President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
Great expectations are coming to the public at a time when South Africa is at the peak of preparations for the World Cup in football, but at the same time the media are shocked by disturbing reports of growing racial hatred and discrimination on the part of the black ruling majority.
According to the AP news agency, the reviews for the new film in JAR are generally positive for now, despite numerous reservations about the casting of the main roles by "proflain" Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman is proud of his new film.
I have dreamed of this role for many years and I have prepared myself well for it.
I’ve also met Nelson Mandela many times in person to – as they say – draw his energy, he said in an interview after the film’s ceremonial premiere in Los Angeles.
“I think it’s good if we can remember Mandela’s personality and message with the film.
It is the story of the South African Republic, but it concerns every person, he added.
In the national rugby team jersey
Based on a book by British writer John Carlin, In the Role of the Enemy: Nelson Mandela and the Game That Created the Nation, the film portrays a South African human rights defender during his first presidential term.
Morgan Freeman is therefore trying to unite two racial and long-defined groups of the population during the film, and as in 1995 Nelson Mandela, he also enters the acting role in the South African national rugby jersey on the World Cup playground, which then won the JAR.
For entering the lawn in a jersey, which is perceived as almost sacred in the JAR, Mandela harvested fourteen years ago the great ovations of the predominantly white audience and gained the recognition of the white population.
The football championship may be able to reunite people into one nation, said rugby player Chester Williams, who was the only "black" in the national team in 1995.
Whether the tense situation in JAR will improve is yet to be revealed.
White South Africans, however, are skeptical, as an example was revealed in a recent interview with LN by rugby fan Christopher Dawson, who fled the country to Britain.
The championship starts on June 11, 2010.
Transformer burns for tens of millions of crowns in Lounsko
A <0xC4><0x8C>eps transformer was caught in the morning by a fire at the distribution plant near the village of Vy<0xC5><0xA1>kov in Lounsk.
According to the spokesman for the Uzbek regional firefighters, Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Marvan, six units are involved in the fire.
Initially, the firefighters wanted the transformer to burn, but later rethought the idea and extinguished the fire with mixtures of water, foam and special fire extinguishers.
The cause was a technical malfunction, an internal shortcut to the transformer.
No one was injured, according to a spokesman for the company Pavla Mandatova, the accident does not threaten the safe operation of the transmission system.
The damage is estimated to be several tens of millions of crowns, it can be precisely quantified only after the fire is over.
According to the Mandate, the destroyed transformer will need to be replaced by a new one.
In ten years of operation of the company <0xC4><0x8C>eps nothing like this has happened, defects of this type are unique, she added.
According to <0xC4><0x8C>EZ spokeswoman for the northern Bohemia, Soni Holingerová Hendrychová, the electricity supply was not interrupted, the operation of households, offices and companies was not affected by the fire of the transformer station.
A.s. <0xC4><0x8C>eps operates in the Czech Republic as the exclusive operator of transmission system, electrical lines 400 kV and 220 kV.
It maintains, renovates and develops 39 distribution plants with 67 transformers converting electricity from the transmission system to the distribution system and the 4,339-kilometre-long line route.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura will file a criminal complaint for slander against three hetmans from the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD
The owner of the Student Agency, Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura, will file a criminal complaint for slander against three social-democratic guards.
And this is Michal Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ka from the South Moravian region, Radko Martínek from the Pardubice region and hetman of the Olomouc region Martin Tesa<0xC5><0x99>ík.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura said it in the Twenty Minutes Radio Journal.
The lawsuit relates to the company’s efforts to operate regional rail transport in some regions.
All regions, however, eventually signed long-term contracts with Czech Railways.
All three hetmans are attacking us and talking about choosing grapes, while we brought an offer only for what they wanted.
They claim that we are more expensive than Czech Railways, which is not true because we know the prices of Czech Railways, which were closed last week.
So all we have to do is defend ourselves.
It's for blasphemy against the Student Agency, he told the Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura Radio Journal.
At the same time, he said he has evidence from all regions that they have not taken their actions in accordance with European law.
It is therefore preparing an initiative for the European Commission.
Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek considers the filing of a criminal complaint to be a further continuation of Mr. Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura’s media show, which serves him as an unpaid advertisement by his companies and his own people.
I am, of course, ready to defend my good name and that of my country, and I will also challenge the other hetmans.
I assume that even on this occasion it will be clear that it is Mr Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura who manipulates the public in the area of regional rail transport and uses false and untrue arguments, Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek said.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura announced last week that he is investing several million kroner in advertising, which will warn of the unfavorable move of the districts.
He told the radio magazine that the campaign will be interrupted after Christmas and he wants to continue it after the New Year.
He said that the campaign will be conducted against corruption as such.
The campaign was launched by Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura after the regions agreed to operate regional rail links with the Czech Railways and no tenders were awarded for the order of around 150 billion crowns.
According to Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura, similar actions are illegal and contrary to the opinion of the European Court of Justice.
Due to criticism of train transport in the districts, Jan<0xC4><0x8D>urov was also threatened by a member of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD.
The only threat was that if we didn't stop, we could lose our bus licenses.
He presented himself as a member of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, I know who the gentleman is, I will not say his name, he told the Radio Journal Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura today.
Pneumococcal vaccination will be free and optional
Vaccination against pneumococcal disease since January will break old habits.
It should be free of charge for families and optional at the same time.
But there are rumors that compulsory vaccination would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of free vaccination against pneumococcal peaks.
The Medical Institute has already set the maximum prices for vaccines to be paid by health insurance companies.
Experts are already clear about the vaccination process.
New Vaccinations
Free vaccines for August children
As of January, children born on or after August 2 of last year can be vaccinated free of charge against pneumococcal disease.
The condition is that they have not yet received a single dose of the vaccine.
Those who started vaccinations last year or earlier will also have to pay for another re-vaccination.
The first dose of vaccination should be given between the 3rd and 5th month of age.
Last year, she volunteered to vaccinate her children against pneumococcal disease.
The parents paid 1600 crowns for a single dose or more.
Four doses are needed to vaccinate the youngest children.
Overall, experts estimate that health insurance companies will spend between 300,000 and 450,000 crowns a year on vaccinations.
But it will save on the treatment that children without vaccination would need.
So far, the state has given about 500,000 per year for all flat-rate vaccinations for children.
The vaccine was introduced with the so-called Janotte package.
Pneumococcal causes inflammation of the middle ear, but also serious infections including inflammation of the cerebral cortex and blood poisoning.
Pneumococcal infections kill up to 28 children under the age of 10 in a year, according to a survey conducted in hospitals.
In addition to the Czech Republic, they have introduced paid surface vaccination of children against pneumococcal disease in about 40 countries.
Will vaccination be compulsory?
At the same time, however, there are opinions that this vaccination could be mandatory in the future.
They will be paid by insurance companies and optional from January onwards.
For example, the head of the civil society association Nahlas Rudolf Kalovsk<0xC3><0xBD> suggested that compulsory vaccination would be better.
His association has been promoting pneumococcal vaccines for a long time.
The experts at the international conference that our association attended were not entirely satisfied with the fact that we had voluntary vaccinations.
It's not perfect.
On the other hand, we are glad that at least this has been enforced.
I think that’s the path we have to take now, Kalovsky said.
The Ministry of Health does not want to change the procedure of vaccination against pneumococcal diseases.
We are not considering this at this time, his spokesman Vlastimil Srsen said.
Voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks, doctors say
Hana Cabrnoch, president of the Professional Society of Pediatric Physicians, acknowledges that voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages.
If all children were vaccinated, it could be considered to reduce the number of re-vaccinations "For a situation where this vaccine costs such a high amount, we quite understand the political decision that the vaccination was started as voluntary," says Cabrnoch.
Experts expect more than 80 percent of new parents to have their babies vaccinated against pneumococcal disease from next year.
Pneumococcal vaccination is also groundbreaking in that it is the first flat-screen vaccination of children to be paid by health insurance companies, not the state.
Insurance companies should spend money on prevention, thus saving on further treatment, explains Cabrnochova.
Doctors will have to buy drugs themselves.
But this is related to the concerns of practical pediatricians regarding the purchase of vaccines.
According to the original plan, the vaccines were to be purchased by insurance companies, and doctors would receive them in the same way that the state supplies them with substances for other vaccinations.
However, some MEPs feared that insurance companies could “take money out of health insurance.”
Therefore, doctors will have to buy the drugs and wait for insurance companies to repay them.
According to estimates, individual pediatricians will invest 40,000 per month in vaccines, which is a significant amount.
It's not going to be easy at all, says Cabrnoch.
American artist's son 'steals in museum'
Frank Frazetta’s son has been charged with attempting to steal $20 million worth of paintings from his father’s museum.
Police in Pennsylvania said Alfonso Frank Frazetta was caught loading 90 pictures into his vehicle and trailer.
Named Mr. Frazetta and the other man used a dredge to break into a museum in the Poconco Mountains region.
Mr. Frazetta senior, aged 81, was famous for creating the characters of Barbara Conan and Tarzan.
At the time, the artist was in Florida, according to the Associated Press.
The AP quoted an unnamed police official as saying that Mr. Frazetta Jr. could have been motivated by long-standing family disputes.
Mr. Frazetta, 52, made a younger oath before the police, saying he had done so at his father's request, "to get into the museum in any way possible and move the paintings to the tuning rooms," the agency said.
Mr. Frazetta senior denied any such authorization, the agency said.
Workers oppose planned tax hikes
The ministers defended the increase in taxes and spending cuts announced in the preliminary budget report against criticism from the opposition, entrepreneurs and trade unions.
According to Alistair Darling, the Torys "missed" the opportunity to show that they seriously meant postponing the decision to reduce the deficit until after the election.
The chancellor was also fired for disabling low- and middle-income workers.
According to his proposal, it is mainly a 0.5% increase in social security and a 1% adjustment in public payments since 2011.
Involvement in Social Security
Trade unions protested that low-income workers were being punished for a recession they did not blame and warned in advance of “problems.”
Social security is rising - an increase of about <0xC2><0xA3>3 trillion a year - which has outraged the community of entrepreneurs who said it is an employment tax, while focusing on the recovery of the economy.
This increase, limited to incomes of more than <0xC2><0xA3>20,000 per year, will affect approximately 10 million workers.
KEY POINTS PBR
Social Security will increase by an additional 0.5% from April 2011
The economic situation will worsen more than expected, by 4.75% this year
New taxation 50% of bankers bonuses
1% increase in corporate tax on depreciation for small businesses
Tax reduction for electric cars and wind turbines
Increasing pensions by 2.5%
According to estimates by the State Financial Administration, some revenues of <0xC2><0xA3>30,000 will be reduced by <0xC2><0xA3>90 a year and some revenues of <0xC2><0xA3>40,000 will be reduced by <0xC2><0xA3>190, while some revenues of <0xC2><0xA3>10,000 will be increased by <0xC2><0xA3>110.
The ministers announced that their goal of reducing the deficit by half by 2013 means "complex decision-making", but insisted that 60% of the special taxes should fall to 5% of those with the highest incomes.
Treasury Secretary Stephen Timms has denied that the proposed tax increase and spending cuts would be “a drop in the ocean” compared to what would have to be done.
"These are big numbers, which will allow us to halve the deficit, which is an absolutely essential requirement for the next four years," the BBC said.
Mr Timms said he was convinced that economic growth should occur at the turn of the year.
But making a forecast for future economic growth – which will affect the volume of necessary loans and how quickly the deficit will be reduced – must be taken into account after the chancellor was forced to revise previous amounts.
In that opinion, he said, the decline in the economy was 4.75% this year - far worse than the 3.5% decline predicted in April - because the loans were 3 trillion pounds higher than previously estimated.
A Wasted Opportunity
Conservatives, who launched a new campaign on Thursday warning of Labour’s “debt crisis,” called the planned <0xC2><0xA3>789 trillion loan intolerable over the next six years.
The ministers failed to submit a credible plan on how to pay for it, they added, "cynically" postponed the decision until after the elections - which must take place by June 2010.
"They didn't add anything significant that was feasible," said shadow finance minister Philip Hammond. "They had the opportunity to do it, but they wasted it."
" All important announcements will be made after the election, if we win them "
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labour insists that schools, hospitals and the police will be protected from future cuts, unlike the Tory proposals, which would like to reduce the deficit faster and to a greater extent.
But liberal democrats argue that the money raised by tax increases and spending cuts should be used to support spending next year and not to reduce the deficit, arguing that the plans are “built on sand.”
BBC political commentator Nick Robinson said the timing of the announcement – for example, the above-mentioned inflation will rise and there will be an inability to pay benefits in April – could lead to the chancellor’s impeachment in the election campaign if the money were harder to get back.
But Labour insists on providing special assistance if people really need it, and the situation will be revised in September 2010.
“Suspected Budget”
Although ministers did not disclose details of spending after 2011, economists said it was clear that cutting public spending would only be the beginning of medium-term curbs.
The prestigious Institute of Budget Studies said the Chancellor's figures suggest substantial cuts in many areas, potentially in the future including transport, higher education and defense.
"It's really very painful so far," said its director, Robert Chote.
“All important statements will only come after the election if we win them,” Roger Bootle, an economic advisor to Deloitte’s account manager, said in a statement.
"It was a report of a suspicious pre-budget. Markets are implementing it."
FBI conducts investigations in 'American prisons in Pakistan'
The FBI is investigating five Americans suspected of being linked to extremists in a Pakistani prison.
The men were arrested for the attack on a house in Sargod in the eastern Punjab province, the U.S. embassy in Pakistan told the BBC.
The FBI said it was investigating whether they were the same men who were declared missing in the last month at their home in the U.S. state of Virginia.
The U.S. State Department said it was also seeking information about the men.
Three of them are said to be of Pakistani origin, one of them has Egyptian ancestry and the others come from Yemen.
“If they were American citizens, we would be very interested in what conditions they were detained and under what circumstances they stayed there,” Kelly said.
FBI spokeswoman Katherine Schweit said the agency had been informed of the arrest and had been in contact with the families of the missing students.
"We are working with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identity and the nature of their actions here and whether they are actually missing students," she said.
The Pakistani embassy in Washington said the men had been arrested in a house owned by an uncle of one of them.
It said the house had always been the focus of the local police’s interest and that no charges had been filed against the arrested men.
Secretary of State Hillry Clinton declined to comment on the arrest, the Reuters news agency said, but said the United States must "cooperate much more closely with Afghanistan and Pakistan in uncovering the infrastructure of terrorism that continues to recruit and train people."
The disappearance of these five students from a home in northern Virginia was announced by their families at the end of November.
Refusal of amnesty for Iranians.
The human rights situation in Iran is as bad as it has been in the last 20 years, according to a report from Amnesty International.
The report describes in detail the "mode of torture" in the regime before and after the controversial presidential election in June.
One of the men said he was beaten and burned with cigarettes; another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran has denied the aforementioned criticism of the human rights report.
Officials described the criticism as politically motivated.
Thousands of people were imprisoned in Iran and dozens were killed after the controversial election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, leading to the biggest street demonstrations since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Dozens of them were imprisoned and the prosecutors sentenced the last five to death.
A BBC correspondent in Tehran, John Leyne, who is now in London, said earlier in the protests, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khomeini declared some forms of torture unjustified and banned their execution in the Karizak correctional facility.
But since then, almost no criticism of the legal power has been tolerated, as our correspondent noted.
“False Confessions”
Amnesty International quoted 26-year-old computer student Ibrahim Methari as saying he was accused of “working with Facebook” and protesting the election results.
"I was often hit in the face," he said in a statement.
"They burned me with cigarettes under my eyes, on my neck, on my head... they threatened my execution and humiliated me."
After five days, he signed a false confession and was released and left on the street, still bleeding and half unconscious, Amnesty said.
In August, defeated presidential candidate Mehdi Charroubi was detained after the protests and tortured to death in prison and others were raped.
Iran’s top government officials denied the rape allegations, but admitted that torture had taken place.
Amnesty also reported the case of a former prisoner who said he had been held in a container with 75 other people for more than eight weeks in Kahrizak prison.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian parliament and justice had set up committees to investigate post-election riots and government responses, but said the mandate and powers of the authorities were unclear and the findings of parliamentary committees had been published.
The group said at least 90 people had been detained in the past three weeks to prevent further demonstrations.
A ski slope was created in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow were used to turn the monument in Bristol into a runway for the race.
The runway for the race in the park attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders to compete for financial prizes.
At the top of the runway in Brandon Hill Park was a short jumping bridge in front of a 100 m long runway.
A fourth-year medical student, John Hickman, said it was a wonderful view from the top of the runway, but that it was really depressing.
It was a wonderful view of the blinking lights of the city downstairs.
There were some of the best skiers and snowboarders from all over the country - some of them real talent," he added.
The prizes were awarded for the best pieces - or maneuvers on the runway.
After Thursday night's race, the snow was left to melt.
Still they and we
Can a Muslim be a Frenchman?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when Swiss voters were calling for a ban on minarets and generally spreading alarming reports of Europe’s alleged Islamization, John Bowen, an American academic, wrote and briefed and wondered whether Muslims could integrate – and whether they would integrate – into one of the world’s most open societies.
After reading this book, some of the readers became admirers of the author's last work, "Why the French don't like headscarves" (2006), this elegant and debated study of the controversial issues that have divided and occupied the country for 15 years and whose effects are felt and felt.
Mr. Bowen’s latest book has a broader and much more ambitious footage.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and the media have said about Islam in France, but what really happened at the bottom.
He spent months in mosques, schools and institutes that now care for five or six million French Muslims, which Mr. Bowen calls "Islamic spaces".
He is a good listener, reproducing debates between teachers and students about the issues that most worry them.
Should a Muslim enter a marriage in a mosque or in a town hall (or both)?
Should a young Muslim be taught about the development and rights of gays?
Can a Muslim woman marry a man who is not a Muslim?
Do Muslims have the right to use an interest-based banking system if they want to get a mortgage?
It is these seemingly mundane issues that are being debated, and which are part of everyday life rather than the political dramas that employ the media.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, among other well-known people, not to mention Tarik Ramadan, an Arab, a Swiss-born Muslim scholar and academic.
This new generation is trying to open up a discussion on how to be a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society at the same time.
They have no arguments for all their habits.
Conservatives are distrustful of the real idea of French or European Islam.
The philosophers and activists with whom Mr. Bowen has interviewed are inclined to believe that it is the counterpart of Selafi — the purist Sunni Islam supporters united in Saudi Arabia — this group is small but influences European Muslims.
Mr Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism are compatible.
But adaptation requires compromises on both sides.
He wonders how far the French politicians (and the intellectual elite who so vehemently defend the secular public) are really committed to the idea of pluralism.
It is believed that Muslims have probably less experience in matters of faith than Catholics, Protestants and Jews, who also had to make historical compromises with secular republicanism.
Rather than the development of pragmatism, he found "the drawback of values".
After reading this book, someone may be inclined to say "Yes, but not now."
The most disappointing prospects in the world
The Arctic is changing more dramatically than the rest of the planet.
The boundary ice melts at alarming speed, affecting animals and their survival like nowhere else.
The interests of oil, gas and fisheries companies must be focused on new natural water sources, together with diplomats, lawyers and writers when they awaken.
In the book "On Thin Ice" Richard Ellis, writer and illustrator, depicts the natural history of the icon of the North, a polar bear.
Well-acquainted with the complicated history and practices of whaling, it describes a long tradition of polar explorers trying to capture a white bear.
Admiral Nelson’s encounter with a courageous 14-year-old swimmer who fought only with a musket flask is indeed a myth, but everything else is true.
Young bears swimming behind the bodies of their recently killed mothers were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
At the beginning of the 20th century, 75 polar bears appeared suddenly in a circus tent.
Even today, zoo fences typically have an area one million times smaller than the area available to adults in the wild. The climate is rarely suitable: the resident polar bear in Singapore has turned green from algae growing within the hollow hairs of its coat.

Mr. Ellis draws on the works of other writers and historians and often returns to the threat that hunters threaten the survival of species.
Although hunting is banned in Norway, America, and Russia, killing continues in Greenland and Canada, where they hunt from helicopters and Indians on skis and are all armed with powerful offensive towels to shoot their prey.
The irony is that it takes place in the water north of these two hunting nations and that the ice will eventually be the largest.
In his new book “After Ice,” Alun Anderson, former editor of New Scientist, offers a clear and disheartened responsibility of science for the Arctic and a compelling glimpse into how the future can change it.
Scientists don’t have answers to everything.
Even meteorologists and oceanographers do not have an adequate response to the speed of change.
That's for lack of exams.
Fridtjof Nansen's research trips in the late 19th and early 20th centuries first suggested how floating ice moves.
Submarines during the Cold War then mapped the sliding partitions as they submerged them.
Satellite exploration and extensive probe fields in floating glaciers are a useful addition, but many are still taking place thanks to the fearless individuals encamping in the winter.
Mr. Anderson looks into the extremely fragile world of the rainfall system inside the Arctic ice, created by the flow of salt water that crumbles as it freezes.
But from the above-mentioned bear to the microscopic wonders of inertia, all this is doomed to extinction as soon as the summer ice moves, which will take place sometime between 2013 and 2050.
In a few months, it could be us.
6,000 Marines lay wreaths on Arlington graves
Deputy Officer De'Angelo Robinson, 19, traveled seven hours by bus to lay a simple wreath on the grave of a soldier he had never met.
For him and other Marines who made their way from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, North Carolina, to the National Cemetery in Arlington to decorate the tombs, this was the day they paid tribute to men and women who once wore the same shoes.
In a few months, when we board, it could be us, Robinson said of the fallen soldiers.
If this happens to us, I would like someone to do the same for me, to show me respect, just as I am trying to do.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who gathered on Saturday morning to lay wreaths at the veterans' cemetery in several departments at the Arlington Mass.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, owner of the Worcester Funeral Company in Harrington, Maine, began this tradition when he and several others decided to decorate several hundred graves at a funeral ceremony in Arlington.
Now it’s an 18-year-old tradition when Mr. nMorill and his wife Karen make this journey every year and stop in different cities along the way to honor the memory of the military and the victims of terrorism.
Worcesters are not looking for profit in this, wreaths across America that they place in other states.
This year, volunteers laid more than 16,000 wreaths at Arlington Cemetery, the Pentagon, the Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, Battery Park in New York City, and the United Airlines 93 Memorial Flight in Shanksville, Pennsyl.
For the second year, the Walmart Foundation is donating more than $150,000 to purchase and transport wreaths.
Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster, said she made a trip to Arlington in honor of her husband, a deceased member of the armed forces.
Because her husband is not buried in Arlington, Mrs. Hunt said it was her way to get back what the victim was doing.
It is a small way for citizens to support our units, she said.
It's like visiting a family grave.
Covered in warm cloth, the volunteers walked through the cemetery through the surrounding grasslands and hills.
Volunteers headed to older graves from the First and Second World Wars and the Vietnam War because these are not visited as often as newer graves
The mood was positive when the children played and held hands together as they transported the young pine tree to the gravestones.
Each circular wreath was dark green with a small red arched hoof top.
Closer to Section 60, where most of the veterans from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried, there was a real silence.
The Association of Service Organizations donated 1,000 wreaths to decorate the departments, but the bleak mood of the ongoing wars filled the area.
Some cried earnestly, others prayed, and families and friends held each other in the cold air.
Some read names carved into stones aloud, while others bowed down to look at the small black-and-white labels pushed into wet mud where the tombstones had not yet been placed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many mothers who wiped tears from their eyes in front of her son’s grave.
She drove for eight hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the last resting place of Naval Artillery Sergeant David Shane Spicer, who died in combat in July.
No one should ever forget why we're free... ..my son paid for it, the rules.
"Even though I've been away for a long time, I want to be the one who will remember him."
U.S. government contractor imprisoned by Cuban government officials
The Cuban government imprisoned a U.S. government supplier who imported mobile phones and laptops into the country, foreign ministry officials said on Saturday.
The supplier, which has not yet been identified, worked for Development Alternatives Inc. based in Bethesda.
The company is working on projects for the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular officials along with the U.S. Interest Section in Havana sought access to the detainee, who was detained on December 5.
Certain accusations have not been released, but according to Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreigner can be imprisoned for almost anything that is labeled "dangerous".
All so-called counter-revolutionary activities, including mild protests and critical states, pose a risk of imprisonment.
Anti-government graffiti and speech are considered serious crimes.
There is a young blogging community in Cuba, led by popular commentator Yoani Sánchez, who often writes about how she and her husband are being watched and harassed by government agents.
Ms. Sánchez has repeatedly requested permission to leave the country so that she can take over the prices, but permission has been denied.
The detention of an American supplier may be the result of growing tensions between the Cuban-ruling Castro’s communist brother and the Obama administration, which has been viewed as a “sustaining tactic” in improving relations with the island.
They were the first to report on the arrest of the New York Times on Friday night.
The new U.S. policy emphasized that if the Cuban government takes concrete steps, such as releasing political prisoners and creating more space for the opposition, the United States will take reciprocal steps.
Mobile phones and laptops are allowed in Cuba, although they are new and sought-after commodities in a country where the average salary of a government employee is $15 per month.
The Cuban government has granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones this year; these are mostly used for text messaging, as a 15-minute phone call would cost more than a day’s wage.
The use of the Internet on the island is extremely limited.
It is available in expensive hotels and for their foreign visitors and at some governmental outlets, such as universities.
Cubans, who often want to sign up, must announce their names to the government.
Access to many websites is prohibited.
Arrest of an American in Cuba is rare.
Most of the U.S. citizens in Cuba’s prison are behind bars for crimes such as drug smuggling, said Gloria Berben, a press official at the U.S. Interests Section in Havana.
Mrs. Berben said she couldn't provide more information about the prison.
Imprisonment and detention were clearly amoral.
Such activities, which would be legal in any other open society - let's call them free mobile phones - are a criminal offence in Cuba, said Miguel Vivanco, director of the U.S. program of the human rights group, which recently published a negative report on freedoms in Cuba, called the "Old Razor of Castro" and the "Old Razor of Castro" in Cuba.
Vivanco said the defendants are often arrested, tried and imprisoned in one day.
He said that any solution would be rather political and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, just as the two countries are heading towards a broader dialogue.
Pakistani government officials are uncovering a conspiracy to send men to Afghanistan.
Pakistani authorities on Saturday uncovered the alleged leader of a conspiracy to send five men from northern Virginia to Afghanistan to kill U.S. troops there, saying they hoped the case could help uncover a vast network of recruitment radios and terrorists.
Investigators said they were looking for a gray rebel figure, known as Saifullah, who invited these men to Pakistan after he first discovered them when one of these men posted a comment approving the terrorist attacks on my YouTube video page.
Saifillah took over the leadership of these men as soon as they arrived in Pakistan, trying to help them get to a remote area of Pakistan in the indigenous tribes of Pakistan, which is home to al-Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani intelligence official who reported the case said on Saturday that Saifullah had failed to convict al-Qaeda commanders and that the men were not part of a CIA attempt to infiltrate a terrorist network.
As a result, they were deployed for several days to the eastern district of Sargoda, far from the horrific mountains in the northwest, which became a haven for terrorists.
They were considered to be a strike unit.
Why they were detained, the official said, speaking about maintaining anonymity given the sensitivity of the case.
The official said the men were not intimidated and were still trying to obtain consent for access to al-Qaida camps when they were arrested by Pakistani law enforcement.
The case of these five — who remained in Pakistan and were questioned by the FBI — highlights the critical role of recruiters in identifying potential terrorists, and perhaps, more importantly, determining who is trustworthy.
Since the September 11, 2001 attacks, U.S. intelligence has given the highest priority to attempts to place human resources in al-Qaida.
The recruiters of the organization act as guards, excluding those who are not serious enough in their commitment to the holy war and those who might be spies.
U.S. counterfeit recruits have been subjected to special investigation by al-Qaeda, analysts said.
But they were also considered extremely interesting in the group because of their potential approach to U.S. goals and their promotional value.
But Evan Kohlmann, a senior analyst at the US-based NEFA Foundation, said terrorist groups have also become considerably more cautious in recent years about when they will allow them to join as U.S. intelligence agencies recruit experts on their recruitment methods.
If we are trying to penetrate these groups, there is no better way than to follow their recruitment model, which has already been followed so much? said Mr Kohlmann.
This model is one of those that is much more web-based.
Tens of thousands protest in Copenhagen, demanding climate 'action'
Tens of thousands of protesters marched through the streets on Saturday, demanding a stronger climate action from negotiators at the city’s Bella Convention Center.
Protesters cited the number of many hundreds of thousands of participants in the event, but police say the number was closer to 25,000.
The event was relatively quiet and a handful of masked activists laid several small charges near a group of government buildings in the city center.
On the day of a minor incident in UN-sponsored climate talks, thousands of activists walked through the city carrying banners with English inscriptions “This is not Planet B” (i.e., second-rate) and one in Spanish that reported “The Earth says ‘enough’.”
Several celebrities took part in the protest, including Danish model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said she had traveled to her mother’s home in Peru and provided me with information about the distressing state of the country, which is still affected by climate change.
That's partly why we decided to join this great march -- to go through the world and appeal to the world's leading figures to come up with a fair, ambitious and binding deal," she said.
It is not an easy task, but it must be done, it cannot be avoided.
Police prevented protesters from approaching Bella's centre and said they had detained 19 people, primarily because they either wore masks or carried pocket knives.
These activities are prohibited under Danish law during demonstrations.
According to one of the non-participating viewers, who does not wish to be identified because he is involved in climate talks, activists disguised as athletes and in black suits placed several charges near the Copenhagen main canal, which is located near several ministries.
They were agitating around the buildings, he said, starting with flashlights, but then there were "several major explosions."
Inside the convention center, people gathered around television screens to watch the march during the afternoon.
But the protest is unlikely to have come to the attention of key officials, such as Su Wei, China’s chief climate negotiator.
When asked whether the demonstration had a constructive impact on international negotiations, he replied in English, "Actually, that is something that I was not aware of."
Then he continued in Chinese and said, "Because the scene is extensive, I can't hear what's going on outside."
He watched whether the march was painful or helpful, depending on everyone’s prospects.
There is a concentration of the general public and various sectors and the subject of climate change, he said.
In other words: "It can also be said that it is a violation of the freedom of others.
Test Data Reveals Constant Persistent Racial Differences
The federal certificate from last week on the math knowledge gained was a welcome element of the good news about public education in the District of Columbia.
Although the district lags far behind the country’s high-performance systems, the certification has shown greater progress among fourth and eighth graders in the past two years than in cities including Atlanta, Chicago, and New York.
But what remains hidden behind the latest figures from the National Attestation Center for Teaching Advancement are the persistent differences in knowledge gained between African Americans and white students, both locally and nationally.
The average score of white fourth graders in the District of Columbia in the past two years has increased from 267 to 270 points (from a possible 500), but their African-American counterparts have grown by only three points, from 209 to 212.
Indeed, the difference in knowledge gained increased from 53 to 57 points between 2007 and 2009.
Progress among African Americans in the eighth grade remains essentially balanced, with a deviation of one point out of 245 to 245 statistically insignificant.
The average score in white pupils was not included in the test results because the sample size was not large enough.
The picture in the six-year horizon is not exactly encouraging.
The difference between white and black fourth graders in 2003, when the first NAEP was carried out in the district, was 60 points on the scale (262 to 202).
Although the result achieved in children from both groups improved during this period, the difference was hardly approaching 58.
Some education advocates in the district said last week that the results celebrated by secretary Michelle A. Rhee and mayor Adrian M. Fenty (D) were more extensively stimulated in white students where the results were already high.
That would imply that we have increased the amount of support for those at the higher end of the scale, which is problematic and worrying, said Jeff Smith, executive director of D.C. Voice, a nonprofit group that advocates for equal pay in the county.
“I’m not jumping up and down because of a two or three-point distraction,” said D.C. committee member Kwame R. Brown (D-At Large), who has a daughter in fourth grade at Eaton Elementary School.
Often criticizing the style of Mrs. Rhee's administration, Mrs. Brown said the report on the test results means that secondary education in the city is in a desperate state and requires attention.
It's obvious that you always want to see the pros, and I respect that.
But what’s terrible is that we didn’t devote almost any time and energy to our secondary education.
Ms. Rhee said the district’s effort is to continue to look for better ways to address the needs of students with low scores.
As a result, for example, some teachers are trained in the use of new reading curriculums, the Wilson Reading System, which targets high school students and high school students who have failed to master the basics of reading earlier in their knee-jerk careers significantly behind their peers.
The daily maths and curriculum of the sixth grade maths lesson, highlighting the games and real-life experiences that came to the precinct under former director Clifford Janey, can be attributed to the progress of NAEP, which was reported last week.
And I think we should continue to work and perform the best possible interventions on those students who remain below class level, Ms. Rhee said.
Others said that the results of the NAEP clarified the question of whether Ms Rhee could continue to increase the overall performance of the system and still provide additional money and resources for low-performance schools, which is necessary to reduce the gap.
It’s a certain Michelle Rhee’s definite dilemma, said Bruce Fuller, a professor of teaching at the University of California at Berkeley where he studies test results in urban areas.
The conventional remedy procedure is to focus funds and administrative reforms on schools located in the worst parts of the District of Columbia.
Thus, the focus can bring political resonances that are directed against an important agenda.
But the adage, of course, belongs to the other city managers, who are trying to maintain the average average between whites and blacks.
We need to focus on building a system of big schools.
We need to strengthen the kinship of our schools so that all families, no matter where they live, can rely on their children to be provided with excellent public education.
Mr. Janey, now director of schools in Newark, said in an interview this week that a key element in reducing the gap between the results achieved is the extension of the traditional public school year, currently 180 days in the county, to make schools eligible.
You have to get up to 200 days to enforce the changes, said Mr. Janey, who signed a contract with his teacher association last year for a 185-day school year, which he sees as a “symptom” for seeking a bigger raise next year.
Making higher education part of a better future
A tour bus entered the Gettysburg Railway with a loud rest.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, stepped up and rested for a moment on white pillars, brick facades and emerald green lawns.
Graciela’s parents hardly graduated from college in El Salvador.
So far, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lived in Riverdale, has never entered the ground of the college.
Now she and other eighth graders in the group were exploring Gettysburg, where tuition was $38,690 a year, their status was rather frightened than enthusiastic visitors to potential students.
Yes! That’s it! called Graciela, who would like to study medicine, when the guide offered them to enter the building of knowledge.
Wow, really? she said thoughtfully, when they were told of the low ratio of professors to students.
The Pennsylvania College was one of the seven that they visited on their three-day tour and were now completely obsessed with the future message: The question is not whether you will enter the college.
The question is where.
However, this is a major problem with the high number of children born in the United States to Spanish immigrants who are excluded from college or pregnant as minors, but there are hundreds of thousands who receive secondary education and thus enter the middle class.
In fact, one-fifth of this “long generation” of Spanish students from college – the remarkable results achieved say that many of their immigrant parents, mostly Mexicans and Central Americans, entered the United States without completing college.
Their success story is important, the researchers say, as it underscores their point of departure for a generation that played a marginal role in the country’s labor force.
Those who have achieved higher education say that they had a natural inclination to school and innate penetration and endeavor to succeed.
Many also had parents who set high goals for their children and looked for ways to replace the ignorance of American education.
But school programs also play an extraordinary role in helping Graciela and the millions of children who would like to go to college — especially if these efforts persist over time.
If we take into account the fact that children come from low-income groups whose parents do not have the experience and ability to help them navigate the system, any simple intervention at every single point will not solve this, says Patricia Gándara, a researcher at the University of California at Davis.
We need to think about providing these children with a pre-school grid in every way they can to get through college.
The federal program that financed Graciela's track trip is a useful example.
Known as GEAR UP, it provides more than $300 million a year for local school systems to run track preparation programs that begin for students from low-income groups in high schools and continue until these students graduate from college.
Since 1999, the program has served more than 10 million students, more than 1% of whom have entered college, according to the U.S. Department of Education.
Iraq's Ministry of Petroleum Industry reaches agreement with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite fears of violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has managed to get major oil companies to rebuild their poor infrastructure during two auctions held on Saturday.
Ten agreements have been signed by the Iraqi Ministry of Petroleum Industry with foreign oil companies, indicating that Chinese, Russian and European oil companies are ready to play a significant role in rebuilding Iraq’s oil industry, crippled by decades of wars and sanctions.
U.S. companies have left with capital participation in just two of the 10 auctioned fields.
Seven U.S. companies paid for participating in the second auction, which began on Friday.
Only one has made a lost offer.
Two U.S. companies reached an agreement on the field, which was auctioned in June.
The modest participation of U.S. oil giants in the open Iraqi oil industry surprised analysts.
Iraq has finally opened its doors after six years of war, and instead of American companies, you have Asians and Europeans in the first place, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum, online news.
It will be a long time before anything else is for sale in Iraq.
Security concerns, highlighted by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday and political instability, as well as the withdrawal of the U.S. military are likely to dissuade U.S. companies from much more intensive business in Iraq, which has proven to be the third-largest stockpile of raw materials, analysts say.
U.S. companies have been at a disadvantage in some cases, especially Chinese and other government-controlled energy companies have significantly lower operating costs and are more prone to risk because they do not meet shareholders.
Exxon Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only U.S. companies to enter into agreements with the department.
Leading U.S. companies such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which have maintained close contacts with the Iraqi Department of Petroleum Industry and offered technical assistance in recent years, have left empty-handed.
Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the top shareholders in two of the contracts awarded at the end of this week.
The state-owned National Petroleum Corp. took part in bids on more contracts than all other companies and left with large shares in contracts on two main fields.
We all know that China is striving to become a major economic as well as technological force, said spokesman for the Ministry of Petroleum Industry, Assam Jihad.
We are convinced that the Chinese company will be comparable to the competition and will meet its commitments to Iraq.
Companies that were pre-selected to submit bids, which were then compared by the Ministry according to the price per barrel, and the Ministry is willing to pay for strengthening the output above the current levels in each field.
Al-Qaeda's top planner was apparently killed in Pakistan.
The U.S. missile strike on the Pakistan-Afghan border this week appears to have killed a top al-Qaeda operations planner, U.S. counterterrorism officials said on Friday.
As confirmed, this could be the second deadly attack on one of the top terrorist leaders.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arabs killed when several rockets hit their car on Thursday near the town of Miran <0xC5><0x9A>áh in North Waziristan province, according to U.S. sources and Pakistani officials in the area.
Local authorities have denied that the missiles were fired from an unmanned aircraft of the type operated by the CIA in the area of illegal indigenous tribes.
They were pointed at a white car heading towards the Afghan border when it was hit, a senior official along with Pakistani intelligence agency said, calling from Miran Shah.
The official said the local armed forces swung to the point and quickly confiscated what was left of the "totally destroyed bodies".
Local authorities were unable to verify the identities of the victims, but two U.S. counter-terrorism officials cited an unspecified witness who said Somalia was dead.
Somalia was cited as a high-ranking planner of al-Qaida military operations that led the operations of terrorist groups outside Afghanistan and Pakistan.
He was involved in rebuilding around the world, a senior official who did not want to be named said, citing the sensitive nature of U.S. airstrikes on Pakistani territory.
If he held such a central position, he was probably involved in attacks against the United States and Europe.
He was instructed by al-Qaida’s top leadership to plan possible terrorist attacks.
Another U.S. official said Somalia was rapidly advancing in the al-Qaeda hierarchy and was well connected to other extremist groups in the region.
He didn’t have to be a well-known person for some Americans, but he didn’t humiliate himself in any way to pose in front of us and our allies, another official said.
When his death was confirmed, Somalia should be the second high-ranking leader of al-Qaida or the Taliban to be killed since September when Najmudin Jalolov, the leader of a militant faction in the Native tribes belt and three other top-ranking militants were killed in a similar attack.
The rate of attacks launched by the CIA using drones has dropped from an average of about six operations a month to two, according to the Long War newspaper, a website run by a non-profit group.
The reduction may be justified in improving the tactics of terrorist groups that have taken steps to reduce their vulnerability by also mercilessly killing people suspected of being informants, the site said.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in Kabul has resigned.
The top UN delegate to Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday he would like to step down in March, ending a tumultuous term plagued by accusations of widespread corruption in the U.N.-backed presidential election in Afghanistan.
Eide’s departure comes after the Obama administration decided to send another 30,000 U.S. troops to Afghanistan.
The U.N. delegate said he supported the increase, but expressed concern that the U.S. state reduction schedule, which begins in 18 months, should be a call for the governments of other NATO states to withdraw their forces.
We need to speed up the build-up of Afghan security forces and send the right signal to Afghans to trust the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also pressed the United States and other military forces to increase the number of international civilian personnel helping to politically transform Afghanistan.
The increase on the side of the armed forces must be copied on the side of the civilians, he said.
Eide said he was not resigning, but was simply fulfilling a promise he made to his family in March 2008 that he would only spend two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to report to the United Nations.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has now said he would need time to find a replacement.
As I said, it’s high time to look for a successor, Eide said.
When I came here, there was a two-month vacuum between my predecessor’s departure and my arrival.
According to U.N. officials, Ban began searching for a replacement.
Officials said the decision was made between Staffan di Mistura, who is of Swedish-Italian origin and previously headed the UN mission in Baghdad, and Jean-Maria Guéhenn, a Frenchman who previously led UN peacekeeping operations.
Eide’s position in Afghanistan was tested by his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, who was accused in September by President Hamid Karzai, who won the country’s presidential election for masking the presence of massive election machinations.
Eide denied the allegations, but said Galgraith's accusation -- which was released -- "certainly hurt the mission because there was a high degree of skepticism about international interference" in the election.
Eide said he had proposed a meeting with the top U.S. citizen representative to coordinate the easing of efforts to lead U.S. forces in Afghanistan.
He also urged the UN leadership to allow his successors to hire more workers from the United States and other Western countries to lend them to the Afghan mission, so he said he wanted to strengthen their confidence that their money was being used properly.
Eide expressed disappointment at the limitations of his efforts in Afghanistan, saying that the UN's tough hiring regulations undermine its ability to use its capabilities.
The UN rules are such that I have been able to get only one person since May, he said.
It's a disaster and I can't go on.
Gates: Iran faces further sanctions
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said on Friday that world powers would soon impose "further significant sanctions" on Iran due to a lack of engagement in talks on its nuclear ambitions.
Gates, who spoke to a group of about 300 U.S. soldiers in northern Iraq during a week’s journey through areas of war in Afghanistan and Iraq, has downplayed the prospects of armed actions against the Islamic Republic.
This is not a good choice for Iran, he said in response to a soldier’s question about probable developments.
One of the things that depends on me is whether I have learned anything from Iraq in the last six years, [that] is the inseparable unpredictability of war.
The Obama administration is deciding on a package of sanctions that could hit the Iranian military and political elite, but Gates signaled that some of those sanctions could also affect ordinary Iranians.
He said a "package of incentives and barriers" would require "to make the Iranian government really feel less secure with nuclear weapons" because "its residents will suffer extremely" with sanctions.
According to a statement issued on Friday by White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the administration has engaged the European leader in warning that Iran will bear serious consequences if it does not fully align its nuclear program with the United Nations Nuclear Safety Committee and its oversight body, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran insists that it wants to develop its expertise only for peaceful purposes.
Speaking in Geneva on October 1, he indicated that he wanted to return to talks on restricting his nuclear program and agreed to provide a substantial portion of his enriched uranium reserves in exchange for urgently needed fuel for the reactor to conduct medical research.
The administration has set itself up for such an agreement as a way to build trust between the two parties and to gain time for negotiation.
But since then, Iran seems to be drifting away from the interim agreements – partly because, the expert says, because the Iraqi leadership is divided in opinions on whether to engage with the United States.
Honestly, as far as Iran's stubbornness towards the international community is concerned, in the case of some proposals with which it actually agreed at the beginning of October, I think that this has led the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, together on a path which is not to be summed up in the terminology of the Ga.
President Obama set a deadline on December 31 for Iran to respond to proposals before returning to seeking other elections, including monitoring, which Foreign Secretary Hillary Rodham Clinton once called “degrading sanctions.”
In a statement issued in New York, the Iranian mission to the United Nations on Thursday condemned what it called "unfounded and unfounded accusations" against some members of the Security Committee on Iran's nuclear activities and said it wants to continue the long-standing talks with the United States and the United States over the next two years.
Gates, who returned to Washington on Friday, met Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki in the morning before flying to the oil-rich Kurdistan region to meet with troops in Kirkuk and Kurdish officials in Irbil.
There remains high tension between the Kurds and the Iraqi Arab majority, mainly because of borders, property rights and income distribution.
Gtes urged both sides to reduce the potential for conflict to prevent delays in U.S. plans to limit the number of U.S. troops from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also sought to alleviate Kurdish concerns about the ongoing depression, citing US officials as quoted by Gates when he told Massoud Barzaani, the president of the Kurdistan Regional Government: "We want to protect your security, prosperity and autonomy in a united Iraq.
We don't want to leave you."
In an ageing China, change of course
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters that read, “Mother Earth is too exhausted to have more children” and “One extra child means one extra grave.”
Then they were taught that when the official government offices in Shanghai, alarmed by the low birth rate and the aging population in their city, suddenly changed course this summer and began to encourage young couples, their reaction was immediate and determined: Never.
We have always devoted all our time and energy to one child.
We have nothing left for others, says Wang, 31, a human resources manager who has an 8-month-old son.
China’s more than 30-year-old policy of having only one child has been put in place, creating two generations of only notorious bullied and bullied children, afflicted by nicknames of “small emperors,” threatening the country with population crises.
The average birth rate dropped to 1.8 children per couple compared to six before the policy came into effect, according to UN data.
The distribution of the population, where the population aged 60 and above is projected to grow stormily from 16.7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 percent in 2050. This is far above the overall average of about 20 percent.
The imbalance is larger than the rich coastal cities with a population with higher education, for example in Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and over made up nearly 22 percent of the registered population in Shanghai, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of the Shanghai City Commission for Population and Family Planning, said many couples need to have children to “help reduce the proportion of the aging population and reduce the numerical status of the workforce in the future.”
He says it's about "being old, it doesn't mean being rich -- like in developed countries like Japan or Sweden."
Gradual calming
As enshrined in the country’s constitution in 1978, China’s one-child policy is probably the most controversial mandate ever imposed under the Communist Party’s government.
The two who violated the policy faced enormous fines -- up to three times their annual salary in some areas -- and discrimination at work.
China’s official offices have been advocating policies that helped the country prevent critical exploitation of natural resources, while human rights defenders have been condemned in advocating policies.
In rural areas, some officials forced pregnant women with their second child to undergo abortions.
In addition, many couples had to undergo sexist abortions of choice, leading to an unnaturally high ratio of men to women.
In recent years, population officials have gradually been milder in their views on the one-child policy.
In 2004, they generally allowed exceptions - including urban residents, members of national minorities, and cases where men and women were single - and in 2007 they mitigated the dictation of their hardline slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at Beijing University’s Population Research Institute, said central government officials had previously debated more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the partners was an only child.
In June, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage more births.
Almost overnight, posters urging parents to have only one child were replaced by copies of the regulation, detailing how it would be justified to have another child and how to apply for permission.
The city administration sent family planning officials and volunteers to meet couples in their homes and insert leaflets under the door.
They also promised to provide emotional and financial advice for those who decided to have more than one child.
The reaction was cold, family planning officials said.
Annoying Reaction
Although officials in a rural city near Shanghai have seen an increase in interest in couples who would like to have a second child after the campaign starts, most city districts have not reported any changes.
Huinan county, with a population of 115,000, for example, still recorded four to five cases per month.
Disappointed officials in Shanghai said despite the campaign, the number of people born in the city in 2010 is still expected to be only around 165,000 - slightly higher than in 2009, but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee at Shanghai’s Caolu Reading, said financial considerations were probably the main reason people don’t want to have more children.
They want to give the best to the first child, he said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said they would like to have two children and were legally allowed to do so.
But like many Chinese, who only have insufficient health and life insurance provided by the government.
Without a local intercept network, the choice could be irresponsible.
People in the West misjudge one-child policy as a controversial legal issue, says Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is in a relationship with her first child in the seventh month of pregnancy.
Yes, we were deprived of the chance to have more than one child.
But the problem is not only in politics.
It's about the money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons for hesitation.
Wang, the human resources manager, says they only want one child because she was also an only child: "We were the focus of our families and everyone took care of us.
We weren’t used to providing care and in fact we didn’t want to care for others.
Chen Zijian, a 42-year-old who works as a translator, said this in a much more subtle way.
For middle-class bi-career parents who have reduced childbirth, he said, being successful means being selfish.
Today’s 20- and 30-year-olds view their parents as the first days of the Chinese experiment with capitalism and do not want to feed themselves in this way, he says.
Just one child makes huge demands on parents’ time, he says.
A mother must sacrifice at least two years of her social life.
Then there are the controversial space questions -- "You have to rebuild your apartment" -- and the strategy -- "You have to have resumes prepared at a time when the child is 9 months old for good preschool education.
Most of his friends want to settle down with one child, says Che, but not with two.
We are the first generation with higher standards of nutrition, he says.
We don't want to make too many sacrifices.
The United Nations has developed a plan to reduce emissions.
The UN-sponsored climate conference -- characterized by far-reaching undisciplined stances and mutual insinuation -- again on Friday focused on the release of a document that proposes ambitious greenhouse gas reductions over the next 40 years with industrialized nations bearing most of the burden.
The text, which can provide a basis for a final political agreement on the regulation of greenhouse gases, highlights the remaining obstacles as well as illuminates the way forward.
But important progress has been seen in negotiations that have taken place at the wrong time with more than 100 world leaders arriving in Copenhagen next week.
Created by an ad hoc UN working group, this text unobtrusively sets out how much money rich countries should provide to those poor to deal with global warming in the short and long term.
And it provides a full range of choices for key issues, including how to develop and manage emerging economies to limit their carbon output and what the upper limit of global warming should be that political actors will still be able to tolerate.
This gives the process a great deal of flexibility, says John Coequyt, senior manager at the Washington Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who drafted the six-page document, shortened the 180-page text from the talks to focus on what the top UN climate official, Yvo de Boer, described as a “big picture.”
It outlines the outlines for a possible agreement in which industrial nations could jointly limit their emissions to 25 to 45 percent within a year compared to 1990 levels, while major developing countries could reduce their emissions to 15 to 30 percent during this period.
Together, the country would reduce emissions by between 50 and 95 percent by 2050.
The European Union on Friday swiftly negotiated a pledge to provide $3.6 trillion over the next three years to help poorer countries adapt to climate change — from managing floods and drought to preventing deforestation.
But he still cited the same kind of verbal fireworks that prevailed in last week’s interviews.
U.S. Special Envoy for Climate Change Todd Stern declined a speech calling for binding greenhouse gas emissions cuts for industrialized countries compared to volunteering in major emerging economies if they were not funded by the developed world.
The shift signaled that the Obama administration had imposed a tougher line on China by running Bush administration officials just two years ago.
The United States will not join the treaty without transferring major developing countries and carrying out actions, Stern said, also complaining that the text is not enough to ensure restrictions and should be verified by external observers.
Stern made the comment an hour after China’s deputy foreign minister, He Yafei, told the US chief climate negotiator that either a lack of “peasant sense” or “extraordinary irresponsibility” led to the announcement earlier this week that the United States could not help financially.
With the future of the economic trajectory of the world’s major powers at stake, tensions broke out both within the developing world and between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current struggle is mostly for the preservation of individual economies rather than for the preservation of the planet, between China and the United States in terms of fulfilling their respective commitments, while the poorer nations point out that two dozen of the world’s most influential countries are ignoring the scientific imperative to carry out more vigorously and effectively.
Ricardo Ulate, Costa Rica’s delegate, said it was not surprising that major powers were fighting over who should bear the cost of limiting greenhouse gases, while vulnerable countries became much more aggressive in finding ways to prevent large emitters from acting responsibly.
It is clearly a game about the new economic hegemony developing, said Ulate, who also serves as a regional advisor on regional climate change in Mexico and Central America for international nature conservation.
Some of the countries most vulnerable to climate change have indicated they would like to continue to enforce a legally binding agreement in Copenhagen, but most of the main participants said the best outcome of the talks would be a political agreement.
The Alliance of Small Island States, which has 43 members, drafted a 24-page deal last Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who led international climate talks in favour of the European Commission, said the push by small island nations “caused a political push for the entire political process” partly because they are now united and demanding action from emerging economies like China and India.
The talks sparked a new urgency once the delegates focused on the fact that they had to resolve most of the remaining issues before the heads of government could reach an agreement.
High-ranking officials such as India’s Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and China’s deputy minister stepped off the planes and ran through the halls of the Bella Center to the closed doors of meetings and new conferences so they could lay out claims to be assessed next week.
The sheer scale of the gathering—when 13,000 people moved daily from and to the convention center, on guitar playing activists staged ironic views at night about the countries they thought they had sent out, and there was no electronic mailing of proposals from hand to hand.
Intensity is only a superstructure: almost all key ministers were present in Copenhagen and earlier in the middle of 60 heads of state.
We’ve gotten into the high categories,” said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, deputy minister for global policy on international nature conservation.
Heavy weights are coming.
Britain's first 140-mile-an-hour train redefined feelings on Monday
At 5:13 a.m. on Monday morning, the hedgehog cut through the darkness to mark the departure of the train, which marked a transport revolution in Britain.
The country's first high-speed passenger train will reach 140 miles per hour and fly from Ashford, Kent, to London's St Pancras, surpassing 58 miles in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, Minister of Transport, then joined Mrs. Kelly Holmes and entered the first high-speed passenger line outside London.
It hopes that the new service will eventually connect Britain with an international network of fast, reliable trains and connect the major agglomerations of Midland, the north and Scotland with London.
Forgotten standing waters should reduce transport times in passenger transport and on commercial roads, and the transition from aircraft and cars to rail could reduce carbon emissions and eliminate road congestion.
Theoretically, the three main political parties have allowed themselves to be acquired for this vision.
But the tens of billions of pounds needed to build a new national rail network, the inevitable fight for projects and environmental concerns have now slowed down the construction of Britain’s high-speed tracks.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company set up in January to provide the government with a feasible study, handed its report to Lord Adonis on December 30, the Times reported.
She provided him with a detailed map of the route of the next planned stage of the high-speed network.
A new route linking London to West Midlands has been designed to reach up to five meters in urban areas and neighborhoods where landing on the habitat could be problematic.
In the open countryside, the final route was planned for 25 m.
HS2 also envisages identifying three options for an extensive high-speed network leading to the north.
Lord Adonis will respond in the spring.
The preferred option is a Y-shaped config, where one high-speed line should lead to West Midlands.
The route should be shared near Birmingham with one branch passing from Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and the other leading northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
One route should lead to Scotland.
"It seems that the most powerful choice has taken place," he said, and the railway expert.
Once this is done, the time between London and Edinburgh will be reduced to two hours and 40 minutes.
The first stage, which will not open before 2025, could allow passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes compared to more than one hour in the present.
The proposals would allow trains to travel at 2,250 miles per hour, making the British network the fastest in Europe.
The initial line is already being proposed to abduct trains in length of 400 m, which would be able to carry 1100 people.
Up to 18 sets could operate every hour on the London - Birmingham route.
This means that the London terminal would be able to serve up to 20,000 passengers per hour if needed.
In view of the capital constraints, it is assumed that the existing station would be expanded to include the high-speed network.
Experts in the railway industry claim that only San Pancras International or Euston offer such potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not he intends to implement this scheme, but extensive public consultations and planning procedures mean that the story of the final decision will not take place before the general election.
Even if it puts the wheels in motion, the net should be built in parts.
Trains should first be put into service not on high-speed lines, but on existing routes north of Birmingham and maintain time between London and Scotland over three hours.
This is considered to be a crucial point of contact for ensuring the transition from aircraft to trains, a point of reference for the rail revolution.
Taxpayers pay a <0xC2><0xA3>75,000 mortgage on Tory orangery
Alan Duncan, the Tory leader in the House of Representatives, paid taxpayers thousands of pounds last year for the orangery he built in his home in the constituency.
A spokesman for the prison party, who was demoted by David Cameron for complaining that MPs lived "out of allocations", raised his mortgage to <0xC2><0xA3>75,000 to build an oak-lined extension in his second home in Rutland.
He was allowed to charge a special interest, a total of hundreds of pounds per month to taxpayers.
General authorities approved the claims in time, so Sir Thomasen Legge, who was conducting the check on member dispensers, was not interviewed. Last night Mr Duncan made his demands "it seemed to be cleaner or simpler".
Mr. Duncan, one of the wealthiest members of parliament, owns two two-story country houses in his constituency of Rutland and Melton.
The houses are worth about a million pounds.
On the ground floor there is a kitchen, a living room and a dining room, but the Fed has agreed that Mr. Duncan needs more space.
Last year, he added a winter garden to the house, which is labeled "orangery" in the plans.
Neighbors describe it as a "greenhouse for entertainment and hospitality".
Mr. Duncan was not asked to provide any explanation for the increased loan during the last audit by the General Standards and Privileges Committee in the latest mortgage settlement.
The committee informed him last month that he had violated the rules after reviewing his spending.
In 2004, Mr. Duncan changed the pupil security to a mortgage of <0xC2><0xA3>27,1406 from his London estate to a house in his constituency he bought in 1991, a year before becoming a member of the House of Representatives.
Documents released this week showed that Mr. Duncan claimed approximately <0xC2><0xA3>1400 a month in the interest of a mortgage until March last year.
In April, his claims rose to more than 1,800 pounds a month.
The interest in the repayment of Mr Duncan’s RBS mortgage could not change at this time, suggesting that all this was intended to finance the loan of <0xC2><0xA3>75000.
The standard variable RBS mortgage repayment declined in December 2007 from 7.94 percent to 4 percent in March of this year, while it remained.
The latest municipal document shows that Mr. Duncan continued to claim <0xC2><0xA3>1,250 a month this May.
Duncan left his job as shadow House leader in September after a secret reporter filmed him and said MPs had to survive "at the mercy" of the spending scandal.
"Basically, it's nationalized, you have to live on the allocation and it treats you like a s**t."
He said: "I spent the money for my garden and the claim and a small fraction of what was needed.
And I could claim all the damn shares, but I won't."
The MP, a millionaire from a former career as an oil trader, was first asked to explain his issues in May when it turned out that he was claiming thousands of pounds for his garden, even before the financial authority approved that it “could be considered excessive.”
One of the activists dug a pound-shaped pit in Mr. Duncan’s lawn in protest after it was revealed that he had claimed 4,000 pounds for three years.
When asked last night about a mortgage increase, Mr. Duncan said: "It was because of a capital increase, which was approved by both the Treasury and subsequently Legge."
"This is not a question of hiding and calling or breaking the rules or anything else.
It's an absolutely straight line down, by the rules, justified and that's all.
This would not be much clearer or simpler in many other ways.”
Come and take a closer look at the cottage on the coast of Brighton with an advent calendar.
Coastal cottages in Brighton have found a new meaning to life in the winter months as an interactive advent calendar.
Beyond, an alternative ecclesiastical group that encourages ducal creativity, urged 24 owners to decorate their cottages for every day in December, and to use Christmas gifts as the theme of this decoration.
The event began on 1 December, when it allowed visitors to view the last chateau from 5:30 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. every day, and the bishop’s sandwich and boiled wine provided for free.
Selected choirs included I Saw Three Ships, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel and The First No<0xC3><0xAB>l, when the cottage featured the work of Janetta Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a TV marketing assistant from Hove, is a non-stipendium priest in the Diocese of Chichester and head of Beyond.
He said: “We want to make religion much more important for people in post-Christian society.
"Why should we, as a church, expect people to come to a strange old building? I feel that the church should come to people and serve in an awakening way.
"The idea of the Advent calendar in the cottages came up just like an interview with some friends during dinner.
Brighton is such a fantastically creative and vibrant place and we have tried to try and present it in a spiritual way.”
Strong mobilization in Copenhagen and in the world against climate change.
Tens of thousands of people took to the streets on Saturday demanding a strong and binding agreement to fight global warming, which should be adopted at a conference in Copenhagen, protested around the world and in Copenhagen, where police arrested hundreds of people on the occasion.
At least 30,000 people, according to police sources, and 100,000, according to organizers, protested in the cold weather in the Danish capital on the occasion of the UN climate conference, which aims to adopt an agreement by Friday, which could enter into force on 1 January 2013.
Connie Hedegaard, the Danish president of the climate conference, said that the growing global mobilization, which is clearly evidenced by the current demonstrations, contributed to the fact that the "political tax" of a possible failure in Copenhagen would be too high.
According to AFP, incidents occurred in the Danish capital shortly after the start of the parade, when a group of about 300 protesters, dressed in black, began to break the windows with tiles and hammers.
The police immediately intervened drastically.
In total, police have announced the arrests of 600 to 700 people, clarifying that they were mainly members of the “Blacks Blocks”, ultra-radical separate groups that had already manifested themselves in April at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, eastern France.
The Climate Justice Action Coalition (CJA), one of the organizers of the event, condemned the conditions under which hundreds of radicals were arrested "without distinction" and stressed that about a hundred of them were "kept in the streets on Saturday evening" even during the extreme winter.
After leaving Parliament, the parade calmly headed towards the Bella Center, where the negotiations were taking place.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the building without attempting to penetrate.
A podium was built for the speakers, in front of which a spiritual meeting was held at candlelight with the participation of the former South African Archbishop of Cape Town Desmond Tutu.
Most of the protesters arrived by bus and train from major European cities, and in addition to Africans, there were a large number of participants from Asia, including several Chinese and Koreans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly in blue coats, formed their first meeting in Copenhagen in the morning, at the invitation of the Friends of the Earth group, which wanted to create "blue waves" for a "fair climate".
"Today we are going to the streets to demand a settlement of ecological debt in favor of the South," said Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino fighter from the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can no longer say, “It’s time,” Benin singer Angelique Kidjo said.
In Africa, rivers and streams are drying up, we can walk in them today, and this has never been possible before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, which was born in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the fight for another world movement has come closer to environmental organizations.
French MEP José Bové, one of the figures fighting for another world, said that he came to Copenhagen in order to "connect climate and social justice". "Currently, there is no difference between fighting against global warming and fighting for another world ".
The first demonstrations began in the Asia-Pacific region, where many islands are particularly sensitive to climate warming.
In Australia, about 50,000 people took to the streets, according to the organizers.
In Manila, several hundred people marched, mostly students, in red clothes and scarves evoking the importance of solar energy.
Hundreds of protesters took to the streets in Hong Kong, Jakarta, and Canada to demand strong action against climate change.
In France, hundreds of people took part in the protests organized by the "350" movement, mainly in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
Dozens of people gathered in Geneva.
Separatist Abkhazia has elected its president, Georgia condemns it as a "frank"
Abkhazia elected its president on Saturday, about a year after Moscow recognized this pro-Russian separatist territory as independent of Georgia, Tbilisi, on the other hand, declares this move a “frank”.
About 131,000 people were invited to participate in these first elections since the Russo-Georgian War in August 2008 for control of South Ossetia, another former Georgian territory recognized by Russia.
The polling stations closed at 17:00 GMT.
According to officials of the Abkhaz Election Commission, the participation was 58% a few hours before the closure of the polling stations.
The first preliminary results should be announced at night from Saturday to Sunday.
All five candidates, including incumbent President Sergey Bagapsh, categorically reject the idea of merging with Georgia, which has condemned these elections.
This election is a joke.
On the other hand, Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili "regrets that Abkhazia has completely fallen into Russian domination," his spokeswoman Manana Manjgaladze said.
Apart from Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela, with 216,000 inhabitants, recognized the territory’s independence, while the rest of the world considers it part of Georgia, which was illegally occupied by Russian troops.
After separating from Georgia, following the 1992-1993 conflict in which several thousand people died, Abkhazia tries to show through elections that it is ready to return to international politics.
This process is one of the stages of our new life, the new era of our independent state, said Kvar<0xC4><0x8D>ija Svetlana, a 54-year-old historian who also admitted she voted for President Bagap<0xC5><0xA1>a.
She was one of those who came to vote for the ballot box at a school in the capital, Suchumi, for a beautiful white building with several palm trees at the entrance.
The issue of Russian domination is the main theme of the presidential elections in this region on the Black Sea coast, which can boast of beautiful nature.
Across this small country with 216,000 inhabitants, huge billboards with Bagapsh are deployed alongside Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
In Galicia, in the west of the country, Russian officials who came to oversee the successful course of the elections were warmly welcomed by the mayor of the district of Beslan Ar<0xC5><0xA1>ba.
"We, the Abkhaz, are grateful," he said at a small ceremony, bearing in mind Moscow's support and in particular its decision to recognize Abkhazia's independence.
I hope that your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations, said Alexei Ostrovsky, a member of the Russian parliament, and drank a glass of vodka on it.
The opposition, which was represented in the election by former vice-president Raul Khadzhimba and two merchants Zaus Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticized last year’s deals with Moscow, such as a deal that allows Russia to control the Abkhazia 10 rail network.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, says he does not support either the current government or the opposition.
A majority of 50% plus one vote is required to win the election.
If none of the candidates achieves this result, the decisive contest must take place within two weeks.
Climate: events in the world, events in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people took to the streets on Saturday demanding a strong and binding agreement to fight global warming, to be adopted at a conference in Copenhagen, protested around the world and in Copenhagen, where police arrested about 700 people on the occasion.
At least 30,000 people, according to police sources, and 100,000, according to organizers, protested in the afternoon in the cold weather in the Danish capital, which hosts delegates from 193 countries until 18 December, negotiating an agreement that could enter into force on 1 January 2013.
After leaving Parliament, the parade calmly headed towards the Bella Center, where the negotiations were taking place.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the building without attempting to penetrate.
A podium was built for the speakers, in front of which a spiritual meeting was held at candlelight with the participation of the former South African Archbishop of Cape Town Desmond Tutu.
According to AFP, incidents occurred shortly after the parade departed, when a group of several hundred protesters, dressed in black and armed with bricks and hammers, began to break out the displays.
The police immediately surrounded them and hit them without waiting, several protesters being knocked to the ground.
In total, police have announced the arrests of 600 to 700 people, clarifying that they were mainly members of the “Blacks Blocks”, ultra-radical separate groups that had already manifested themselves in April at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, eastern France.
Late in the afternoon, a police officer was wounded with a pavement cube on his jaw, and four cars were set on fire near a squat near incidents that, according to police sources, resulted in the detention of about 20 people.
We are focusing on extremist groups, police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen warned, as police helicopters flew back into the air.
Most of the protesters who arrived by bus or train from major German cities, London, Amsterdam and Milan, were of European origin.
But there were also many Asians, including a few Chinese and Koreans or Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly in blue coats, formed the first meeting in Copenhagen in the morning to challenge the Friends of the Earth group to create "blue waves" for a "fair climate".
"Today we are going to the streets to demand a settlement of ecological debt in favor of the South," said Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino fighter from the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.

French MEP José Bové, one of the figures fighting for another world, said that he came to Copenhagen in order to "connect climate and social justice". "Currently, there is no difference between fighting against global warming and fighting for another world ".
Oxfam has summoned several celebrities, such as Danish model Helena Christensen or former U.N. refugee commissioner Mary Robinson, to speak to the crowd.
The first demonstrations began in the Asia-Pacific region, where many islands are particularly sensitive to climate warming.
In Australia, about 50,000 people took to the streets, according to the organizers.
In Manila, several hundred people, mostly students in red clothes and scarves evoking the importance of solar energy, protested in front of the Philippine capital’s mayor.
Hundreds of protesters in Hong Kong and Jakarta have also called for strong action against climate change.
In France, hundreds of people took part in the protests organized by the "350" movement, mainly in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
Dozens of people gathered in Geneva.
The subjects of geography and history will be strengthened as part of the reform of the general gymnasium, Chatel said.
Education Minister Luc Chatel said on Sunday during an interview with JDD magazine that the subjects of history and geography will be "strengthened" under the reform of the general gymnasiums, although their teaching will no longer be compulsory in the last year of the gymnasium with a focus on exact science.
Now all students of the second year will have four hours a week and for all there will be the same program from the general culture, Chatel confirmed.
According to the minister, "it is necessary to stop hypocrisy" because, according to him, the specialization S is no longer focused on exact science" but "essentially the best students in it".
The EC and L specializations may not be for S some sub-specializations, he continues, emphasizing: "I have not heard many historians and intellectuals who would have difficulty in not learning geography and history in the last year of professional high schools."
A survey by Ifop, published on Saturday in the journal Humanité, showed that seven out of ten (69%) of French people do not agree with the government's project to abolish the compulsory teaching of history and geography in the graduation year with a specialization in S, which is why many critics, intellectuals and teachers have criticized it.
On the contrary, the Minister added that "it is not considered" to abolish the philosophy in the program of specialization With the graduation year.
At the same time, Luc Chatel opposed the reform of teacher education, while 16 organizations (students and trade unions) called for participation in Tuesday’s mobilization against this project, which they say sacrifices the pedagogical education of future professors of high schools.
Within the framework of Master's degree 2 (M2), they will undergo an admission test focused on their field at the beginning of the year and at the end of the year a further test verifying their ability to teach, the minister explained.
He will take part in professional internships during the second year of the master’s degree and in the first year he will appear in front of students as a professor-intern.
If you add up all the internships that will be offered to you before the admissions process, you will gain more experience with students, almost 300 hours, he continued.
The minister also announced that he would propose a "personal right to education", which does not yet exist in national education.
He reaffirmed the project to abolish the school map by 2012.
At the Elite École Normale Supérieure, experts have 15 minutes to convince you about the climate.
Fifteen minutes to present the goals of the Copenhagen summit: this is a call announced by Jean Jouzel, Vice-President of the Intergovernmental Group of Experts on Climate Development (GIEC), on the initiative of the University of Ecole normale supérieure on Ulm Street.
According to one journalist, Nobel Peace Prize winner Jean Jouzel opened the first of the "Ernest" conferences, which is a one-day seminar consisting of 15-minute contributions from experts that will be filmed and opened to the public.
We wanted to do something that would attract people and make them want to learn more, explained 22-year-old Edouard Hannezo, one of the organizers of this seminar, who got the name from the fish from the local pond, which the students named so.
About twenty contributing experts from different scientific disciplines will be selected and he clarified that the selection is based on their charisma.
"We can talk for hours, but we can also summarize the basic goals in a few minutes," Jean Jouzel, who spoke to 50 listeners without pre-arranged remarks, told AFP.
It is part of our scientific work, he emphasized with the hope that listeners will realize that "the Copenhagen conference is based on very seriously prepared scientific foundations".
The videos of these lectures will be posted on the school’s website from December 15.
The next seminar "Ernest" is scheduled for February and the next one will follow with regularity every two months.
Delays in payments: angry guards in prisons, planned measures
Prison guard unions announced a "general mobilization" on Friday, demanding that they be paid premiums and overtime until the Christmas holidays, the payment of which was postponed to January for financial reasons.
Prison FO (2nd Supervisory Unions) have asked employees who will not have the service to take part in a demonstration taking place on Tuesday morning in front of prison facilities to "block" them and alert them to "theft of their wages".
The CGT for Prison Supervisors (3rd trade unions of this sector) was called upon to "convene meetings in individual prisons and initiate a fundamental mobilization" with the view that "it is shameful and unacceptable" that "surcharges and surcharges for work at night, on Sundays and on holidays" should not be imposed.
The first supervisory unions, the Federal Union of Prison Supervisors (UFAP/UNSA), "calls for total mobilization (...) in order to show discontent and indignation".
The Administrative Directorate and the Ministry of Justice explain that the number of overtimes increased significantly in 2009 and were not all included in the financial budget, but assure that the amounts owed will be paid in January.
The chancellery said at the end of the day that Michèle Alliot-Mari had sent a message to the unions of prison guards reassuring them that the payment would be made next month.
I know of the efforts of the prison staff to ensure the functioning and modernization of our prison system, the minister writes in her statement.
I have ordered the Directorate of Prisons to take immediate measures to ensure that the situation created by the miscalculation of the number of overtimes will never be repeated in the future, Minister Alliot-Mari added.
The December salary will therefore be low, with the exception of managers who receive famous premiums for performing their duties and fulfilling their goals, Ufap/Unsa says, and for those "always find a place in the budget".
It is simply a scandal, the inter-regional FO union in Marseilles is outraged and has announced its decision to boycott the recall of "all meetings and summonses".
Workers will not come to work on Sundays or holidays, unless the surcharges for these days of October are paid in December, as well as in overtime, the FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne is also at risk.
At a time when they are giving us more and more work and more tasks without giving us more staff, it is sad to allow the lowest-ranking employees to pay for it, the CGT-prison supervisors in Bordeaux say.
According to the trade unions, the situation is not the same in all regions, some are better than others.
However, in any case, funds are scarce, said Ufap Secretary General Jean-François Forget.
Obama Says He Gives Better Gifts At Christmas Than What He Gets
U.S. President Barack Obama, who is preparing for his first Christmas with his family in the White House, has confided in the screen's "goddess" Oprah Winfrey that when it comes to gifts, she has a simple rule: "I give better gifts than the ones I get."
The president and his wife Michelle spoke in a special issue of the show, which will air on Sunday evening on ABC about how they are going to spend the Christmas holidays and the end of the year in their new and prestigious residence.
Even Bo, the little four-legged companion of the family, gets his share.
Jesus loves Boa, too, said Michelle Obama, saying that the dog will also receive a "of course" gift, as evidenced by excerpts from the show's pre-show.
And Michelle Obama also protested her husband’s claim about the quality of the gifts she receives: “So definitely not, I gave you some great gifts last year,” she teased the president.
Well, of course it is true, he was forced to agree, but immediately with humor he pointed his finger at the pearl necklace of the First Lady: "And who gave you this?"
At this one-hour, very relaxed show with the famous moderator, who has been a strong supporter of Barack Obama’s presidential campaign, Obama’s husbands also talked about their most favorite gifts they received as children.
Barack Obama introduced a ten-speed wheel, but also a basketball, which his Kenyan father gave him for Christmas, which he met very rarely.
“I remember seeing my father come to see us at Christmas and how he gave me the basketball,” the president said.
It was not until long afterwards that I realized that the ball was actually given to me by him.
The first lady recalled the dollhouse.
I didn’t know how to organize everything in the house, so I leveled all the furniture along the wall instead of putting it around the fireplace, but I loved that little dollhouse, Michelle Obama recalled.
Johnny Hallyday re-operated, RTL says he’s in an artificial sleep
Johnny Hallyday was re-operated in Los Angeles due to "injuries" caused by a major surgery he underwent in France, but the situation is according to his closest "under control", while RTL station said the singer is in an artificial sleep to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker was resurrected from Wednesday night to Thursday at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles after American doctors found an "injury resulting from an operation" on a heated plate that he underwent in Paris on November 26, his press department said.
The singer's press department, however, sought to reassure the public, saying the situation was "under control" and announcing that new medical communications would be issued within 48 hours at the latest.
According to RTL, which is the lead partner of the singer's last tour, Johnny Hallyday was put into an artificial sleep to avoid "pain and complications."
In 48 hours, when the patient opens his eyes, we will have a little more certainty, adds RTL.
The press department, when asked by AFP, did not confirm or comment on this information.
RTL also states that "some sources" say no drain was located in Paris after the first operation.
Rocker was operated on at the international clinic Parc Monceau because of a heated plot.
The operation, which was planned a few days in advance, was performed by neurosurgeon Stephan Delajoux, a doctor well known in the art circles.
But the doctor was not available on Thursday to comment on the RTL information.
After the operation, singer Johnny Hallyday was hospitalized at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles on Monday due to an infection that occurred after the surgery.
Singer Eddy Mitchell, a close friend of Johnny Hallyday, said on RTL radio on Thursday that his boyfriend is going through a "bad time" but added that he "doesn't worry about the rocker" because he is a big "warrior".
He called me just before he left for Los Angeles, but I told him he was doing a silly job because spending 12 hours on a plane after such an operation is no fun, Eddy Mitchell said.
On Wednesday night, the singer's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, calmed the situation, saying that Johnny Hallyday "reacts well to antibiotics" and that the infection was "stopped".
Mr. Camus also said he had met Laeticia, the singer's wife, and that he had not noticed any special concerns.
The singer's health problems have only multiplied since July, when he was hospitalized for nine days after falling on his yacht.
Two months later, to everyone's surprise, it was revealed that Johnny Hallyday had been operated on for a "small small intestine tumor" and then for a weak infection.
At the end of September, the singer returned to his long tour "Tower 66", which is presented as his farewell.
But since then, every single one of his health problems has been heavily monitored and commented on. Fans and journalists have noticed that the singer has difficulty moving on stage.
In mid-November, his team again had to deny the report of a new hospitalization.
Euro-2009/small pool: Premiere of Bousquet in his favourite discipline
Frenchman Frédérick Bousquet, a triple medalist at the 2009 World Championships in the large pool, won the title on Thursday at the 2009 European Championships in the small pool in Istanbul in a discipline he especially likes: 50m freestyle.
On the first day of the championship, on which overalls are last allowed, only three world records fell, although much more was expected.
One of them was overtaken by the Hungarian racer Evelyn Verrasztová in the 200 m positional race and the two remaining men's relays of Russia in the 4x50 m positional race.
It is a great sadness for Bousquet, who has made his way to the world record for 50 m freestyle, which he already holds in the large pool (20.94).
In one of the two royal swimming disciplines, 50m freestyle, the 28-year-old Frenchman won with a final time of 20.53 seconds in the final, where ten swimmers started the premiere instead of the usual eight.
Bousquet defeated Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russian Sergei Fesikov (20.84), but failed to break the world record (20.30), as he predicted.
We can always dream of something better, but I said that if the world record is within my reach, I will try it.
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers wore polyurethane suits, which will be banned from 1 January.
The overalls have helped 238 world records since February 2008 and their era ends in Istanbul, which was the first to host the same competition in 1999.
The use of the overalls this time did not help even the Germans, Paul Biedermann, the double world champion in the large pool in the summer in Rome, who had a world record at his fingertips.
The young swimmer failed to break the 400m freestyle record (3:32.77) but still won with the second fastest time in his career (3:34.55), ahead of Russian racer Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and Danish Mads Glaesner (3:36.82)
I didn't put everything in that race.
I knew I wouldn’t beat the world record this time, but I managed to defend my title and I did my job.
Lobintsev will be a serious rival in the future, Biedermann explained.
U.S.: Zola's Roman sarcophagus plate auctioned for $1.5 million
A Romance sarcophagus that belonged to no one but French writer Emil Zola was auctioned for $1.5 million on Thursday, significantly more than was estimated, Sotheby's art dealer said.
The price of this two-meter long and 63-cm-tall windscreen, dating from the third century AD, was estimated at $150,000 to $250,000.
The marble "representing four Dionysian scenes in a sophisticated architectural decor, surrounded by satire and bakchantas is a rare work, there are very few such pieces in the world, maybe four or five," Florent Heintz, vice-president of Egypt and vice-president of the ancient auction, told AFP on Tuesday.
The work was sold among a hundred others.
The sale is still underway, but it is probably the subject that has been the most popular, Sotheby’s spokesman Dan Abernethy told AFP.
The fact that Emile Zola bought this marble was discovered a few days ago.
The board was in Rome for almost 300 years in the famous collection of the Borgia family and then gradually appeared with the French actress Cecile Sorel, who decorated with it a bathtub in her private hotel in Paris and with Paul Reynaud, Minister of the Third Republic in France and briefly the President of the Council before him.
It remained in the shadows for about fifty years.
Florent Heintz found out from a search of the Louvre museum's database that the plaque was part of the "remains of Emil Zola" opened since 1903, a year after the death of the author of "Therese Raquin" and the fresco "Rougon-Macquart".
An interrupted attempt by President Zelaya to leave Honduras for Mexico.
Mexico on Thursday ruled that the conditions for the transfer of the ousted president of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, to whom the rebels refused to provide a guarantee of a safe departure were not met.
“After a telephone conversation I had with President Zelaya last night, everything so far suggests that there is no way to implement this transfer,” Mexican Foreign Minister Patricia Espinosa said.
A Mexican government plane that flew to El Salvador for President Zelaya on Wednesday flew back, a source at the DG Migration said.
The government of the Putschists wanted to force President Zelaya to "demise" and to apply for political asylum abroad, only in this way would it give him the opportunity to leave safely.
But the ousted president rejected these demands because he wanted to go to Mexico as the head of state in exile.
The government of the Putschists "has experienced another failure when it wanted me to resign from my office ... they wanted me to resign," Zelaya told Globo radio on Thursday, in which he often spoke about the political crisis that has lasted for five months in this Central American country.
I can stay here for ten years, I have my guitar here, added the deposed president, hidden in the Brazilian embassy in Tegucigalpa for two and a half months and played a few chords.
The Mexican embassy has asked us to provide a guarantee for safe transportation, but unfortunately we cannot accept it because it does not contain an asylum request, Interior Minister Oscar Raul Matute told HRN radio on Wednesday.
"I will not ask any country for asylum," Zelaya told Telesur station in Caracas.
“If I ever leave Honduras, I will leave as president of the people of Honduras,” he said.
Rumors of Zelaya’s departure mobilized supporters of the ousted president who came to gather around the Brazilian embassy, where the army reinforced protection.
Brazil’s Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticized the government’s stance.
They are showing their marginal attitude towards international norms, he added.
Zelaya, who was close to Venezuela’s socialist president Hugo Chavez, was overthrown on June 28, the day he organized a public consultation in preparation for his re-election against the recommendations of the Supreme Court, the army and Congress.
He unexpectedly returned from exile in Costa Rica on September 21 and found refuge at the Brazilian embassy.
If he gets out of here, he will be arrested and held accountable for the crime of “betrayal” of which he is accused, the coup government says.
President Roberto Micheletti was able to hold a presidential election to replace President Zelaya on November 29.
In the controversial elections, recognized by the United States but condemned by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil, Porfirio Lobo won.
Three days later, Congress voted against President Zelaya’s return to power until the end of his term on January 27.
Wall Street rises, U.S. trade balance spurs optimism
The New York Stock Exchange ended Thursday with an increase, and the results of the US trade balance show an increase in both the United States and its partners: the Dow Jones gained 0.67% and the Nasdaq 0.33%.
According to the final closing data, the Dow Jones Industrial Average improved from 68.78 points to 10,405.83 points and the Nasdaq, with a technological dominance from 7.13 points to 2190.06 points.
The Standard & Poor 500 index improved by 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1102.35 points.
We have good news coming from different parts of the economy, commented Lindsey Piegz of FTN Financial.
But we can't take it too seriously, she added, because the market focuses on "half a full glass".
For Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners, investors are focusing primarily on the US trade balance sheet figures, “which show that activity is improving in the fourth quarter.”
The U.S. trade deficit fell 7.6% in October compared to September, to $32.9 billion.
Analysts, on the other hand, expected an increase in the deficit.
There was an increase in both imports and exports.
“Great news is the growing volume of trade, especially exports of goods, reflecting the growth of the economies of major U.S. trading partners,” said Christopher Cornell of the research firm Economy.com.
However, in the United States last week unemployment rose against all expectations and the number of job applicants reached 474,000.
But over the past four weeks, the average number of new job seekers has fallen “to the lowest this year,” said Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The stock market has also fallen.
The yield of the state treasury with a 10-year outlook increased to 3.482% from 3.423% on Tuesday evening and the yield to 30 lets grew to 4.492% from 4.408% the day before.
Cuba: Hundreds of supporters of the regime whispered "Ladies in White"
Several hundred supporters of the Cuban regime whispered on Thursday the wives of political prisoners who met in Havana on the occasion of World Human Rights Day and prevented another demonstration to which dozens of dissidents were arrested.
Around forty "Lady in white", wives or close political prisoners were blasted directly on the street by supporters of the Raul Castro regime as they marched towards the center of the capital with a demand for the release of political prisoners, the journalist reported.
Away with the Yankees!, "Soldiers!", "The streets belong to revolutionaries!", "Long live Fidel and Raul!", the regime's supporters chanted with a raised fist at the dissidents.
The dissidents were eventually escorted by civilians who arrived "to ensure security".
The day before, a similar demonstration took place in Havana against "Ladies in White", but there were no injuries or arrests.
But in Havana’s Vedado district, about ten dissidents were detained in civilian custody by police, who were also preparing to protest on Thursday on the occasion of World Human Rights Day, AFP reported.
According to the reporter, the police charged dissidents who were fired by supporters of the government regime into civilian vehicles using force.
Arrest of dissidents under similar conditions usually lasts only a few hours.
The winner of the 2005 Sakharov Prize of the European Parliament, "Ladies in White", organized an unauthorized march to "release all, according to dissent, about 200 political prisoners", said one of their leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband Hector Maceda is serving a 20-year prison sentence.
Mr. Maceda is one of a group of 75 Cuban dissidents arrested in March 2003, of whom 53 are still behind bars.
The Cuban authorities consider the opponents to be "mercenaries" or "agents" paid by their main enemy, the United States.
A complete miracle, Cuban television reported on Thursday's demonstration of government supporters against "revolutionaries".
Cuba, led by the Communist Party and one-party government, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of disrespecting human rights and freedoms, including freedom of speech.
A madman stabbed an 80-year-old man and wounded five people in Clichy-la-Garenne.
A man armed with two knives killed an eighty-year-old man and wounded five others in the town of Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine) at the peak on Thursday afternoon.
According to preliminary results of the investigation, the 28-year-old attacker allegedly attacked two knives and for unknown reasons an 80-year-old man in the pharmacy or in front of it, at 85 Boulevard Jean-Jaures, this is the version of the police and witnesses.
A severely injured old gentleman, born in 1929, died in hospital from the consequences of injuries, according to the Alliance police syndicate.
In this pharmacy or in front of it, the attacker attacked the pregnant woman and her partner.
At the age of thirty, the husband began to defend himself and was injured.
The first two seriously injured victims were admitted to the same hospital where an 80-year-old man died.
The life of the second wounded is in danger, according to police sources, vital organs have been affected.
The pregnant woman then collapsed and was taken to the hospital "in shock," a police source said.
An armed man who was apparently under the influence of alcohol or drugs, according to a police source, then fled to the street, still on Boulevard Jean Jaurès.
He wounded two more people, apparently by accident: a thirty-year-old and a forty-year-old man, the other seriously.
How this all happened is not entirely clear, as it all happened in the evening.
He was armed with two butcher's knives, which he carried with a cross behind his back, said Arnaud Presse, head of the Alliance syndicate in Hauts-de-Seine.
Several passers-by, including young people, have attempted to stop and disarm the madmen, according to witnesses gathered by AFP.
I saw a 30-year-old guy in a green jacket.
Three young men tried to catch him.
They failed because he was quite strong, Alberto, a waiter from a nearby bar, commented on the situation.
He was overthrown by a crowd, including a city policeman who broke his wrist.
Still on Boulevard Jean-Jaures, at level 61, two city police officers, including their commander, attempted to detain an armed man while being injured with their fists, a police source said.
The incident took place in one of the main streets in Clichy-la-Garenne, where many shops are located.
Passengers came to tell me there's an injured person outside.
“I went out and saw a seventy-year-old man on the ground, I put him in a safe place and I noticed big wounds on his abdomen,” Frederic Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist, told AFP.
Five minutes later, a second, about thirty-year-old person arrived, who also had stab wounds with a knife.
A man who did not have his identity papers was later arrested by the state police.
The Attorney General in Nanterre handed the case over to the Hauts-de-Seine Regional Police Investigation Department (SDPJ 92).
The suspect was taken to the hospital on Thursday night.
He's in custody awaiting interrogation.
The police source did not rule out his placement in a psychiatric hospital.
Another police source said six police officers were needed to handle him at the police station in Clichy, where he was transported.
He was "completely out of his mind" as "all the madmen of this type, whose strength in action increases tenfold".
USA: Polanski's lawyer again calls for end of criminal prosecution
A lawyer for Polish-French director Roman Polanski again requested Thursday in Los Angeles (California, west of the United States) to stop prosecution of his client, who is currently in his Swiss residence because of the moral affair that took place before.
Chad Hummel, the lawyer for the director of the film "The Pianist" criticized three judges of the Second District Court of Appeal in California for serious mistakes that occurred during the trial at the time of the events in 1977.
“I demand that the prosecution be stopped now and immediately,” Hummel said, adding that Laurence Rittenband was “frozen in his back by the behavior of the judge who ruled the case at the time.”
According to him, the judge (who had already died in the meantime) was supposed to deal with the prosecutor before the verdict, who told him that Roman Polanski deserves to go to jail – a serious violation of the rule of law.
Information about this interview appeared in the document "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" (Roman Polanski, sought and desired), from the mouth of the Prosecutor himself, David Wells.
But Mr. Wells finally declared at the end of September that he had "lied" to the author of the document.
In the event that the court refuses to stop the criminal proceedings, Hummel’s lawyer will request a trial to which he will be able to provide evidence of his claim.
The plaintiff reiterated what had already been said in the first state, namely that there would be no serious examination of the request for the cessation of criminal prosecution until Roman Polanski appeared before the court.
The 76-year-old director fled the United States in 1978 before a court ruled in a case of “illegal sexual intercourse” with a 13-year-old girl.
Since then, he has never entered the United States again.
Los Angeles Deputy Prosecutor Phyllis Asayam said Roman Polanski "should be there to attend a trial."
In this case, we want to inform not only Roman Polaski, but also other defendants that it is possible to escape? asks Mrs Asayam.
He said the filmmaker "requests a favor from the court and at the same time despises his authority."
One of the three judges, who now have 90 days to make a decision, also stressed that "there are other alternatives to the escape".
Attorney Hummel was not the only one who demanded the cessation of Roman Polanski’s criminal prosecution.
The victim’s legal representative, Samantha Geimer, also once again called for an end to the prosecution.
She recalled that her client would no longer tolerate the perpetual harassment every time the Polanski case emerged, adding: “No one in this room can say that the process was fair.”
Thirty-two years is enough.”
Roman Polanski was arrested on September 26 in Switzerland on the orders of the United States.
After more than two months behind bars, he was released to house arrest in his cottage in Gstaad, where he is awaiting possible deportation.
Wall Street ends with no direction, is hampered by rising dollar
The New York Stock Exchange ended without direction on Friday, the market bounced between indicators that are better than expected in the US and the rising price of the dollar: the Dow Jones gained +0.63%, but the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to data from the final closing, the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced from 65.67 points to 10,471.50 points and the Nasdaq, with a technological dominance, dropped 0.55 points to finish at 2,190.31.
The Standard & Poor's 500 Index rose from 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1,106.41 points.
To be honest, the market is very calm, said Mace Blicksilver of Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains in a narrow range, the volume of trade has decreased significantly and I think it will remain so until the end of the year.
This trend was also confirmed by the publication of economic indicators that are better than expected and that "helped improve the market mood in terms of stability of the economic recovery," said analyst Charles Schwab.
Retail sales in the U.S. rose 1.3% in November for the second month in a row, much more than expected.
According to a preliminary estimate by the University of Michigan Index, U.S. consumer confidence has also returned, rising sharply in December to 73.4 versus 67.4 in the previous month.
However, the indices were hampered by a new dollar price hike against the euro, which is the highest in the last two months, which "presses down sectors sensitive to the economic situation," Deutsche Bank's Owen Fitzpatrick said.
Technological actions thus lose ground under their feet.
The stock market has fallen.
The yield of the state treasury with a 10-year outlook rose to 3,540% from 3.482% on Wednesday evening and with a 30-year outlook it rose to 4.497% from 4.492% the day before.
Miss World is back in South Africa.
After a month-long journey across South Africa, 112 Miss World nominees are set to cross the line on Saturday to achieve their dream of being elected the most beautiful woman in the world in front of a billion television viewers.
This great celebration of beauty was already held for the second year in the vicinity of Johannesburg, and so far five candidates have been promoted to the semi-finals.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta from Mexico, Mariata Kargbo from Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gilbratar and Yanbing Mao from Canada were chosen during their African stay Miss Sport or Miss Top Model.
It was a real twist of events.
It was amazing to visit beautiful cities like Port Elizabeth, Durban or Cape Town.
“I’ve seen so many things, and I’ve had so many experiences,” said Miss Sierry Leone.
The competition, which takes place in South Africa at the ninth hour, will be broadcast live from Midrand, in the north of Johannesburg, from 5 p.m.
I couldn't have dreamed of a more beautiful country where I could plant a crown.
It was a fascinating experience.
I am happy to have experienced it twice, confided Miss World Ksenia Sukhin, in the hot southern summer.
For the young Russia, her second stay in the South African Republic was in the spirit of numerous meetings with other candidates and the new discovery of the country and its "country that breathes out".
After a month of performances, rehearsals, press and safari, Miss is now focusing on the competition itself.
Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to follow in the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, elected in 2000, who also participates in the election of Aishwarya Rai, the 1994 winners who both became Bollywood stars.
Being crowned as the most beautiful woman in the world is every woman’s dream, but it’s not just about appearance.
We are the ambassadors of our countries and I want to come home with the crown, says Miss India with a wide smile.
According to the organizers, the 59th year will be held in the spirit of music and dance.
The candidates will be presented in traditional costumes and, of course, in swimsuits.
The show will be hosted by Chinese TV presenter Angela Chow, former South African beauty queen Michelle McLean and Miss World Committee chairman Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that it can welcome the world with a warmth that is difficult to cope with, said Julia Morley, President of the Miss World Competition.
Like last year, the candidates took part in a safari, visited the famous town of Soweto, this time by bike, and tasted the local cuisine.
An extraordinary event was a meeting with South African President Jacob Zuma, who shook their hand.
Unusual for the president, said Miss Sierry Leone.
Undoubtedly, the most beautiful memory will remain the draw in Cape Town (in the southwest of the country) for the World Cup, which will be held in June 2010, and which helped the country to support the event a little more.
I was able to meet people I never dreamed of.
I’m sure I’ll be back for the 2010 World Cup,” said Miss Italy Alice Taticchio.
According to David's son, reports of Hallyday's condition are "very positive".
News of Johnny Hallyday's condition is "very positive," as his son David assured us on his Friday arrival at Los Angeles airport, where he flew to visit his father, who has been hospitalized for several days.
The news is very positive.
He is very strong and everything is going very well, said David Hallyday on board the plane he flew from Paris shortly after 1 p.m. local time (21 p.m. world time).
The singer's son, who acted calmly, said he would "as soon as possible" arrive at Cedars-Sina<0xC3><0xAF> hospital in Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday was admitted on Monday for a postoperative infection caused by a heated intervertebral platelet surgery he underwent on Nov. 26.
According to a press release, the singer was "brought into an artificial sleep" for comfort in Los Angeles, which is intended to prevent pain and facilitate treatment.
Johnny Hallyday was already put to sleep by doctors at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles. The hospitalization was due to an infection after surgery of the heated intervertebral disc performed on November 26 in Paris.
Due to the serious damage caused by this intervention, the singer had to be re-operated from Wednesday to Thursday night.
According to the AFP photographer, his wife Laeticia attended a school performance at the French Lyceum in Los Angeles on Friday morning, attended by their daughter Jade.
Yves Catoné, head of the orthopedic surgery and traumatology department at the Pitié-Salpêtrière hospital, said he was flying to Los Angeles on Monday.
The producer strongly accused Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, a neurosurgeon who operated on the singer on November 26 at the Clinique internationale du parc Monceau in Paris.
They told us it was a massacre.
Los Angeles surgeons said they were upset, Camus said.
I heard about the possibility of a future trial, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus believes that Johnny Hallyday "did go too fast to Los Angeles with the permission of his Parisian surgeon".
I personally spoke to the doctor on the phone and he assured me that this trip was not a problem, which surprised me greatly, since I myself had already suffered from intervertebral disc hemorrhage twice, he added.
Shortly before, on RTL radio, he said that the singer apparently flew off after the Paris operation without a drone, without anything.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is very well known in artistic circles.
He operated on actress Maria Trintignant in Vilnius a few days before her death at the clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine, where he worked at the time.
In 2007, he also operated on actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to remove a hematoma caused by a brain haemorrhage.
However, he is also a doctor with a dark reputation, several times convicted in cases of negligence in medical care, for tax evasion and fraud.
Olivier Metzner, a lawyer for the medical chamber, called him a “scrupulous man” who is “regularly” summoned before the medical chamber and cannot even be “recommended by far”.
After several days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux spoke about the matter through his lawyer David Koubbi on Friday.
He said the procedure was "absolutely good" and that the post-operative examination was "normal".
The operation was not of a hemorrhagic nature, so the introduction of the drain was not necessary," he added.
The singer's health problems have been increasing since this summer and in any case, his next tour seems to remain with a question mark.
It is clear that the date for the resumption of the planned tour on January 8 (in Amiens) seems too close, Camus said.
The UDF raises the tone and urges the Nouveau Centre party not to continue using their abbreviation.
The UDF, controlled by MoDemFrançois Bayrou, responded on Friday to the attempt by the president of the Nouveau Centre, Hervé Morin, to seize the abbreviation of the former Giscard's party, saying it should not be used in any media under threat of prosecution.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to take the abbreviation UDF with the fact that François Bayra does not deserve to bear her legacy after giving his hand to the left.
The defense minister, whose party is a partner of the UMP, had planned to confirm this strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the Nouveau Centre (NC).
This move was supported by a member of Parliament, Hervé de Charetta (formerly UMP now NC), who attributes ownership to the UDF brand, having first registered it in 2004 with the National Institute of Industrial Property (l'Institut national de la propriété industrielle).
But on Friday evening, a committee of the Association of UDF-led friends of François Bayrou, who do not intend to be expropriated, stepped out of their silence and made a formal request to the minister and MPs to stop using the abbreviation and return ownership of the trademark, under the threat of criminal law.
In recent days, you have increased the alarming statements that you will propose to your political movement to take over the abbreviation UDF, writes the Association in its letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the committee, including, for example, François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez from the Centre Jean Arthui or Senator AlDem.
At the same time, you considered it appropriate to place on your promotional materials and on the welcome website of your movement the name +Nouveau centre+, with the slogan +UDF today+, also note the signatories of the letter.
As you are aware, you have no right to use this abbreviation, the UDF committee explains, which requests the NC movement "immediately remove all mentions of the UDF name from all promotional materials including (its) website".
At the same time, he asks Hervé de Charette "to hand over ownership of the trademark to the legitimate owners".
If you do not, we will appeal to the courts to respect the law and the legitimate rights of UDF members, the signatories warn.
In their letter, they state that the UDF "has been a full-fledged political movement since 1978" and recall that Mr. Morin and his friends "chose" to leave in 2007 "to form a competitive movement, like others in 2002, to establish the UMP.
According to them, the Nouveau centre movement has no right to use the abbreviation UDF (Union pour la démocratie française).
At the same time, they recall that the last UDF congress voted in 2007 to join the MoDem for a three-year term and to create a committee charged with defending the "moral and material interests" of the association founded by Valery Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, the committee continues, "when he registered the trade mark", he was not "for three years a member of the UDF", but of the UMP.
In a scandalous and fraudulent way, he used the non-existent registration of the acronym to do so on his own account.
This impoliteness begins to turn into a crime, they declare, and then, ironically, they express themselves to the NC strategy: "It seems to us that it is more valuable to make a name for yourself, both in politics and in everyday life, than to step out of the anonymity by deceiving the name."
The case of Liliane Bettencourt: François-Marie Banier will be tried for abuse of the state of weakness.
On Friday, a court in Nanterre decided to sue the artist Françoise-Marie Banier and rule on whether he took advantage of the weakness of the 80-year-old billionaire to make her lose part of her fortune, blamed by her daughter Liliane Bettencourt.
A 62-year-old photographer, known for his photographs of celebrities, will be tried on 15 and 16 April 2010 for abuse of the state of weakness, a crime punishable by a maximum sentence of 3 years and a fine of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>375,000.
This decision confirms that there will indeed be a trial in a case that can be described as the family saga of one of the richest families in France, in which a mother and daughter attack each other and fight for the control of the cosmetic empire of L'Oréal.
However, the 15th criminal court also ordered a medical examination of 87-year-old Liliana Bettencourt, which was to be conducted by a college of three doctors.
The heir and principal shareholder of L’Oréal has always refused to undergo such an investigation, certainly not under the conditions offered by the Attorney General’s Office in Nanterre during the investigation.
Physicians to be elected on Friday should prepare a report by March 10, 2010, while also stating whether Liliana Bettencourt could have been in a state of weakness, and in what period.
I think she's going to go through with it.
"I'll talk to her about the matter," Mrs. Bettencourt's lawyer, Georges Kiejman, said after the hearing.
As for Francois Bettencourt-Meyers' lawyer, Olivier Metzner, he welcomed the court's decision.
It's an excellent news (...). Experts will show that this old lady, who needs protection, has been manipulated (M. Banier), confirmed.
It’s been two years since Liliana Bettencourt’s only daughter launched criminal proceedings against François-Marie Banier, a photographer and omni-artist whom she blames for years of using her mother’s state of weakness to earn a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1 billion gift in the form of checks, life insurance contracts or paintings.
Liliane Bettencourt has always refused to be manipulated by a photographer she considers a long-term friend.
While the court had to assess the validity of Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers’ lawsuit, Friday’s lawyers’ court speech changed at times into a family truth hour.
Attorney Liliana Bettencourt submitted three letters that his client (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) sent to her notary, in which she expressed her mistrust towards her husband Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers.
In a 2003 letter, Liliane Bettencourt added, "Could you explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier once or twice a day for fifteen years.
Since I got married, I’ve never been able to talk to Françoise.”
The Prosecutor’s Office in Nanterre once again found that the complainant’s actions were not justified, not least because the guardian judge had rejected her request to open proceedings to issue legal protection for her mother in these days.
Liliane Bettencourt "is fully capable of taking part in the trial, not under protection or guardianship.
No one else will be acting for her,” said Marie-Christine Daubigney, the prosecutor’s office’s representative.
In the end, the court ruled that Ms Bettencourt-Meyers’ legitimacy was to be expressed at the time of the opening of the proceedings.
The Management Revolution or the End of Economic Intelligence?
If nothing changes in the management of the great French companies, our struggle for the development of economic intelligence has been futile...
For more than a decade, the behavior of the management of large companies towards employees has been reminiscent of the approach of companies to consumers before the marketing revolution: it is about the employees identifying themselves with the "values" determined from the mountain, as it was before, when consumers had to impose the products that came from the ideas of the technicians.
With the customer becoming the center of business, the marketing revolution has compared the strategy of conquering the market in the right direction...even though authoritarian efforts to impose products other than customer preferences are returning regularly!
The passive attitude of employees can lead to fatal demoralization.
Suicides in France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only a visible part of a much more widespread general phenomenon that affects mostly managerial staff.
This demobilization adversely affects the development of all intellectual functions of society, including research and development, and more importantly, economic intelligence.
Indeed, the EI "requires an active approach and predictability from all stakeholders (...) and requires commitments from employees that are completely contrary to the revenues of authoritarian management.
Therefore, we call for a management revolution, which should aim to put workers at the center of interest of the company as well as the client.
The relative usefulness of internal public opinion surveys.
Will internal opinion polls – as a questionnaire submitted to Orange employees – contribute to a revolution in management practices?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
Mainly because I have already convinced myself that in the face of a new situation, the structure will return to what it has always done... after different turns!
Furthermore, because authoritarianism, as one of the pathologies of power, increases in proportion to the severity of one’s own failures.
Finally, because most managers have a simplified view of human behavior.
Because they are graduates of colleges for engineers, they have a mechanical interpretation of psychology.
For the sake of thought convenience, they are adopting an old behaviorist theory, now revived by US “neurology” and widely disseminated without greater knowledge by scientific institutes and the media.
With the possibility of moving the “levers” (sic) of the involvement of managers, a recent survey by the agency Ipsos on the site Figaro.fr, which only strengthens the managers in their position of mechanical control, unsuitable for today’s world.
Identify and measure mobilization factors.
On the contrary, the management revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern enterprises presupposes the adoption of the final vision of human behavior.
It consists in incorporating a basic observation into all management intentions and practices: For employees, commitments to the company will only be possible if they appear to be a clear means of achieving their dreams, ambitions and projects.
Currently, this concept of employee motivation is dealt with only studies of Motivational Functional Analysis.
These studies showed that they evaluate their businesses on the basis of a predetermined doxy, which allows them, through the image that speaks about the company, to evaluate what it offers them to achieve their life goals.
By identifying and measuring these mobilization factors, managers can monitor, predict and anticipate their “social performance” and put their human resources management “on the right track”.
This creates a fertile soil for the development of solid and efficient economic intelligence.
The Oslo speech: “A just war” has earned Obama praise from the right.
On Friday, the American right welcomed a speech delivered by Barack Obama the day before in Oslo, delighted that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize winner was defending the concept of a “just war” against the enemies of the United States.
The Conservatives, who initially ridiculed Obama’s award on October 9, applauded the presidential speech this time, including Sarah Palin, the former vice presidential candidate in the 2008 election.
I liked what he said, Palin, a right-wing Republican muse, told USA Today, adding that she herself expressed herself on the subject of the “sometimes necessary” war in her memoirs, which are just coming out.
Of course, war is the last thing Americans would like to have at work, but it is necessary.
All terrorists must be detained, he believes.
President Obama, who inherited two wars in Afghanistan and Iraq from his predecessor, George W. Bush, on Thursday in Oslo, justified the deployment of forces and used a speech to clarify his decision to send another 30,000 troops to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, said the president had done “very good work” in Oslo.
I think the speech was really very good, congratulated the former Speaker of the House of Representatives, who especially appreciated the President's mention of "the existence of evil in the world".
In my own way, I considered this speech to be completely historic, Gingrich said during an interview on the radio show "The Takeaway".
A former MP, considered by some to be a possible Republican candidate in the 2012 presidential election, was thrilled to see the “left president” remind members of the Nobel Committee, “that they themselves would not be free and could not hand over the prize for peace if the use of force did not exist.”
According to Michael Gerson, former speech author George W. Bush, now editor of the Washington Post, Obama delivered a “very American speech.”
Not only did he portray himself as a “world citizen” as always, but “he spoke like an American president” and reminded Europeans “that they live in a safe bubble that they did not create themselves and that they don’t do too much to preserve it,” Gerson said.
Few dissatisfied right-wingers include the Bush-era hawk, former U.N. ambassador John Bolton, who called the speech “uniform, swollen and uninspired,” as he stated on the National Review Online website.
To the left of the president, for example, Democratic representative Dennis Kucinich is horrified to see Barack Obama justifying the use of force.
"If we wrap war in the package of justice, we can easily justify the massacre of innocent people," he warned.
However, the middle-left press holds a commendable position towards the president.
Although the Los Angeles Times still considers Obama’s awarding of the Peace Prize premature, it has valued his output as a “superior” even for a speaker known for his talent.
The Oslo speech should serve as a guide to international decisions in conflict resolution, in the fight against poverty and oppression," the California newspaper said.
Obama “pronounced the speech as needed,” the New York Times said, describing the speech as “simple and instructive.”
Road transporters: three marathons to a deal that will save the supply of supplies at Christmas.
After three negotiating marathons, road transport unions and TLF, the only employers’ organisation that remained until the end, came to an agreement on Friday night that ended the call for a strike and the threat that hung over the supply of supplies for Christmas.
Secretary of State for Transport, Dominique Bussereau, expressed "joy" at the signing of the agreement on Friday, after several negotiations that began on Wednesday morning.
After the second night of discussions, the negotiators broke up early Friday morning in the hope that the text of the agreement would be signed as soon as possible by the end of the morning.
Despite the fact that three employers’ organisations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) resigned.
But it took more than six hours for the meeting, which began at 11 o’clock, for everyone to agree and for the agreement to be signed at 18 o’clock.
This conflict "would greatly harm businesses" and "would threaten to disrupt the holidays at the end of the year," Bussereau said.
The text contains an increase in wages of 4% for the lowest wages (local and regional road transport) and of 2.9% for the highest wages (international transport).
The hourly wage at the lowest wages increases from EUR 8.72 to EUR 9.06.
It is not much, but there is a lot of effort behind it, Patrice Clos (FO) explained.
Tonight, we're going to give our members a command to avoid blockades, no blockades of supply centers.
But there may be a few more opponents who are not satisfied," he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of TLF, welcomed the "right deal", although it was difficult to admit the increase in high wages due to international competition.
According to him, there will be an increase of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC> 170 per month for the lowest wages and of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC> 100 to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC> 120 for the highest wages.
It is a common sense agreement and respect for employees, CMaxime Dumont (CFDT) said, while Thierry Douine (CFTC) welcomed the "historic agreement".
According to Richard Jaubert (CGT), this is an "acceptable compromise".
The agreement also envisages a 3% revaluation of travel expenses and a report on the state of road transport in the first half of 2010, which will also allow focus on the question of the 13th salary and the modernisation of the collective agreement.
Bussereau recalled the "100 million euro reduction in corporate income taxes" that was the subject of a government amendment to the 2009 budget bill, which was voted overnight by the National Assembly from Thursday to Friday.
The government will ask the Senate for an "agreed" vote.
The signature allows that this agreement will apply first to the enterprises that are members of this organization, later to the whole field, in case of extension by the Ministry of Labour.
It will take place “in the shortest possible time,” Bussereau said.
The whole process can only be hampered by the disapproval of employers’ organizations.
The FNTR calls it a “bad trade” since <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million “has already been offered to the sector as part of the carbon tax compensation”.
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to an emergency meeting not as a result of mutual analysis, but in order not to anger turkey eaters during the coming Christmas holidays, Unostra complained.
For Otre, the agreement threatens to "bury a large number of small and medium-sized enterprises in the industry" in the next 12 months.
Suburban trains RER A: traffic disruption on weekends, trade unions dissatisfied with the proposals of the RATP transport company.
The disruption of the RER A suburban train line, which is France’s largest urban public transport line, will continue over the weekend, as Friday’s talks between the trade unions and the RATP leadership on the second day of the strike did not lead to any concrete results in terms of the premium application.
On Saturdays and Sundays, i.e. the days of an important shopping weekend before Christmas, trains will only travel between 10 a.m. and 8 p.m., on the main section (between La Défense and Nation) there will be every other train, outside this section only one train out of four.
Connection with SNCF will be discontinued in Nanterre Préfecture and passengers will be forced to switch to another train.
The Galeries Lafayette, which expects more than 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that "RATP was trying to secure connections with large retailers".
The RER A line leads from west to east of the Paris agglomeration.
The RATP managed section leads from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, one train out of two was in peak operation and virtually no set was going off-peak at the time as planned.
As on Thursday, residents of Ile de France arranged differently and there was no confusion on the platforms.
So early in the morning there were much fewer people at the station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) than usual, among other things also because of the lack of pupils and students.
Jack Nbakina, an engineer, 29 years old from Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne) explained that he got up "an hour and a half early to be sure he would arrive on time".
The Saint-Lazare train station was not overcrowded, the SNCF State Railways reported, as a larger number of establishments and security guards were predicted.
Suburban trains RER A operated by SNCF in the direction of or to Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or departed from Saint-Lazare station with a connection to the metro.
Further general meetings of the strikers will be held on Saturday and Sunday, on which the results of Friday afternoon's meeting with the leadership will be evaluated, which the unions rated as "weak".
The RER management proposes negotiations on a special protocol for RER A suburban trains on all sides, adjustment of working hours, career course, etc.
However, this is not the case for drivers who claim the merited premium, according to Thierry Garon (South).
RATP has even postponed proposals for the premium so far, aggravating the CGT with the fact that the management "was not able to solve the problem, while travel carriers and SNCF were able to do so".
The new meeting, which is scheduled for Monday, will "review the conditions of the exercise of the profession more closely," the RATP transport companies said.
That’s why unions think the company “makes weekend travelers fun.”
In the morning, about 150 drivers were occupied by a company committee at his Paris headquarters.
The leadership, which had so far rejected any discussion during the strike, therefore decided to hold a meeting in the interest of "calm down".
There is a risk that the conflict will spread to the RER B line on Tuesday, after Unsa and Independent announce strike alerts.
Trade unions are demanding a premium of 120 (Unsa) to 150 euros, of which 30 euros are variables (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud (South), Indépendants (Independents)) and are complicate the deteriorating working conditions on this line, which transports a million passengers daily.
RER suburban train drivers earn <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2200 to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2700 gross wages and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>600 to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>650 premiums for non-regular working hours and for working on Sundays and holidays.
Turkish justice has dissolved for the Kurdish side and this decision has severe consequences.
The Turkish Constitutional Court on Friday ruled on the abolition of the main pro-Kurdish party in the country. This decision prompted protests in the Kurdish community in the south-east of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision can greatly complicate the task of the government, which is trying to give the Kurdish community a friendly hand and try to end 25 years of conflict.
The Democratic Society Party (DTP) was dissolved because it became a "nest of activities threatening the independence of the state and its indivisible unity," Supreme Court President Hasim Kilic told reporters after four days of talks.
The decision was taken unanimously by 11 judges, when a majority of seven votes was needed to dissolve the party, Kiliç said, adding that 37 party cadres, including its president Ahmet Türk and MEP Aysela Tuglukova, were banned from participating in political life for five years.
The judge also announced the lifting of the parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Mr Türk and Mrs Tugluk and the confiscation of the party's assets by the Ministry of Finance.
The DTP has 21 seats in Parliament (out of 500).
The party’s leadership had already warned before the verdict that MPs would rather leave Parliament than act as MPs without political affiliation.
The decision is a continuation of a trial initiated in 2007 by the prosecutor of the Court of Cassation, Abdurrahman Yalcinkay, who accuses the DTP of obeying the "orders" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which Ankara and many countries consider a terrorist organization.
Many observers are convinced that the DTP is the legal political showcase of the PKK rebels.
The party says it has no “basic connection” with the PKK, but refuses to label it a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The court’s verdict comes at a time when the government lends a friendly hand to the Kurdish community and offers a series of measures to strengthen their rights and tries to limit the support of the Kurds towards the PKK and thus end the conflict.
The DTP leadership confirmed that the dissolution of the party could lead to renewed tensions in southeastern Anatolia, where many demonstrations in recent weeks have distorted the conditions under which PKK leader Abdullah <0xC3><0x96>calan is detained in clashes with police.
Since the announcement of the justice decision, thousands of protesters have gathered outside the DTP headquarters in Diyarbakir, a large city in the southeast inhabited mostly by Kurds.
Police used tear grenades and water cannons, while protesters threw Molotov cocktails or fired stones from the cracks.
Hundreds of people also protested in Istanbul.
After the verdict, Türk said that the decision of justice only "deepens despair".
Turkey cannot resolve the issue (of the Kurds) by banning the party, he said in a statement.
The government, formed by a party from the Islamist movement, also condemned the decision.
We are in principle against interference.
There is no solution, Energy Minister Taner Yildiz said.
This decision is a complete blow to the democratic proposals initiated by the government, commented political scientist Ahmet Insel.
Of course, we can expect a reaction from the PKK, he added.
On Thursday, the PKK reported on one of the deadliest attacks in northern Turkey that killed seven soldiers three days earlier.
The snow can come
A nice crunchy winter, that's what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
Not because he wants to harass citizens, says the head of the winter department of technical services of the FES.
But in order for his employees to be able to test and learn to control all the vehicle technology.
This could happen for the first time this weekend, according to meteorologists.
More than 300 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to take care of snow and ice.
The ESF is proceeding according to a precise plan.
As soon as it snows in Frankfurt and the temperatures drop below zero, they will go on 20 so-called sections of the A giant spill, Brauburger explains.
These sections include main and passageways such as the Neue Weg and the Hanauer Landstraße.
But also arrivals for firefighters, suburban public transport lines, pedestrian zones and sections with descents such as the Atzelbergstraße.
The FES service starts at 3 a.m.
If necessary, it is necessary to sprinkle moist salt within a maximum of three hours, which holds better, something about 1040 kilometers.
Therefore, the FES starts at three o'clock at night, "to keep the roads clear when the transport to work starts".
It's not easy when it starts snowing until 7:30.
Then we have a problem, says the head of the winter technical services department, "because no one is willing to make room for the scavengers."
Only when it does not snow so much, there are a number of arrival and connecting roads, including Rat-Beil-Straße.
The last priority is the side and side roads.
Brauburger knows they'll be complaining.
At five o'clock in the morning, the FES pedestrians leave for the road, preferring to clean dangerous places and crossings.
The FES usually cannot take care of all cycle paths.
There is a special service in Frankfurt that monitors mainly bridges from 22 to 4.30, says Brauburger.
As the glacier quickly forms on them, the sprinklers leave immediately as soon as the temperature drops below two degrees.
If necessary, the police will also call.
Dinosaur cradle
Tawa hallae looked like a lot of other carnivorous dinosaurs: an animal two meters long and 1.50 meters high ran along two strong hind limbs, had an elongated skull with sharp, curved teeth, short front limbs with spiky claws and claws.
If this species lived a few million years later, there would be nothing extraordinary.
Sterling Nesbitt of the University of Texas at Austin and colleagues write in the Thursday issue of Science magazine that Tawa hallae was one of the first dinosaurs with these bodily features.
The animal lived about 215 million years ago in what is now New Mexico, which was then located in the equatorial dry region of the supercontinent Pangea.
Tawa opens a new window to the earlier evolution of dinosaurs, says Nesbitt.
It shows us a lot about kinships, extensions, and signs of early dinosaurs.
In 2006, Nesbitt and other paleontologists began excavating at Ghost Ranch in northern New Mexico.
Sometimes in one day we found a dozen dinosaur bones, which is unprecedented for triassic sediments, reports team member Randall Irmis of the Museum of Natural History in Utah.
Some of the bones were quickly identified by scientists as a new species.
During the excavations, the remains of a total of five individuals were collected.
The finding confirms the theory of the early history of dinosaurs.
The name "Tawa" comes from the sun god of the Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt, this is an unusual finding: "The fossils of the triassic dinosaurs are very rare, usually only individual fragments are found."
Other dinosaur experts do not share this enthusiasm without reservation.
This finding is not particularly sensational, but it confirms some theories about the early history of dinosaurs, says Martin Sander of the University of Bonn.
According to current scientific opinion, dinosaurs first appeared about 230 million years ago.
Many of the oldest fossils are not complete, so the assignment of pradinosaurs is usually controversial.
Experts discuss, for example, when the lizards were divided into three most important developmental lines: carnivorous theropods, which later included Tyranosaurus rex, Velociraptor and also birds, "long-legged" four-legged sauropods and their relatives, for example, steeplefish and steeplefish.
Tawa hallae is the original therapod after analysis by Nesbitt and his colleagues.
It exhibits an interesting combination of primitive and advanced properties, says Nesbitt.
For example, researchers found evidence of air sacs on the skull of Tawa hallae, which are also the offspring of theropod birds.
Thanks to air bags, breathing birds is more effective than mammals.
In the Tawa hallae, the bones of the spine were apparently partly filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive theropod with air bags, says Randall Irmis.
Since the allied lineage of giant sauropods later also had airbags and light bones, this useful innovation probably created a common ancestor of the two groups.
At least three waves of migration to North America
Because the most primitive dinosaurs known to date lived in South America, scientists inferred that the lizards first appeared there.
According to this, the three evolutionary lines were soon divided and expanded from South America to all the continents that at that time, as the supercontinent Pangea, formed a single Earth mass.
The fact that the team and Tawa hallae found the remains of two other, not particularly closely related theropods would speak for it.
These three cannot come from one common, immigrant ancestor, scientists argue.
We believe there have been at least three migration waves to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, co-author of the scientific study.
Of course, there are also contradictions.
An even older species, Silesaurus, which belongs to the heaviest group of dinosaurs, lived in present-day Poland, says Bonn paleontologist Martin Sander.
His conjecture could put together a distorted picture, as many primitive fossils of dinosaurs have been preserved in South America, with rare occurrences on other continents.
How dinosaurs proved that they evolved from a relatively rare lineage of reptiles to the dominant vertebrates on Earth during the Earth's Middle Ages remains an enigma.
During the triassic, dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other reptiles, such as the ancestors of today's crocodiles and flying lizards and countless other lizards.
Around the end of the triassic, dinosaurs have spread to the whole world and many new species have evolved, while relatives have died out and the interfaces of the triassic and the jury.
The success story didn’t last forever.
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
There may have been a mass extinction that the dinosaurs accidentally survived, but the reptiles did not.
Or the dinosaurs adapted better so they could push out the competition.
The success story didn’t last forever anyway.
150 million years later, a meteorite impact helped another group of animals, which also evolved in the triassic and have lived in the shadows ever since: mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the signatories are international.
The list includes professors from the University of Toronto, the University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna, or Berkeley, California.
Professors from Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen joined.
The police clearing of the occupied casino of Frankfurt Goethe University has caused a worldwide uproar.
278 professors and lecturers from Goethe University, as well as universities across Germany, Europe and North and South America, stand in solidarity with protesting students at the Westend campus.
In a statement written in German and English, they “disapprove” of the police intervention incited by the Presidency.
Because the walls and works of art were blurred, University President Werner Müller-Estler ordered the demolition of a building occupied last week by students and lecturers on strike.
Five students were injured in the incident.
The damage, the signatories judge, does not justify "the violent dissolution of the self-organized teaching of students and teachers by the police command."
Clean-up is an "unacceptable interference" with the freedoms of research and science.
The exclusive focus on vandalism serves to "illegitimate and criminalize protest" and distracts attention from the content.
The Presidency avoided the necessary discussion.
The speakers call for the cessation of criminal prosecution.
It is claimed that most of the strikers did not support material damage.
Legitimate protest
The youth of the Verdi trade union and the German trade union union also stand in solidarity with the students.
The protest is a legitimate expression of growing concern for one’s own future, says the mysterious Earth Youth Verdi Alexander Klein.
Hessian Minister of Science Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU) has so far defended the actions of the university president and police.
We are grateful to the President of the University.
Destruction and occupation are completely unacceptable means, she said Thursday in the Aktuellen Stunde (Current Hour) in the Wiesbaden Landtag.
“We have an understanding for protest, but we have no understanding for vandalism,” CDU MP Peter Beuth said.
The opposition factions of the SPD, the Greens and the Left saw it differently.
The CDU takes the painted walls as an excuse to criminalize the protest, said Janine Wissler (Linke).
Instead of dealing with the arguments and demands of the students, there was clearance.
Line has submitted a proposal calling on the Minister of the Interior to report on the police deployment.
New Silicon-Valley
For many years it was a secret city, inaccessible to visitors from the West.
Zelenograd, one of the ten districts of the capital of Moscow, in the Soviet Union it was a strictly guarded location where secret weapons research was conducted.
Today, this district of 216,000 inhabitants, 37 kilometers from the center of Moscow, is considered the "Russian Silicon Valley".
Important micro- and nanoelectronic research and production centers are located here.
Since September 2008, the representatives of the city have established contacts with the Frankfurt-based Riedberg Science Centre - with the university institutions and companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There were several mutual visits and on Wednesday they signed the "Protocol on Close Cooperation" in Frankfurt Zelenograd and Ridberg.
The Russian delegation was led by the Moscow mayor Yuri Rosljak and the prefect of Zelenograd, Anatoly Smirnov, and the head of planning, Edwin Schwarz, signed for Frankfurt.
In 2010, representatives of FIZ and small and medium-sized enterprises engaged in natural science research will go to a seminar in Zelenograd.
Scientific Interchanges
This is an ongoing scientific exchange.
It is also about economic relations.
Fizu companies will be able to catch up on the growing Russian market.
On the contrary, Russian scientific companies want to get contracts in Germany.
Zelenograd is home to major Russian research institutes and companies.
These include, for example, the Moscow Institute of Electronic Technology, large companies Citronics and Rossiyskaya Elektronika.
The district was founded in 1958 as the so-called "Socialist Planned City" for Arms Research.
Zelenograd (literally translated "Green City") got its name from the forested hilly landscape in which research facilities are planted.
Stuttgart brakes
The Stuttgart 21 dimension cannot be prepared at all.
For the supporters of the project, it is simply the "new heart of Europe".
Well, S21 is more than a station launch, it's more than a monstrous construction that will throw the capital of Baden-Württemberg into a desperate construction chaos for a decade.
Stuttgart 21 was born from the spirit of the 80s.
The main railway stations, which ended up in the city center, were then considered to be 19th-century traffic-technical fossils that acted as brakes for modern rail transport, as it took an enormous amount of time to overtake the locomotives from the rear forward.
Go, stop for a while, move on - that's how it should work.
And that’s why the main train stations are disappearing: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: the crossing station, which lies about halfway between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava – that’s why the slogan about the “heart of Europe”.
It really starts with the S21, although the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality.
The very ambitious designers themselves realized that in the Hesse and Bavaria metropolitan areas, the start of construction is almost unfundable.
Since there are modern shuttle trains with motor and driving vehicles on both ends, the main stations no longer have problems with entry and exit.
Still: Starts with Stuttgart 21 including the new ICE track to Ulm.
This was done by local and local politicians.
The railways work together, also because the risks of the largest individual infrastructure project in the republic are borne by the taxpayer and not by the state group.
In urban planning, the project can still be apologized in some way.
There will be a new urban space that - if we trust the computer images of the designers - will contain a lot of green.
The S21 is harmful to the rail transport system.
The crossing station and the construction of the track are intended for passenger transport, which - typically in the 1980s - was attributed to a huge increase.
At that time, there was no competition for cheap flights.
However, modern transport policy must first and foremost be about strengthening freight transport, because rail transport is far more environmentally friendly than road freight transport.
But the new route is not suitable for freight trains due to the abrupt climbs.
Even more serious is that S21 indirectly affects many other railway projects.
A good <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>6 billion should have been buried in Swabia.
That's the official number.
Experts estimate it to be between 10 and 15 billion.
It is clear that over the next decade there will be a shortage of funding for additional hubs and network bottlenecks.
There are sixty major projects on the list of the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the construction of a 180 km long route through the Rhine valley.
Since 1987, this route has been running at a slow pace.
There should be a lot of pressure here.
But S21 will be like a brake.
The route through the Rhine valley will become the neck of the bottle of international freight transport: right in the heart of Europe.
The government is investigating the decision on the airport.
The land government has left open in the Wiesbaden Landtag whether it will go against the judgment of the Hesse Administrative Court of Justice (VGH) regarding the ban of night flights and has it revised.
The CDU/FDP coalition commissioned experts to legally assess more than 400-page rulings of the VGH, Economy Minister Dieter Posch (FDP) said.
VGH in Kassel today argued in writing that the state would have to re-adjust the night flight ban in the event of the planned construction of the northwest runway of Frankfurt airport.
Authorization for 17 flights between 23 and 5 p.m., as envisaged by the country's government, does not comply with the law ordered to protect the population from night air noise.
The coalition must decide by January 4 if it will request a review of the ruling.
The opposition criticized the postponement and reached out to the government representative to waive the revision of the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
SPD faction leader Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel called on the CDU and the FDP to return to the promises they made before the election to ban night flights, otherwise it could be considered a "violation of the word".
It’s damn hard if you can keep your word, Greens chief Tarek Al-Wazir said in reference to the FDP’s election slogan “We keep our word.”
Minister Posch has rejected Schäfer-Gümbel's admonition, the country's government is trying to get to its night flights through "distortion of law and trickery."
Accurate legal control needs time.
The coalition does not want to work on the basis of a "quick first impression".
We need a realistic decision, Stefan Müller (FDP) said.
His faction’s statements to ban night flights have never been the same as those put forward by the opposition.
U.S. Banks Pay Aid
American, crisis-stricken big banks are getting rid of state ties.
Bank of America on Wednesday paid a total of $45 billion (about <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>30 billion) in aid from the bank’s Tarp bailout fund.
According to a report by CNBC, Citigroup is also planning to repay state aid.
The institutions thus want to get rid of the restrictions that have occurred by accepting money - the restriction of bonus payments to managers and the payment of high fees.
The Bank of America has secured $19 billion in net cash from investors through exchangeable bonds.
She took the rest of the amount from her treasury, which was filled, among other things, thanks to union sales.
Bank chief Kenneth Lewis on Wednesday night thanked the U.S. taxpayer explicitly: The money injection helped us overcome a difficult time.
The monetary institution has been hurt at the height of the financial crisis by the takeover of investment bank Merrill Lynch.
Citigroup also wants to free itself from its obligations to the state by acquiring money on the capital market.
CNBC reported, citing sources, that the U.S. bank could have announced a capital increase of around $20 billion on Thursday.
The Citigroup spokesman did not want to comment.
In June, Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley paid off.
Quick Selection
It just went faster than I expected.
The station introduced the successor just two weeks after the ZDF board of directors removed editor-in-chief Nikolaus Brender from office.
Last night, the Grammy wanted to agree on that person.
The favourite was Peter Frey, head of the ZDF studio in Berlin.
But the station did not confirm it - officially, so as not to anticipate the trial.
But the role could also be played by the fact that they did not want to harm ZDF Superintendent Markus Schächter if this proposal was not passed by the board of directors.
Frey, Schächter's candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 panel members.
The result of the vote was not known before the closing of this issue.
Two weeks ago, he failed on the Schächter Board of Directors with his proposal to extend his contract with Nikolaus Brender for another five years.
Brender's loss of office was a bitter defeat for Schächter, although it was to be expected.
The EU majority on the Governing Council had already signaled weeks before the elections that it did not want to confirm Brender in office.
The resistance to the editor-in-chief was organized by the Hessian Prime Minister Roland Koch.
He declined to remain in the office of the highly respected editor-in-chief, arguing that Brender's watch quotas for the ZDF news broadcast had fallen.
Until shortly before the election, there were protests, in which the political influence on the ZDF was sharply criticized.
There have recently been 35 state lawyers involved in the debate, who consider Koch’s move to be unconstitutional.
It wasn't useless.
About the person
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogy and romance.
Then he worked for Südwestfunk and Frankfurter Rundschau.
In 1983 Frey moved to ZDF, first to "heute-journal".
Other stations: 1988 to 1990 personal editor-in-chief; 1991/92 Washington correspondent; until 1998 head and moderator of "Morgenmagazins"; until 2001 head of foreign policy of the ZDF; since then head of the main studio of the ZDF.
After Brender, who was voted Journalist of the Year by Medium Magazine on Wednesday, was deposed, the Greens announced they would file a constitutional suit.
Koch’s counter-candidate on the board, Rhineland-Palatinate Prime Minister Kurt Beck, explained last week that the federal states should change the state contract with the ZDF so that the intendant’s personnel proposals cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
But Beck also rejected the exclusion of party politicians from the ZDF’s supervisory boards.
Brender's presumed successor, Peter Frey, commanded the board with a clever chess move - immediately after Brender's demise, he strongly criticized the gremium for it.
Thanks to this proof of journalistic independence, Schaechter could nominate him as editor-in-chief without losing face, so he could be elected by the board of directors without suspecting that the party would be pushed into office.
In party arithmetic, Frey is a left-wing liberal.
Studying to get rid of harampada
After a year of strikes, the ministers of culture finally arrived in the federal states on Thursday: At a conference of culture ministers and university rectors, both sides agreed that there is a willingness to improve the conditions of study for bachelors and masters.
Students should be able to manage their studies in the future.
Specifically, they agreed to reduce the test load: Essentially, each study module should be completed with a single test.
In addition, the workload of students should be checked, and a "real and defensible rate" should be guaranteed.
To this end, politicians and universities want to simplify the recognition of exams between universities in Germany and abroad.
The Federal States are committed to creating a more flexible common structural assignment for the undergraduate and postgraduate fields of study.
Land derogations should cease to exist.
Less Exams
Since the start of student protests in the worm, ministers of culture and university rectors have had winged words about better study in their mouths.
Now for the first time they are filled with specific content.
The so-called Accreditation Board has decided that the number of exams is partly drastically reduced: "Each module will usually be completed only with one exam," according to a 30-page report, which is partly to re-regulate the approval of study disciplines.
"Distinctly lower the test load," said Reinhold Grimm, chairman of the accreditation board, "is to stop the wrong development that significantly reduced the study's complexity."
To this end, the "demand of study" in the future is to be the "decisive criterion" in the implementation.
Modules and contents must be "hardly checked" so as not to "unnecessarily restrict students when choosing
seminars.”
Students should be "entitled to a space that enables and supports their own initiative".
The rules should apply when approving new fields of study, after review, but also for existing fields of study.
These need to be “re-accredited” every five years – but that means it will take until 2015 before all the fields of study are reviewed.
This is the responsibility of ten accreditation agencies throughout Germany, which are subject to the accreditation boards set up by the federal states.
In October, the ministers of culture urged the federal states “strongly” to act on the agencies so that the supply of teaching materials is not too large and the test regime is not strict.
In individual federal states, universities and colleges have already agreed with state ministries on appropriate measures.
As to date, only one country has promised Rhine-Westphalia additional funds for the further development of the Bologna Process.
Most of the money should be spent on consulting programmes and study counselling, as well as on strengthening testing and foreign authorities.
For this, countries and universities want to spend ten million euros.
At the beginning of 2010, the government wants to submit to the parliament an amendment to the university law.
According to her, only one test should be required to complete the study module.
The formation of the study should be even more flexible, in order to guarantee the recognition of exams from other universities and to facilitate the access to the master's degree.
By the end of next year, the demands of all study disciplines in the country should be checked.
On Thursday, the government and the opposition again argued about the country’s study conditions.
In addition to praise, criticism of the resolution also fell.
The Federal Council of Higher Education Groups called for the development of education policy not to take place in the future "behind closed doors" of ministers and university rectors.
At the latest after the strike, students should "speak at least a word" as the person concerned.
Future academics also received support from the president of the Conference of Higher Education Rectors (HRK), Margreta Wintermantel: "We need the experience of students," she said Thursday at a meeting with the ministers of culture with whom the HRK consulted on a joint reform report.
According to the Departments of Education and Science (GEW), the Bonn resolutions did not go far enough: they require a legal claim that would allow any graduate with a bachelor’s degree access to an additional master’s degree.
Secondly, the federal states must ensure that for today’s generation of undergraduate students, there are enough places available tomorrow in the master’s degree fields with the best study conditions, said GEW board member Andreas Keller.
The federal government needs to employ a lot more speakers.
However, the Ministers of Culture did not comment on the free access to the master’s programs.
More than a line note to Herta Müller
Getting to Germany and out is nice, almost no control..." is the opening line of a poem by the poet Werner Söllner, who in this ripped language piece themeizes the experience of arriving a dissident who gained freedom but at the same time lost his language environment.
Werner Söllner was born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, worked first as a teacher of German and English in Bucharest and later as a lecturer at a children's book publishing house, then moved to Frankfurt am Main in 1982.
Söllner has been awarded various literary awards, lectured poetry at the legendary Goethe University in Frankfurt in 1993, and since 2002 has been chair of the Hessen Forum for Literature in Mousonturm, Frankfurt.
A significant extra-literary upheaval took place last Tuesday at a seminar in Munich, which dealt with "German literature in Romania in the mirror and the broken mirror of its security acts".
Apparently insecure and infected, Söllner left a statement in which he confessed to his fellow Romanian German writers, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak and Helmut Frauendorfer, to cooperate as a secret informant of the Romanian secret service Securitate.
Together with some of the attendees, Söllner won the German Language Award in 1989.
Recruitment attempts began inconspicuously, first in 1971.
I am, Söllner continued, "then someone who has not resisted sufficiently the attempts of intimidation by the Securitate."
The poet Werner Söllner is a secret agent, Walter.
Almost at the same time as the award of the Nobel Prize to Herta Müller and her unprecedented literary dealing with the mechanisms of dictatorial government, there is a literary scene, and in particular a community of German authors from Romania, shaken by a case that denotes the depths and shame of the political symposium.
Werner Söllner is not, at least if it can be said according to the current state of knowledge, only the perpetrator, but he is also a victim.
In the Securitate acts, the secret agent Walter played a role, said after Söllner's confession Michael Markel and referred to the positive influence of the secret agent Walter on himself.
“He cut me out at all the points that mattered to him at the time,” says Markel.
He has a moral duty to make that remark.
Söllner’s statement in this form and before this audience was unexpected, but the confession of the former dissident and his cooperation with the Romanian secret service is not entirely surprising.
Herta Müller wrote back in July, when she read her own 914 pages, that Germany was a pleasant reservation for the spicy Securitate.
The subjects, one can assume, will speculate and, in some cases, probably even know which name is hidden behind the covert names Sorin, Voicu and just Walter.
Unlike the domestic, in the meantime a very certain view of the files of the Stazi, the manipulation of the relics of the Securitate control is still very diffuse.
In recent years, systematic enlightenment has been dampened and limited.
One of Birthler’s offices, which corresponds to the National Council for the Processing of Securitate (CNSAS), was founded only in 1999, the issue of the act has since been rather lengthy.
Only since 2005 there is a law that governs the management of components.
The fact that former members of Securitate still have great influence in Romania, after the publication of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller, proved one interview in which one of the former heads of Securitate from Temeswar commented on the award winner in a negative way.
She is said to have psychosis, after all, she was interrogated only once.
The defamation of power was expressed here completely uncovered in the form of freedom of expression.
Of course, there are inevitable questions about the Söllner case, as in the case of the silent offense.
The special reaction of the audience to Söllner’s confession suggests that the continuation of this chapter will determine the desire for knowledge rather than the attribution of guilt and stud.
The genesis of Herta Müller’s work, which received the Nobel Prize yesterday, is more than a note below the line.
Saturated deposit Champions League
It seemed as if a purely dressed salesman had come from a cute Christmas party where the sports goods manufacturer was distributing sweets when he was a quarter of an hour after midnight in a Mercedes C-Class, the new coach of VfBr Spo<0xC5><0xBE>u<0xC5><0xA1>ko, Christian Gross, accompanied by Orv<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE>ev<0xC4><0x9B>.
A man with a marked baldness was driven by a foreign city because of him.
Otherwise, he could drive himself - alcohol was not in the game, and the 55-year-old man was drunk fortunately too little.
It's been a pleasant evening, but work will continue tomorrow.
Or it's just getting started.
The words of the only three days of the committed Swiss: "We have reached the eighth final", namely in the Champions League thanks to a win of 3:1 over Unirea Urziceni from Romania, "but we must not let ourselves be dazzled by the success: it will be a brutally hard fight against the descent."
A far more important task is ahead of us on Sunday.
It is important to repeat the performance of the royal class in the Mughal even on an ordinary league day.
And avoid again obvious weaknesses after three quick goals of Maricy (5th), Träsche (8th) and Pogrebnyak (11th).
Lottery
The Champions League Eighth Finals (match 16/17 + 23/24 February/ avenge game 9/10 + 16/17 March) will be drawn on 18 December in Nyon.
The joy of Babbel’s successor’s sudden appearance will therefore be preserved.
Not only in the case of the supposed healer, who gave uncertain Stuttgart professionals confidence, commitment and joy from the game in a short period of time.
I went to the players and told them to focus on their strengths and I urged them to be more courageous, explained the soul healer Gross, so simply sounding successful recipe, which, however, under the action of the therapist Babbel proved no longer effective.
Babbel’s supporter Jens Lehmann admitted, “When a new impulse comes in football, sometimes things happen that you wouldn’t think possible.”
And Sami Khedira, who after several weeks of break due to injury, became the best player on the field thanks to his dynamics, tried to describe the detected "phenomenon" with the proverbial "fresh wind" and the working procedures of the new superior: "It is a man who is a radical and disciplined man.
That’s what we need in the current situation.”
Apparently, Babbel was missing it.
VfB Stuttgart not yet saved, warns sports president Horst Heldt
But VfB Stuttgart needs more consistency.
Like Gross, players and managers do not want to overestimate the victory against the weakened substitute and completely overwhelmed defense of the Romanian guest.
They would have won in Glasgow before a nasty awakening came after a 0-4 defeat in Leverkusen, Khedira thinks.
Sports chairman Horst Heldt recalled that while one goal has been achieved this season, the other is still a long way off.
We're not out of the water yet.
The fact that Heldt did not celebrate his 40th birthday even after his first home win in three months was caused by weekend events that freshly came to life in the form of a television interview with goalkeeper Jens Lehmann just before the match began.
They are decisions that are taken by others rather than Jens, Heldt responded to Lehmann’s harsh criticism.
He threw the board of weak leadership and decided to change the coach after the pressure of pubertal fans.
Even the fact that his day off after the matches was cancelled, Lehmann described it as a sign of a lack of sovereignty and envy.
Lehmann’s statements “formulate pure selfishness,” Heldt replied, announcing the consequences for the goalkeepers.
The 40-year-olds will no longer have any joy in life.
In any case, they agree with each other that without the work of the deposed coaching team, it would not be possible to have such a player-strong and combative performance.
Babbel and his assistants had "a large share of success," Heldt and Lehmann say unanimously - and the man with the needle bag agrees.
Wrestling World Heavyweight Championships
Passionate duel in Bern: Challenger Kevin Johnson constantly provoked the words and gestures of world champion Vitali Kli<0xC4><0x8D>ek.
However, after twelve hard laps, the Ukrainian defended his title in the heavyweight boxing organization WBC.
The decision of the arbitrators was unanimous.
Hamburg - Vitalij Kli<0xC4><0x8D>ko remains World Heavyweight Boxing Champion.
38-year-old WBC champion defeated American Kevin Johnson on Saturday night in Bern unanimously by points (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
For Kli<0xC4><0x8D>ek, this is the third successful defense of the title after his return in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainian was twice World Champion of WBO and WBC.
Unfortunately, it did not come to the K.O. everyone expected.
Kli<0xC4><0x8D>ko improved his balance to 39 wins in 41 professional matches, twice being defeated due to injuries.
The challenger Johnson was defeated for the first time in the 24th match.
In front of about 17,000 spectators in the Berne arena, the 2.02-metre-high Kli<0xC4><0x8D>ko duel was mainly driven by his left hand.
Eleven centimeters smaller Johnson, who announced the end of the Klitschko era before the duel, was retreating from the World Champion strikes, so Klitschko could not strike decisively with his dangerous right hand.
Overall, passive Johnson did little for the challengers and was just trying to get into the next round.
Whilst he provoked words and gestures, his blows hit the World Champion seldom.
But it is still only the second boxer after Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who fought with Kli<0xC4><0x8D>ek full twelve laps.
Before the match, the challenger took care of a riot in the Swiss capital.
He insulted Klitschko as an "abhorrent zombie" who "does nothing right".
During the weighing on Friday, the champion was provoked, removing Johnson's sunglasses from his nose, "so he could see his eyes."
Fourth victory after Kli<0xC4><0x8D>kov's return
Kli<0xC4><0x8D>ko remained undefeated after his fourth match after his return on 11 October 2008.
After a nearly four-year hiatus, he defeated Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and took back "his" WBC belt, which he had to surrender without a fight.
This year he defeated Juan Carlos Gomez of Cuba and Chris Arreola of the United States in September.
In this fight I got only one blow and physically I am in good shape, justifies Kli<0xC4><0x8D>ko a quick return to the ring.
But his dream remains to defend all four important titles in the family.
Vladimir is the World Champion of the WBO and IBF.
The WBA belt is worn by Brit David Haye after he deposed Nikolai Vulaev from the throne in November.
Haye abandoned the fight against Klitschko in the summer, which was scheduled for September.
His promotion company is reportedly planning a duel against Kli<0xC4><0x8D>kov at London's Wembley Stadium.
The Case of Kunduz
Front-line attack from the opposition: Jürgen Trittin, the leader of the Greens, called Minister of Defense Kunduz Guttenberg a liar because of misinformation about the affair.
The SPD and the Left (Left) call on the Chancellor to give an explanation.
Hamburg/Berlin - According to the latest information on the raid on Kunduz, the opposition believes that Defense Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) has committed deliberate deception.
The minister said the deadly bombing of two tankers in September was "consciously false," Greens group chief Jürgen Trittin told ARD's "Tagesschau" on Saturday.
Let's call it the usual term: lying.
The order to kill was issued in violation of the rules of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan (ISAF).
That is the essence of the report that NATO had, which Mr Guttenberg read, Trittin said.
On Friday, it was revealed that the attack was not only about the destruction of the hijacked trucks, but about the targeted killing of two Taliban leaders.
The U.S. strike, demanded by German commander Kunduz Colonel Klein, killed or injured up to 142 people, according to NATO investigations.
The Greens, the SPD and the left called on Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) on Saturday to speak immediately before the Bundestag and also clarify what Guttenberg really knew about the event.
Merkel must explain whether the strategy of targeted killing is part of the Afghan policy of the Bundestag - and whether the Chancellor's Office, the Bundeswehr and the intelligence service approved this new strategy, Jürgen Trittin and colleague from the Greens called for.
Government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm strongly rejected the criticism.
The chancellor's office has no influence on the specific deployment of the Bundeswehr in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, there were also loud doubts about the ministry’s assessment of the background to the release of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert.
According to SPIEGEL, they both informed Guttenberg correctly and completely about the background of the attack on the tanks.
Officially, they were supposed to deny the existence of NATO reports and silence the minister’s sensitive details.
However, it was reported from the two top officials that they had even alerted the Ministry of Defense to several reports, including a two-page document from Colonel Klein and a report from the military police.
The Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung reported that Wichert had in the meantime requested clarification in the letter.
It is noted that he has not yet received any response.
The ministry did not comment on the remarks on Saturday and pointed out that this will be dealt with in an investigation committee of the Federal Parliament, which will be set up next Wednesday.
Worlds of Dreams
Some see images in a waking state and hear voices that others cannot see or hear.
It is not only the mentally ill or drug addict who merge the boundaries between imagination and reality.
As long as it happens in your sleep, everything is fine.
If we lie with our eyes closed in our dark room, we may surround ourselves with the wildest imaginations and fantasy delusions.
But those who experience dream states, see and hear things that others do not see or hear, in today’s Western world, are mostly considered a fool or a drug addict, or at least a freak.
However, such images and voices do not occur only in the mentally ill or in drug addiction.
The fault lies with our imagination: The same neural processes that allow us to design houses, paint paintings or write novels, make sure that the boundaries between dream, imagination and reality merge here and there.
Dreams altered state of consciousness can occur in a variety of forms, at best we call them visions, in worse delusions.
Although the initiator and effect may vary, the visions of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiences of the New-Age prophet Carlos Castaneda, shamanic states of whispering, psychosis and hallucinations can be derived from similar processes.
Hallucinations or visions occur when the balance of the brain’s neuronal transmitters—especially dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin, and acetylcholine—is disrupted, and interactions between different parts of the brain are disrupted.
Complex hallucinations and delusional thoughts occur very often in schizophrenic psychosis.
Gravity has no power over it.
The connection between error and dream has been employed by philosophers and physicians since ancient times.
Aristotle understood hallucinations as a form of dream in a waking state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychology, noted in 1861 "a great resemblance of blurring with dream states", for Sigmund Freud the dream was even "psychosis, with all nonsense, delusions, deceptions with deceit".
In the autumn of 2001, Henning T. turns into a comic book character.
His body is two-dimensional and crisply colored.
Gravity above it has no power, it floats at the ceiling of the room.
She feels kicked.
Behind him, winged devilish figures with blood-red grimaces, appreciating teeth.
They chase him, kick him with heavy, fiery shoes, throw him against the wall, feel the pain all over his body.
Loud, bad voices threaten from the walls and from the radio.
He can no longer stand the voices that insult and insult him.
Henning T. pulls two cables out of the stereo, puts them in a loop and attaches it to a hook on the ceiling.
He stands on one speaker and puts a loop around his neck.
He's jumping.
The loop allows.
Learn, shouting choir voices tore his drums, "Go to the clinic and be treated!"
Today, Henning T. is 40 years old, experienced six acute psychoses, the last two years ago, the first almost 20 years ago.
LSD has been released.
His diagnosis is schizoaffective paranoid psychosis, in addition, he is manic-depressive, taking antidepressants, mania, schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness and has been married for three years.
In psychosis, I experienced the worst of fears and the deepest of doubts, he says.
Ghosts are a terrible reality.
About one percent of people get schizophrenia at least once in their lives, in psychiatric clinics it is the second most commonly treated disease after depression.
In acute schizophrenic psychosis, people with disabilities can no longer distinguish between the inner and outer worlds, they get into an over-revealed state, which can lead to hallucinations, magnitude, relationship illusions or the illusion of persecution.
Particularly widespread is the hearing of voices – voices that command, comment or conduct dialogues.
Even optical hallucinations are not uncommon.
The affected person is not able to distinguish the important from the unimportant, the brain cannot filter out disturbing signals, consciousness is flooded with impressions.
Just like a dream, psychosis opens up a flood of thoughts and fantasies that come from the deepest layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is focused on the subject, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, senior physician at the Clinic of General Psychiatry at the University Clinic in Heidelberg.
The schizophrenic is located at the center of events, everything has a meaning aimed at him.
At the same time, he gets into a passive role, becomes, like in a dream, overwhelmed by events and cannot actively shape them.
Schizophrenics often feel threatened, controlled, and manipulated.
Comparing with reality is usually not possible in them, ghosts are a terrible reality, awakening is excluded.
Experience hallucinations once in a lifetime
Unlike in a dream, Fuchss says, “but the sensory and spatial structure of the reality that one perceives in psychosis remains fundamentally preserved.”
Deceptive thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, the theft of experience takes place within the real framework.
Scientists are still struggling to figure out exactly why our brains are making these kinds of shifts.
Exceptional states can lead to a short-term loss of relationship to reality, says Fuchs.
Not everyone develops into psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but studies on twins have shown that genes are not the only determining factor.
Scientists assume that the affected people have minimal brain damage.
We believe that at an early stage of development, neural maturation of the brain will be damaged, for example, by viral diseases of the mother during pregnancy, explains Fuchs.
But it remains an enigma as to how the neural system will break, which has not manifested itself for many years.
The influences of the environment also play a role - stress or traumatic experiences can be the initiator of psychosis, if there is a willingness to do so.
Also, hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychosis because they interfere with the transmission system.
When our brain boils
The crazy thing is that psychotronics suffer from their hallucinations, and to get rid of them, they swallow expensive drugs, others give money for drugs to get them, says psychology professor Erich Kasten of Lübeck.
Whether we perceive delusions as pleasant or unpleasant is often just a matter of attitude.
Kasten has been collecting reports on hallucinations and delusions for ten years, interpreting his findings in the book "Die irreale Welt in unserem Kopf" (Die irreale Welt in unserem Kopf) last year.
While hallucinations are a typical accompanying phenomenon of psychosis, they are also a surprise for many other diseases.
In addition to mental disorders such as borderline personality or depression, illnesses such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer’s disease or brain trauma are also common.
Surprisingly hallucinates under certain conditions the brain of a healthy person.
Hallucinations, according to Kasten, consist of the contents of thoughts that are normally suppressed.
They occur when the parts of the brain in which sensory perception is processed are too active or little suppressed; when our brain becomes clogged, or when there is no stimulation.
Drugs can trigger this condition as well as brain damage or psychosis.
But also deprivation of stimuli, stress, worries about love or other exceptional conditions.
In recent studies, up to a third of those surveyed said they had experienced hallucinations at least once in their lives.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. is 16 years old, lives in a small town in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and attends the gymnasium there.
Actually, a perfectly normal girl.
If it wasn't for the patterns and the voices.
During the breaks, she may be approached by a colophane with long, dark hair.
When she answers, her classmates look at her with surprise – no one but her sees and hears this boy.
This daring girl is considered a trapped dreamer, but Sarah K. doesn't, she knows.
He is awake, he hears and he sees the boy, just as he hears and he sees the girl sitting next to him in the bench.
He may even feel his presence, at least for a few moments.
It's a nice feeling, she likes that boy.
“Am I crazy?” he asks sometimes.
But he knows that this boy and other delusions are not real and will disappear again.
In the night the sights are rather depressing
Frequently, they are a burden.
When she sits in the classroom, she cannot watch the lesson many times, because the teacher in her eyes and ears is presenting a new classmate, but he explains it to everyone else in an audible and visible way on the mathematical equation board.
At night, the sights are rather depressing.
When she waits in her dark room for a sleep that comes rarely and too late, she often cannot tell whether she is awake or asleep, whether the images she sees, the grimaces, or the girl with bleeding cut wounds on her hands and feet arise behind her eyes, open or open.
Leave me alone, he's yelling at the characters.
She doesn't tell her parents and friends about it, they'd think she'd go crazy.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is 20 years old today.
She graduated last year and lives with her boyfriend.
A year ago, the hallucinations stopped.
Since she contacted psychologist Kasten on the Internet, she knows exactly that she hasn't gone mad.
Deception is also an art of despair.
If someone is socially isolated or is stripped of stimuli, they are more likely to have hallucinations, Kasten says.
I think the brain doesn't have enough work to do and it's taking care of its own fun.
Sarah K., the only child, was afraid of other children as a little girl, often playing alone.
Her hallucinations began when she learned at 13 that the man she has been calling her dad since she thought he was her own father.
Because in visual and acoustic hallucinations the same brain regions are active, which also process real perceptions and sounds, it is difficult for those affected, like Sarah K., to distinguish between delusions and reality. "Every experience," says Kasten, "is taking place in the brain, there is also reality.
Hallucinations are also images that the brain produces, which is why they are so real.”
Also, night dreams are evaluated by Kasten as a form of hallucination.
The hallucination of healthy people is not fundamentally different from the hallucination in acute psychosis.
Compared to schizophrenics, mental health people are able to identify their delusions as unrealistic.
Kasten therefore advises its patients to evaluate hallucinations as an extraordinary ability.
The boundary between sleep and hallucination
In our world too focused on consciousness, the imaginary experience is unfortunately mostly pathologised, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor in Heidelberg and head physician of the Psychiatric and Psychotherapeutic Clinic of the Florence-Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
Psychosis is a difficult, painful disease, but it also brings positive, creativity - delusion is also the art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard investigated the so-called one-iroidal form of experience, a special form of altered consciousness to dream.
Oneiroid states are highly complex, detailed fictional dreams that the person in question considers to be real and cannot even distinguish them backwards from the waking state.
Oneiroid state of consciousness arises in extreme situations caused by trauma or disease, for example, patients with polyradicular inflammation who experience motor paralysis with full consciousness.
When a person is threatened by the loss of the world and of himself, perhaps permanent, complete inability to move, he replaces the life-threatening real situation with his own, imaginary world, which is disconnected from reality, says Schmidt-Degenhard.
A type of boundary state between sleep and hallucination.
Because in reality it is not possible to manage a situation, there will be a change of worlds, but the real situation becomes an idea.
An intense form of support of the senses and the transfer of the senses in some unbearable situation, which allows us to people's own ability to form, to pass in a moment to loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in the memory
Also art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen describes his one-iroid experiences in his book "Herzwechsel" (Exchange of the Heart) as a rescue action of the soul.
He was 49 years old when, after a heart valve surgery followed by a heart transplant, his consciousness embarked on a several-day journey while his body lay motionless in an intensive care unit.
Claussen immersed himself in the world he created, visited foreign times and places: he becomes an old man clinging to bed, in a train sanatorium, the robot takes care of his health.
She lives in the early Middle Ages among the nobility that produces narcotic substances from the blood.
On a motorbike, he is taken by a Greek to his homeland, surfs on a hospital bed in the Alps and meets a Korean mobster.
It immerses itself completely in the imaginary story, everything is real, even later in the memories.
For Claussen, these inner paths are fundamentally different from any dream.
A dream is a different state, it describes its experience.
In contrast to dreams, the memories of those mental journeys are clearly clear even after years and in insignificant details.
Even brighter and more intense than the real experience.
The intensity of this experience breaks the horizon of our other true experiences, says psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
After all, oneiroid states, psychoses, hallucinations and drug addictions show how fragile our inner images of external reality are, even in a waking state.
Any change in the state of consciousness, summarizes psychologist Kasten, "can lead to a deformation of what we call reality."
A fact that can also be enriching.
The snow can come
Burda
The 27-year-old should take over the children's publishing house.
The new editor-in-chief of Kallen is a transitional solution: In the long run, Hubert Burda wants to hand over his business to his two children, he told SPIEGEL.
The holding company will continue to be 100 percent owned by the family.
Hamburg - Publisher Hubert Burda has seen his company in the hands of his children for a long time.
Both children will inherit at the age of 27 and have a strong will to enter the company, says the 69-year-old man to SPIEGEL.
We dealt with the details carefully.
The question of whether they are also active in the company is asked only afterwards.
The question is whether they have the ability to do so.
It is not possible to put 7,500 employees at the head of your children if they are not capable enough.
That would kill both the kids and the company.
Burda announced on Thursday that he had stepped down from the chairmanship of the board since January and appointed Paul-Bernhard Kallen as his successor.
Kallen, 52, has been a Burdy board member since 1999.
At first he was in charge of technology.
Later, the section of the Treasury was added to the responsibility for the company’s assets and, after the resignation of Jürgen Todenhöfer, Direct Marketing, Foreign Affairs, Print and Finance.
For the first time, none of the members of the family are at the head of the publishing house.
Burd’s children are 19 and 17 years old, and his son Felix, who would be 42 today, died a few years ago.
Kallen’s appointment also serves to “turn over 10, 15 years,” Burda said.
The holding should continue to be 100 percent owned by the family, Burda says.
With regard to the Schickedanz and Schaeffler cases, Burda commented that even family-owned enterprises are not certain of their demise: "It has always affected companies that have become infected with a desire for capital, that they have speculated and thought they could become big players.
That was never my strategy.
He never “dreamed of world power,” Burda said.
I don't see myself as a political preceptor of this country, like Springer, and I don't want to play the world league with Time, these deals are too big.

The shape of the cut is very important to highlight the figure, which it is necessary to bear in mind.
We make a few suggestions.
Singer Fergie chose an extravagant and very complicated cut. We do not recommend.
Endesa in Barcelona, by electric car
The energy company Endesa, together with the Barcelona City Hall, founded the 'Kancerá<0xC5><0x99> LIVE'.
This is a project for the development and promotion of an electric car in the capital of Catalonia.
The LIVE Office (Logistics for the Deployment of Electric Vehicles) will establish and manage a roadmap for the introduction of electric vehicles in the city and will secure mobility agreements, manage, coordinate and submit contributions, etc.
It will also develop the MOVELE project, promote electric cars, collect views and results of activities in the sectors involved.
Overall, the aim is to support this means of transport of the future.
3 "Electric cities"
However, Barcelona is not the only city to be involved in the project of introducing electric cars in Spain.
Madrid and Seville will also join the project.
These are the three cities chosen by the government as part of the MOVELE Plan to support the introduction of electric cars.
Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Catalan government.
The aim is to support research and technological development activities in the Autonomous Region of Catalonia.
This includes activities related to energy and, above all, energy efficiency.
This is not the only initiative with Endesa’s involvement in promoting electric cars.
The company is represented in European standardization teams and actively implements a number of additional projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero predicts a 'peace period' in the automotive industry.
Prime Minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero predicts that the Spanish automotive industry, the country's main export sector, is waiting for a "peace period".
In Prime Minister Zapatero’s 2009 economic report, he summarized the measures that were put in place during the year to support the automotive sector.
"Without a Competitive Plan for the Automotive Industry, we would be in a state of abandonment today, the closure of some of our main manufacturing companies," the Prime Minister said.
“Thanks to this plan and the desire of the individual brands to continue to operate in Spain in this highly competitive sector, a certain period of calm in this industry, which is our main export sector, is foreseen in the future,” he added.
In this sense, he pointed out that the competitive plan, which forms part of the Integrated Automotive Industry Plan (PIA), allocated 800 million to projects of 19 manufacturers and 137 subsidiaries that mobilized investments of more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3 billion.
The Prime Minister explained that this investment is intended for the development of new models, for the modernization of production and the existing processes.
Zapatero also stressed the government measures to support the request and mentioned the 2000E plan, which is implemented in cooperation with autonomous regions and automotive brands.
According to the president, the plan allowed a 6% reduction in the average emissions of new vehicles sold on the Spanish market, and ensured a "significant increase" in registrations, namely in November by "40%".
20,000 square meters of classic vehicles
The first International Salon of Classic Vehicles will open in Madrid, which is a meeting place for professionals and amateurs from the world of motorcycles.
This initiative will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 in the Glass Pavilion of the Casa de Campo in Madrid.
It is an exhibition area of 20,000 square meters, on which more than 200 domestic and foreign exhibitors will be represented.
Here you will find not only classic motorcycles and cars, but in ClassicAuto Madrid there will also be products of all kinds related to the world of motorcycles.
The exhibitors in the pavilion will offer accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, accessories, publications, miniatures, etc.
Hundreds of products related to classic engines, real treats for collectors and inquisitors.
Among the participating companies will be the following:Clásicos de Mos and Good Old Times, car sales; Juan Lumbreras, renovation; Coupe-Francisco Pueche, sale and renovation of cars; or Cochera Clásicos, the specialized company Mercedes Benz.
Exterior Eligibility Tests
In addition, the commercial activity of this salon will be complemented by parallel activities: the conduct of concentration, sports performances, eligibility tests, presentations and competitions.
Eligibility tests will also be carried out for classic cars and motorcycles in an adapted circuit outside the exhibition area.
Mazda3 i-Stop: preserving sporty style
Mazda aims to show that environmental friendliness has no negative impact on sporting style.
That’s why the Mazda3 also has a built-in engine stop and start system – also known as the ‘Stop’ – a device that is currently only available with a 2.0 150 hp gasoline engine.
This second generation Mazda3 is characterized by the good characteristics that it has achieved as a whole.
Surface treatment, vehicle design, habitability, behavior, mechanics, i-Stop system...
All these aspects are excellent at Mazda3.
The front seats, including the driver’s seats, have excellent ergonomics and are perfectly fixed.
The steering wheel is also extremely soft.
Using the set of tools and the console, we conclude that Mazda continues the Japanese trend in the development of futuristic design with many buttons and controls and a distinctive red and blue color.
This style is partly reminiscent of the style that is also presented by the Honda Civic.
So we can say that both the Mazda3 and the Civic, both Japanese, contrast with the sobriety of German products and more specifically with the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to defeat.
As usual, this Japanese compact product represents more than enough space for four adults who want a very comfortable ride.
In addition, it is necessary to mention a large luggage compartment and regular shapes.
The automatic engine stop and start system is currently only available with a two-liter petrol engine and 150 horsepower and a six-speed manual transmission.
This engine is a real treat. It is very subtle, characterized by reduced noise levels, its power and lower consumption.
Although the most sought-after Mazda3 is in the diesel version, all those who do not drive so many kilometers a year should not rule out this gasoline-powered i-Stop, as it is characterized by greater driving comfort and reduced consumption.
As for the equipment, the version selected for testing is called Sportive and includes a larger number of serial elements.
For serial equipment, it is necessary to mention in particular the audio tracking system (RVM), which prevents the formation of a dead angle, traction control and stability, speed control, internal mirror sensitive to light, on-board computer with large screen, parking sensors and bluoth, separate air conditioning, dream world.
And if the equipment was not enough, this version was equipped with a Pack Premium, for an additional <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1,500: adaptive double-xenon lights and a BOSE sound system with a CD holder, among other components.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the most compact cars in its category.
It is mainly characterized by the quality of the materials used, its operation and high level of equipment.
In addition, people who do not drive more miles per year can choose this version of the i-Stop, which is only powered by a 2.0 and 150 hp gasoline engine.
The only disadvantage of this model is its higher price, which is 21,770 euros for the Luxury version and 23,270 euros for the tested version -Sportive-.
At this high price, Mazda3 offers us a great dose of satisfaction for every day.
Luxury 'Premiere'
L.A. has a red carpet, fine as the hands of Penélope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars were dazzling more than ever in the new elegant and sexy models of the brand 'Nine'. (Photo: Gtresonline).
Our 'Pe', extravagant as usual, chose dark 'ladies'.
Slib FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, it is only used to view mail, without the ability to view certain types of attachments or surf the web.
He enjoyed his five minutes of fame in the U.S. when Time magazine named him one of the products of the year.
Seeing it outside is harder, but the idea can be interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek is characterized by a very low price and monthly payments, less than half the amount that is paid, for example, for an iPhone data plan.
After its success, the company began offering two new devices: one is intended exclusively for Twitter, the other is based on the permanently provided free data service, but for which it is necessary to pay six times the amount for Peek.
FonPeek, which was presented yesterday at Le Web, is a European version of the invention and at the same time its third transformation.
It is limited as well as its American counterpart, but brings a surprise.
The monthly maintenance fee is around 12 euros per month and includes roaming throughout Europe.
People with smartphones already know what it means to lose data services after crossing borders or impatiently search for a café with WiFi (or a Fon connection) to view mail.
The idea of rooming at a fixed price is incredibly attractive and should have been introduced a long time ago.
Yes, some operators have special contracts and travel plans, but in my experience one would need a PhD in physics to understand them, and also very good glasses to be able to read miniature letters.
The European Commission is constantly demanding that roaming tariffs be reduced so that they are accessible across Europe, which still does not have the desired effect.
There is a reasonable concern about the use of data services outside the home state.
The fact that a device like FonPeek (interestingly, it still has the name Fon when it doesn’t have WiFi) reaches this type of tariff means that operators are starting to think differently and consider different offers to compensate for their data network.
Kindle is another nice example, offering book downloads and other Internet searches.
No contracts, no complications.
This device is connected and is valid upon purchase, not after months.
And that’s exactly what I expect to happen in the case of FonPeek, it’s an option to purchase with a permanent approach as that Peek has already introduced in the US.
Not because I wanted to buy it.
I'm looking at the mail on the phone, thank you.
I expect it because I think it is the best type from the consumer point of view.
It would be interesting if the same system could be used in a computer.
The color that Michelle loves
Yellow is undoubtedly the favorite color of the First Lady of the United States.
For Barack Obama’s assumption of office, she chose a dress and coat in this color, the same color she also chose when she accompanied him at the second most important moment of his life: the award of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama used very similar models in both cases: besides being a similar color - yellow-green with glittering effects -, in both cases it was a three-piece set - a dress, a bag and a coat of the same fabric - decorated with a large embroidery or collar.
At first glance, it seemed that the First Lady of the United States decided to follow in the footsteps of the Asturian princess and wear similar clothes.
The fabric from which the clothing is made makes both models considerably different.
On the occasion of taking office, Michelle used a large lace, in Oslo velvet with a print.
It also changes accessories: green shoes with a medium high heel, the current model, but in gold color.
She also wears a variety of hairstyles: this razor, previously dissolved hair.
75% of working mothers have work-related maternity problems.
Discrimination in employment has increased in recent years, especially among younger-age women who intend to have a child.
This is the result of the study 'Fertility and working careers of Spanish women', conducted by the CSIC in collaboration with the Women's Institute.
The study involved 9,737 women between the ages of 15 and 75, and the results are unambiguous: 75% of working mothers have limited opportunities in the labour market due to maternity.
The study highlights that at the beginning of the partnership there are many differences in opinions about the number of children depending on whether they work or not, and also according to the type of employment.
Women who do not work outside the home, work part-time or do not have a stable job, start living with their partner earlier, give birth to the first child earlier, and overall have more children.
On the other hand, women with stable employment, especially in the public sector, postpone cohabitation and motherhood, and have fewer descendants.
"Women between the ages of 35 and 49 with stable employment have their first child, on average, 3.7 years from the beginning of cohabitation, a figure of 4.1 for women who have devoted most of their lives to achieving stable employment and have therefore had to postpone cohabitation and the arrival of children.
The type of profession also has a strong impact on maternity, although it has a smaller impact on the start time of cohabitation with the partner,” explains Margarita Delgado, who is a researcher at CSIC.
Another factor affecting the age of women at the time of the marriage of the anaroid offspring is the degree of education.
Research shows that the higher the level of education, the older women get married and have their first child.
There are also differences between women of the same generation.
For example, in the age group of 35 to 49, women with primary and higher education gave birth to their first child at 25.1 and 32.1 respectively.
"There is still another difference between women depending on their degree of education.
Women with basic education get married and give birth to their first child before they can find a stable job, while women with secondary or higher education do the opposite, preferring to get a stable job, before getting married and giving birth to their first child,” said Delgado.
Diane Kruger is worth it.
L'Oréal Paris has just added a new name to its prestigious list of representatives: Diane Kruger.
From next year, the German actress will be the face of the various products of this brand under the universal slogan 'Because I am worth it'.
'Joyeux No<0xC3><0xAB>l', one of the most elegant international actresses, joins other famous figures of L'Oréal Paris such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and Spanish Penélope Cruz.
Even before her, actresses Evangeline Lilly ('Lost') and Freida Pinto ('Millionaire from the Cottage') joined this selected club.
The men's part of this cosmetics brand is also represented by prominent personalities: Patrick Dempsey ('Grey's Anatomy') and Matthew Fox (Evangelini's partner in 'Lost').
British Fashion Awards
The British have a lot to say about fashion.
Their most prominent representatives – designers and models, past and present – met at the annual awards ceremony held in London, on the Royal Court axis of Justice.
No one was missing at the meeting.
Former model Jerry Hall and her daughter Georgia May Jagger, who was voted the best model of the year.
Poker Manuel Vicente
Manuel Vicent donates thirty X-rays of the writers he has encountered in his literary life (and in some cases in his everyday life) in 'Ass Poker' (Alfaguara, illustrated by Fernando Vicente).
It does not do so in feared and predictable genres (biographical similarity, life and work), but rather seeks something similar to the core of the creative personality.
The journey brings excitement and Vincent spares no trouble or inspiration.
This book is a great readership, even if you read it again.
Here are some of the observations.
On Albert Camus: "I have found in the pages of this book that the Mediterranean is not a sea, but a spiritual impulse, almost physical, the same as what I feel, but it cannot be called: the enjoyment of counter-destiny, morality without guilt, and innocence without any god."
“A nihilist, an allegorical Christian, wrote according to his own nature and not intellect, something between helplessness and ignorance, with a dazzling poetic humor, meaningless, as if it were the blade of a knife that almost killed him.”
About Graham Green: "Our man has been driven by the passion for this woman for thirteen years, fornication, pleasure and remorse, which is a spiritual privilege to reach heaven by the way of damnation."
About James Joyce: "This Odyssey was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the eight thousand peaks in universal literature that must be overcome from the north side, from which the best climbers often fall."
William Faulkner: "He was a strange man.
He said of himself that he was the heir of a county estate owner, and then that he was the son of a crocodile black woman.
In both cases, they were big dreams.”
On Louis-Ferdinando Céline: "This writer caught on the bridge the confused cry of this man from Munich to bring his echo to the night of the twentieth century in its literary form, fleeing in front of himself and calling into the future and rushing to the worms."
Dorothy Parker once knelt down and prayed, “God, my dear, make me stop writing like a woman.”
Joseph Conrad: "Spenser's verses were engraved on his grave: 'After effort a dream comes,/ after a storm a calm harbor,/ after a war rest,/ after a full life death.'
About Virginia Wolf: "He also carried his depressions in his luggage.
Her husband agreed to tell her that Edward VII was watching her among the Azalka or that the birds were singing Greek.
No man has ever been so patient and in love with a neurotic whose literary talent goes hand in hand with madness."
About Pío Baroja: "What else did Martín Santos do than focus Joyce on Baroja?
What else did Bennett do than have Baro executed by Faulkner's weapon?
What else did Cel have to do but make himself famous at the expense of that man's glory?"
Cowardly aggression
Last week, my seventy-year-old mother was walking through our neighborhood, in the district of Fuenlabrada, and a group of young people aged 15 to 18 went through the barn and our dog, a crusader rescued from a shelter weighing up to six kilograms, was beaten twice without a word.
Our resentment is all the more so that we see nothing fun in such aggression towards a small, defenseless animal that was also on the leash.
And the shock of the old lady after this incident, when she encountered these individuals on the walk, she also began to worry about her own safety, because such a devil-possessed man who attacks an animal is able to do the same to a woman, a child, an old man, or anyone who is weaker than him.
It happened at five o'clock in the afternoon, on Tuesday, in a normally quiet neighborhood.
The dog was crying all day.
We have, of course, lodged a complaint with the nearest Commissioner, but we doubt that it was of any use, and to avoid raising delicate questions, we note that these cowardly murderers were of Spanish nationality.
Annoyance has forced us to announce this fact.
We do not understand what is happening to today’s youth when they are amused by tormenting the helpless animal that gives us love, company and friendship.
We do not understand where the right upbringing, respect for animals and people has gone.
Michelin and Fesvial jointly for the use of helmets
The tyre manufacturer Michelin, in cooperation with the Spanish Foundation for Road Safety (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to support the use of helmets, especially for younger motorists, as both entities reported today.
The aim of this initiative is to highlight the importance of wearing a helmet, as it is the only way to prevent head injuries and deaths in the event of a motorcycle accident.
Michelin says the campaign is part of its commitments to road safety, which “means more than designing and manufacturing even safer products,” and has confirmed that it is trying to achieve this goal in the form of an instructional and information campaign.
This new campaign to promote the use of a motorcycle helmet, under the slogan ‘To be or not to be’, is the first phase in which more than 500 repaired motorcycles will be deployed to spread the word to the general public.
In conclusion, Michelin pointed out that road safety "is a constant problem" of the company, which is a manufacturer of tyres for two-wheeled vehicles and whose main goal is to constantly increase the safety of products.
Sales of light commercial vehicles are increasing.
Nearly two years later, the market for light commercial vehicles is beginning to recover.
All 9,425 vehicles registered in November in Spain represented an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and what’s more, this is the first increase after 22 months of permanent decline, according to figures of the patronage organization of Anfac manufacturers and dealers Ganvam.
However, it is better to quarantine the positive figure, since November 2008 is a very bad period for comparisons and has meant a 60% reduction compared to the previous year.
As a result, despite the increase in the last month,the total number of registered vehicles in the last 11 months is 40% less than in the previous accounting year.
Since January, 95,853 vehicles have been sold, which includes all possible vehicles falling into the category of light commercial vehicles: passenger car derivatives, pick-ups, vans, smaller trucks and light trucks/chassis.
And the clouds that are most damaging to demand have not disappeared, even though they were purchased by private individuals, most of the purchases were made by small and medium-sized companies, and in 100% of cases they are financed through third parties.
The constraints arising from the closure of a bank lending source should be accompanied by other factors such as the cessation of activity or the continuation of a bad economic situation.
In this situation, unlike passenger cars, the support for the purchase of the 2000E did not help much.
In addition to private individuals, it is necessary to mention businessmen on the trade list of small and medium-sized companies who intend to buy a light commercial vehicle up to 3.5 tons with a CO2 emission level not exceeding 160 grams per kilometre, but the number of operations has been confirmed.
Yesterday, Ganvam reminded that special attention must be paid to the management of these vehicles as well as industrial vehicles (trucks and buses).
The sales association expects that in 2010 the development will be similar to last year and, according to calculations, sales of passenger cars and 4x4s will fall by 19%.
The manual brake auxiliary system is already a compulsory equipment.
As in the case of ABS anti-lock system, it will also be with ESP stability control, with manual brake auxiliary systems, all this will become a mandatory equipment of European cars.
In fact, it is already part of the mandatory equipment of all newly registered passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, while for the others a deadline is set to remove the shortage, which is February 2011.
The measure introduced in the EU aims to increase the protection of pedestrians, while working in a way that can help prevent many collisions.
The auxiliary handbrake system increases the brake pressure in an emergency, which the system detects after the driver steps down.
But it is not always possible to maintain this pressure until the end.
According to a study by the automotive parts manufacturer Bosch, one-third of drivers who have an accident did not brake before crashing, and half of them did not fully use the brake power.
Up to 1,100 accidents
Conversely, this assistance requires the maximum of the braking system, shortening the braking distance of the vehicle.
According to a study conducted in the EU itself, if all vehicles were equipped with this type of equipment, up to 1,100 pedestrian-related fatalities could be prevented annually.
Reducing this number will be even more significant-according to calculations would prevent one of four accidents with an impact on people-after the introduction of the so-called intelligent handbrake systems.
In this case, the vehicles will be equipped with a system that (using radar or camera) detects obstacles and reports them to the driver, except for light braking.
If the driver reacts, it will help him increase the pressure on the pedal if necessary.
If the driver does not react, even if a collision cannot be prevented, the device will exert the greatest possible force on the brake and reduce the risk of damage to a minimum.
General Motors postpones plans for Opel until January
Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, told employees of Opel in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) that production of the new Meriva will begin in the first week of April -probably April 8- as Javier Ortega, the American manufacturer warned that to meet the recovery plan for Opel will need more time.
Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, is trying to get every point of the plan agreed first with the party concerned.
And as a result, it may happen that the final document, which will first be submitted to employees and then to the governments of the individual countries in which the production plants are located, will be issued with a delay in early 2010.
GM, on the other hand, assures that the decision to sell Saab should be made in those days.
It is no wonder that the Swedish government has increased the pressure on the American manufacturer to make a certain decision as soon as possible.
GM is making contacts with some new potential buyers possible.
One of them could be Geely, which also wants to acquire Volvo, but is considering the possibility of the Dutch sports car manufacturer Skyper, which operates under the auspices of the Russian group Converg.
In the event that it is not possible to agree with any of them, GM could sell some of Saab’s assets to China’s Baic.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year remains valid if the sale fails.
Driving with Porsche Boxster Spyder
In the development of this magnificent model, Porsche engineers used the Boxster S as the basis and managed to reduce the weight by 80 kg, so the weight shows only 1,275 kg.
Based on, first of all, the automatic retractable roof of the kg is in the canvas version of the kiln with manual control, thus the weight was reduced by 21 kg; furthermore, aluminum doors such as GT3 were used, which means an additional 15 kg less; removal of air conditioning, 13; reduction of fuel tank
Finally, removing the CDR-30 audio system means an additional six kilograms less and replacing the door handles with textile handles means an additional kilogram.
Also available with a dual-clutch PDK transmission, one vehicle with a manually controlled six-speed gearbox was tested, mainly on second-class roads in California, on mountainous sections with many intricate turns.
His behavior can only be classified as untouchable.
The weight reduction does not mean that the vehicle is not pushed to the asphalt.
Rather the opposite: we haven’t tested such a small and lightweight model for a long time, which at the same time would carry such safety when moving in a corner, even at high speeds.
He's a little athlete capable of warming up his muscles for a short ride for as long as it takes until we order him to sprint, brake, and resume motor use...
Whatever we want. Thanks to the steering, which is as communicative as it is precise, whatever we suggest with our hands on the steering wheel, is what the car will do.
And he'll do it with surgical accuracy.
Sound of the engine at will
The sound of the V6 boxer, about 320 horsepower (10 more than the Boxster S) is very successful and can be reinforced with the option of 'sport' and through a system that modifies the sound of the engine that was previously used in the Panamera.
The acceleration capacity is brutal, whether during suction or recovery.
Curtains are firm, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt roads we drive through with the Boxster Spyder were pretty damaging, but the car handled the mudslides well.
Electronic support was almost unnecessary during the ride; and at some corners we encountered frost and gravel even in the early morning at dawn.
Definitely this ultralight car is one of the funniest on the market, as it is a little more than just a modification of the Boxster S.
The car will go on sale in February 2010 for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>70,831.
"Bag Girl"
A girlfriend of Karl Lagerfeld, an icon of the Coco Cocoon series and an occasional starlette at the company's shows, the singer shows her face to the evil girl as vehemently as her Chanel handbags.
More than 'Bad Girl' or 'It Girl', it's 'Bag Girl'.
Basque Country wins victory in Israel
The working treasury won a brilliant victory in 82-91 during its hosting on the complicated field of Maccabi Electra, despite numerous absences in the Duska Ivanovice team, and thus came to the forefront of its group after the big performance of Mirza Teletovice, who was the best team with eight triple points.
The Vitoria team succeeded in replacing the significant absence of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas, or Mitzvah with a great deal of dedication and collective work, although it had to suffer to the end to win.
In addition, the high precision of the lap with 16 triple points contributed a lot to the final triumph.
The match started with the front for the blues, who stood on the mark from the beginning.
The fact that the first four baskets for Vitoria were from a distance already indicated that they had attacked the Israeli cooperative very hard.
English and Teletovic were among the main shooters 18-20 at the end of the first part.
The second quarter was similar, but the Alava team opted for Baraca's inner play and Eliyahu's work, which was accepted by whistling and applause upon returning to its original venue to increase the advantage before the break began (34-43).
Teletovic had already started to show himself as the best in his team with 13 points, although 'without six' in the rating of Splitter already indicated that it would not be the best evening for the Brazilians.
But even though the match was tough until the break, it was not decided at all, and the Maccabees wanted to remind Vitoria that not everyone wins on their field, and they were able to win by the 'hand of Elias'.
Eidson and Pnini definitely contributed to the return of the 'yellow' to the eviction (50-49).
More inappropriate
The members of Ivanovic, wounded but not dead at all, needed several precise games to catch their breath, and then the Mirza Teletovic machine gun appeared, which with three triplets almost in a row and with the help of English and Ribase returned the score to a soothing number (54-67), which reached the locals-67 at the end.
The Alavists were in the last half and English and San Emeterio (60-75) have already announced that they will not allow anyone to lose their deserving results in the first thirty minutes.
However, Pnini and Eidson, the best in their team, did not give up and tried to keep the team alive from the three-point line (70-77).
Despite this and with the Splitter excluded for the foul, Ivanovic did not rush and defend well, and although the Israelis approached the final minute (80-85), the match already had a winner andTel Aviv lost for the first time in a season.
Injuries prevent Unicaja from fighting
Unicaja lost significantly in Greece to Olympiacos and left him the leadership of Group B in the Euroleague in a match marked by three attacks by Unicaja, but above all by an internal game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated the Greek victory.
The Malagasy team was not afraid of the environment of the Pavilion of Peace and Friendship, nor of an opponent, perhaps one of the sickest in Europe, and with a large budget.
The game in the first quarter allowed the Andalusians to dream. Aggressive defense and three triple points in a row, two thanks to Omar Cook and one Guillem Rubia, brightened the field with 12-18, minute 9.
Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of Unicaja, although the arsenal of locals in the indoor game with Bourousis, Vujcic and Shortsanitis, turned the score 22-20, minute 13, which was the moment when the battle between the supporters of USABeverley and Williams meant the exclusion of both players.
The Greek team began to function and proved its dominance in both zones, where the absence of the English pivot due to Joel Freeland's injury and three personal mistakes of Carlos Jiménez burdened the Unicaja team.
Between the inner players and Lithuanian wing Linas Kleizas with three points increased the advantage to 44-32, the 19th minute.
Impossible retaliation
The third part was very offensive on the part of Olympiacos, who despite losing by 19, showed superiority and even managed to equalize the difference from the match in Malaga Malaga 66-48, the 27th minute, which shook the lead in the group.
Unicaja tried to overcome the absence and final absence of Scottish Pivot Robert Archibald, who was injured in the last match.
Despite all the downsides, Unicaja, thanks to the leadership and triple points of Cook and the contribution of Lewis, left a certain hope of winning 66-57, the 31st minute.
But it was practically impossible, because Olympiacos, thanks to the reinforcement and superiority in centimeters in his zone, proved that he is unstoppable.
Croatian Pivot Nikola Vujcic, managed to equalize basketball average 81-62, minute 37, and Unicaja defeated and handed the lead to Olympiacos.
How much should you pay for your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can get acquainted with the salary they deserve for their profile, thanks to the new Trovit app, the search engine with the highest number of classified ads from real estate, employment and motor vehicles in Spain.
The How Much Should You Take? tool calculates user salaries based on more than 140,000 job offers that Trovit has available in Spain, using a form that is available on Facebook, where to insert a profession, years of experience, age and the city where the applicant wants to work.
Within a week of the application working, the search engine found that the Spanish worker generally "feels poorly paid", explained in his report Albert Rivera responsible for the product Trovit.
According to the data available to Trovit from its search engines in the UK and France, Spaniards are the worst paid.
The British programmer receives 45,226 euros gross per year and the French 31,059, while Spain receives 24,000.
Similarly, the driver has a salary of 34,247 euros net per year in England, 25,751 in France and 16,420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the worst paid job in Spain is a waiter with 11,592 euros net a year; followed by a seller with 14,725 euros and a worker with 15,667 euros.
The most sought-after jobs on the network in the last three months are a driver, a part-time job and a social worker.
Brazil sets date for Zelaya’s departure
The Brazilian government has set a stay period for Manuel Zelaya at his embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The deposed president must leave the diplomatic mission no later than 27 January 2010, when his term of office officially ends.
Francisco Catunda, head of business at the Brazilian embassy in the capital of Honduras, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knows he must leave the embassy by that date, where he has been hiding since September 21.
"He is aware that on January 27, after the end of his term of office, he must leave and seek another refuge."
The station also quoted a former state official who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the deadline: “I intend to leave as soon as possible, logically under the auspices of the Brazilian government,” Zelaya said by phone.
After the November 29 elections (when Porfirio Lobo was elected) Zelaya assured that he would remain at the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, the same week he tried to get refuge in Brazil.
The operation ultimately failed because Zelaya refused the political asylum condition that the "de facto" government, chaired by Roberto Micheletti, was trying to impose on him.
Thank you.
After the days of wine and roses since last spring, when asset inflation was the prevailing mood in the markets, uncertainty has resurfaced in the markets, which should come as no surprise, as it is already a natural state in an environment where managers make decisions about the future that they are unsure of themselves.
The cure used by central banks to stabilise the market was to monetise debt by direct purchase of assets and indirectly release liquidity at a rate close to zero so that financial institutions could purchase assets for deduction.
The central banks have already confirmed that direct purchases of assets are virtually over, and without questioning their dissolute liquidity policy, they are starting to throw some sand into the ground, as the Spanish Central Bank did with its auction last year.
Investors therefore doubt the ability of the world economy to sustain economic recovery without such heterodox measures, and we are participating in the return of risk-reducing returns.
Stock market movements and bond differences of companies have regained points, although they are still very far away from the abnormal levels they reached at the beginning of the year.
States were forced to socialize private risk, which again touched on public debt.
Once again, the quality is under pressure, and the US, Japan and Germany have become the refuge of the chosen investors, thus expanding the differentiation of the eurozone countries against Germany.
Spain was hardly affected by this instability, but at that time Standard & Poor's came and threatened a new revision of the reduction of the qualification of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, certain uncertainty is not useless for the silence of moral risk advocates who have tried again to burden the consciences of those responsible for world economic policy to curb the devastating consequences of credit limitations on employment, when in fact a new day of thanks would have to be proclaimed.
However, the situation in Dubai is a tribal struggle between emirs for the restoration of power in the emirates, and as far as Greece is concerned, we have seen this before.
A government that hides the deficit, elections and a new government is coming up.
Prodi did it in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It makes no sense for Ecofin to save Hungary from defaulting on foreign payments at the beginning of the year and to allow the euro member country to default on its commitments.
What makes sense, however, is that Ecofin is forcing the Greek government to be transparent and to commit its own citizens to joint responsibility when emergency measures are needed to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we expect, we are ahead of the transitional risk premium normalisation period, after some excesses on supported positions would be within expectations.
In the Spanish case, while our gaps in public debt will increase as well as the bonds of European companies, we do not need to worry.
If European disparities were to be reduced and ours expanded further, this would be a typical Spanish risk.
The Standard & Poor's issue is just an anecdote. When our leading indicators force most of the study services to anticipate their recovery scenarios and revise their rise scenario for 2011, including the OECD and the European Commission, to return to the Japanese scenario, for the spanish economy it is not.
Again, it seems that it will be a great opportunity to buy Spanish assets, although for the time being "cautious, fellow driver".

President Iberdrola Ignacio Sánchez Galán was the first to speak before a sub-committee of the Chamber of Deputies, where Spain’s energy strategy for the next two decades is being discussed.
Following his intervention, followed by the speech of President of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villasecy, Galán gave the press several comments on the proposal, which he submitted to the subcommittee behind closed doors.
According to President Iberdrola, Spain needs an investment of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>50,000 million by 2020 and another <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>60,000 million from that date by 2030, if nuclear power plants that are currently in operation are maintained.
If this does not happen, investments will not be 60,000 million but up to 95,000 million.
Iberdrola really believes that in the next decade, investments should focus not on increasing production capacity, but on distribution networks and international connections.
From 2020 onwards, the issue is changing and there will be a need to increase performance.
Its offer focuses on gas and coal power plants with carbon capture mechanisms and, above all, on renewable energy.
In this case, it is believed that new 18,000 MW are needed, but with other "supporting energies".
Galan, who believes the woman’s bill on the sustainable economy, which has just been approved by the government, is in line with the line that the company has demanded, did not want to launch a vein as a royal decree to promote the consumption of national coal, which opposes policies to combat climate change.
In his view, the "clear long-term bet" in this sense, despite the "accurate" measure, as President Iberdrola called it.
Whatever the case, Galán believes that investment decisions, although long-term, must begin to be made now because their maturation is ongoing and a stable tax framework is needed for their initiation.
Ferrovial wins Aer Lingus 'handling' at 10 airports
Ferrovial’s subsidiary for airport ground services, Swissport, will play the role of the preferred partner of Irish airline Aer Lingus for freight services at ten European airports where it is present.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are among the most important of them.
The agreement, which has not yet expired economic terms, is valid for five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Junta Castilla-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed a cooperation protocol yesterday to create a Centre for Intelligent Infrastructure Innovation
The association expects an investment of 20 million by 2012, of which 50% belongs to Ferrovial.
One of the Centre's tasks will be to research energy efficiency at highways and airports.
Acciona aims for its first highway in Australia against Hochtief and Bouygues
Acciona is fighting for its first concession on the highway in Australia, which is a market where it already operates as an energy and water management company.
The construction in question is a tunnel estimated at 1.7 billion Australian dollars (about 1.047 million euros).
Its rivals are the French company Bouygues and the German Hochtief.
The five-kilometre tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane on the east coast has become the closest option for Acciona to settle in the country as a construction and concessionary highway enterprise.
The city wants the tunnel to be completed by the end of 2014.
After selecting the public-private cooperation (PPP by initials in English) for further development of the project in the business plan protected by Erns & Young, the administration already has the final list of candidates for the implementation of the construction and operation of the toll.
Bids are expected to be submitted in May, and the projected investment will reach $1,700 million (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1,047 million) and in the final phase, three companies with a significant presence in European construction will compete.
The Transcity group is led by Acciona, the only Spanish company in the competition, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of Australia’s largest construction companies and the second, based in Italy, is one of Europe’s largest specialists in underground construction.
In the game against the Acciona group is Northern Direct with the presence of the British Laing O'Rourke, the Australian infrastructure manager Transfield and the French construction group Bouygues.
The third and last group to pass through the network is called LBRJV and is owned by the Australian capital Leighton (a subsidiary of the German construction company Hochtief, here represented by ACS), as well as local Baulderstone (owned by the German group Bilfinger Berger) and a major civil construction company specializing in the construction of the city.
The Australian infrastructure market promises large construction and privatization, but it carries with it a clear difficulty of entry in a way other than through the acquisition of a local construction company.
The strategy followed by Hochtief or Bilfinger is still an example for the Spanish giants in the sector, in addition to the Asian references.
ACS gained market position through its 30 % stake in Hochtief, the owner of the cited Leighton.
Millions of assets
Acciona is investing in the geographic area with the greatest importance for the sector, where it already has a significant presence through its energy supplier activities and in the desalination trade.
Among other assets, it has the largest wind farm in Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria and runs a group of companies that build and manage a 700 million-dollar Adelaide desalination plant.
Its plan is now to consolidate these two areas and use common energy for access to the areas of construction and operation of infrastructure.
The toll road, promoted by the Brisbane City Infrastructure Office, called Northern Link, is to connect the Toowong West Highway with the Kelvin Grove Circular Route (see map) in the length of 5 kilometers of the tunnel.
The calendar set by the local administration is scheduled for the summer of 2010 and the start of work for December next year.
Although this paid crossing would open in the last months of 2014, full completion of the work is planned only in 2016.
The tunnel began to be designed in 2005.
It will contain two currents in each direction, an electronic toll system and a comprehensive ventilation system.
The Queensland government will provide $500 million (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>308 million) to finance it.
Brisbane has already offered this job Hochtief
Australia is still making a significant profit, as it announced a contract with the government estimated at $154 million yesterday.
Shared ACS will operate its national broadband network infrastructure with fiber optic cable through its local Leighton branch.
This situation will allow fast access to the Internet for 400,000 people and provide the German company with a job for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company abandoned the 27-story King George Tower project in the Australian city of Brisbane. Construction work was just about to begin and Hochtief closed the sale for $129 million.
In the UK, specifically in Manchester, he will be involved with Laing O’Rourke in the construction and operation of two school centres for 25 years.
The initial investment will be <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>75 million.
FCC awarded a tunnel in Slovenia for $64 million
The FCC, through its Alpine subsidiary, has received a 2.1-kilometre tunnel construction allocation for a 64.5 million-euro highway in Slovenia.
The company won the contract a few days after carrying out work to expand the tunnel in Bosruck (Austria) for 130 million.
In this way, Alpine strengthens its experience in the construction of tunnels.
The start of the work is planned for the beginning of 2010 and the deadline for implementation is 32 months.
Mrs. Rushmore won an ad at Renfe
Renfe has awarded advertising and marketing services to Ms. Rushmore for an estimated <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3 million a year over the past two years, the company said.
Ms. Rushmore was selected from among the 16 agencies that presented themselves in the Renfe contest, of which four went to the final, including TBWA , which was responsible for creating the ad for the last three years.
From now on, Mrs. Rushmore will take care of the design and production of the campaigns.
Fine of 63 million for France Télécom for braking competition
France’s competition regulator has fined France Télécom <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>63 million for anti-competitive behaviour in the Caribbean regions belonging to the country.
According to this institution, the operator has restricted the competition of fixed and mobile phones by signing exclusive agreements, pricing plans and loyalty programs with consumers on the edge of regulation.
With the sanctions, the former French monopoly and still state-owned company has purchased more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>560 million in fines since 1994 for placing obstacles on its competitors.
The fine imposed yesterday was de facto increased because the competition authority believes that France Télécom has committed a similar offence as in the past and that there has therefore been a recurrence.
Trade with Applications
On the other hand, the mobile branch of the French company is still a star among other operators and has opened an app store on the Internet in order to increase revenues that will not come from voice transmissions.
From the beginning, the Orange app store will be active in France and the UK.
It will be necessary to wait until 2010 to enter other countries such as Spain.
To play in the Champions League brought since the beginning 476.4 million to Madrid and Barça
The Champions League has been a source of income for these clubs since its inception in 1992.
To the extent that Real Madrid and Barcelona have made 476.4 million since then, making them the third and fifth most profitable club in the competition.
The list is led by Manchester United.
The list is led by Manchester United.
Winning the UEFA Champions League doesn’t just bring fame, it’s also one of the main sources of revenue for big clubs.
To the extent that the competition distributed <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>5,362,5 million among the 105 teams (including 12 Spanish ones) that participated in the event since the start of the tournament in the 1992/1993 season, according to UEFA data.
Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona have done very well in this division.
The White Club was the third on the continent with the most money it won for participation, and the only one together with AC Milan to win the main prize three times.
The current champion of Catalonia and the last winner of the lost European Cup in 1992 is fifth in the classification.
The list is led by Manchester United and Bayern Munich, the two teams that charged the most money for their participation in the last Champions League.
She lost both of them to Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country to win the most money through the Champions, although it has won the most titles of all (five against four for Italy, three for England and two for Germany).
Distributed
This seeming paradox is explained by the complicated money-sharing procedure used by UEFA.
For this financial year, the body, chaired by Michel Platini, plans to earn $1,090 million for the Champions League.
Of this money, UEFA spends 413.1 million on fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that participated in the preliminary qualifying round (including Atlético Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who achieved participation received 3.8 million only for their attendance, in addition to an additional 550,000 euros for each match they participated in.
There is also a prize for winning (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>800,000) and a draw (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>400,000 for each team). Eight finalists will receive three million each; eight quarter-finalists,3.3 million.
Each of the last four will receive $4 million.
The champion will make $9 million, while the second finalist will make $5.2 million.
Thus, the club will earn a minimum of 7.1 million and a maximum of 31.2 million on fixed payments.
On the other hand, Barça won 2.5 million for winning the European Super Cup in August.
In addition, there are movable payments, for which 337.8 million are allocated.
This money is divided by the relative value of each television market.
Spanish is one of the main ones and has four assigned seats.
The champion from last year will receive 40% of the money allocated, the second 30%, the third 20% and the fourth 10%.
The second part will be paid according to the number of matches that will take place this year.
Nueva Rumasa offers 61 million euros for 29.9% Sos
Nueva Rumasa Group yesterday published the details of the offer to buy shares, with the help of which it wants to gain a top position between 25% to 29.9% of the capital of Sos.
This percentage does not oblige to make a public offer for the acquisition (option) of all securities.
Specifically, Nueva Rumasa offers 1.5025 euros per share, which it would pay in ten years and for which it would pay interest for this deferral 1% per year.
Yesterday, Sos shares ended trading at 1.85 euros; therefore, the offer of Nueva Rumasa evaluates the company by 18% below the market value.
According to Nueva Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the real value of Sos.
The offer is conditional on the appointment of eight of the 15 members of the board.
The Jerez Group provides a 15-day deadline for shareholders to announce their interest in selling the shares.
The CNMV stated that it was not informed of the offer, although Ruize Mateose confirmed that it had contacted the regulatory authority.
If the purchase is made, the price would reach 611.7 million, while the capitalization of Sos is 254.27 million.
In the meantime, Sos continues to change the structure of his leadership.
As an attempt to stay on the edge of possible bids to buy and settle the judicial fluctuations of his former leaders, the brothers Jesús and Jaime Salazar, the election of Maria Luisa Jordá as the head of the internal audit was announced.
This decision makes her the first woman to hold a high position in a food business.
It is a newly created place, which will be subject directly to the president of the group.
And it is not excluded from the controversy, as the company is still immersed in the legal battle over the alleged transfer of more than 230 million from the Sos to the Salazar Brothers.
In fact, it is impossible to rule out the possibility that in the coming months Sos will reveal new transfers of funds
Regarding Salazar’s credit, former members of the council of Ildefonso Ortega and <0xC3><0x81>ngel Fernández Noriega (representatives of CCM and Unicaja) confirmed yesterday before the National Court that they had approved the transfer of 212 million without knowing their destination.
CNMV approves the exclusion option of Paternity, which participated Inversora Mer
The National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) yesterday approved the exclusion, in which Inversora Mer participates, against Federica Paternini on October 9.
The Authority has explained that it is authorising the operation, as it understands that its conditions comply with the applicable standards, and considers that the content of the explanatory brochures submitted following the amendments introduced on 2 December is "sufficient".
The CNMV clarified that the offer is aimed at acquiring 550.008 shares of Federico Paternina at a price of 7.65 euros per share, which represents 8.95% of the company's capital, which is made up of 6,142,786 shares admitted to trading on the Madrid and Bilbao stock exchanges.
He further explained that 5,592,778 million shares were suspended, which will not be able to be transferred in any way until the closing of the tender, which he specified that the price was determined by Federica Paternina in accordance with the provisions of the applicable standards.
New tools for valuation of cars
In these days of storms and accidents, not only car repairs make money.
Every day, thousands of cars that have suffered an insurance event are taken to the service station, where the expert must estimate the damage and repair costs.
No insurance event is the same, and calculating the cost of parts and labor time can be a long and complex job.
Calculating manually the repair costs from 20,000 to 30,000 euros including parts and workforce can take two or three hours.
However, with the support of new computer tools, it would be a matter of minutes
Therefore, almost 100% of experts use this type of system.
Service providers and solutions for estimating insurance events and maintenance are dedicated to collecting the information that manufacturers provide to them to then develop and offer their customers a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex, from the American group Solera, is a leading company; 80% of the evaluations are carried out with its products.
Other companies competing in the field of valuation and information development tools are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with data provided by manufacturers is not easy at all.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, Sales Director of Audatex, 63 manufacturers and importers work in Spain and each of them provides them with information in a different format.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed is still growing, as more versions, variants and engine solutions have been listed in the last five years than in the previous fifteen years.
As soon as the new vehicle enters the market, these companies will start working.
This is a very feverish job, because it is necessary to catalogue each of the thousands of parts of the vehicle and determine its price.
In addition, for each model, a "smart" graphics processing is carried out, where it is possible to "pump" individual parts of tourist cars.
As for the model with massive sales, the work can be finished in a week if the process is very fast.
As for a minority car, it can take three or four months. Currently, Audatex has complete information on 99.2% of cars sold in Spain.
Among the most exclusive models they have information about are Porsche, but not, for example, Ferrari or Lamborghini.
With regard to the fleet in circulation, they exceed 99%.
Audatex has eight centres worldwide (Spain, France, Germany, USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan) specializing in specific brands for documenting and database development.
The National Headquarters is in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There more than a hundred technicians (normally mechanics) work simultaneously with three computer screens.
Audatex invests <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>90 million annually in the development of these databases.
Every month, 2.5 million data are recorded and customers receive updates every two days.
The processing of this immense flow of information allows companies to make different use and provide different products.
The most common use focuses on repairs and maintenance, but there are also country-by-country tools for controlling spare parts or for calculating the sales or residual value of the car.
The only company that has a guide that informs you about the value of used vehicles in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not offer them in our country, but in the United States it does.
With the products offered by Audatex, it is easy to get support that can be used by professionals in the sector.
This company offers ten different tools, with the star product being AudaPlus, a standard insurance event award solution designed for experts.
It includes cars, motorcycles and light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of parts, it also includes repair time estimated by the manufacturer or painter.
This tool applies according to the use for each assessment.
The maximum price is <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>5.75 for customers who use it little, up to ten times a month.
Then every insurance company that makes thousands of estimates negotiates its price with Audatex.
Other products such as AudaVIN allow complete identification of the vehicle and equipment with which it exited the assembly line, only on the basis of the first chassis number.
AudaGlass focuses on vehicle glass and AudaSubastas is an open service to the professional sector on the Internet that allows you to exclude vehicles with an overall insurance event.
Its statistical service is very useful for identifying trends, performing geodemographic analyses or detecting deviations by brands or models.
For example, it is possible to study how many modelscertain brands went through service due to an accident or how many suffered serious insurance events over a certain period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of tools.
Among other things, it sells Gt Estimate, which is also intended for experts and also provides digital images, access to parts or prices and official manufacturer times.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa Group founded in 1971 as a service provider and solution for the assessment of damages, accidents or car maintenance
The Gt Guia award is its reference historical product on the market.
They work with 24,000 service users, 3,100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
Turnover increased by 20% per year over the last three years and in 2008 they accounted for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>10.8 million.
At the beginning of last year began the process of internationalization of the installation of the office in Paris.
Audatex was founded in Germany in 1966 and established in Spain in 1979.
According to the company's sources, 62% of her brother originates in Europe and 38% in North and South America. She works with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 services, of which 3,000 are in Spain.
Solera’s global invoicing (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) will reach $557 million, up 3.3% from 2008.
In our country, the company earns 19.1 million euros, which is 7.2% more than last year.
In 2005, the Solar Group was on the stock market for $1 billion, and now its shares are estimated to be worth $2,400 million.
It has been listed on the New York Stock Exchange since 2007 and is included in the Standard & Poor's benchmark index.
Online auction of crashed vehicles
In October last year, the Solera Group bought Autoonline, an online base for the sale of cars and motorcycles or special vehicles after an insurance event.
The transaction anticipated a subscription of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>59.5 million from 85% of the company’s capital, which could expand by the remaining 15% next year.
The goal of the purchase was to provide more value-added services to customers with access to a huge international market.
This valuation and purchase and sale service is exclusively guaranteed to professionals in the sector such as insurance companies, experts, rental companies, services, sales of spare parts and professional resellers who must register before starting operations.
The platform was established in Germany in 1996 and manages more than 650,000 operations across Europe, of which 500,000 are in Germany.
Among the main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
The site currently has more than 1,500 registered dealers and 4,000 experts.
It manages 3,000 daily ads and about 100 new ads are added to the Spanish market each day.
Under Spanish law, a car whose chassis number has been omitted cannot be put back into service, but can be used as a source of spare parts that have not been damaged.
Vehicles with a historical value may be allowed to operate, even if they have been discontinued, after preliminary driving.
Service budget in four steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, Audatex guarantees that the user gets a budget in just four steps: identifying the vehicle, finding a spare part, creating a budget and generating a budget.
Ease of use is a prerequisite for these systems, especially for the conviction of older professionals who tend to be more or less reluctant to use new management techniques.
The database contains 1,034 vehicles, including 666 tourist, 109 off-road, 137 motorcycles, 78 deliveries and 44 trucks.
Naturally, a computer with an internet connection is required for use.
After identifying the model to be repaired, using the chassis number, a real graphical representation of the model will appear, and then the necessary spare part will be selected.
The user can include variables such as labor price, surcharges or discounts, and then print and pass on to the customer.
AudaTaller is not a valuation tool like AudaPlus, but rather a reference catalog.
The main difference between the two systems is that it is service-oriented and does not include a workforce estimate.
The cost of using this tool for the workshop is 350 euros per year, which the customer can finance.
At present, Audatex is working to make these views three-dimensional.
This is an innovation that mechanics welcome, because it will allow, for example, to select a door and turn it to show the inside.
