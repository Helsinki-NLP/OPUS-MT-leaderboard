USA Gymnastics supports the U.S. Olympic Committee’s letter and accepts the Olympic family’s absolute need to promote a safe environment for all of our athletes.
We agree with USOC’s statement that it is in the best interests of our athletes and clubs, and their sports, to move forward with meaningful changes within our organization rather than de-certification.

This not only confirms that there were at least some dinosaurs that had feathers, a theory already widespread, it also provides details that fossils generally cannot, such as the color and the three-dimensional arrangement.
. Scientists say that this animal's feather was chestnut brown at the top with a light or carrot-colored underside.
The finding also provides insight into the development of feathers in birds.
Because the dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft, called a feather shaft, but have other characteristics from feathers—beams and bi-rays—the researchers inferred that the feather was likely a later evolutionary development than these other characteristics.
The removed structure suggests that they were not used for flight, but rather for temperature control or for decoration. The researchers believed that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows an adult feather and not a chicken down.
The researchers believe that the sample from the tail of the young dinosaur shows the feather of an adult individual and not the down of a chicken.
A car bomb detonated at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, yesterday morning, killing two police officers and injuring more than twenty others.

They found that the sun works on the same basic principles as other stars: the activity of all the stars in the system turned out to be driven by their brightness, their rotation and nothing else.
The brightness and rotation are used together to determine a star's Rossby number, which is related to the plasma flow.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is in terms of magnetic rotations.

The work carried out was mostly theoretical, but the program was designed to simulate observations of the SagDEG galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be a result of tidal-like forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the Moon exerts a pull on the Earth and causes tides, so the Milky Way exerts a force on the galaxy SagDEG.
The researchers could conclude that the dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as ordinary matter does.
This theory states that most of the dark matter around a galaxy is found around the galaxy in a kind of ring and consists of lots of small particles.
Television reports show that white smoke is coming from the power plant.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered the extremely drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal.
He said in an interview that the new variant was "very worrying and that there was cause for alarm due to its very high mortality."
Some patients may have got the virus in the hospital, Dr. Moll believes, and at least two were hospital health professionals.

“Glen Cushing of the United States Geological Surveys (USGS) Astrogeology Team and Northern Arizona University, Flagstaff, Arizona said: “Their thermal behavior indicates that they are pretty deep holes in the ground, even though they don’t behave as stable as large holes on Earth that often keep a fairly constant temperature through the day.”
In France, voting has traditionally been low-tech: voters isolate themselves in a box and put a pre-printed piece of paper indicating their choice of candidate in an envelope.
Once officials have verified the identity of the voter, the voter puts the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voting list.
The procedure is codified very precisely in French electoral law.
Voting ballots have been transparent since 1988, so that voters and observers can see that the ballots do not contain ballots at the start of the vote and that no ballots other than those that are correctly counted and come from approved voters are added.
Candidates can send representatives as witnesses to all parts of the process. In the evening, the votes of volunteers are counted under close supervision and according to specific procedures.

In her second race, which was a great slalom, she finished in tenth place in the women's sitting group with a total run time of 4:41.30. 2:11.60 minutes slower than the woman in first place, Austrian Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than Gyöngyi Dani from Hungary.
Four skiers in the women's group of sitting athletes did not complete the race, and 45 out of a total of 117 skiers in the grand slalom did not rank in the race.
Police in Madhya Pradesh found the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D K Arya said: "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman, and we have found her mobile phone and laptop."
The names of the accused are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Commissioner Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the defendants met in court with their faces covered.
Although there were three people in the house when the car hit it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver sustained serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed, while the rescue services freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was first admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was later transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been charged in the Edinburgh Sheriff's Court with the murder of his son.
She is in custody and waiting to be prosecuted and brought to justice, but evidence from eyewitnesses may be misrepresented because her picture has been widely published.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but Scottish courts operate differently, and the courts have considered the publication of images as potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee comments that "it seems destined for journalists to be careful if they publish photos of suspects, etc."
The Crown Office, which has overall responsibility for prosecution, has indicated to journalists that no further comments will be made, at least until the indictment is available.
According to the leak, the document will refer to the border conflict that Palestine wants based on the borders that existed before the 1967 Six-Day War.
Other topics reportedly covered include the future condition of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both countries, as well as the problems surrounding the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a constant military presence in the valley for ten years once an agreement has been signed, while the Palestinian authorities only agree to leave the valley for five years.
Shooters in the complementary pest control trial had to be closely monitored by the park officers as the trial was monitored and its effectiveness was evaluated.
In a partnership between the NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited under the Sporting Shooters Association hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the acting director of conservation and cultural heritage at the NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received comprehensive safety and training instructions.
A new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) of nine members was sworn in yesterday by Martelly.
It's Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, the resignation of the former CEP was recommended by a presidential commission as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
Martelly’s response to the widespread anti-regime protests that began in October was the Commission.
The sometimes violent protests were triggered by a lack of elections, some of which had not been held since 2011.
In about 60 reported cases, defective iPods have been overheated, causing a total of six fires and giving four people less burns.
Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it had been aware of 27 accidents related to the units.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed them of another 34 cases of overheating, which the company called "non-serious."
The ministry responded by calling Apple's postponement of the report "very regrettable."
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 local time (09:19 GMT Friday).
The Northern Mariana emergency department said there were no reports of damage in the nation.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there were no signs of a tsunami.
A former Philippine policeman has taken tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 at tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued, and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages including children and the elderly were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers later took the place of an elderly lady when she was going to the toilet. Mendoza was shot down.
Liggins followed in his father’s footsteps and began a career in medicine.
He graduated as an obstetrician and began working at Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working in the hospital, Liggins began researching early births in his spare time.
His research showed that if given a hormone, it would accelerate the development of the baby’s lungs in the fetal stage.
Xinhua reported that government investigators found two "black box" aircraft recorders on Wednesday.
Other fighters also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said "Luna was the first queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna died on the night with two moons. Quite unique, like herself. Strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was as wild as me... maybe even more... love her and will miss her... hopefully she's a better place now."
Of the 1,400 people polled prior to the 2010 federal election, the number of those opposed to Australia becoming a republic has increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the campaign for the 2010 federal election that she believed Australia should become a republic by the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34% of those surveyed share this view and want Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia’s last monarch.
In the various extremes of the vote, 29 percent of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints there have been doubts about his condition.
He could not take the medication necessary to fight his pains, as these are prohibited during doctors.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered on January 25 the largest known prime number to date.
Several people confirmed this discovery in early February using different hardware and software, and on Tuesday it was announced.
Comets may have been a source of water on Earth along with organic material that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets are shaped, and especially how the Earth was shaped since comets collided with Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, became governor earlier this year and signed a bill last month that legalized same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors “political fraud and stupidity.”
I wonder if he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that, according to the FAA, allows aircraft to fly shorter routes, save millions of gallons of fuel per year and reduce CO2 emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology, unlike older technology based on radars on the ground, to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with greater precision and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No extra transport is put in and the overground trains will not stop in Wembley, and car parking and park-and-ride options will not be available on the ground.
Fear of lack of transport raised the possibility that one would be forced to play the game behind closed doors without the team's fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported on the formation of a new bird species in the Ecuadorian Galápagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported that the new species was developed in just two generations, although it had been thought that this process should have taken much longer due to mating between the endemic Darwin finge geospiza fortis and the invasive cactus finge geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be processed into all kinds of shapes. It can be rolled into very small shapes.
It can be pulled out into a thin cable that can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into plates.
It can be made very thinly and put on other metal. It can be made so thinly that it was sometimes used to decorate the hand-painted images in books called "enlightened manuscripts".
This is called a chemical's pH value. You can make an indicator by using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color, all depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The PH value is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the test chemical.
Brintions are protons that have their electrons removed (as hydrogen atoms consist of a proton and an electron).
Shake the two dry powders together, then squeeze them together into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers, which will feel strange and form a kind of shell.
The towns of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flushing toilet connected to a sophisticated sewer system in almost every house,
Remains of sewage systems have been found in houses in the Minoan towns of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses where men and women stayed together in mixed company.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and reflects it down again almost immediately.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
Putting a satellite or telescope in space requires a giant rocket that is over 100 feet high.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The biggest thing that the wheel has done for us is that it has provided us with much easier and faster transport methods.
It has given us the train, the car and many other means of transport.
Below them there are several medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including loose domestic cats) that eat the much more numerous small prey such as insects, rodents, ferrets and birds.
The secret to their success is a concept of the niche, a special task each cat has that keeps it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social cats and live in large groups called herds.
The herds consist of one to three related adult males as well as up to thirty females and young.
The females are usually closely related to each other and are a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion herds react much like wolves or dogs in flocks, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other large cats) in behavior, and also very deadly to their prey.
The tiger is a good athlete who can climb (though not well), swim, jump far and pull with five times the strength of a strong person.
The tiger is in the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones who can roar.
The roar of the tiger is not like the loud roar of a lion, but sounds more like a sentence of whispering, screaming words.
Ocelots prefer small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds, if they have the opportunity. Almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than it itself.
Researchers believe that ozelots follow and find animals to eat (exchange) through smells, by sniffing at where they have been on earth.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision, and they also move very quietly around. Ozelots chase their prey by walking into one with their surroundings and then throwing themselves over their prey.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) is separated from the main population they came from (as if they move across a mountain range or a river, or if they move to a new island so that they cannot easily move back), they will often find themselves in a different environment than they were before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population needs to have different features or adaptations in order to be a stronger competitor than it had previously been necessary.
The original population has not changed at all; it still needs the same adjustments as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to their new environment, they begin to resemble the rest of the population less and less.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two population groups will look so different that they cannot be called the same species.
We call this process species formation, which simply means the formation of new species. Species are an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants make oxygen that humans inhale and they absorb carbon dioxide that humans exhale (i.e. exhale).
Plants make their food from the sun by photosynthesis. They also give shade.
We make our houses of plants and make clothes of plants. Most of the foods we eat are plants. Without plants, animals would not be able to survive.
Mosasaurus was the top of the food chain in its time, so it feared nothing but other mosauras.
Its long jaws had more than 70 sharp teeth and an extra set at the top of its mouth, meaning there was no escape route for anything crossing its path.
We do not know for sure, but it may have had a split tongue, its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosauras, and it may even have been a cannibal.
It also attacked everything that came into the water. Even a giant dinosaur like a T. rex would not be able to stand against it.
Although most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans ate some strange or unusual things, including wild boars, peacocks, snails, and a type of rodent called a seven-sleeper.
Another difference was that while the poor and the women ate their food while sitting in chairs, the rich men liked to have large feast meals together, where they lay on the side while eating.
Ancient Roman meals could not have contained foods that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and none of the ancient Romans had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built each of their gods a primary temple, which was considered to be the home of the god.
People brought sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to meet the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary, which only priests were allowed to enter.
Sometimes pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
The Hebrew family lived most of their lives outdoors.
Women made the food in the yard; the shops were just open disks facing the street. Stones were used to build houses with.
There were no large forests in Canaan, so wood was extremely expensive.
In the Nordic sagas it is said that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and when he traveled further west he found Greenland and called it Greenland.
But regardless of his discovery, Inuit tribes already lived in the area at the time.
Although each country was "Scandinavian", there were many differences between the people, kings, customs and history in Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you’ve seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that a tax card is drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
That's not true, though, even though it says something on the back of the document, it's not a tax card.
Inscribed on the back of the U.S. Declaration of Independence were the words "Original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776". The text appears at the bottom of the document when it is turned on its head.
Although no one knows with guarantee who wrote it, it is known that early in its lifetime the large parchment document (measuring 293<0xE2><0x81><0x84>4 inches x 241<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 inches) was rolled up for storage.
So it is likely that the comment was simply enclosed as an addendum.
The D-Day landings and the subsequent battles had liberated northern France, but the southern part was still not free.
It was ruled by the French government of Vichy - there are French who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with them instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, Allied troops invaded southern France; the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French forces had liberated southern France and were focusing on Germany.
A civilization is a single culture shared by a larger, significant group of people living together and collaborating, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, and is related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city state; and it also somehow defines the size of society.
Cities are the forerunners of nations. A civilizational culture involves the transmission of knowledge across generations, long-lasting cultural influence and fair dissemination.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence, and are not recognized as true civilizations.
During the War of Independence, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government—with the Congress as the only component—under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to impose taxes, and because there was no national executive authority or judiciary, they relied on state authorities, often uncooperative to enforce all actions.
It also had no right to circumvent tax laws and tariffs between states.
The articles required unanimous acceptance by all the states before they could be changed, and the states took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
Italy's national football team, along with Germany's national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and became FIFA World Champion in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fighting, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 motorsport.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Due to the cluster/group of islands that Japan has, Japan is often referred to, from a geographical point of view, as an "archipelago"
The history of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when European sailors en route past the island named the Ilha Formosa or the beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan that began a change in the original grain production practices, and employed Chinese workers to work on their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing dynasty (1644–1912) took control of Taiwan's western and northern coastal areas and in 1885 declared Taiwan as a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, after a defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Peace of Shimonoseki Treaty, with which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled over the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures: the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Temple with the three windows.
Most of the buildings on the outskirts of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what they originally looked like.
In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and excavations continue to this day.
For example, the most common photography format in the world for stills is 35 mm, which was the most widely used film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but more importantly, its aspect ratio has been inherited by sensor formats in digital cameras.
The 35mm format is actually, which may seem confusing, 36mm wide and 24mm high.
The aspect ratio for this format is therefore 3:2 (divided by twelve to achieve the simplest integer ratio).
Many common formats (for example, APS formats) are equal to or close to this image format.
The very abused and often ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining a certain order in an image.
It says that the most effective place for the main motif is at the intersection of lines dividing the image in thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period in Europe’s history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and influential, was examined in more detail.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion united European countries in spite of different languages and customs.
Its all-encompassing power affected everyone from kings to ordinary citizens.
One of the most important Christian dogmas is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the Church’s financial resources are used specifically for this purpose.
The central authority of the Church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money led many to question whether this dogma was properly lived up to.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain launched a blockade at sea against Germany.
The strategy proved to be effective and prevented important military and civilian supplies from reaching. This blockade was inconsistent with recognized international laws codified in several international agreements over the past two centuries.
The United Kingdom laid mines in international waters to prevent ships from entering entire sections of the sea, which was a danger even to neutral ships.
As there was a limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to the country's unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the attitudes of most citizens and nations were against pacifism and isolation.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, nations wanted to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to work for the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents on him, a collection of poems and a written recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his boss from his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China, different periods of time were shown in a unique way; each Chinese period of time or each family in power was a separate dynasty.
In addition, between each dynasty there was an unstable period of divided provinces; the most famous of these periods was the era of three kingdoms, lasting for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasty.
During these periods there was fierce war between many noblemen who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest periods in the history of ancient China. Thousands of people died in the struggle to sit in the highest seat of the great palace in Xi'an.
There are a lot of social and political effects, such as the use of the meter system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people, not to one ruler.
Even after the revolution, the professions were open to all male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and successful to do well.
The same applies to the military, because instead of class-based ranking in the army, the ranking was now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working class people from other countries to begin their own internal revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in relations beyond worldly life. He used to visit a cave that became known as "Hira" on the mountain "Noor" (light) to immerse himself in his thoughts.
The cave itself, which has survived through time, gives a very vivid picture of Muhammad’s spiritual inclinations.
The cave is located on top of one of the mountains north of Mecca and completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not at all easy to find at all, even if you know that it exists. When you are inside the cave, it is a total isolation.
Only the clear beautiful sky above and the many surrounding mountains can be seen. Very little of the outside world can be seen or heard inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders still standing today.
The Great Pyramid was built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E. and is one of many large pyramid structures that were built in honor of the dead pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis" in the Valley of the Dead in Egypt, contains several pyramids (of which the world-famous Great Pyramid is the largest of them all), several small tombs, several temples and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The "on-arc" mark resembles a V and the "down-arc" mark resembles a staple, or a square that lacks its bottom side.
Up means that you have to start at the tip and push the bow, and down means that you have to start at the frog (where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
Sweepstakes usually produces a softer sound, while sweepstakes sounds louder and more powerful.
You can always insert your own markings, but remember that the entered arch markings are determined for musical reasons, which is why they should usually be respected.
The frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11 years old Marie Therese and four years old Louis-Charles) and the king's sister, Mrs. Elizabeth, were forced back to Paris from Versailles on 6 October 1789 by a pack of market women.
They returned to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a screaming group of people shouting threats against the king and the queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to keep the windows of their wagon completely open.
At one point, a member of the mafia showed the head of a royal guard who was killed at Versailles to the frightened queen.
The war expenses of American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
The Philippines had to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial power to raise money for most of the expenses, and bond rates ran through the banks on Wall Street in the name of the government.
Of course, the superprofits from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people would constitute the fundamental gains of American imperialism.
To understand the Knights Templar, one must understand the context in which the Order was founded.
The period during which these events took place is commonly known as the High Middle Ages, the part of Europe's history that took place in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000–1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages preceded the Early Middle Ages, followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by convention ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from technology as a driving force or technological necessity, to a narrow idea that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic connected to scientific laws, as well as the way in which they result in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a route largely outside of cultural or political influence, and that technology, in turn, has an "impact" on societies that are hereditary and not socially conditioned.
For example, it can be said that the motorized car necessarily leads to the development of roads.
But a nationwide road network is not economically viable for just a handful of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
When many own cars, there are also more accidents on the roads, which leads to inventions of new health techniques to whole body injuries.
The romance contained a large element of cultural determinism, derived from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, it was geography that shaped the individual, and over time customs and cultures that were related to geography arose, and these were in harmony with the location of society and were therefore better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is today known as the capital of maturity in the modern world, Constantinople was considered the capital of maturity in feudal Europe.
It is known to be an epicenter of luxury since about 400 AD and lasted until about 1,100 AD.
Its status declined in the twelfth century, mainly because crusaders had returned with gifts such as silk and spices that had a greater value than what the Byzantine markets could offer.
It was at that time that the title as a fashion capital passed from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style was most prevalent in the period between the 10th-11th century and the 14th century.
In the beginning, the clothing was largely inspired by Byzantine culture in the East.
However, as a result of the slow communication channels, Western styles could slow down by 25-30 years.
By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest developments of the time as a result of the Crusades was that people began to use buttons to attach clothes with.
Subsistence farming is farming that is carried out to produce sufficient food simply to meet the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Subsistence farming is a simple and often organic system that uses stored seeds native to the ecoregion, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques, to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers have been involved in subsistence farming, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring like-minded individuals together who feel overlooked by societal standards and enable them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be characteristic due to the age, ethnic background, social class, location, and/or gender of the members.
The qualities that regulate a subculture as distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of several factors.
People who belong to a subculture often signal their affiliation through a clear and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, manners, and slang.
One of the most common ways to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw on the few unfortunate cases where children through failure, accident or deliberate neglect have not been socialized by adults in their childhood.
Such children are called "wild" or wild. Some wild children have been deprived of liberty by humans (most often their own parents); in some cases, this childish failure was caused by the parents' rejection of a child's severe intellectual or physical weaknesses.
Wild children may have experienced severe child abuse or trauma before they were abandoned or ran away.
Others claim to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived in nature on their own.
When raised by non-human animals, the wild child exhibits behavior (within physical limits) that is almost identical to the animal that has shown care for the child, such as its fear or lack of interest in humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes one step further.
Setting up is not a learning method, but a support for people who need to learn new things – for example, using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real, in other words a teacher is a kind of scaffolding, but it’s the little paper clips man in Microsoft Office as well.
Virtual scaffolding is internalized in the software and aims to question, ask, and explain procedures that may have been too challenging for the student to handle alone.
Children come into nursing homes for a variety of reasons ranging from neglect to abuse and even blackmail.
No child should grow up in an environment without nutrition, care and education, but they do.
We see the system of nursing homes as a safety zone for these children.
Our family care system is designed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.
A nursing family has the task of providing all the necessities that were not found in the home from which they were removed.
The Internet combines mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The specific characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of use and satisfaction.
For example, it is suggested that "learning" and "socialisation" are important motives for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "persistent relationships" were also identified as new motivational factors by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in the understanding of microexpressions, which are facial movements lasting a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that one can identify whether a person is lying by interpreting micro-expressions correctly.
In his article The President's Speech, Oliver Sacks indicated how people who are unable to understand speech due to a brain injury are nevertheless able to assess sincerity with great accuracy.
He even believes that such abilities to interpret human behavior can also be found in pets such as dogs.
Research from the twentieth century has shown that there are two different pools of genetic variation: the invisible and the visible.
New genetic variation is added via mutation, and it is removed from the pool of exact variations via selection."
Separation and recombination mix the variation between the two pools with each generation.
Out on the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like humans to satisfy their need for amino acids from available plant sources.
In addition, there are serious consequences of non-compliance: reduced growth, malnutrition and ultimately death.
The most readily available plant resources would have been the proteins that exist in leaves and legumes, but for primates like us, these are difficult to digest unless they are cooked.
Conversely, animal feed (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easy to digest, it also provides large amounts of protein, which contains all the essential amino acids.
All in all, it should not surprise us if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in roughly the same way as chimpanzees in the savannah do today.
Sleep disturbance is the process of consciously waking up during your normal sleep period and falling asleep shortly afterwards (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to consciousness without waking you up completely.
If you find yourself turning off the clock while you sleep, you can place it on the other end of the room, forcing you to get up to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options involve drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before bedtime, forcing one to get up and recharge the water.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses is quite the opposite of the amount of tension a person possesses in body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force. All people have the potential to find absolute peace and satisfaction.
Everyone can learn to understand. The only thing that stands in the way of achieving this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but was expanded by the love path of Mahayana and with a lot of techniques from Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of all-encompassing love.
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy is awakened to life (enlightenment energy) through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the Deity Yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, the energy channels are purified, the chakras are activated, and the enlightenment consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States. When the war ended, the difference in the system, process and culture of the countries led to the countries opposing each other.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies became enemies, and the Cold War began.
It would last for the next 40 years and would be fought seriously by deputy armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defences were already broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became almost obsolete from day to day when over 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Red Army seized and established the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading Poland's eastern regions in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Polish-Soviet non-aggression pact, and other international treaties.
The use of ships for the transport of goods is the most efficient way to transport large quantities of both people and goods across the seas.
The Navy's mission has traditionally been to ensure that your country continues to have the ability to move your people and your goods, while at the same time affecting your enemy's ability to move its people and its goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this is the North Atlantic campaign of World War II. The Americans tried to transport soldiers and materials across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, which mainly used submarines, tried to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain like the rest of Europe.
As far as we know, goats were first tamed about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to hold them so that they could have easy access to milk, fur, meat and skins.
House goats were generally kept in flocks that wandered on hills or other pastures, often supervised by goat shepherds who were often children or teenagers, corresponding to the more commonly known shepherds. These methods of shepherding are still used today.
As early as the 16th century, carriageways were built in England.
Although the carriageways consisted merely of parallel wooden planks, they meant that horses could pull heavier loads faster than on the slightly more uneven roads of the time.
Sweller was invented quite early to keep the tracks in place. However, it was gradually realized that tracks would be more effective if they had an iron piece on top.
This became common practice, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Finally, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first rails were used, which were made entirely of metal.
The first known method of transport was to walk, humans began to walk upright two million years ago with the emergence of Homo Erectus (meaning upright man).
Their predecessors Australopithecus did not usually go upright.
There are two-legged specializations in Australopithecus fossils that are 4.2-3.9 million years old, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs already seven million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly, we can become part of the environmental movement, and we can even be activists to reduce the future suffering to some degree.
This is in many cases like treating symptoms, but if we don't just want a temporary solution, we should find the root of the problems and disable them.
It is obvious that the world has changed a great deal due to the scientific and technological advances of mankind, and problems have become greater due to overpopulation and the extravagant way of life of man.
After Congress passed it on July 4, a handwritten draft was signed by Congressional President John Hancock, and Secretary Charles Thomsen was then sent to John Dunlap's printing house a few blocks away.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, which is now known as "Dunlap broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was carried out by John Nixon on July 8 at Independence Hall's farm.
One of them was sent to George Washington on July 6, and on July 9 it was read to his soldiers in New York, and on August 10 a copy arrived in London.
The 25 Dunlap sheets that still exist are the oldest surviving version of the document. The original handwritten version no longer exists.
Many palaeontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and still live. We call them birds.
Most people do not see them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
There are many things about birds that resemble dinosaurs.
They have feet with dandruff and claws, lay eggs, and walk on their hind legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers that are used today are based on manipulation of information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, e.g. 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary digits or bits, to now use computer languages.
Internal intoxication may not be immediately visible. Symptoms such as vomiting are far too general for a diagnosis to be made immediately.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open medicine container or toxic household chemicals.
See the label for specific first aid instructions for the specific poison.
The term bug is used by entomologists as a formal description of this group of insects.
This term derives from ancient knowledge of wall lice, which are insects that live largely as parasites on humans.
Both predators and bedbugs are nidicolous, meaning they are adapted to live in their host's house or nest.
Across the United States, there are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the largest neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system consisting of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to get MS as men.
A couple may decide that it is not best for them or their child that they have a baby.
It is possible for these couples to make an adoption plan for their baby.
In an adoption, the biological parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can take over them.
The main goal of science is to find out how the world works through the scientific method. This method is actually used in most scientific studies.
However, it does not stand alone, experimentation, and an experiment is a test used to remove one or more possible hypotheses. Asking questions and making observations also leads to scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and especially on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all scientific matters, including psychology, were accepted.
As the knowledge of Greek disappeared, the West felt cut off from its Greek roots in philosophy and science.
Many of the observations made in physiology and behavior often depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and the natural, biological production.
Periodic rhythms, which are not reactions to external periodic signals, have been documented for most living beings such as both bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-driving oscillators that will continue a period of free-running cycles, even without external signals.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the leading suggestions that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages or viruses to insert their own DNA into a bacterium.
They did two experiments in which they labeled either the DNA in the phage with radioactive phosphorus or the protein in the phage with radioactive sulphur.
Mutations can have a variety of effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected piece of genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas for the purpose of enjoying the landscape as well as plant and wildlife.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching and visits to parks as well as studies of information about the ecosystem.
An example is visiting, photographing and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
In the morning, people leave small villages by car to go to their workplace and are passed by others whose workplaces are the place they have just left.
On this dynamic transport ferry, everyone is connected to, and supports, a transport system that is based on private cars.
The decarbonized economy has detached the biosphere from the stable phase that has supported human development for a few million years.
Everyone is part of society and uses the transport systems. Almost everyone complains about the transport systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear as many complaints about water quality or bridges collapsing.
Why do transport systems cause such complaints, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental happening?
Traffic flow is a study of the movements of individual drivers and vehicles between two points, and their interaction with each other.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flows, because the behavior of drivers cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers typically behave reasonably consistently; thus, traffic is also typically reasonably consistent and can be calculated mathematically.
In order to better represent the traffic flow, there are established relationships between the three main characteristics: (1) current, (2) density and (3) speed.
These conditions help to plan, design and operate road systems.
Insects were the first animals to fly in the air. Their ability to fly helped them to avoid enemies more easily and find food and partners more efficiently.
Most insects can fold their wings along the body.
This gives them a larger selection of small places where they can hide from predators.
Today, the goldsmith and the daytime fly are the only insects that cannot fold their wings back.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system was moving around the sun.
There were divided opinions about his theory - some believed he was right, while many believed the opposite: that the solar system, including the sun (and even the other stars), revolved around the Earth.
It makes sense, because we can't feel the earth spinning, right?
The Amazon River is the largest and second-longest river on Earth, containing over 8 times as much water as the second-largest river on Earth.
The Amazon River is also the widest river in the world, and in some places is up to six miles (about 9.6 km) wide.
20 percent of the water that flows through the planet’s rivers and into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River collects water from thousands of smaller rivers, but the main river itself is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long.
Although stone pyramid building continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in size and technical expertise.
The ancient Egyptians in the New Kingdom were astonished at the monuments of their ancestors, which at that time were well over a thousand years old.
It is the smallest independent country in the world, and the country with the lowest population.
The Vatican uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language spoken by most of those working in the state, while Latin is often used for religious ceremonies.
All residents of the Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
People have known the basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper since ancient times because they are found in nature in their natural form and are relatively easy to dig for if you have the right tools.
The philosopher Aristotle had the theory that everything consists of a mixture of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air and fire.
This was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, although he had also had a theory that they change into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are basic mixtures of two or more metals. Do not forget that there are many substances in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
You may also have alloys that include small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter consists of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit into the point that ends this sentence.
That’s why the pencil was a good friend to most people when it came out.
Unfortunately, the pencil has lost its status and is being used less since new writing methods have emerged.
People now write messages through computer screens and never need to get close to a pencil pointer.
You can only guess what will happen to the keyboard when something new comes along.
The fission bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's a bit like pushing a heavy wagon up a hill, and when the core splits again, some of the energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to collapse under little or no influence.
The surface of the Moon is made of stone and dust, and the outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the front and 100 km thick on the back.
It is thinner under the maria and thicker under the highlands.
There may be more lunar gardens on the front, as the crust here is thinner. It was easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories are centered around finding out what makes people react or what appeals to them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they mature and reach adulthood.
The theories examine what is in certain people that causes them to perform certain actions, and what elements in their environment cause them to perform or fail to perform certain actions.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's theory of the need pyramid, and Hertzberg's two-factor theory.
In general, two forms of behavior can arise when a manager begins to lead his former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is to try to remain "one of the guys" (or girls).
This type of leader has difficulty making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary actions, performing performance assessments, assigning responsibilities and holding people accountable.
At the opposite end of the spectrum, you turn into an unrecognizable individual who feels that he or she has to change everything the team has accomplished and make it their own.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the team’s successes and failures.
This behavior often results in problems between the leaders and the rest of the team.
There are the same expectations for expertise for virtual teams as conventional teams, but there are small differences.
Virtual team members often act as contact points for their immediate physical group.
They often have greater autonomy than conventional team members, as their teams can meet in different time zones, which their local leadership may not understand.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique part of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team to which each of the members reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why should an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of establishing a learning organization? One of the goals of translating organizational learning concepts into practice is innovation.
Creativity and ingenuity begin to show when all available resources are effectively applied across an organization’s functional departments.
As a result, the process in an organization that works together to cope with an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process that meets the needs of the customer.
Before an organization can be innovative, leaders must create a culture that promotes innovation as well as knowledge sharing and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the Continuum approach as a method that can help organizations reach a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition. Therefore, it narrows the field of research and makes it much more accurate.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, trauma, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The development of new technologies allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes that we have never seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and materials to build simulation models that can help us understand our mental processes.
Although artificial intelligence is often associated with science fiction, it constitutes a very important branch of computer science dealing with behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
Research in AI involves being able to manufacture machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and schedules, the ability to answer customer diagnoses and questions, as well as handwritten recognition, voice and face recognition.
Such things have become separate disciplines, focusing on providing solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is now widely used in the economic, medical, engineering, and military business sectors, as it has been embedded in numerous home computers and software applications for computer games.
Excursions are a big part of any class. Quite often a teacher would love to take his students to places where it is not possible to travel by bus.
The technology offers solutions with virtual excursions. Students can look at museum objects, visit aquariums or admire beautiful works of art while sitting in the classroom.
Sharing an excursion virtually is also a good way to evaluate an excursion and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students from Bennet School in North Carolina design a website every year about their trip to the state capital, and every year the website is redesigned, but old versions are still available online as a sort of scrapbook.
Blogging can also help improve students’ writing skills. Although students often begin their blogging experience with sluggish grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience generally corrects this.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blog’s author begins to strive to improve in writing to avoid criticism.
In addition, "blogging forces students to become smarter in the world around them." The demand to give the audience what they want inspires students to be smarter and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to expand their learning far beyond the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs "can help students become more analytical and critical; by providing active response to internet materials, students can define their roles in relation to what others have written as well as describe their own perspectives on specific topics (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada’s charming bilingual capital and has a number of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada’s past and present.
Further south are Niagara Falls, and the northern part is home to Muskoka and other areas of untapped natural beauty.
All these things, as well as more, highlight Ontario as what is considered genuinely Canadian by outsiders.
Further north there are large areas that are quite sparsely populated, and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
A population comparison that surprises many: There are more African Americans living in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is clearly the largest and is a continent of its own when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or are connected to France and known for their luxurious beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the country, and the religion quickly spread to the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century with the discovery of the Cape route between Europe and India by the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama.
In the north, the region borders the Sahel, and in the south and west the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: it is recommended that all female travelers say they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It makes sense to wear what might look like a wedding ring (it just should not look too expensive.
Women should realize that cultural differences can result in what they would consider harassment, and it is not abnormal to be persecuted, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be determined when rejecting men, and don’t be afraid to say no (cultural differences or not, that’s not okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merenids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to leave it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya, and it was named Casablanca by Spanish traders who established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop throughout Morocco.
Around the ancient Medina, it is easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan goods such as tagines, ceramics, leather goods, water pipes and a variety of nips, but it is very touristy.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and is located in the eastern part of Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, particularly in the city center.
Despite the fact that Goma is reasonably safe, all visits outside Goma should be investigated to understand the matches taking place in the North Kivu province.
The city is also the base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano as well as one of the cheapest places to track mountain gorillas in Africa.
You can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. The normal (local) price is <0x7E>500 Congolese francs for the short trip.
Along with the relative inaccessibility of the city, it has made "Timbuktu" a metaphor for exotic, remote areas.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of endangered world heritage sites due to the threat of desert sand.
It was one of the major stops during Henry Louis Gates' special Wonders of the African World for PBS.
The city stands in sharp contrast to the rest of the country’s cities because it has a more Arabic flair than an African one.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa and runs along the border with Mozambique to the east and Zimbabwe to the north, while the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each supporting different wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions in South Africa and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As in all South African national parks, there are daily conservation and access fees to the park.
It can also be advantageous to purchase a Wild Card, as this allows either access to a selection of parks in South Africa or to all of South Africa’s national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives the territory its name and is the place that many tourists consider the primary focus area.
Hong Kong's skyline is a group of buildings that, by their reflection in the waters of Victoria Harbour, are often compared to a glittering column chart,
To get the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the Kowloon Harbour Front on the opposite side.
The majority of Hong Kong’s urban development is closely intertwined on inhabited land along the northern coast.
This is the place that the British colonizers made their own, so if you're looking for evidence of the area's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, stretching 80 km from the coast into Bangladesh and the hinterland of India.
Sundarbans has been added to the UNESCO World Heritage List. The part of the forest that is within Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are not just mangrove mushrooms —they include some of the last remaining vegetation of the mighty forests that once covered the gangetic plain.
Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2, of which about a third is covered by water/mosaic areas.
Sundarbans has been a wildlife reserve since 1966, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Bengal king tigers and about 30,000 chital deer in the area.
Buses run from the interregional bus station (on the other side of the river) throughout the day although most, especially those going to the east and to Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since buses in the district are often full, it is a good idea to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small, Japanese buses, which are both comfortable and robust.
Deletaxes is a fast and comfortable way to travel to nearby places such as Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable bridge that crosses the Oyapock River and connects the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guyana.
The two towers are 83 meters high, the bridge is 378 meters long and has two tracks that are 3.50 m wide.
The vertical free height under the bridge is 15 meters. The construction was completed in August 2011. It opened only for traffic in March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs control posts are expected to be completed.
The Guaranís were the most significant group of natives living in the area that is now eastern Paraguay, and they lived as semi-nomadic hunters who also farmed for survival.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycurús and the Payaguás, who survived by hunting, gathering and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly known as the "Great Province of India", came into the world in the 16th century as a result of the meeting between Spanish conquerors and the indigenous populations.
The Spanish began the period of colonization, which lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve a lot of its original character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams in the world as well as some of the best players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo courts in Las Cañitas.
Also smaller tournaments and matches can be seen here at other times of the year.
For news about tournaments as well as where to buy tickets, you can inquire at Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falklands Pound (FKP), whose value is set equivalent to the value of a British Pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands located in Stanley opposite the FIC West store.
In general, British pounds are accepted everywhere on the islands, and within Stanley credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
On the outer islands, credit cards will probably not be able to be used, although British and US currencies may be able to be used; ask the owners in advance to find out which payment method is accepted.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falklands currency outside the islands, so be sure to exchange your money before you leave the islands.
Since Montevideo is located south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics; in the summer months it is normal to have temperatures above 30°C.
Winter can be misleadingly cool: temperatures rarely reach below freezing point, but the wind and humidity combined make it feel colder than what is on the thermometer.
There are no particularly "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rain remains roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, wildlife is still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, you must be at least 100 yards/meter away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meter from all other wild animals!
No matter how submissive they look, bison, elk, bear, and virtually all large animals can well attack.
Every year, a lot of visitors get hurt because they do not keep proper distance. These animals are large, wild and can be dangerous, so give them space.
In addition, be aware that smells attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid bringing or cooking food that smells, and keep your campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port formed the framework of a notorious naval confrontation in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and the United Kingdom refused to leave the port.
All the ships were sunk except for a British cruise ship, and nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence, which was organized by the Mau movement, there was a peaceful gathering in the city that resulted in the murder of the supreme chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches because Auckland is close to two ports. The most popular are located in three areas.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour district) are located in the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
They are almost all sandy beaches with safe swimming, and most get natural shade from pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are located at Waitemata Port in the exclusive suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches with a good selection of shops along the sea. It is safe to swim here.
The most common local beer is "Number One", which is not a complicated beer but is pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines to drink, but the New Zealand and Australian wines may be better to transport.
It’s definitely safe to drink the local water from the tap, but it’s easy to find bottled water if you’re worried.
For Australians, the idea of a "flat white" coffee is foreign. A "short black" is called "espresso", cappuccino has plenty of cream on top (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate lives up to Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive, but in return excellent.
Many people visit the reef all year round, and people rarely get damaged on the reef for these reasons.
Always listen to the advice of the authorities, read and follow advice on signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Sea wasps occur near beaches and near river mouths from October to April north of 1770. They can also occasionally be found outside these times.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and will swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live their active life in the ocean, their primary habitat is in the river mouths north of Rockhampton.
Pre-booking gives the traveler peace of mind that they have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often have deals at certain hotels, although it may be possible for you to book other types of accommodation through a travel agent, such as campsites.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation arrangements to/from the airport or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They may also keep the reservation for you if you need time to consider the offer or provide other documents for your destination (e.g. a visa).
However, changes or requests should be addressed to the tour operator first and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, the majority of participants in music festivals choose to camp on site, and many participants consider it a crucial part of the experience.
If you want to be where it is going, you need to get in early to get a tent pitch close to the music.
Keep in mind that even if the music on the big stages is over, there may still be parts of the festival that play music until late in the evening.
Some festivals have special camping areas for young families.
Check where your cabin is if you cross the Baltic Sea in the winter, as sailing through ice can sound quite a lot for those closest to it.
Passengers on cruise ships are exempt from visa requirements (see terms and conditions), which is nice to know, as cruises to St. Petersburg give passengers time to see the city.
Casinos do everything they can to make sure that guests spend as much time and money as possible. Windows and watches are usually not present, and finding an exit can be difficult.
They usually have special offers on food, drinks and entertainment to keep guests in a good mood and keep them in the house.
In some places, alcoholic beverages are offered at the expense of the house. But drunkenness weakens judgment, and all real gamblers know how important it is to be sober.
Anyone who has to drive at high latitudes or above mountain pass should consider the possibility of snow, ice and minus degrees.
On ice and snowy roads there is low friction, and you cannot drive, as you would normally do, on dry asphalt.
During a snowstorm, enough snow can fall in a very short time to get you stuck.
Visibility may also be limited by snow falling or blowing, or by condensation or ice on the windshields of the vehicle.
On the other hand, ice and snow conditions are common in many countries, and traffic mostly glides undisturbed throughout the year.
Safaris are the highlight for many and are perhaps what draws the most tourists to Africa.
The term safari is often used to refer to land trips to see the beautiful African wildlife, especially on the savannah.
Some animals such as elephants and giraffes tend to approach the cars, so standard equipment is enough to see the animals.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes cloudy, and you can better see them with a binoculars.
A hiking safari (also called a "bush walk", "walking safari" or "walking safari") consists of walks that take either a few hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will take place from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held elsewhere in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, as it also hosted the 1964 Olympics.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the delay was announced, you may have problems.
Cancellation policies vary, but from the end of March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies do not extend until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
It is expected that most tickets to the event will cost between <0xC2><0xA5>2,500 and <0xC2><0xA5>130,000, with typical tickets costing around <0xC2><0xA5>7,000.
Ironing damp clothes can help to dry it. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board that you can borrow even if there is no one in the room.
If you do not have the option to use an iron, or if you do not like to walk with socks that are folded, try using a hairdryer, if one is available.
Be careful not to let the fabric get too hot (which can cause shrinkage or in extreme cases burns).
There are different ways to clean water, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas it is enough to boil water for a minute, in others it takes several minutes.
Filters vary in efficiency, and if you’re worried you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travellers may encounter pests that they do not know from home.
Pests can destroy food, cause irritation or, in worse cases, cause allergic reactions, spread poisons or transmit diseases.
Infectious diseases in themselves, or dangerous animals that can hurt or kill people, are usually not perceived as pests.
Duty-free shopping is the opportunity to buy goods in certain places that are exempt from taxes and fees.
Travelers traveling to countries with a high tax rate can sometimes save significant amounts, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The route between Point Marion and Fairmont offers the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, which often passes through isolated terrain in the hinterland.
Be vigilant if you are not used to driving on the road: steep hills, narrow tracks and sharp turns are plenty.
The prescribed speed limits are remarkably lower than on before and after routes — typically 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) — and it is even more important than usual to adhere to them accurately.
Strangely enough, the coverage on mobile phones is much stronger here than along many other routes such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German cakes are quite good, and in Bavaria they are very tasty and varied, just like in Germany’s southern neighbor, Austria.
Baking with fruit is common: apples are packed into cakes all year round, and cherries and plums make their appearance during the summer.
Very German bakery also contains almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts. Popular cakes and a strong cup of coffee often go hand in hand
If you want some small but full, cakes, you can try what depending on the region is called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
A curry is a dish based on herbs and spices along with either meat or vegetables.
A curry is either “dry” or “wet” depending on how much liquid is in it.

With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is an overarching term that covers a wide range of regional food cultures found throughout the country.
However, if the term is used without further elaboration, it typically refers to the food that originally originated in the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now the Javanese cuisine is widely available throughout the archipelago; it consists of a number of single spicy dishes where the most popular spices are peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
Stair beams are supports for the rider's feet, which hang down on either side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider, but can cause safety problems due to the possibility of a rider’s feet getting stuck in them.
If a rider falls off the horse but has a foot trapped in the stairwell, the rider can be pulled with if the horse runs away. To minimize this risk, some precautions can be taken.
First, many riders wear riding boots with a heel and a soft, narrow sole.
Next, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety straps, which allow the straps to be detached from the saddle if pulled back by a falling rider.
Cochamó Valley - Chile's largest climbing destination, known as South America's Yosemite, has a number of large granite walls and cliffs.

Alpine winter sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports activities that involve running down snow-covered terrains with skis or a snowboard clamped to your feet.
Skiing is a great travel activity with many enthusiasts - sometimes known as "skibumsers", who plan the whole holiday around skiing in a particular area.
People have been skiing for thousands of years - cave paintings dating back to 5,000 BC show people skiing!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back to the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Backpacking on skis: This activity is also called backcountry skiing, skiing or skiing.
It is related to, but usually does not involve skiing in alpine style or mountaineering. The latter is carried out in steep terrain and requires much stiffer skis and boots.
You should see the ski route as it was a similar hiking route.
Under good conditions, you will be able to cover slightly larger distances than if you walked – but it is very rare that you get the same speed as on cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack and on prepared tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through several countries would mean having to undergo visa applications and passport checks several times.
In this context, however, the Schengen area acts more or less as one country.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can usually cross borders without having to go through passport control again.
Similarly, with a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a separate visa for each Schengen country, which saves time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what manufactured goods are considered antiques; some tax authorities define goods older than 100 years as antiques.
The definition has geographical variations, where the age limit may be less in, for example, North America than in Europe.
Handmade products can be categorized as antiques, even if they are younger than similar mass-produced goods.
Reindeer husbandry is an important livelihood for the Sami, and the culture around it is also important for many Sami with other professions.
Although traditionally, however, not all Samis kept reindeer in great style, but they lived by fishing, hunting and the like and mainly used reindeer as traction animals.
Today many Sami work in modern trades. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the territory of the Sami.
Although the word "gypsy" is often used especially among non-Romans, it is often considered offensive because of the word's association with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of the Roma population.
If travel instructions occur in the country you are visiting, your travel insurance or cancellation insurance may be affected.
It may also be that you want to get advice from governments other than your own, but their advice will be designed for their own citizens.
One example is that U.S. citizens in the Middle East may face a different situation than Europeans or Arabs.
The advice is only a brief overview of the political situation in a country.
The views expressed are often with a crude view of the matter, general and simplified compared to the more detailed information that can be found elsewhere.
Extreme weather conditions are the general term for all hazardous weather phenomena that can cause damage or serious societal disruption or cost human lives.
Extreme weather conditions can occur all over the world, and there are different types that can depend on geography, topography and atmospheric conditions.

Regional and seasonal severe weather phenomena include snowstorms, rafting, ice strokes and dust storms.
Travellers are strongly advised to be aware of any risk of severe weather conditions that may affect their area as it may affect any travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country that can be considered a war zone should undergo professional training.
A search on the Internet for "Course in hostile environment" will likely give the address of a local business.
A course will normally cover all the topics discussed here with much more detail, usually with practical experience.
A course will normally last from 2-5 days and will involve role-playing, a lot of first aid, and sometimes there will be gun training.
Books and magazines dealing with survival in the wilderness are common, but there are not many publications dealing with war zones.
Travellers planning sex-change operations abroad must ensure that they bring valid documents for their return trip.
The willingness of governments to cooperate varies when it comes to issuing passports with unspecified gender (X), or documents that have been updated to give a person a desired name and gender.

Transgender passengers who have not been operated should not expect to get through the scanners with their privacy and dignity intact.
The current from waves returning and breaking on the beach, often by a reef or equivalent, is called a counter current.
Due to the underwater topology, the return stream is concentrated in a few deeper sections, and a rapid flow to deep water can be formed.
Most deaths occur as a result of fatigue by trying to swim back against the current, which may be impossible.
As soon as you get out of power, it’s not harder than normal to swim back.
Try aiming at a place where you won’t be caught again, or, depending on your skills and whether you’ve been discovered, you might be able to wait for your rescue.
Homecoming shock comes faster than cultural shock (there is not to the same degree a period of enthusiasm for the new), lasts longer and can be more serious.
Travelers who have had an easy time adapting to the new culture sometimes find it very difficult to adapt to their own culture.
When you return home, after living abroad, you have adapted to the new culture and lost some of your habits from your home culture.
When you traveled abroad for the first time, people were certainly patient and understanding, knowing that a traveler in an entirely new country needs to adapt.
People do not necessarily expect the need to show patience and understanding when returning home as a traveler.
The Pyramid’s sound and light show is one of the most interesting activities in the area for children.
You can see the pyramids in the dark, and you can see them in silence before the show begins.
Normally you always hear the sound of tourists and sellers. The story of the sound and light is like a history book.
The Sphinx is set as a backdrop and tells a long story.
The scenes are shown on the pyramids, and the different pyramids light up.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819 and claimed by many nations, have the most bases, of which sixteen are active in 2020.
Located 120 km north of the peninsula, the largest is King George Island with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception, where an active volcano’s flooded caldera provides a spectacular natural harbour area.
Ellsworth Land is the region south of the peninsula bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
Here the mountains of the peninsula meet on the high plain and form the 360 km long chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, which are divided into two by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern portion of the Sentinel Range holds Antarctica's highest mountain, the Vinson Massif (also called Mount Vinson), peaking at 4,892 m.
In remote areas without mobile coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
A satellite phone is generally not a replacement for a mobile phone, as you need to be outside and have free view of the satellite to make a phone call.
This service is often used by shipping, including pleasure craft, as well as expeditions in need of remote data and speech.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide you with more information about connecting to this service.
An option that is becoming more and more popular for those planning a Sabbath year is to travel and learn.
This is especially popular among those who leave school as it allows them to take a year out before university without compromising on their education.
In many cases, a course abroad in your sabbatical year can actually improve your chances of getting a place in a higher education in your home country.
There will typically be a tuition fee to enroll in these training programs.
Finland is a great destination for sailors. "The Land of the Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands in the lakes as well as in the islands along the coast.
In the islands and lakes you do not necessarily need a yacht.
Although the coastal islands and the largest lakes are large enough for any yacht, you get a different experience in a smaller boat or even a kayak.
Sailing is a national hobby in Finland, where there is one boat for every seven or eight people.
This is somewhat similar to Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but otherwise it is quite unique (e.g. in the Netherlands the number is one to forty).
Most Baltic cruises offer an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can visit the historic city for a couple of full days, where you go back and sleep on the ship at night.
If you only land with the ship's excursions, you do not need a separate visa (since 2009).
Some cruises have Berlin, Germany in the brochures. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not at all close to the sea and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
It can be a terrifying experience to fly for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have not flown before or if they have experienced a traumatic event.
It is nothing to be ashamed of: it is no different from the fear and hatred of other things that many people suffer from.
For some, understanding how an airplane works and what happens in flight can be a help in overcoming a fear based on the unknown or not having control.
Delivery companies are well paid to deliver quickly. Often time is very important when it comes to business documents, goods or spare parts for an urgent repair.
On some routes, the larger companies have their own planes, but on other routes and in smaller companies there was a problem.
If they sent things by air freight, it may have taken days on some routes to get through unloading and customs clearance.
The only way to get it through faster was by sending it as checked-in baggage. The airlines’ rules do not allow them to send baggage without a passenger. That’s where you get into the picture.
The obvious way to fly in first class or business class is to put in a large pile of money rather than get the opportunity (or even better, get your business to do it for you).
However, this is not cheap: as a rule of thumb, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal business class price and eleven times the price of first class!
Generally speaking, there is no reason to look for discounts at all on business or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know well that certain core groups of passengers are willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of arriving quickly and comfortably, and they set their prices accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chi<0xC5><0x9F>in<0xC4><0x83>u. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely spoken.

General messages in the subway are only given in Catalan, but unforeseen changes are communicated via an automatic system in several different languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-absorbed, rude and arrogant.
Although this is often just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to get along with people in Paris is still to behave as nicely as possible, you need to behave like someone who is "bien élevé" (developed). This will make it significantly easier to get around.
The cool exterior of the Parisians evaporates quickly if you show basic courtesy.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is filled with forest areas - mainly beech and conifer trees - and offers a mix of both alpine and Mediterranean plants.
It has a remarkably wide variety of plant communities due to its many microclimates, different soil types and varying altitude levels.

Here, along with many more common species, you will find rare fauna such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, locust, wildcat and bull.
During visits to the monasteries, women are required to wear skirts that cover their knees, while also having their shoulders covered.
Most of the monasteries have scarves for women who appear unprepared, but if you bring your own and especially some with bright colors, you get a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men are required to wear trousers that cover their knees.
This can be borrowed from the warehouse at the entrance, but the clothes are not washed after each use, so maybe you are not quite sure about wearing these skirts. One size fits all men!

Premodern observatories are usually obsolete today and remain as museums or educational sites.
Since light pollution in their time of greatness was not such a problem as it is today, they are usually found in cities or on campuses where they are easier to reach than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are huge facilities in remote areas with good atmospheric conditions.
Watching blooming cherry trees, known as Hanami, has been a tradition in Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China, where flowers from flower trees were the chosen flower.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom festivals were held by the emperor for himself and other members of the aristocracy around the imperial court.
Plants look best when they are in a natural environment, therefore, you need to resist the temptation to "just take one sample".

Since the first humans came to Galapagos, many mammals have been imported such as goats, horses, cows, rats, cats and dogs.
If you visit Arctic or Antarctic areas in winter, you will experience the arctic night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This provides a good opportunity to see polar lights, as the sky will be dark more or less around the clock.
Since there are not many people living in the areas, and therefore light pollution is often not a problem, you will also be able to enjoy the stars.
