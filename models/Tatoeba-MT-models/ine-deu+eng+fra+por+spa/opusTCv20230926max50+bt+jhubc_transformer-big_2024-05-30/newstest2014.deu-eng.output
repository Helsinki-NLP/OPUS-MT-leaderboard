Gutach: More safety for pedestrians
They are not 100 meters apart: On Tuesday, the new B 33 pedestrian traffic light at the village parking lot was put into operation in Gutach - in view of the older town hall traffic light.
Two plants so close together: intention or civil strike?
Yesterday, the mayor of Gutach gave a clear answer to this question.
"The town hall light was installed at that time because it secures the school path," Eckert explained yesterday.
The Kluser traffic lights secure both cyclists and bus passengers and the Bergle residents.
The plant officially commissioned yesterday is important for the Sulzbachweg/Kirchstraße junction area.
We have the museum, two churches, the spa park, the bus stop, a doctor and a bank as well as the traffic flow from the residential area <0xE2><0x80><0xBA>Grub<0xE2><0x80><0xB9>.
"Due to the high traffic and pedestrian traffic, there was another traffic light for their safety," says Eckert.
This is also confirmed by Peter Arnold of the Landratsamt Offenburg.
"According to current measurements, about 12,000 vehicles pass through the municipality of Gutach every day on the B 33, of which about ten percent are heavy-duty traffic," Arnold emphasizes.
Therefore, the construction of another beacon is more than necessary: "Security is simply happening here," says Arnold.
A total of four traffic shows were carried out, a roundabout was also envisaged, but due to the narrowness in the intersection area Sulzbachweg/Kirchstraße again discarded.
According to Arnold, everything was previously tested when selecting the stopposts: "By means of an extra truck loaded with particularly long logs for us, we tested whether these vehicles can exit from the Sulzbachweg to the B 33 without knocking over the stopposts."
The <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>15,000 light system itself is “the most modern thing on the market at the moment,” Arnold explained.
The system is equipped with colored LEDs that shine so brightly that the lights are clearly visible from the drivers, for example, even in the low sun.
And it is also economical: the older lighting systems consume about 100 watts, the new ones just eight watts.
There are three lighting systems per direction of travel.
Arnold explained the technology of the new plant: it is equipped with two radar sensors.
When the pedestrian presses the traffic light button, the upper radar sensor tests the traffic situation.
If the road is clear, the pedestrian will immediately come green, if not, it will take about 15 seconds.
Another radar sensor checks whether the green phase can be completed for the pedestrian.
“If a group or disabled people cross the road, the green phase will be extended, so everyone will be safe on the road,” Arnold said.
Of course, the driver has to think as a partner and observe the road.
This was not the case yesterday: barely the lights for pedestrians showed green, a top-class vehicle rumbled through - in bright red.
For more than 30 years, Josef Winkler has been writing to himself the needs of his childhood and youth from the soul.
The catastrophic events of his Catholic village infancy – the languagelessness, the inclination to raw violence and blunt sexuality, the narrowness and unpleasantness – the Carinthian poet has often described.
The Büchner Prize winner is best known as a prose writer, theatrical texts are rare in his work.
For his performance "Wetterlichten auf der Zungenspitze", which can now be seen in the Garage X at Petersplatz, Gerhard Fresacher compiles a collage of prose texts.
The theatremaker combines elements from the autobiographically imprinted novel "Der Leibigene" (1987) with prosaminiatures from "Leichnam, seine Familie belauernd" (2003).
On the largely empty stage - an important prop: a cranky sofa, on which it is implied that it is copulated and masturbated - the eight-piece ensemble hangs through the text material.
However, the director seems to have little confidence in the text.
The 70-minute performance overflows the template with an abundance of directorial incidents, known from the repertoire of post-dramatic forms of play.
Especially the actresses come to the occasional somewhat questionable stage implementations.
They are touched hard, submerged with their heads under water, tacked to the wall with their evening drops.
Forced into cellophane or cod, they strike at dangerously high stalks through the staging, either monologize loudly or lie completely silent on the stage floor.
However, the text hardly conveys itself in this stressful way.
The best moments are in the evening when singing - the bandwidth ranges from Deep Purple to folk songs.
Only towards the end does the twisted performance come to a bit of a rest, and Winkler’s seemingly absurd humor flashes up.
A black box in the car?
U.S. road planners are looking for a source of money to repair the decaying highway system, and believe they have found the solution in a small black box that fits in the dashboard of every car.
The devices that record every mile driven and report the information to the authorities are at the heart of a controversial attempt by Washington and state planning offices to revise the outdated system for financing U.S. roads.
The usually rather boring area of road planning has suddenly sparked an intense debate with colorful alliances.
Libertarians have teamed up with environmental groups and are calling for the government to use the small boxes to record the kilometers traveled – and possibly where they were driven – and then use the information to calculate tax returns.
The tea party is horrified.
The American Civil Rights Association (ACLU) is also deeply concerned and expresses a number of privacy concerns.
But while Congress cannot agree on a move, several states are no longer waiting.
They are currently examining how to switch to a system where drivers pay per mile driven over the next ten years.
Thousands of drivers have already tested the dials, some of which are equipped with GPS monitoring.
This is really a must for our country.
“It’s not something we’ll just possibly use,” said Hasan Ikhrata, managing director of the Southern California Assn. of Governments, which plans to record the miles driven by all California drivers in the state from 2025.
The way we pay these taxes will change.
The technology for that is there.
The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund, funded from the taxes Americans pay at the pinnacle, is bankrupt.
In America, however, there is no longer as much gasoline as before.
Cars use less gasoline.
The state mineral oil tax of 18.4 cents per gallon (less than 4 eurocents per liter) has not increased in 20 years.
Politicians do not dare to raise the tax even by a penny at high alcohol prices.
“The gasoline tax is simply not sustainable,” said Lee Munnich, a transport law expert at the University of Minnesota.
His state has recently equipped 500 cars with tachographs to test a mileage-based payment system.
“This is the most meaningful alternative in the long term,” he said.
Bureaucrats refer to it as a mileage-based user fee.
It is not surprising that the idea is appealing to urban liberals, because the tax could be used, for example, to influence driving behaviour in such a way as to reduce congestion and climate-damaging exhaust gases.
The California planners are relying on the system to develop strategies to achieve the state’s ambitious, legally anchored goals on climate change.
But Republican Bill Shuster of Pennsylvania, chairman of the House Transportation Committee, also said he sees it as the most viable long-term alternative.
The free marketers of the Reason Foundation are also driven by the idea of having drivers pay for a distance traveled.
“This is not a tax that disappears in a black hole,” said Adrian Moore, vice president of policy at Reason.
People pay directly for what they get.
The movement is also supported by two former U.S. Transportation Ministers who, in a 2011 report, urged Congress to move toward miles-based billing.
Last year, the U.S. Senate approved a $90 million pilot project that would cover 10,000 cars.
But the majority in the House of Representatives prevented the advance, responding to the concerns of MPs from rural areas, who represent people who often have to travel many miles on the way to work or to the city in everyday life.
Nevertheless, several states and big cities are moving in this direction on their own.
The most committed is Oregon, which currently recruits 5,000 drivers for the country’s largest experiment.
These drivers will soon pay the mileage fees instead of the mineral oil tax to the state.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York City also considers one.
Illinois is testing it to a limited extent with trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes the transport ministries of 17 states on the east coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is currently investigating how to introduce the change.
The concept is not a universal hit.
In Nevada, where 50 volunteers were recently equipped with the devices, drivers were skeptical of the idea that the government could track each of their movements.
“Concerns about Big Brother and things like that were a big problem,” said Alauddin Khan, Head of Strategy and Results Management at the Nevada Department of Transportation.
The people didn't want it.
As the test began, the Nevada ACLU warned on its website: “It would be relatively easy to turn the tachographs into adult surveillance devices.”
There is no need to build a gigantic, bulky technological infrastructure that would inevitably be used to capture data about the daily movements of individuals.
Nevada is one of a number of states that are now looking for affordable technology that will allow the state to track the kilometres traveled, but not exactly when and where.
That, Khan said, would also reassure the public.
The hunt for this technology has led some authorities to a small startup company called True Mileage in California.
The company did not initially step in to help state governments tax drivers.
Rather, it was their goal to set foot in an emerging market for car insurance, where drivers should pay based on the miles driven.
But the devices tested by her are also interesting for road planners, because they do not work with GPS and only provide limited information, which is regularly uploaded via modem.
“People are more likely to get involved if their speed and locations are not recorded,” said Ryan Morrison, Managing Director of True Mileage.
Some of these public pilot programs have made major mistakes.
There are much cheaper and less intrusive ways to implement this.
In Oregon, planners are experimenting with giving drivers a range of choices.
You can choose a device with or without GPS.
Or they don’t choose a device at all and instead pay a flat fee based on the average mileage driven by all residents of the state.
Others hope to sell the concept of a suspicious public by equipping the devices with more functions than with fewer.
In New York City, traffic officials want to develop a taxation device that can also pay parking fees, only have to pay insurance for kilometers driven, and collect speed data from other vehicles in real time, thanks to which drivers can avoid congestion.
“Drivers would be motivated to participate by the added value of the system,” the city’s planning document states.
However, some traffic planners wonder if the whole talk about paying per mile is not just a huge distraction.
At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission for the San Francisco Bay area, officials said Congress could solve the problem of the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund simply by raising the fuel tax.
An additional one-off fee or annual levy could be imposed on drivers with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that consume little gasoline, so that they too pay a fair share.
“There is no reason for an operation if an aspirin is enough,” said Randy Rentschler, the Commission’s head of legislation and public affairs.
When we do that, hundreds of millions of drivers worry about their privacy and numerous other things.
Kingsfield: Small team beats up
The Volunteer Fire Department handled its autumn main rehearsal with bravery despite shortages of personnel.
Only eleven men took part in the exercise.
Department commander Hans Kammerer had chosen the property Feather in Burgberger Straße in his exercise assumption.
There should have been a short circuit during sawing.
Two people were injured in the fire and smoke, but one of them was able to send an emergency call.
After the first inspection of the situation by Hans Kammerer, two Wehr respiratory protectors made themselves ready to enter the building.
After a short time, they managed to find the first person and guide them out into the open.
The second person had to be worn.
This was not so easy, as there was also a narrow staircase to overcome.
The building, a workshop with an integrated stable for two horses, was not easy to secure.
There was a lot of wood and also straw balls in it.
There were also electric machines for woodworking.
The first extinguishing attack took place via the tank in the vehicle.
A further line was made via an overflow hydrant at a distance of about 100 meters.
Now three erasure attacks could be designed.
A hollow jet tube was also used in the building.
Hans Kammerer was also about showing what to do with little available staff.
In the event of an emergency, support is provided via the Königsfeld Day Operations Group.
The commander was satisfied with the course of the exercise.
Connecting universities and companies is important
During his visit to the district of Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald, Landtagspräsident Guido Wolf was also able to find out in Titisee-Neustadt where the workers of tomorrow come from.
In the Förderzentrum Hochschwarzwald he followed this important question together with the managing directors of the Vocational Schools as well as of the Kreisgymnasium and the chairman of the Parenting Advisory Board.
"Education is an important location factor," stressed Claudia Stehle, director of the Hans-Thoma-Schule, who presented the networked school project High Black Forest Education Center.
Wolf was impressed with the model projects for training.
Since 2011, there has been a successful collaboration between the Förderzentrum, Kreisgymnasium and the Berufsschulenzentrum in the Waldstadt.
He also praised the family friendliness in the county.
"It is important not only to keep in mind the family phase, but also, due to demographic change, the phase of caring for relatives," Wolf explained.
He also said that more and more employees were taking care of their relatives and caring for them.
"Without the support of employers, the resulting burden on employees can lead to a termination of the employment relationship," Wolf said.
But no one could afford to lose skilled workers, he said.
Another particularly important factor is the networking of universities and companies.
"Because those who have already learned the advantages of the region during their studies, with their acquired knowledge and skills, will often be preserved by the regional economy, which contributes to the strengthening of the region," said the president of the Landtag.
Because only if sufficient training places were offered could the need for skilled workers be met.
In his opinion, the advantage of the county is its advantageous location in the southwest of Germany, close to France and Switzerland.
On his train journey from Titisee-Neustadt to Freiburg, he also experienced the efforts already made to expand public passenger transport.
"Continue to be persistent and make sure that public transport improves," he told the address of the local politicians present.
Experience an entertaining afternoon with music
For 15 years, the Kaul family has been inviting the Dietinger seniors to coffee, cakes and then a vesper.
In the past, the elderly were hosted in the resting place.
In the meantime, this afternoon takes place in the nursing home St. Joseph.
The locals were looking forward to the delicious cakes and cakes.
Later there was sausage salad.
Silvia Kimmich-Bantle and her father, Karl Kimmich, performed popular tunes.
The over 100-year-old natural stone wall as the front demarcation of the old schoolyard facing renovation to Kirchstraße is to be added to the renovation cost plan of the city of Bräunlingen.
In the days before the Kilbig, during the first works of renovation of the front schoolyard, a small corner wall was installed to stabilize and static relief of the over a hundred-year-old natural stone wall with balustrade.
The next step, according to Alexander Misok of the Bräunlinger Stadtbauamt, is to include the State Memorial Office in the planning and to create a renovation concept for the old wall.
After that, a cost calculation will be made by experts, which will then be placed on the table of the municipal council for the decision and determination of the next procedure.
A decision on this is expected to be made as early as next year.
After the renovation, paving and tree planting of the old school courtyard within the two side wings of the school built in 1912, the renovation-needing boundary wall must be renovated from the ground up and placed on new foundations in the foreseeable future.
The historic, one-hundred-year-old demarcation wall of the old schoolyard to the church street, is mainly due to water and frost damage, as there is no drainage, needs renovation and has a bow tilt forward.
Deep cracks in individual stones testify to weather damage, however, the wall is not currently at risk of collapse.
A standing wall is a prerequisite for a schoolyard used by students, which is done through the current mounting work.
Initially, the renovation of the schoolyard was planned even in 2008/2009, but high unplanned expenses brought a shift.
An important word in the historic renovation of the school wall, which has even been used for filming, will be shared by the National Memorial Office.
Should specifications come from this page, then the city of Bräunlingen hopes for grants from the monument protectors.
The students of the Bräunling primary school, who are now being taught again in a well-renovated old school building with a new classroom, will soon be able to use the old school yard.
<0xC3><0x96>zdemir wants to receive jazz training in Stuttgart
Cem <0xC3><0x96>zdemir, Federal President of the Greens, has also joined the ongoing discussions about the future of the music colleges in Baden-Württemberg.
"I think it is wrong to abandon the holistic education at the Musikhochschule Stuttgart," <0xC3><0x96>zdemir told "Stuttgarter Nachrichten".
Jazz and classics are part of the jazz venue Stuttgart.
With this, <0xC3><0x96>zdemir, who in Stuttgart is considered a favorite for a direct mandate in the September 22nd Bundestag elections, contradicts the Green-Red state government.
On the basis of an expert study, this enforces a reorganisation of the five music colleges in Baden-Württemberg.
Afterwards, the Jazz and Pop programme will be transferred from the Musikhochschule Stuttgart to the Musikhochschule Mannheim.
U.S. Border: "Super Tunnel" for Drug Smuggling Discovered
At the border between Mexico and the United States, investigators have discovered and shut down a "super tunnel" for drug smuggling.
According to U.S. customs officials, the more than 500-metre-long tube between Tijuana and San Diego was equipped with electricity, railroads and a ventilation system.
Three suspects were arrested and eight tons of marijuana and nearly 150 kilograms of cocaine confiscated.
The tunnel was reportedly not in use yet.
“These cartels are stupid if they think they could dig under the radar,” U.S. District Attorney General Laura Duffy said at a press conference outside a warehouse in San Diego, where one end of the tunnel had been discovered.
“If you continue to build such tunnels and try to use them, we are determined to make this a huge waste of your dirty money,” Duffy said.
Both the U.S. authorities and the Mexican security forces are in an ongoing fight against the drug cartel.
Since 2006, more than 77,000 people have been killed in connection with drug crime in Mexico.
Designed by experts
Due to the complex equipment of the tunnel, the investigators assume that it was designed by architects and engineers and that the construction took about a year.
The rail system was equipped in such a way that electric vehicles could be used there.
On the Mexican side, the access is in a building that is 80 meters from the border.
According to authorities, a ladder leads 20 meters deep to the actual tunnel entrance.
The tunnel has a cross section of 1.20 meters high and 90 centimeters wide.
It would also have been suitable to encourage illegal immigration to the United States.
Two of the suspects were arrested in connection with the cocaine discovery.
The third, a Mexican, was arrested for the seizure of marijuana.
All three are threatened with life imprisonment, officials said.
Since 2006, eight such tunnels have been discovered, it was further stated at the press conference in San Diego.
This is the first time cocaine has been found in such a tunnel.
Normally, cocaine is smuggled in smaller quantities and not through tunnels.
This shows the "desperation" of the drug gangs, whose traditional routes have now been cut off, said Bill Sherman of the DEA's drug search in San Diego.
They would do anything to get to the United States.
No details of the detainees were disclosed, at least one being Mexican, it said.
You must expect up to ten years in prison.
2014 will be Geisinger festive year
The anniversary of the city of Geisingen on the occasion of the 1250.
The return of the first documentary mention is getting closer and closer.
If the year ends in just eight weeks, the anniversary year will come to an end.
Geisingen and church houses were first documented together in 794.
In churches, a document has been produced mentioning both places.
On March 15, there will be an official opening for the anniversary year, and since Geisingen currently has no hall, this opening event takes place in the place where both were first mentioned 1250 years ago, in church houses.
As part of the anniversary, several events are planned both in Geisingen and in church houses.
Church houses will be the 1250 on a festive weekend in July from 18th to 20th July.
Celebrate the return.
On Friday with a festive act, on Saturday and Sunday with a feast around the Kirchtalhalle.
On this holiday weekend is also the Kirchen-Hausener Kirchenfest.
City music director Rudolf Barth has written a commissioned composition for the city on the occasion of the anniversary, which is listed on three dates.
On 21 June together with the Sunday celebration of the Black Forest Association, on 12 July in the Arena with fireworks and on 13 December as the first concert of city music in the new festival hall.
This will be completed and inaugurated in the anniversary year, the official date is on the last weekend of September, on 27 and 28 September.
On the occasion of the Geisinger Stadtjubiläum, a new chronicle is also released.
"But it should become a chronicle not only of Geisingen itself, but a printed work about the geising of today, which consists of Geisingen, churches-houses, Leipferdingen, Aulfingen and Gutmadingen," says Mayor Walter Hengstler.
And also the geising of today celebrates 2014 birthday, 1974 the present space was completed with the inclusions.
The new chronicle will then be presented on 21 or 22 November in the new festival hall in Geisingen.
2014 is also a year with many anniversaries.
The Narrenzunft Strohglonki starts on February 8 with a custom evening on the occasion of its 60th anniversary, the Harmonie Gutmadingen turns 90 and has the festive banquet on March 29 and then celebrates the district music festival from May 1 to 4.
The Altenwerk Leipzig turns 40 years old, the Geisinger School has been at the new location for 50 years and celebrates this on 10 May, the Musikverein Polyhymnia Leipzig turns 150 years old and celebrates this as part of the well festival from 4 to 7 July.
The city of Geisingen was first mentioned in a document of donation, which is owned by the monastery of St. Gallen, in 764.
The document was produced in churches (houses), which at the time was the courthouse.
Both municipalities are therefore mentioned in the same document.
The reason for celebrating this 1250th anniversary in 2014 is also the fact that the reform of the municipality is 40 years old.
Council takes rail system into consideration
Should the railway crossing "Am Hirschen" be elaborately converted to increase traffic safety?
Yes, the municipal councils have decided.
Schiltach has to take 220,000 euros in hand.
Deutsche Bahn aims to improve the Kinzigtal railway line next year.
In particular, the safety of railway crossings is to be increased - there are regular collisions of trains with other vehicles throughout the country.
If the municipalities agree to the renovation measures, they must share with one third of the costs, the rest are shared by the railway and the federal.
Schiltach's city architect Roland Grießhaber explained to the municipal council the peculiarities of the bay crossing "Am Hirschen".
There, the city plans to build a bay at the height of the tunnel mouth to the west of the railroad track.
There, even larger vehicles, such as those transporting long timber, could be in reverse traffic without having to block the tracks.
Grießhaber therefore proposed to construct a necessary support wall so that the city could widen the subsequent road in due course to ensure a smooth flow of traffic.
This was controversial in the council, as some councils questioned the need for road distribution: Thomas Kipp, in his statement, brought the mood of critics to the point: "Do we have to take so much money in hand because of so few vehicles?"
Mayor Thomas Haas objected: The railway crossing "Hirschen" is regularly used for long-wood transports.
Even wood from the "Kuhbach" area is transported partly over this route, because the vehicles up to 20 meters long could not use the route at the Häberles Bridge, because they could not turn into the main road there.
In addition, the route serves as a diversion for those vehicles that are not allowed to use the tunnel when the main road is blocked, Haas argued.
As it is to be expected that the Kirchberg and Schlossberg tunnels would have to be converted and renovated, as is currently the case in Wolfach, the railway crossing "Am "Hirschen" could also have an important transport significance for a longer period of time.
The councils agreed to let them examine what costs would be incurred by the proposed road expansion.
Notwithstanding this, the majority agreed to the conversion of the railway crossing on the condition that the necessary supporting wall is built in such a way that the city could possibly expand the subsequent road towards "Bahnhofstraße" for meeting traffic to about 5.5 meters.
On the other hand, the conversion of the railway crossing at the tanning shop Trautwein could entail a completely different problem, which concerns the access to the "Geroltzhäuser Weg" which is rising sharply.
The administration had the railway renovation plans investigated by the engineering firm Breinlinger, as it had doubts whether the planned connection of the Geroltzhauser path would then be possible without further ado.
The investigation concluded that it was not possible to exclude that the slope conditions of the road could cause longer vehicles to sit on.
The responsibility for this, in turn, lies with the city as a road loader.
The renovation could therefore entail liability disputes.
Since both the timber removal and the bending functioned in the current state of expansion, one should not agree to the conversion of the railway crossing, argued Haas.
Also at this point, the risk of a collision of the train with a vehicle standing on the crossing is significantly lower than with the other rail crossings, because there is directly next to the center of the stop point, to which there is a good visual connection.
Even trains from the main station would have to be so slow at this point that there is no danger of collision.
The majority of the approval was refused for the conversion of this railway transition, as the city of Schiltach would have to "swim out" the problem with seated vehicles, according to the councils, since the railway could withdraw from responsibility after the completion of the construction work.
The panel considers the conversions at the railway crossings "Vor Heubach" and "Vor Kuhbach" as unproblematic, for which crossing agreements have already been made with the railway.
ESA decides on large space missions: missions for billions
Faraway planets, gravitational waves or black holes – experts at the European Space Agency now have to agree on two major projects they want to launch in the coming years.
There were 30 proposals to choose from, five are still in the race.
Far away worlds.
More than 1,000 planets in other stars have already been discovered by astronomers.
Whether there is life on at least some of them, no one knows.
The choice is difficult: Should we look for gravitational waves?
Or would you rather explore the origins of the cosmos?
Or looking for Earth-like planets and perhaps discovering extraterrestrial life?
These questions are being asked by those responsible for the European Space Agency ESA.
For their "Cosmic Vision" program, they are looking for ideas for two major space projects that are crucial to advance research.
The state for such "L-missions" is approximately one billion euros each.
The launch is expected to be in 2028 and 2034.
In early September, the European space exploration elite met in Paris to discuss proposals for such missions.
Thirty ideas were debated, five of which have now come to the narrower choice.
Numerous panels reviewed the proposals and followed up with the researchers.
In the coming days, a final decision will be taken by the Scientific Programme Committee.
In total, ESA has selected four major questions to be answered by the missions of the Cosmic Vision programme launched in 2007.
What are the conditions for the formation of planets and life?
The exact processes in the formation of stars from large gas clouds - and thus also the formation of planets that orbit these stars - are still in the proverbial darkness.
A large infrared telescope in space could penetrate this darkness.
And if a star has a planet, under what circumstances can life arise there?
To answer this question, the Cheops Space Telescope is expected to launch in 2017 to investigate 500 known planetary systems in our immediate surroundings.
But the possibilities are limited, Cheops is a small mission with a budget of 150 million euros.
Using larger instruments, astronomers could map Earth-like planets and even analyze the composition of their atmospheres, looking for "biomarkers": gases that are considered an indicator of biological activity.
How does the solar system work?
This question, too, is ultimately intended to give an insight into what conditions exist for the emergence of life.
An important role is played by the magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field and the emanating particle radiation with the planetary system.
In our solar system, these processes can be studied exemplary.
With the "Solar Orbiter" the ESA has already approved a mission of the M-Class (there the budget is about half a billion euros) for this question.
The probe is expected to launch in 2017 and closely observe the surface and activity of the sun.
Of great interest to the researchers are also Jupiter and its moons.
They want to find out what role the giant planet played in the development of the solar system.
For this purpose, the ESA envisages the first of a total of three L-missions of the "Cosmic Vision" program.
Juice (Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer) begins its journey in 2022.
Eight years later, it reaches Jupiter and is to explore the planet's atmosphere as well as the icy moons Europa, Kallisto and Ganymede.
What are the basic physical laws of the universe?
The universe offers many opportunities to study matter under extreme conditions and thus examine whether the laws of nature known to us are still valid there.
There may also be deviations that could lead physicists to a new theory under whose roof all known laws of nature can be united.
How did the universe come into being and what does it consist of?
13.7 billion years ago, our cosmos was created by the Big Bang.
In addition to our common matter, which consists of stars, planets, and living beings like us, there is dark matter whose gravity holds galaxies and galaxy clusters together, and dark energy whose action accelerates the expansion of the universe.
So far, researchers do not know which physical laws were valid in the first fractions of seconds of the Big Bang, nor what Dark Matter and Dark Energy consist of.
With "Euclid", the ESA has already approved an M-mission, the start of which is planned for 2020.
Using a special telescope, the probe will investigate the distribution of matter in the universe for the first time in the entire sky, thus allowing conclusions about the nature of dark matter and dark energy.
Who could make the race
Of the 30 proposals, only two will remain at the end of the selection process.
According to many experts, the best chances of obtaining an authorisation as an L-mission is "E-Lisa", a sophisticated concept for detecting gravitational waves.
This includes changes in the structure of spacetime that Albert Einstein predicted almost 100 years ago.
They have not been proven to this day.
Elisa could do that, hope the scientists behind the project.
The mission includes a detector consisting of two or three probes stationed in space.
Unlike plants on Earth, it could also detect gravitational waves created by the Big Bang, thus providing new insights into the formation of the cosmos.
Four other proposals are still competing for the second L mission: a large X-ray telescope called "Athena", which is to explore black holes, "Icy Planets", another mission to the outer planets of the solar system, "Prism", a mission to measure the cosmic background radiation, "finding" and "exploring" the cosmic background radiation.
Proposals for the return of samples from Mars, for the exploration of the moon, Venus and asteroids and for solar physics have already been eliminated.
Snowden ready to “cooperate” with Germany on U.S. surveillance
Edward Snowden, the U.S. intelligence whistleblower, has said he is willing to travel to Berlin and testify before the German Bundestag if the U.S. National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander do not respond to their activities.
The German MP Hans-Christian Ströbele met Snowden on Thursday in Russia, where he received asylum to discuss the statement with him in Germany.
In a letter from Snowden, which was presented to the media in Berlin on Friday by Ströbele, he writes: “Even if the result of my efforts was demonstrably positive, my government continues to treat a divergent opinion as a breach of allegiance and tries to criminalize political expression with criminal threat.”
But telling the truth is not a crime.
In the letter, Snowden writes that he is convinced that the support of the international community can convince the U.S. government to drop the charges against him.
The charge brought by the U.S. Department of Justice includes espionage and theft of state property.
German Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich told Time Online: “If Mr. Snowden is ready to speak with German representatives, then we will find ways to make that possible.”
Relations between the United States and Germany are plagued by allegations that the NSA has intercepted Chancellor Angela Merkel’s phone.
Thomas Oppermann, the MP who heads the parliamentary committee responsible for intelligence, said the opportunity should be taken to listen to Snowden as a witness, if possible, “without jeopardizing him and completely ruining relations with the United States.”
Strobele, a Green MP, posted a picture of himself and Snowden on his Twitter feed.
He was accompanied by two German journalists during his visit to Russia.
According to the lawyer of the former NSA employee, Snowden could not return to Russia if he left the country.
If Snowden says in Germany, he needs an assurance that he is “safe” there, the MP said.
Snowden said in his letter that he was subjected to a “serious and ongoing” persecution campaign that drove him out of his homeland.
However, he is touched by the global response to “my act of political expression.”
Citizens around the world as well as senior politicians – including in the United States – have described the revelations about an uncontrolled system of comprehensive surveillance as a merit to the general public.
In his letter, Snowden made an offer to the German authorities to cooperate “when the difficulties surrounding the humanitarian situation have been resolved”.
Frontier Airlines charges for carry-on baggage
Frontier Airlines plans to demand up to $100 from passengers who want to store hand luggage on their flight.
Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to $100 for a piece of hand luggage and $2 for coffee or lemonade, although the announcement on Wednesday read that passengers are allowed to keep the entire can.
The new fee applies to hand luggage in the luggage compartment above the seat, small pockets under the seat are still free.
Frontier said it would charge US$25 if the fee was paid in advance, and US$100 for travelers who only paid at the deck.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O'Malley said the $100 fee aims to move travelers to take care of the payment in advance.
“We don’t want to calculate that amount,” she explained.
In 2008, airlines began charging fees for the first and second checked baggage.
Passengers trying to bypass these have therefore put as much in hand luggage as possible, resulting in the luggage compartments above the seat being often overcrowded.
Fees are a way to get passengers to take less on board.
O'Malley said the new fee wasn't really about making money.
It’s about Frontier’s most loyal customers who have made it clear that it’s becoming increasingly difficult to find room in the compartment above the seat.
Passengers who purchase their tickets on the airline’s website do not have to pay.
This means that a passenger at Frontier’s flight deck may be allowed to take one piece of luggage free of charge, but the next person must pay $100 for a comparable piece of luggage.
O'Malley said Frontier's website and check-in procedures would be changed so that passengers would be informed of the fee before arriving at the airport.
Frontier’s new hand baggage charge will only come into effect in the summer, but there is no exact date yet.
Passengers often scoff at baggage surcharges and other fees, but airlines like to resort to them.
They argue that transporting baggage costs money and passengers should pay for this service if they want it.
Many on Wall Street view the new baggage charges as a sign that airlines are taking enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.
Most, however, so far leave fingers off fees for hand baggage.
Spirit Airlines Inc. was the first to charge for hand baggage three years ago and later followed by Allegiant Air, also a low-cost airliner.
The only other airline with such a fee is the Hungarian Wizz Air, said airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who closely monitors the additional fees.
He estimated in a December 2011 report that the Spirit Hand Luggage Fee would bring in $50 million annually.
Sorensen, who previously held a leadership position at Midwest Airlines, recently flew with Spirit and was curious about what he would expect on the flight deck if passengers were faced with the company’s unusual hand baggage charge.
“The boarding process was one of the smoothest I’ve experienced in aviation in my career,” he said.
I expected to see toothaches and handshake discussions on the flight deck.
“The plane was full,” he explained, “and the boarding was running like lubrication.”
Frontier also follows Spirit with the 2 dollars required for coffee, tea, lemonade or juice.
The company said passengers who bought lemonade or juice were allowed to keep the entire can and coffee was replenished free of charge.
Water is still free.
US Airways briefly tried to demand money for soft drinks in 2008, but reversed this seven months later after passengers complained and no other major company was pursued.
Frontiers’ step of charging for hand baggage if passengers do not buy directly from the airline is the latest initiative to direct customers to their own website.
Airlines pay online travel agencies like Orbitz for $10 to $25 per ticket sold.
This provides an incentive for all companies to move passengers to direct purchase with them rather than through an online travel agency.
Frontier, however, has gone the most far in this area.
In September, the company began to allocate only half as many frequent flyer miles when booking via an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, the miles were once again cut to 25 percent of the flight distance.
A flight booked by a third party with Frontier over 1000 miles will therefore only bring customers 250 miles.
Passengers can also reserve seats exclusively on direct purchases on the Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base at its Denver headquarters, but the business is shrinking and the company is losing money.
Revenue fell 9% and flight capacity shrank nearly 13% in the first quarter, as seen in the financial report released Wednesday by the parent company, Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic has attempted to control the finances of Frontier as part of the sale of the company.
Proverbs come from the Bible
About 40 women attended this year’s last women’s breakfast in the Protestant church community of Bisingen.
The theme of the day in the parish house was "words from the Bible" and "speech from the Middle Ages".
Zita Köhler, the chairwoman of the church council, addressed the biblical proverbs in a lecture after breakfast.
"Speech words contain wisdom, regulations, or warnings," she explained.
She compared several proverbs with the corresponding scriptures and explained the meaning.
She called proverbs such as: Wooden eye be watchful, as scales fall from the eyes, cast an eye on someone, to whom the Lord gives in his sleep, wash his hands in innocence.
Several times the speaker also let her listeners guess what the saying was.
The church councilor Christel Dehner took on the phrases from the Middle Ages: All good things are three, making blue, making something up.
She explained the meaning and origin of the speeches, which she called "bridges to the past".
At the end, a tombola was drawn.
The prizes were covered on a table and were humorously described before they were handed over to the winners.
Among the visitors to the breakfast round was also the mayoral candidate Roman Waizenegger.
Learning instead of being unemployed: a pilot project for unskilled people in tourism
A pilot project for the tourism industry was launched today on the Mecklenburg Lakes Plate.
Under the leadership of the Federal Labour Agency, 49 women and men who are already working as unskilled workers in the industry will be qualified to become specialists for hotels and restaurants over three winters.
"What's new is that the six-month courses end with graduations," said Carmen Wiechert of the employment agency Neubrandenburg.
The benefits are diverse: the participants would not be unemployed, the companies would get trained professionals, who were increasingly lacking in hotels and restaurants, and the agency would not have to finance unemployment.
The project also involves the Chamber of Industry and Commerce in Neubrandenburg and the German Hotel and Restaurant Association (Dehoga) Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
NSA Says ‘Internal Mistake’, Not Hackers to Blame for Website Crash
The shadowy National Security Agency said late Friday that a mistake had paralyzed its public website for a few hours and not hackers, as claimed online.
"NSA.gov was unavailable for several hours tonight because an internal error occurred during a planned update," the agency said in an emailed statement.
The problem will be resolved this evening.
The claim that the failure was caused by a distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is not true.
In the early evening hours, online server trackers noticed that the NSA website was unavailable for at least six hours, and this is still not the case for some users.
Earlier, an NSA spokesman told ABC News that the agency’s sensitive internal network was “in no way compromised.”
Secret information is not at risk, the spokesman said.
At least one group of hacktivists claimed to have paralyzed the NSA website with a DDoS attack.
In such attacks, the target website is flooded with page views until the servers are overloaded and the website collapses.
The cyber tactics are relatively simple and the attacks are not intended to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
The former super-secret NSA, whose nickname was once No Such Agency (No such authority), is now in the bright light of the public and sees itself exposed to sharp criticism by the NSA, a result of the secret NSA’s hard work and criticism of its extensive surveillance program published in recent months.
The growing controversy surrounding the intelligence service fueled initial speculation that the incident today was the result of a targeted cyper operation.
The number of unemployed fell slightly in October by 22 to 1,307.
While the ratio is 3.1% better than last year and also better than in September, "we would have hoped for more," says Monika Felder-Bauer, deputy head of the agency for work in Sonthofen.
Because many companies have reacted to attitudes so far.
According to Felder-Bauer, one reason for this is: "We have hardly any specialists in crafts, health care and elderly care."
Due to seasonal conditions, job vacancies for staff in the hotel and restaurant industries have also been open since September.
The winter season begins there in mid-December.
The full background report can be found in the Allgäuer Anzeigeblatt of 31.10.2013 (page 33).
Bombardier Profit Losses After Decrease in Delivery Numbers and Orders
Canadian aircraft and rail manufacturer Bombardier Inc reported a 15 percent decline in net profit on Thursday after falling orders and deliveries on aircraft in the third quarter and contract problems in the rail sector.
Bombardier, based in Montreal, also did not release flight test data for its brand new CSeries aircraft, nor did it provide new information on whether the aircraft could go into commercial use next September according to the ambitious schedule.
Only three more launches followed the test plane’s maiden flight a month and a half ago, which makes it questionable whether the test phase is going as planned.
Results lagged behind forecasts and led to a price drop of over eight percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, an analyst at National Bank Financial, on Thursday lowered his valuation from “outperform” to “sector perform” in view of the stock’s limited price potential in the next one to two quarters.
“While weaker deliveries on aircraft were widely expected, we are clearly disappointed by the margin development in the transport sector,” Doerksen said in a letter to the customer.
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries as the test program for the aircraft progresses.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more skeptical of the program.
Bombardier hopes the CSeries aircraft series can catapult the company into the lower market segment, which is currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test plane was unveiled to the public in March and flew for the first time in September after months of delays.
But so far, binding orders for the CSeries are moderate with 177, as potential buyers await the results of the flight tests and want to see if the company’s claims regarding fuel efficiency and cost-saving potential of the new jet transport aircraft are true.
Currently, there are a total of 403 orders and pledges from 15 customers and companies.
Chairman Pierre Beaudoin is confident that Bombardier will meet its target of 300 binding orders at the start of commercial use of the jet.
On Thursday, management also assured analysts and media that the program is on schedule.
"The test aircraft has not remained on the ground longer than expected," Beaudoin said at a conference call, adding that during the aircraft's downtime, ground testing and software updates were employed.
Each manufacturer plans differently.
We decided to take a first flight and then add a review period, which we did.
This happens throughout the entire flight program.
The second of five test aircraft is expected to launch in the coming weeks, the rest shortly after, the company said.
However, analysts remain skeptical about whether twelve months after the maiden flight, the first customer will be able to operate a CSeries aircraft.
Bombardier said it is reviewing the commissioning schedule (EIS) and will update it in the coming months.
“The slow progress of the flight test – even if it obviously corresponds to Bombardier’s internal planning – reinforces our view that commissioning is shifting to the first quarter of 2015,” Doerksen said.
In the third quarter ended September 30, Bombardier’s net profit fell to $147 million or 8 cents per share of $172 million or 9 cents per share the previous year.
The adjusted profit per share is unchanged 9 cents.
Revenue declined slightly and fell from 4.2 billion dollars to 4.1 billion dollars.
Analysts had expected a profit of 10 cents per share and a turnover of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The world’s fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer says it delivered 45 aircraft in this quarter, down from 57 last year.
Net orders fell from 83 aircraft to 26.
As of September 30, orders in the aerospace sector amounted to $32.9 billion and were thus unchanged from December 31.
"In the field of aerospace, the results were within our specifications, but the low order intake and market conditions overall were disappointing," Beaudoin said.
Revenue in the aerospace sector fell by 13 percent to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world’s largest railway manufacturer, announced that sales in this sector have risen by just under 11 percent to $2.1 billion.
As of September 30, orders in the transport sector amounted to $32.6 billion, slightly increasing compared to December 31.
The profit margin in the field of transport was affected by problems of settlement in some large-scale contracts.
According to management, there will be new targets for the fourth quarter.
In the afternoon trade on Thursday, the Bombardier stock dropped by 8.5 percent to 4.83 Canadian dollars, after it was also announced that Google’s chief financial officer Patrick Pichette will move to the board.
Brazil’s Embraer SA, the world’s third-largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and Bombardier’s closest rival, reported a 10 percent decline in quarterly profit on Thursday.
USA: Shots at Los Angeles Airport
An unknown man fired shots at LAX airport on Friday morning (local time).
While the airport management said on Twitter that the shooter was in custody, the Los Angeles Times reported that the man was dead.
A security man was also killed.
The media also reported several wounded.
U.S. President Barack Obama is being kept informed about the situation, White House spokesman Jay Carney said.
The incident took place in Terminal 3, eyewitnesses said they saw a gunman with a rifle in one of the departure halls, several media reported.
A traveler told CNN that many people had sought protection in panic.
Travellers were screaming and children were crying.
Panic erupted among the waiters, many of whom were afraid to hide behind chairs.
He heard two shots, says a traveler to the Los Angeles Times.
An employee of the TSA security agency suffered a gunshot wound on his foot.
The scene was “like in a movie.”
Afterwards, he himself was taken to a security area, the man reported.
The gunshots were reportedly shot near a security control area.
Airport building evacuated
TV footage showed numerous ambulances and police cars in front of a terminal.
Hundreds of people were evacuated from the building.
Users posted photos on Twitter of a Special Operations Command and a rifle lying on the ground.
As the airport management announced via Twitter, the incident began at 9.30 a.m. local time.
The access roads were blocked, which, according to CNN, resulted in long backstops.
Until landings, air traffic was temporarily suspended, it was said.
However, several pilots were also observed on CNN at the launch.
Terminal 3 is mainly served by smaller U.S. airlines.
Los Angeles LAX Airport is one of the largest airports in the United States.
Cocaine-dependent lawyer who warned drug boss of police investigation must go to jail
Basharat Ditta, 42, shared information on Underworld size Neil Scarborough
The lawyer was afraid that his secret drug addiction could come to light
He was sentenced by the Liverpool Crown Court to three years in prison.
A well-known criminal defenseman who warned a drug baron of a major police investigation because he feared his secret drug addiction could be exposed was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, provided Neil Scarborough with sensitive information about investigations into his drug trafficking activities after he was compromised by his own cocaine addiction.
The lawyer, nicknamed Bash, was arrested in his home in 2011 after police oversaw Scarborough, which he had represented in a previous drug trial.
Officials watched Scarborough deliver three bags of cocaine to the lawyer’s house in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he and colleagues were eating at the bar.
The investigation revealed that Ditta regularly consumed Class A drugs after tests found traces of cocaine in his hair, wallet and credit cards.
Over an eight-month period between January and August 2011, he attempted to obtain unauthorized information about the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his partners.
All four suspects were then monitored by police as part of a major investigation into the heroin and cocaine trade in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
Together with 32 others, they were later arrested after police secured <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million worth of heroin and cocaine and <0xC2><0xA3>200,000 in cash during a series of house searches.
Ditta, 42, passed on information to the criminals because he feared his drug addiction could become public.
Today, Ditta, who works for the Forbes Solicitors law firm in Blackburn, was found guilty and convicted in the Liverpool Crown Court after a three-week trial in two counts of obstruction of justice.
He admitted cocaine possession in an earlier interview.
The lawyer was transferred after police found out in their investigation against Scarborough that he had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two investigating officers followed the suspect and saw him go to Ditta’s house and put the drugs in a 60 percent purity in a black golf glove under the lawyer’s garbage can.
Shortly after delivering the drugs, Scarborough regularly telephoned Ditta, who was at the Blackburn Rovers football stadium in Ewood Park for dinner.
The lawyer returned home, picked up the drugs, and then nine messages were exchanged between the two.
Ditta was a “regular consumer” of cocaine after Class A drugs were found in his hair, wallet and credit cards during tests.
Ditta was later arrested, but refused to take cocaine, saying he had spoken to the alleged dealer because he was his client, claiming that their discussion was subject to “lawyer’s secrecy.”
During his arrest, Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove a number of credit cards, but they were secured and a hair sample was taken from him.
During the police interrogation, he stated that he operates an office both under his private address and at the workplace, and clients would call him at home for legal matters.
In court, it became known that he had summoned key actors of the drug trade, some of whom he had previously represented, after significant arrests and informed about what the investigators knew about them.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said, “A criminal lawyer should know better than anyone else that you don’t break the law.”
Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal defenseman because he has engaged too much with certain clients.
The relationship in question is not simply that of a drug dealer, but of a drug dealer who supplies his lawyer with drugs.
Part of his communications were undoubtedly legitimate, as he was the lawyer of these persons.
But that went far beyond the limits of a normal relationship between lawyer and client.
He acted against the police investigations as much as possible so that they could continue to pursue their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta thus discredited his professional status.
He was too close to certain clients, particularly Scarborough, and he allowed his independence to be compromised.
“If I were a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and wanted to pass on information to Scarborough, I wouldn’t wait 15 hours, but I would do it immediately.”
But after the hearing, Superintendent Lee Halstead of the Lancashire Police said, “Mr. Ditta took the step from a criminal defenseman to a criminal the moment he began acquiring drugs from organized criminals.”
His cocaine addiction led to hopeless compromise and made him receptive to the motives of leading members of organized crime who commissioned him to gather valuable information about police investigations.
Lawyers must maintain the highest standards of integrity and ensure public trust and confidence.
Ditta has broken that trust and is trying to hide behind the facade of his profession.
The Serious and Organized Crime Unit of Lancashire led the investigations against Ditta, which also resulted in a conviction in three cases for possession of cocaine and judicial disability, underlining our determination to bring criminals to justice.
This case should be a warning to criminals and shows that no one can escape the arm of the law.
We'll find you and take you to court.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after pleading guilty to the conspiracy to trafficking in heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Thirty-five other persons involved in drug trafficking were sentenced to a total of 153 years for drug offences.
On his website, Ditta published a section with questions and answers about himself in which he stated that his dream job was to represent clients in the death cell in America as a lawyer, his ultimate guest at dinner was Mohammed Ali and inequality was the motivation for his work.
Revolutionary Work of Church Music
To conclude the celebrations on the occasion of its 160th anniversary, the Liederkranz Dunningen will frame two services with the "German Mass" by Franz Schubert.
After the great success of the musical "Rock my Life", which delighted the audience in the spring of this year, the song wreath will enrich two services at the end of the anniversary year with the performance of the German Mass by Franz Schubert.
On Saturday, 26 October, this extraordinary Mass will be heard from 19 during the evening Mass in St. Martin's Church Dunningen and on Sunday, 27 October, from 10.15 a.m. at the service in St. John the Baptist Church in Lackendorf.
The so-called German Mass with the original title "Songs to Celebrate the Sacrifice of the Mass", D 872, is a spiritual musical work of the composer Franz Schubert from 1826 and was considered almost revolutionary at the time of its creation.
The Mass is presented as part of the services, as the client Johann Philipp Neumann had it in mind.
Under the direction of Hermann Schneider, the choir is accompanied by the group of musicians Frohsinn Tennenbronn and Noemi Lokodi at the organ.
Haslach: Skepticism evades overwhelming confidence
With the 2015 elections to the parish council, for example, the basics in the Haslach (SE) pastoral unit will change.
There is only one common parish council for all six parishes.
In a joint meeting on Saturday, the panels from Haslach, Hofstetten, Mühlenbach, Fischerbach, Steinach and Welschensteinach prepared for the changes.
For there is nothing to change about the fundamental decisions of the diocese and it is up to the parish councils to implement them as satisfactorily as possible.
Over the course of the day, it became especially clear: the skepticism towards the new one shrinks hesitantly but looking at a confidence.
From the ideas and expectations for the 2015 innovations to concrete proposals about the future composition and size of the parish council, the extremely constructive discussions of the six bodies with the heads of the pastoral care team ranged.
Regional Dean Georg Schmitt explained the new guidelines for pastoral care units in the Archdiocese of Freiburg on the basis of a presentation.
After that, SE Haslach, as a church community, will in future form a public law body that will enter into the rights and duties of the six individual church communities.
There will only be a joint parish council and a foundation council in which the parish priest is represented.
Each parish should have at least two elected members, in which six parishes are formed locally so-called community teams.
It will be your task in the future to promote ecclesiastical life in the locality.
When asked about the finances of each parish, there was a considerable need for discussion.
The innovations provide that the accumulated funds in the parishes will remain dedicated.
The liabilities, on the other hand, pass on to the entire municipality.
Especially with regard to the large planned investments, the commitment of which then meets all parishes, there were great concerns.
"Even in the past, only projects were invested that could be handled by the individual parishes alone," said Haslach's parish council chairman Bruno Prinzbach.
Practical experience with a joint board for five parishes was described by Barbar Ritter, the chairperson of the board in the pastoral unit Schutterwald-Neuried.
They had set themselves the task in 2006, "become one, stay five" and had to realize that this is not so easy at all.
The boards of the Haslacher Soul Care Unit then set out to answer questions about the future composition and size of the joint parish council, as well as the practical work of the community teams.
The preparations will be concreted in further meetings and decided in a further joint meeting of all six bodies in the coming spring.
At the end, the parish council Michael Schöner from Steinach presented the new logo of the pastoral unit, which was approved by a clear majority.
In Pfullendorf, electricity is getting more expensive
The citizens of Pfullendorf must adjust to higher electricity costs.
As Jörg-Arne Bias, the managing director of the municipal works, confirmed to the SÜDKURIER, there are additional costs of 70 to 90 euros per year for a four-person family in Pfullendorf.
The main reason for the upcoming price increase is the increase in the so-called EEG levy from 5,277 to 6.3 cents per kilowatt hour.
Each year in October, the four operators of the major power lines re-establish this taxation.
These amount to the additional costs incurred by them from the energy transition, which they can raise by taxing the electricity price.
The Pfullendorf municipal works form the last link in this chain.
In its forecasts, the supervisory board of the energy company had even assumed a higher surcharge, as reported by Jörg-Arne Bias.
Now, the concrete figures would have to be calculated before the municipal works could inform their customers about the exact price increase next week.
"We assume an increase of 1 cent plus x," Bias said, with the number going to be closer to 2 cents.
Lights on permanent red: watch out for waiting time
Sometimes a light simply does not turn green.
The contact loop in the street does not respond, or the light sign is defective.
What to do - drive at Red?
If an affected person has waited long enough at a red light and the intersection is free, he can continue, explains Stuttgart lawyer Ralf Becker in the magazine "Motorrad".
However, the waiting time must be "appropriate", which can be interpreted differently from case to case.
Becker advises to endure at least five minutes before starting a dysfunction of the traffic lights.
However, those who continue to drive despite the red lights must be aware that they are fully responsible for an accident caused by it.
Those who wait less than five minutes may not wait long enough, Becker warns, referring to a decision of the Oberlandesgericht Hamm.
In the negotiated case, after about three minutes, a driver had permanently ignored the traffic lights and was responsible for a negligent red light violation.
The lights were not defective, but turned green shortly afterwards.
He was spared a driving ban because of the special situation - but not the fine.
The City Council welcomes a solid budget
When it comes to the budget in municipal council meetings, Mayor Ralph Gerster laughs well.
The municipality of Herdwangen-Schönach is well-filled and the administration has not been in debt since 2005.
The 2012 financial year can also be counted as a full success in this sense.
This was evident in the presentation of the annual accounts for 2012.
As Andrea Rothmund explained, the administrative budget with about 7.6 million euros was over one million euros higher than planned.
The administrative budget surplus is also around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1 million above the approach, with about <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.8 million.
The surplus is mainly due to higher business tax revenues and the municipal share of the income tax.
The asset budget was also clearly above the planned values.
Instead of the planned 1.5 million euros, it amounted to 2.5 million euros last year.
"This is mainly due to the higher inflow from the administrative budget," says Rothmund.
As fewer investments were made than planned in the 2012 financial year, the provision of reserves was also higher.
Overall, the overall reserve was increased by around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.1 million to a total of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>4.9 million.
Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked Rothmund and her team for the good work.
"You can't just shake a work like that out of your sleeves," Gerster praised with regard to the annual accounts.
He and the city councils were evidently pleased with the good numbers.
It may sound paradoxical, but it is precisely these good numbers that the citizens could soon come to be expensive.
Due to the good financial situation, the municipality has been able to renounce high lifting rates in the past.
As a result, however, according to Gerster, subsidies have already been cut by the country many times.
There are prerequisites for these grants from various countervailing levels.
Among other things, cities and municipalities applying for grants must have certain lifts.
"We have to look at the issue of lifting rates, because in the coming years investments will be made, for which we would like to have subsidies," Gerster announced in this context.
Nagold: Hugo Wermter has been in the choir for 60 years
With 60 years as a singer, Hubert Wermter’s history at the men’s singing club Cäcilia is almost twice as long as that of the autumn festival, in which he was solemnly honored.
Hubert Wermter was on stage, as usual, in the colors of his men’s singing club.
Even after 60 years, he still enjoys singing with the choir, which he has won more than a lot of love.
Wermter was also active in the association, including for 28 years as a member of the committee.
He received several awards for his commitment and loyalty to the association: Jörg Kohr, pastoral speaker on behalf of the Cäcilienverband Rottenburg-Stuttgart, presented him - since the choir is also a church choir - a certificate of the association and an honorary letter signed by Bishop Gebhard Fürst.
His fellow singers handed him the certificate of the German Choir Association as well as an engraved tin plate.
In addition to the honor, the 31st Autumn Festival took place on the usual tracks: with the MGV Betra, the Liederkranz Salzstetten, the Baisingen Singers’ Department and the local music club, the Vollmaringer had loaded a colorful mix of different choirs and singing styles, which entertained the approximately 400 visitors.
The MGV Vollmaringen opened with atmospheric songs such as "Im Weinparadies" and "Lustig, ihr Brüder".
In honor of their honorary singer Hubert Wermter, they prepared a small booth - Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's "Bundeslied".
The men's singing association Betra also sang classical choir songs such as "Jägerwerben" by Julius Wengert, "Weit, weit weg" by Hubert Goisern and the folk song "When you go through the valley".
The song wreath Salzstetten, with its mixed choir and its women's group - the "impulse choir" - ensured the women's quota of the festival.
The mixed choir, with the Neapolitan folklore "Santa Lucia" and "Eviva Espana" by Antos Gus, kidnapped to foreign countries, while the "Impulsor" also resorted to foreign languages: "Liberatio" and "Hey Jude" were part of their program.
The singers' section of the Baisinger Sportverein returned with "Was ist der Schwob?" by Hans Süssmuth and Robert Pappert's "Bierlied" to local fields, where the Vollmaringer Musikverein offered the crowning musical finish.
For the children there was a small side program - "Grandma Hanne" alias Hannelore Stollsteimer conducted a casper theatre and read a few stories that the children were busy at lunchtime.
Children's dreams come true
The kindergartens and day care centers in the Zollernalb district receive mail in these days.
In cooperation with Bauhaus and the Sparkasse Zollernalb, the Schwarzwälder Bote would like to support the facilities in realizing their construction and embellishment wishes.
Does the kindergarten need a new sandbox?
All kindergartens, day care centers and nurseries from the entire Zollernalb district can participate in the action.
If you have a construction or embellishment wish for your furniture, you can apply with this at the Black Forest messenger.
Be creative with your children and surprise the jury of the action kindergarten building site.
A jury consisting of representatives of Schwarzwälder Bote, Bauhaus and Sparkasse Zollernalb selects three wishes from all submissions.
What are the prerequisites for participation?
The wish should be realized with construction materials worth a maximum of 2000 euros and on a (action) day.
In addition, the winner has to take care of many diligent construction workers himself.
What does it have to do with the day of action and the helpers?
Bauhaus provides the material with the support of the Sparkasse Zollernalb.
It will be delivered to the kindergarten on the agreed day and will then be processed directly by the helpers.
Helpers can be parents, grandparents, friends, associations and, of course, the educators and children themselves.
Kenyan press outraged over controversial media law
“We are in a frightening situation and one may ask: what is stopping Parliament from simply abolishing judicial independence tomorrow?” read the newspaper, which considers the draft law to be unconstitutional.
“The law is draconian and very punitive and we reject it,” said Cyrus Kamau, CEO of Capital Group, which also includes CapitalFM, one of Kenya’s most respected independent radio stations and news websites.
He said the new media tribunal “will always be biased because it is an extended arm of the government,” and restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya’s position in the global economy.
“I hope the president listens to us and we appeal to him to reject this bill and send it back to Parliament,” he said.
According to the newspaper The Star, the new law effectively puts the media in a strangling grip, while The Standard, democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya have suffered a "heavy blow" and labeled the draft as "draconic".
The passage of the law is part of a series of measures aimed at strengthening national security following the attacks by armed Islamists on the Westgate shopping mall in September.
The Kenyan media drew the anger of the authorities because they published footage of security cameras showing how the units sent to the scene allegedly robbed the luxury shopping mall.
Police chief David Kimaiyo responded by hiring two journalists and a leading media representative to interrogate, even though the indictment was withdrawn after a media outcry.
Under the new law, media houses can face a penalty of up to 20 million Kenyan schilling and individual journalists with up to one million as well as the further risk of losing their professional recognition or being excluded from official press accreditation.
The Tribunal also has the right to confiscate the property of those affected if a penalty is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, “already a single penalty can push most radio stations into bankruptcy.”
In addition, the paper believes that these measures could have a devastating effect on what it describes as Kenya’s “lively blogosphere.”
If they silenced the media, politicians could do whatever they want with impunity.
“No one will ever know,” wrote Mutuma Mathiu, a journalist at the nation who describes the Kenyan media as a crucial control factor in public life.
“If you leave politicians to themselves, they will lead the country to bankruptcy and us back to the time of hunters and collectors,” he said.
The Kenyan legislature has already attracted public outrage in the past.
In May, they voted to reverse the cuts ordered by the National Compensation Commission and reintroduced their decent wages of about 532,000 shillings tax-free per month – they are among the highest in the world.
Bad-Dürrheim: A dream come true for FC
The importance for the city and the football club did not diminish the official inauguration ceremony for the artificial grass sports field despite the cold weather and the rain.
A more pleasant celebration had been desired by everyone on last Saturday, but Peter did not want to participate.
So all those who came without an umbrella, or could not keep one for any reason, had the look.
This was the case for the musicians who framed the event, as well as for some speakers.
That’s why FC chairman Albrecht Schlenker, who spoke about the fulfillment of a dream, was also wet.
First and foremost, he thanked Mayor Walter Klumpp, who was very committed to the implementation of the project, the City Council, the companies involved and the members of the association who contributed.
Lothar Held, Paul Weizenegger, Heiner Gail and Peter Graf.
The restless pensioners laid 400 square meters of paving stones for the new roads.
Karl Rombach, Member of the Landtag, also commended this remarkable voluntary commitment.
Further greetings were given to the municipal sports committee Hubert Baier, the district chairman of the South Bay Football Association, Kuno Kayan, and Friedrich Knorr of the planning office, who announced a donation to the club’s youth department.
Mayor Klumpp recalled that recurring weather-related influences in spring and autumn added to the original lawn so much that it could not be occupied.
Already 15 years ago, the first considerations were made to solve the problem, when it was thought of building a third place at the football club or at the Realschule am Salinensee.
Both were rejected again.
Six years ago, ideas arose for the construction of an artificial grass sports field, which was generally considered the ultimate solution.
Concrete planning was undertaken two years ago when FC took over the Schabelstube in inheritance lease, promised a cost contribution of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100,000 for the construction of the site and the country approved funding of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>104,000.
The municipal council decided in October 2012 to take over the remaining 356,000 euros from the total cost of 560,000 euros, summarized Klumpp.
The construction of the 68-by-108-metre artificial lawn square began on June 4.
During the three-month construction phase, 3,000 cubic meters of land were removed, half of which was used for the construction of a dirt-bike route.
The Union and the SPD have continued their coalition negotiations on internal affairs and justice.
In addition, the responsible working group met in Berlin in the morning.
These include direct democracy, parliamentarians and the Federal Police.
In the morning, the Migration and Integration Working Group also wanted to continue its discussions.
Among other things, the issue of dual citizenship is likely to be the subject of conflicting views on both sides.
The SPD wants to end the compulsion for immigrant children born in Germany to choose one – the Union rejects a double passport.
On the issue of traffic, which is not on the agenda this Friday, the SPD supported its no to a toll on cars demanded by the CSU.
A vignette is a “flat for multi-driving and thus ecologically counterproductive,” said SPD negotiator for the topic of transport, Florian Pronold, in a letter to his group.
There was a threat of evasion on rural roads, which are already major accidents.
In addition, the introduction of a toll for all cars would be only a first step from Pronold’s point of view.
"There is a risk that compensation for Germans will be cancelled at a later date," he said.
Dieter Thomas Kuhn in Stuttgart: The singing hair dryer wave on the open-air stage
Stuttgart - "When will it be summer again?" was not actually the question on Friday evening at the open-air stage Killesberg.
It was truly a tropical night in Stuttgart.
The best conditions for Schlagerstar Dieter Thomas Kuhn and his band.
Click through the picture gallery to see the ascending of the "singing hair dryer wave".
Driver seriously injured in an accident
In an accident on Thursday night, a 37-year-old driver from Aachen was seriously injured.
According to police, a 41-year-old woman from Müsch was driving her car on the Kempen outer ring towards Grefrath around 9:15 p.m.
When she wanted to turn left onto St. Töniser Straße, she overlooked the 37-year-old’s approaching car.
The scaffolding collided.
The Aachener suffered serious injuries and had to be taken to the hospital for treatment.
Constance: Blockage after an accident on the Schänzlekringel
According to police, the accident occurred when a 51-year-old driver of a Swiss Seat Ibiza drove outside the city on Thursday evening, around 8 p.m., on the left lane of the two-lane Reichenaustrasse.
Shortly before the roundabout on the Schänzle he noticed that he was on the left turn track towards Stromeyersdorfstraße and switched to the right lane.
In this case, there was a collision with the BMW of a 23-year-old Constanter.
The VW Passat of a 19-year-old was also damaged behind the BMW.
A total of about 15,000 Sachs damage occurred, the police said.
The road had to be blocked during the accident, it continued.
Vienna Airport Takes Off Passenger Calls
Mr. Max Maier, please come to Gate 24.
Prophecies like this will no longer exist at Vienna Airport Schwechat in the future.
Much of the loudspeaker predictions are eliminated - the noise level is supposed to be so significantly lowered.
Creating a more relaxed atmosphere is the goal of this innovation.
As Airport spokesman Peter Kleemann told Radio Wien, the Vienna Airport is following an international trend with the cessation of prophecies affecting individuals.
For example, the airports in Copenhagen, Frankfurt or Dubai already refrain from the noisy calls.
The elimination of these predictions – an average of about 200 personal calls per day from the speakers – is intended to make the airport more quiet in the future.
"It has also been shown in experience that these individual predictions have been relatively little perceived, but at the same time all other information about changed flight departs or departure times are also a bit lost here," said Kleemann in a conversation with the radio station.
Highlander games on the Kaltenhof
In addition to the braking car with tractors, there will be a second competition at the agricultural autumn festival at the Kaltenhof from 6 to 8 September.
On Saturday, September 7th, the Highlander games start at 13.30.
Although they have a Scottish tradition, they are hung Swabian on the Kaltenhof.
Teams and individual fighters measure themselves in the disciplines of tree trunk throwing, hoof casting and water bucket carrying.
The tree trunk is four and a half meters long and weighs 25 to 30 kilograms.
"It does not depend on the breadth," explains organizer Peter Saile.
The trunk must be discarded vertically, should overlap once and then come straight to the bed.
This is evaluated with most points.
When it comes to casting hoof irons, it depends on the target accuracy.
Eight meters away, it is thrown into a pile.
Skill and strength must be demonstrated by the participants when carrying the bucket over 50 meters.
Time and amount of water in a can are measured at the end.
From each "clan" or team, two are then allowed to participate in the individual competition.
The winners of the team and individual competition will receive prizes.
You can train from 10 a.m.
A suitable clothing is desirable, for example, competitors can compete in the Scottish Skirt.
Swabian costumes are also allowed.
For the "outfit", the jury will award a few bonus points.
You can register up to one hour before the start of the competition.
With the Scottish-Swedish Highlander games and the tractor pulling, which starts half an hour earlier, there is already a lot of action on the festival grounds on Saturday.
In the evening, the wind music lovers come at their expense.
At 7 p.m., the Birabohemian wind music from Schömberg creates the great entertainment evening.
The chapel plays fleet polkas and marches.
Their repertoire also includes sensitive waltz and a rich big band sound.
Heinz Koch, known as the singing host and black sausage baron from Weilen unter den Rinnen, will be present.
In Dornhan he has already performed at the Christmas market and at the Fools' Party.
On Sunday, the Musikverein Leinstetten entertains the early shoppers, from 2 p.m. the farmer's chapel Böffingen is a guest, and the "Oldies" then let the party end.
Starting on Friday is the Stoppelackerparty with DJ Ralf.
Other program points include the Old Car and Trailer Meeting on Saturday and Sunday, exhibitions by companies on the topic of agriculture and forestry.
Other Sunday attractions include the maze labyrinth, the artisan market and sheep shearing.
Especially for children there is a petting zoo, straw jumping castle, tractor driving (under guidance) and tractor surfing.
The organizers are the Förderverein Mehrzweckhalle, the ski club and the tractor friends "Zündköpfesele".
Milk and Egg Alternatives at a Glance
Vegan diet requires plant-based alternatives to eggs, milk and dairy products.
Purified tofu with vegetable cream is, for example, a quartz substitute.
The Vegetarian Federation also calls it World Vegan Day on 1 November.
On the occasion of World Vegan Day on 1 November, the German Vegetarian Association proposes a number of vegan alternatives:
Pure plant margarine is a good alternative to butter, yogurt let replace with soy yogurt.
Instead of milk, soy, oat, almond or rice milk can be used.
Removable plant cream replaces conventional batter cream.
There are also herbal alternatives to eggs.
A half crushed, ripe banana, for example, can replace an egg as a binder in a cake.
Also 50 grams of apple cider or one tablespoon of ground flaxseeds plus three tablespoons of water are suitable for this.
Loosely make dough instead of egg, for example, with a mixture of a teaspoon of baking powder, a tablespoon of food strength and three tablespoons of mineral water.
But also 50 grams of soy yogurt or siidentofu can fulfill this purpose.
According to Vebu, around 800,000 people in Germany currently eat vegan food, i.e. purely vegetable.
Sleepless in New York
On the way to their host families in Weymouth, Massachusetts, the students of Black Forest High School got to know the American metropolis of New York.
After an eight-hour flight, we headed to the Brooklyn Bridge, which reached the heart of the city, Manhattan, on foot.
Here was already offered a fascinating view of the world-famous skyline, which is a special attraction in the evening light.
Due to the time shift, the students were almost 24 hours on their feet, but faithful to the motto "The city does not sleep," the day was decided on Times Square.
Despite the shutdown, on the second day, the Statue of Liberty was reached by a ferry and climbed on foot.
Then it went over the financial center around Wall Street to the 9/11 memorial.
On the third day, students were able to gain an overview of the fascinating large city from the 373-metre-high viewing platform of the Empire State Building while enjoying the view.
Afterwards, the hustle and bustle of the New York streets across the Rockefeller Center led to Central Park, an ideal opportunity for a short stay in the autumn sun.
After a short flight from New York to Boston, the students have now arrived in their host families and are experiencing everyday school life at Weymouth High School.
Also this year, on the day of St. Hubertus, a Hubertusmesse will be celebrated in the parish church of St. Mary on the Hülsbergstraße.
St. Hubertus was said to be a rather ruthless hunter who was converted by a vision and later appointed bishop of Liège.
The hunting horn group of the hunting trio Westphalia, led by Brigitte Kluth, plays music on parforce horns (natural horns in the mood It) according to ancient, originally French melodies.
The blazers wear equestrian clothing because they primarily accompany horses, horses and dog mobs musically on tow hunts.
The solemn Mass will take place on Sunday, 3 November, at 11.30 a.m.
The redesigned look shines with a new cafe.
One that invites you to stay and come back.
One that wants to make the name of the program.
According to the Lexicon, Déjà Vu is a psychological phenomenon that is expressed in the feeling of having experienced or seen a new situation before.
In case of visiting the café of the same name at the Opschlag in the district town of Kleve in sight to the Rhine-Waal University of Applied Sciences, it does not have to stay with the pure Déjà Vu feeling.
After all, the café with the beautiful name has exactly that goal: to make an actual stay not only mentally, but hands-on, always reoccurring.
Because it's just fun and it's just beautiful.
A glance at the inside of Opschlag 8 gives the viewer a good feeling at first.
The state-of-the-art but not cool café ambience looks like a place to feel comfortable.
Here the team, together with the founders Mirjam van der Stelt and Daniel Büttner at the top, pampers the guest with a variety of coffee or cocktail variants.
In addition, there are delicious cakes or individually prepared fresh baguettes.
The owners, both 33 years old, have already made a name for themselves as gastronomers before the opening of the jewelry café at Opschlag: In Kranenburg they ran the "Art Lounge".
From the move to Kleve, the friendly cafe lovers expect more audience.
Last but not least, the university.
"While we do not have a specific target group," emphasizes Daniel Büttner.
Rather, the two young students here would like to appeal to the same as seniors and all age groups in between.
Speaking of coffee lovers.
The friendly owner pair is behind the coffee enjoyment.
Enjoy the fragrant hot brew in the most varied variations yourself.
Expressophane
Daniel Büttner is more of an espresso fan and Mirjam van der Stelt is a cappuccino drinker.
"A baguette - that's my thing," she tells the NRZ.
Two events were also held in the bright café.
Better to say one.
Because the harbour party was held outside - the Café Déjà Vu did not benefit from it.
But there was also the ring net evening.
"Beautiful, successful and funny," the two 33-year-olds found.
But not everyone's business.
Perhaps that’s why Daniel Büttner is not a big fan of event evenings: “You can’t do it right now.”
And with an event, I always address only those who are also interested in the special event.
Events will be the exception for us.
"We want to disrupt the very normal operation as little as possible".
It should be said: Déjà Vu also stands for reliability.
In terms of the quality of the products offered here, as well as the team and the beautiful surroundings at the shop in Kleve.
The road that is becoming more and more a gastronomic mile.
To the delight of many adepts, the guests from near and far and the students who discover the gastronomy and thus the Déjà Vu café for themselves.

A day of thanksgiving at the MGV in Dinker
It was the 165th foundation festival to which the MGV "Friedrich Wilhelm Dinker" had invited this year and 52 guests, active singers and their wives, were happy to come.
In the club room of the restaurant "Witteborg" in Dinker, everyone enjoyed the harmonious harmony of music.
Traditionally, the foundation festival is always the right festivity to pay tributes.
This time writer Rolf Wagener was delighted with the special award "Singer of the Year".
"You have not only written a lot for us, but you have also done so many rounds for us, our sincere thanks for that," said the chairman of the choir Erich Schlotmann.
The awards for participation in the performances and choir rehearsals by means of activity bouquets went to the choir director Dieter Schulze with 44 participations, followed by the honorary chairman Horst Pier-Ribbert, the chairman himself, and last year's "singer of the year" Friedrich Winkler with 42 participations.
Fifth place was scored by Arthur Brückner.
A special thank you was addressed by the board to the team of club hostess Ange Pier-Ribbert, who once again had enchanted a menu of the extra class and to Gerda Pier-Ribbert for the table decoration.
The MGV "Friedrich-Wilhelm" meets for its regular choir rehearsals always on Tuesdays at 7.45 pm in the clubroom.
"New singing voices are welcome at all times," says Schlotmann.
UN announces new targets for poverty reduction
The United Nations is now beginning to develop a series of new goals to replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) announced 12 years ago.
In the run-up to the UN Summit on Sustainable Development, which began in Rio de Janeiro in the evening, Australian diplomats played a key role in pushing for “sustainable development goals” to replace the 2015 Millennium Development Goals.
They were included in the final draft of the document to be adopted at the summit by world political leaders, including Ms Gillard.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said at the summit that the time had come to “think beyond national interests.”
“I am delighted that the member states have agreed to take up a process with which to agree on universal, sustainable development goals,” he said.
“These goals will build on our progress from the Millennium Development Goals and form an integral part of the post-2015 development framework.
I will not hesitate to implement this mandate given to me by the Member States in order to realize our vision of the Sustainable Development Goals building on the success of the Millennium Development Goals.”
Even if the SG Achim/Baden has been without a win for four days, the handball league continues to be in a good mood.
Coach Tomasz Malmon has no doubts about this.
Everyone is still fully motivated.
However, I hope that we will finally win again.
"Because I don't know how such a victory tastes," Malmon expects a successful experience from his team at VfL Fredenbeck II.
Although the third-league reserve from Fredenbeck has not yet plucked any trees, Malmon raises the index finger in advance.
I trained a lot of players in my youth.
Therefore, you will certainly be particularly motivated against your ex-coach.
"In addition, we have to wait to see if there will be reinforcement from the first one," explains the SG-Coach.
In order to finally return to the track of success, the Malmon team must definitely increase compared to the previous appearances.
Above all things in the cover work and in the switching game, the last time it happened huge.
Opportunity must also be improved.
So I hope my players finally get their heads free during the short break.
Security concerns in Mozambique are growing in the face of clashes between influential personalities
Thousands of people gathered in the center of Maputo under the watchful eye of the statue of Samora Machel, the founder and first president of Mozambique, to vote for peace calls at a rare public demonstration.
“We want peace again, we want stability,” said Vanessa de Sousa, managing director of an investment firm.
Fearing for the future of the country, she exchanged her business clothes for a t-shirt with the inscription “We demand security” in Portuguese and joined the crowd on Thursday in the capital’s Independence Square.
For the past two weeks, there have been nearly daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo, which are among the worst battles since the peace agreement over 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement, initially backed by White Rhodesia and later the apartheid government of South Africa in an effort to destabilize the country's independent government.
Following the 1992 peace treaty, she became an opposition party.
Analysts believe it is unlikely that the country will fall back into a grown-up conflict, but recent events have alarmed foreign investors and locals.
A lot is at stake for the fast-growing economy, as the discovery of huge offshore gas reserves and coal deposits in the northwest could bring more than $50 billion in investment from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy and Anadarko from the US in the coming years.
The ruling Frelimo party, the dominant force since 1975, and Renamo blame each other for the tensions.
Renamo claims the government has provoked the recent clashes by attacking its members in the province of Sofala, a traditional Renamos stronghold, on October 17.
The attacks on the former rebels escalated as government troops attacked Renamo bases and attempted to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the group’s leader, Renamos’ spokesman told the Financial Times.
The government blames Renamo for the clashes and accuses the organization of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has tried to play down concerns about instability.
To AFP, the French news agency, he said on Wednesday that Dhlakama sees himself as a "loser" who wants to "use all his remaining forces to prove that he can impose his decisions on the government."
Both Frelimo and Renamo emphasize that they want to avoid war.
But the concerns have increased, since Mazanga was quoted as saying Renamo abandons the 1992 peace agreement.
He told FT that he meant that Frelimo no longer respected the agreement.
“Our vision is to resume negotiations, and we are serious,” Mazanga said.
Previous talks between the parties have contributed little to alleviating the tensions fuelled by a series of clashes this year.
“We have two adult men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) here who are brainstorming,” says Joseph Hanlon, professor at Open University and Mozambique expert.
None of them are good at negotiating and none of them are willing to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, which is pushing for electoral reforms, has already said it will boycott the November municipal elections.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted the use of force as an attempt to gain concessions and financial benefits from the government.
Renamo's electoral success has been shrinking since 1992, while a newer party, the Movimiento Democrático de Mozambique (MDM), founded by a former Renamo member, is likely to improve in the elections.
Mazanga claims that Guebuza – whose resignation is imminent if his second term ends next year – wants to destroy the country’s democracy.
“He doesn’t want multi-party democracy, he doesn’t want transparent elections, he doesn’t want peace because he doesn’t want to give up the presidency,” Mazanga said.
It is unclear what capacity Renamo has, but it has carried out disturbing attacks on police stations and vehicles on a major north-south connection.
Most of the battles took place in the province of Sofala, a few hundred kilometers north of Maputo, but in which Beira is located, the port, mining companies such as Rio Tinto and Vale use to export coal.
In June, Rio stopped using the railroad for a month after Renamo announced an attack on the route.
Mazanga responded reluctantly to the question of whether Renamo would repeat this threat.
Renamo wanted to “warn the international community that things are not going well in Mozambique,” Mazanga said.
Instability has increased frustration about the government, says Fernando Lima, head of Mediacoop, an independent media company, because many people were already worried about corruption, slow progress in development and a recent wave of kidnappings.
“People think the government and the president are responsible for the country’s future and he should be the one to find solutions to the problems,” he said.
Omar Sultane, a protester, said people just wanted stability.
“No one cares about Renamo and Frelimo, they just want peace and usable roads again,” he said.
Children should be taught myths and legends as “models for life,” says one author.
Thor’s stories showed that “brutal power has no chance against clever tricks,” and the Arthurian legend demonstrates how important it is to have a dream.
Many of the myths, however, are "far too wild, too offensive, and in some cases too dirty to be taught in schools," which is why Crossley-Holland advocated for a "careful selection" of age-appropriate works.
“I find it wonderful that in America myths and folklore are already part of education,” he said.
I have been proposing this as a plan for twenty years.
He added that authors and teachers who were “excessively didactic” would “disable children completely” because in entertaining stories the messages would be conveyed “underwhelmingly”.
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon and is the author of the Penguin Book of Norse Myths and the British Folk Tales, explained: "You can pursue certain intentions, but you should keep them in the background as much as possible."
Perhaps the biggest difference between an adult author who writes for adults and an author who writes for children lies in the need to convey hope.
Not everything needs to be simplified or lead to a happy ending, but there is an immanent sense of good and evil.
This must be subtly depicted, revealed through history and not explained.
This is the old story of showing instead of telling.
Hansjakob moves to Freihof again
100 years ago, Heinrich Hansjakob took up his retirement home in Haslach, and on Sunday his last years in the "Freihof" came to life.
The many spectators were delighted with the extremely short-lived stage play.
From the arrival to the awarding of honorary citizenship until his death, screenwriter and Hans-Jakob-star Alois Kraftzcyk had designed an entertaining piece that received much applause under the direction of Cornelia Volk.
Marcus Zagermann took the audience as a speaker through the ten different scenes, explained connections and bridged time leaps from youth to impending retirement.
On October 22, 1913, Hansjakob returns home to his children's paradise, to his Freihof.
And then the stage play began, in which Alois Krafczyk once again shined in his role as the city’s great son.
Stylishly, he led with the two-spinner and "Schwarzwalder Fuchsen" by Erich Becherer from Mühlenbach.
Not only was he received with much applause by the audience, but his sister Philippine also welcomed him.
Billy Sum-Hermann understood it incredibly well to take on the role of the sister and gave her immense life in mimicry and gesture.
Between the individual scenes, the Mühlenbacher Bauernkapelle played appropriately selected pieces of music and thus completed the performance.
Heinz Winkler, the mayor of Haslach, was honoured with the honor of being an honorary citizen, who, together with a part of the city council, made his appearance on behalf of the then-official owner, Hättich.
The three-kings-singers then made their wait, which caused Hansjakob to exclaim: "How beautiful, there are again youthful memories of my own three-kingdom time."
With their song "O Jesulein" they delighted the audience in the Freihof as well as the Storchentagskinder with their loud "Heraus, Heraus".
His criticism of the official church at the time had expressed Hansjakob’s concerns about the outgrowth of agriculture, the consequences of industrialization, or the effects of war.
In the homestead, behind his tomb chapel on the fire near Hofstetten, he found his resting place.
"A restless ghost had finally found his peace and had gone home forever," it said at the end of the play.
There were many applause and many commendable words from the audience for the performance.
Basketball: The Neckar Giants' Hope Is Growing
The chances of the league stay of the sportingly downgraded Ludwigsburg Bundesliga basketball players have increased.
Because if there is a wildcard procedure, then there is now one competitor less for the Neckar Giants.
The basketball project Hamburg Towers is renouncing an application for a possible rebound.
"We will not participate in the wildcard procedure," said former national player Pascal Roller, who has been designing the concept for a professional club in the Hanseatic city since 2012.
However, the first breath was not heard from Ludwigsburg.
"We did not deal with the wildcard procedure until it is established that Düsseldorf does not receive a license," Neckar-Riesen-Boss Alexander Reil told our newspaper.
Until May 23, Aufsteiger Düsseldorf Baskets can still file documents with the arbitral tribunal and prove its economic suitability for the Bundesliga.
So far, however, the Rhineland countries have been denied the licence twice.
The arbitral tribunal is the last instance.
Haigerloch: Evening Meal Church comes to the fore
As the city’s contribution to the 150th anniversary of the Protestant Church in Haigerloch, the city’s cultural and tourism office is dedicating the last of its public themed guided tours this year on Sunday, October 27, to the Church of the Evening Meal.
After visiting the Atomic Cellar Museum, the Haigerloch is to be considered after 1850, when Haigerloch came under Prussian rule.
A crowning end point is a visit to the Church of the Evening Meal.
There, the leaders get the story of the construction of the church told and gain insights into the development of the evangelical community in a Catholic area.
Last but not least, there is also a glimpse of Friedrich Schüz’s painting of the Evening Meal, which was created with the support of Walter Kröll and Georg Halbritter.
It is an original reproduction of the famous Milan model of Leonardo da Vinci.
The meeting point for the second half-hour tour is at 3 pm at the Atomic Cellar Museum.
Tickets are available at the Atomic Cellar Museum box office.
For questions and information, the tourist office of the city of Haigerloch is available.
Snowden could also testify in Russia
Former U.S. intelligence expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in the U.S. spy business in his Russian asylum.
Representatives of the Federal Prosecutor’s Office could either ask questions in writing or meet the 30-year-old in person in Russia.
This was reported by Interfax, citing unnamed circles familiar with the situation.
Such a question could be clarified interstately, it said.
Snowden’s departure from Russia is virtually impossible.
"In this case, he will lose his refugee status," the source said.
Because Germany is an ally of the United States, Snowden threatens extradition there.
Long Breath Makes You Pay
Six men's teams competed for the title at the club's tennis tournament.
In the end, the endurance of Team Maier/Bronner decided the last match.
A dream weather had been given to the tennis department of the Sportfreunde Rohrdorf for the tournament of the local clubs and friends.
The fun of playing tennis was at the forefront of the tournament.
There were five games per team on the schedule, with each playing against each other.
It was played in double mode with a long set of up to nine points or a maximum of 45 minutes.
Anja Schlichter leads the tournament
The management of the tournament was in the proven hands of Anja Schlichter, supported by Carmen Müller and Inga Kronemeyer.
After the first three games and a lunch break with pasta, the tournament entered the decisive phase.
The favourites Andre Maier/Matthias Bronner were on point level with Michael Klippel and Sadmin Osmicic (both teams of SG Rohrweiler), so the last two matches had to make the decision.
At the victory ceremony, Carmen Müller was finally able to hand over the walking cup to Andre Maier/Matthias Bronner, who had the longest breath on the finish line.
Michael Klippel/Sadmin Osmicic took second place.
Rainer and Bernd Maier of Team Asphaltriecher reached the bronze ladder.
In the late afternoon sun and coffee and cake the successful resonance of the tournament took place.
On the last weekend of August, the Schwarzwälder Freilichtmuseum Vogtsbauernhof in Gutach near Hornberg is again firmly in the hands of children.
Traditionally, the museum welcomes visitors on Saturdays and Sundays, August 24th and 25th, as part of the summer holiday program for a colorful children's and family festival with numerous co-promotions and events.
"Big and small can learn different old crafts on both days," the press release states.
Whether it’s making soap, turning candles, felting or making ropes, it’s the right fit for every age.
Regional artisans help the children from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.
The museum workshop is also open.
When building cuckoo pipes, water wheels or circles, the young guests can prove their craftsmanship.
Lots of fun also promise the many old games, such as push cart races or stall runs.
Speed and coordination are required here.
For all the little detectives, the open-air museum offers a riddle tour of the museum on Saturdays and Sundays, at 12 and 14 a.m. respectively.
On a ladder walk, the children have to guess which stories correspond to the truth or are lying.
In addition, visitors have the special opportunity to get to know the open-air museum during a carriage ride with black forest foxes.
Not only horses, but also many other animals such as sheep, goats, cows and chickens are to be found and admired on the grounds.
In addition, all children can look forward to the Clown Otsch on Sunday, who will be running his steak with the museum guests from 11 am.
In the meantime, Hermann Büttner is cozy and fairy-tale.
The storyteller takes the little guests to the wonderful world of fairy tales at 11, 13 and 15.
In addition, the children’s dance group from Gutach presents traditional dances at 11.30 a.m.
Furthermore, on both days of the event, from 11 am to 5 pm, numerous craftsmen such as the besenbinder, the seamstress, the spinner, the weaver and the baker can be seen looking over their shoulders during their traditional work.
Until the end of the summer holidays in Baden-Württemberg, visitors to the open-air museum await a varied holiday programme.
In a small town in New Zealand, Burt Muro is considered to be a lovable butcher because he set out to take part in a race in America with his motorcycle, built in 1920.
Despite a heart defect, Burt is not able to get away from his dream.
With his savings, a couple of donations and a mortgage on his old workshop shop, he transfers by ship to Los Angeles.
After the movie there is coffee, tea and cake.
Schrilles Piepsen disturbs local residents
Rhenus Midgard has also invested heavily in land.
They distribute the coal coming from the ships to the harbour.
The company has several irons in the fire at the site.
In addition to coal imports, Rhenus Midgard relies, among other things, on wind turbine logistics.
Black shimmers the coal on the storage site in front of the dam.
Two huge blue hold-up and return chargers distribute or load the coal here as needed.
With each movement of the wrapping devices, a shrill warning sounds across the terrain.
“The signals are for safety and are required by law,” says Matthias Schrell, managing director of Rhenus Midgard in Wilhelmshaven.
Unfortunately, in the case of unfavorable winds, this is widely heard - and so there have already been some complaints from people from the city.
He takes the complaints very seriously and has therefore made contact with the victims, says the 40-year-old.
In close consultation with the authorities, we are now in the process of keeping the warning signals quiet with technical measures.
In the future, he will continue to focus on open dialogue with his neighbours.
Because Matthias Schrell still has a lot to do at the site.
With the expansion of the Lower Saxony Bridge, Rhenus Midgard continues to rely on coal imports for power plants and is one of the largest in Europe in this sector.
Thanks to the 18.5-metre deepened berth in front of the terminal, Capesize bulk carriers can also be disposed of here.
"This year, we want to break the 3 million-tonne mark when it comes to wrapping," Schrell said.
In addition to the Eon power plant on site, imported coal goes to power plants in the country.
If the GDF-Suez power plant goes to the grid then 5 million tons of coal imports per year are realistic.
The three ship unloaders on the bridge as well as the second conveyor belt could generate up to 10 million.
Bayern's basketball player optimistic despite first defeat
Even the first defeat in the Euroleague could not diminish the huge optimism of the basketball players of FC Bayern Munich.
"Nobody can forbid us to believe in winning even against the best team in Europe in the past two years," said Bayern coach Svetislav Pesic after the unfortunate 83:88 (39:47) on Thursday night at the title defender Olympiakos Piraeus.
We sent the message: There is basketball in Munich too!
On their third appearance in the European royal class, the Munichers sold themselves very well for a long time, but were simply not clarified enough in the crucial phases.
The guests initially managed to turn a 15-point backstop into a guided tour 13 minutes before Piraeus again gave the game a turn.
"We fought back incredibly against the two-time Euroleague champion, but then again made reckless mistakes," said Bayern's Yassin Idbihi.
We are proud of our performance, but we want to win every game.
Malcolm Delaney and Nihad Djedovic were the most successful pitchers of the Munichers, who had celebrated clear victories in the first two games against Italian series champion Montepaschi Siena and Polish title holder Zielona Góra.
Ben Greenman: Ten Years of New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
You could say that New York City is the birthplace of stand-up comedy in America: Almost a hundred years ago, the variety artist Frank Fay, who worked as a lecturer at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began telling the crowd jokes directly in the form of a conversation.
Over the years, Fay’s innovation was expanded, as was the case last time at the New York Comedy Festival.
Launched and led by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the stand-up institution Carolines, this year the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary with over sixty shows in small clubs and large theaters.
“Most of these headliners started at Carolines and then became more and more successful until they were too famous to perform in a club at some point,” Hirsch said.
We have designed this festival so that we can continue to work with them.
This year’s event features performances by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher, as well as “Stand Up for Heroes”, an annual music and comedy benefiz event for Army Veterans at Madison Square Garden featuring Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.
With the festival, the world of comedy has also grown.
A number of comedians taking part in the festival this year have become known in rather unconventional ways, such as broadcasting on smaller television channels such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll became known with a cable sitcom (the ironic fantasy football series "The League" on FXX) and now has his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate was part of the cast for both "Saturday Night Live" and "Parks and Recreation", although she is best known for her viral video series "Marcel the Shell with Shoes On".
Both Kroll and Slate and other young comedians with distinctive voices (the surrealist pessimist Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic, racially focused W. Kaumau Bell) are products of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the biggest visitor magnets of the festival is an interview: David Steinberg speaks with Larry David.
Steinberg began as a stand-up comedian, but has developed into a respected television and film director as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he hosted a television show titled "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg" on TV Land.
The meeting will take place at the Town Hall in the middle of Manhattan.
“The city is definitely in the comedy DNA of Larry’s entire work,” Steinberg said.
He told me that when he’s here, he sometimes walks through the alley between two buildings and thinks, “Hey, if I lose all my money, maybe I’ll live here.”
Iran Satisfied with Nuclear Negotiation Process
Iran shows itself satisfied with the negotiation process a week before the next nuclear meeting with the five UN veto powers and Germany.
"After years, we now have an agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency to clear up the differences of recent years," Foreign Minister Mohammed Jawad Sarif wrote on his Facebook page.
It would be a long way to go, but the nuclear dealer is satisfied with the negotiation process and also optimistic that in the end both sides will come to a solution.
Drama in Uruguay: Boys kill game comrades with machetes
Two children have confessed to the murder of an 11-year-old boy in Uruguay.
The two 14 and 12-year-old boys had invited their victim to go bird hunting with them.
Armed with machetes and knives, they stabbed the 11-year-old on Tuesday and threw the body into a well, the newspaper "El País" reported on Thursday.
Afterwards, they would have played football in front of their apartments in a worker’s quarter.
The body was found the following night in the village of Cerro Pelado, 15 kilometers north of the exclusive beach resort of Punta del Este.
As an alibi, a five-year-old half-sister of the younger man she took with her was supposed to state that she had been sexually assaulted by the boy.
However, when the girl described the incident in front of the police without mentioning an attack on her, the two boys admitted to the intentional killing of the 11-year-old.
Among other reasons, the elder mentioned a rivalry in the football game.
He was temporarily admitted to a psychiatric youth institution.
Keeper has to go to jail
For exploitative human trafficking, bribery, threats, insults and dangerous bodily injury, the Landgericht Konstanz sentenced a 33-year-old man from St. Georgen to three and a half years in prison.
The former Bundeswehr soldier, who worked as a doorman after two deployments in Afghanistan, made a confession as part of a trial agreement.
According to him, in five cases he met women via internet or telephone contacts, which he sent to the line after a few weeks against her will.
He used to break resistance with violence and threats.
He retained the income of the women who had been buying for him for years.
By confiscating phones and SIM cards, he prevented women’s contacts with the outside world.
Together with a colleague who taught the women, he brought them to various brothels in the southwest.
There, he had them partially monitored to control their income.
In court, the defendant initially claimed to be suffering from severe trauma after colleagues in Afghanistan beside him died in an explosion.
After a psychiatric expert suggested great doubts about the mental limitation and thus a limited culpability, the 33-year-old made a comprehensive confession.
The court did not have to hear any more of the injured women.
As one Kripo official reported, after an initial announcement, at least four more cases of exploitative human trafficking could be identified through telephone surveillance measures.
The interviews were marked by high aggression.
In later interrogations, the injured confirmed their martyrdom.
Another witness, in whom one of the women had discovered blue spots all over her body, had not made a statement until today.
It’s about “a completely broken personality” who sees violence and exploitation in this business as normal.
The defendant regretted his behavior yesterday.
“He’s gotten out of these circles and wanted to live a normal life after being detained,” he said.
Oil price continues after up to 96 USD per barrel
Oil prices continued to fall on Friday after concerns about a high supply overshadowed a report that saw China’s energy-hungry manufacturing sector grow.
The reference crude oil supply range in December had fallen by 14 cents to $96.24 per barrel late in the morning in Europe on the New York Mercantile Exchange in e-commerce.
The contract fell by 39 cents on Thursday, which meant a price decline of 5.8 percent in October.
The large supply of crude oil has burdened prices in recent weeks.
The U.S. Department of Energy said on Wednesday that the U.S. supply had increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
Over the course of five weeks, the supply had increased by 25 million barrels.
But on Friday, there were indications of stronger demand through two reports of an increase in activity in Chinese manufacturing.
This indicates a continued recovery in China’s economy, which grew to 7.8 percent in the third quarter, after reaching its lowest level in two decades in the previous quarter.
Brent crude oil, a benchmark for international crude oil that is also used by U.S. refineries, fell by 26 cents at the ICE Exchange in London to $108.58 per barrel.
Court Blocks Judgment on NYPD Stop-and-Frisk Policy
A federal appeals court in the United States on Thursday blocked the order of a judge who had demanded changes to the Stop-and-Frisk program (“stop and search”) of the New York Police Department, and dismissed the judge from the case.
The 2nd U.S. Court of Appeals stated that the decisions of Judge Shira Scheindlin would be suspended until a decision on an appeal from the city was made.
The judge had ruled in August that the city violated the constitution with the way the program for arresting and interrogating people was implemented.
The city appealed against its assessment and ordered remedial action, including the decision to set up a monitoring body to support the police in changing its policy and the relevant training program.
The Court of Appeal heard the arguments for the suspension requested on Tuesday.
The appeals report stated that the judge had to be dismissed from the case because she violated the code of conduct for U.S. judges by decreing that a judge should avoid the appearance of bias; this was partly based on a series of media interviews and public statements in which she had publicly responded to the accusations.
The judge had ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people because they targeted black and Latin American men in an inappropriate way with the stop-and-frisk program.
It appointed an external body to monitor the implementation of major changes, including policy reforms, training and service oversight, and set up a pilot programme with body-bearing cameras in neighborhoods where most controls were carried out.
In August, the city of New York declared itself ready to end the practice of storing names and addresses of people who were released after a police check.
An oral hearing on the appeal of the city is planned after March 14, 2014.
The stop-and-frisk tactic has been criticized by a number of civil rights advocates.
Controls of this kind have existed in various forms for decades, but the number of checks recorded during the tenure of partyless mayor Michael Bloomberg rose to an all-time high of 684,330 in 2011, most of them black and Latin American men.
In 2004, a lawsuit was filed by four men belonging to all minorities, which turned into a joint lawsuit.
Proponents of changes to the NYPD’s stop-and-frisk program say the changes will end unfair practices and create a more trusted and effective police force, as well as affect the way other police departments implement the regulation.
Opponents are of the view that the changes would dampen the morale of the police, but not the crime; nor would money be wasted and the wider problem of a police force that is under pressure after the loss of thousands of jobs in the last decade.
The judge pointed out that she is not ending the stop-and-frisk practice, which is constitutional, but only reforming the way the NYPD implements controls.
From the happiness of the dreaming camels
Happiness is an oasis that only dreaming camels manage to reach
With this Bedouin wisdom, the first chairman Wolfgang Henne described the history and fascination of the "Helping Hands" association.
On Saturday afternoon, the tenth anniversary of the club was celebrated, which can already have considerable successes.
The first Chairman Henne reported in detail about the work of the association.
He himself was in Mauritania for the first time in 2004 at the Cheijk-Zajed Hospital in Nouakchott.
Subsequently, further cooperation developed, and the gynaecologist Henne carried out numerous operations on several trips on the spot.
During the speeches, images of the missions were shown on a large canvas, so that the guests of the anniversary event could take a picture of the mentioned actions.
The desert vehicle of the association was also shown.
It is a former federal border guard vehicle.
Rainer Prewo, the former OB of Nagold, had made the proposal to equip this vehicle with a photovoltaic system and now plans, according to Henne, to work in an advisory role at the association.
In 2008, the Schleeh carpentry from Baiersbronn created the hospital in Socogim, a miserable district on the outskirts of the capital, in the record time of just under a week - voluntarily.
Henne also mentioned a new mother-child hospital in Nouakchott
Especially interesting in times when in Nagold the obstetrician should be rationalized away.
One learns a lot in Africa as a doctor, according to Henne, for example, deceleration against burn-out.
Due to the political unrest in the country, you could not make as many trips as planned, but for this many doctors came to Germany to stay here in different areas.
In addition, containers with material are regularly shipped to Africa, so in March this year medical devices, medicines, bandages, hospital beds and glasses.
Co-initiator Hans-Joachim Fuchtel himself delivered ample local colours by telling from Mauritania about Mercedes vehicles converted to mobile goat stalls and depicting the experiences of the Stammheim musicians, who traditionally support the club, during their trip to Mauritania.
As his personal motivation, he called his work in the field of auditing as a young member of parliament.
When he realized how much money was lost on the way, he decided to help the Africans control a budget by the people.
In addition, Fuchtel stressed that the global economy also requires global human love.
It should also not be forgotten that Africa is closer than some people think.
From Gran Canaria it is not far to Africa.
Coulson used phone hacking to check a tip
Former News of the Word editor Andy Coulson allegedly used “phone hacking, surveillance, and confrontation” in an attempt to confirm a false tip about an affair of then-Interior Secretary Charles Clarke.
Attorney General Andrew Edis QC told the Old Bailey court in May 2005, News of the World heard a false rumor that Clarke had a relationship with his "attractive special counselor" Hannah Pawlby.
The newspaper commissioned private detective Glenn Mulcaire to hack Pawlby's voicemails and tracked them, but Coulson also called them and left news as the court learned.
“In the opinion of the prosecutor’s office, Coulson, who is now the editor of the NotW, is no one standing in front of people’s apartment and hoping to catch them in action, but one who likes to confront people with a story to see their reaction,” Edis said.
He said NotW uses three methods to investigate stories investigatively: phone hacking, surveillance, and confrontation.
The publisher is personally involved in the third method.
Obviously, he knows about the second, the surveillance, otherwise it can't be.
What about the first one?
Does he know about the phone hacking?
He denies it, but we say, “And if he knew about it.”
Rumors about a Clarke affair were first picked up by NotW’s feature editors when a source who was sexually interested in Pawlby was told, “Don’t waste your time, she’s with Charles.”
A tape of voicemails from her phone on at least three occasions was secured in Mulcaires's apartment in August 2006.
Investigators also found records on the detective's computer where Pawlby and her sister were stored as "projects."
During the time of the research, Pawlby’s grandparents received anonymous calls asking them for information about them, Edis explained.
Meanwhile, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup oversaw the monitoring of Pawlby's movements.
On June 18, 2005, Coulson left her a voicemail with the following message: "I have a story we want to bring out tomorrow that I'd like to talk to Charles about."
Edis explained that Coulson’s activities in this story followed the same pattern as with other important personalities, such as former Home Secretary David Blunkett.
Jurors heard on Thursday that Coulson Blunkett faced a married woman for an affair when he himself was tied to co-accused Rebekah Brooks, who had been married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks dispute having conspired with others to hack phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have admitted the phone hacking.
In protest against the planned Reich tax, French football will actually go through the first strike since 1972.
A conciliation meeting ends without results.
In the conflict over wealth tax, the government and professional football in France have maneuvered into a dead end after a failed conciliation meeting.
President François Hollande received representatives of associations and associations at the Élysée Palace in Paris on Thursday and also listened to their complaints.
But he refused to save the football from the planned 75 percent tax on income of more than one million euros per year, which all companies in the country will pay for two years from 2014.
The opposite side was also hard.
The strike announced for the end of November will now be carried out, said the head of the professional clubs association (UCPF), Jean-Pierre Louvel.
The game days in Ligue 1 and Ligue 2 set between 29 November and 2 December are thus out.
Gechingen: No absolute protection possible
"We want to involve the residents in the planning early," Mayor Jens Häußler opened the citizen information event on the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
About 80 participants had come to the hall to explain the planned measures, to ask questions, to express concerns and to bring ideas.
Häusler clarified: "The final decisions are made by the members of the municipal council."
The flood, which hit Gechingen unprepared on May 15, 2009, was a staggering event that raised the question of protective measures for the future, Häusler said.
A river area survey was commissioned with the neighbouring municipality of Aidlingen, which is now the basis for the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
"Protection of as many built-up plots as possible is the goal," says Häußler.
Based on the planning of protection against a flood, according to the German Weather Service, it is statistically expected every 100 years.
Climate change is accounted for by a 15 percent surcharge.
In professional circles this is called "HQ 100aKlima".
The water masses, which caused considerable damage in Gechingen in 2009, corresponded to a 1000-year flood.
"There is no absolute protection, but we can achieve a relative improvement," says Häußler.
In order to achieve the protection of HQ 100aKlima, about four million euros must be invested in Gechingen, with the municipality being able to expect state subsidies in the amount of about 70 percent.
Häusler pointed out, however, that funding only exists if an overall concept is implemented.
The community depends on the participation of the citizens.
An elaborate planning and approval process must be completed.
At best, the implementation could begin in 2016.
Among other things, the protection concept, which was presented in the municipal council last week (we reported) provides for local measures in the influx of the Irm liquid from the Stammheim valley.
Following the presentation of the flood protection concept, the participants took the opportunity to present their concerns.
Among other things, it was questioned why no more dams and retaining basins were planned to protect the site.
Gregor Kühn, specialist planner of the commissioned engineering firm Wald und Corbe from Hügelsheim, who presented the concept, stressed that it needed the interplay of all the measures presented in order to achieve the desired goal in total.
In addition, the most economical solution is to be found, according to Joachim Wald von Wald and Corbe.
Discouragement prevailed among the inhabitants of the Altorto, who, even in normal thunderstorms, have to suffer again and again from an overload of the channel network.
The problem is well known in the administration and the first steps have already been taken.
Häusler pointed out, however, that the guidelines for sewer systems are different from those for flood protection and should not be mixed.
The municipality is obliged to interpret the channel network in such a way that two to three years of rainfall events could be overcome.
To scale up the wastewater ducts would swallow millions.
Severely injured after collision
On early Friday afternoon, two motorists were seriously injured in a frontal collision on Landesstrasse 44 near Revensdorf.
The police immediately blocked the road completely, but could initially say little about the accident.
However, there are several testimonials that should first be evaluated.
It is clear that the 19-year-old driver of a VW Golf drove towards Revensdorf and the 38-year-old man from Gettorf met her with his Hyundai.
Both vehicles collided, with the woman so tightly clamped that the fire department took nearly half an hour to free her from the vehicle wreck.
The actual cause of the accident was initially unclear.
Both of the victims came to nearby hospitals.
The route was completely closed for about two hours.
You could call him the Dostoevsky of the United States.
Philip K. Dick was a seeker, a metaphysicist, his novels and stories also have something serial.
Amazing the kinship on the outside: the stinging eyes, the beard, the high forehead.
And just as Fyodor M. Dostoevsky, with his massive work, is to be understood as the founder and apologist of the Russian soul, Philip K. Dick is to be read as an American prophet, who is quite valid in his own country.
Some titles have appeared in Heyne Verlag, the Haffmans cassette with the 118 stories distributes two thousand.
Dick explains America - the realm of breathtaking technical progress, coupled with paranoia, security madness and the belief to be chosen.
Dick had divine experiences, his late books read as a mixture of the Revelation of John and a computer manual.
Maybe he was crazy, drugs had added to his brain.
He understood, early on, that the computers are divinities.
He wrote a theology of the computer and asked what distinguishes a man from a machine, the creator from his creature.
That's the Blade Runner problem.
The killing.
A master of science fiction.
A fantastic writer.
His stories have inspired film directors such as Ridley Scott, Paul Verhoeven and Steven Spielberg.
This story is now particularly significant.
The "minority report" dates back to 1956, it spreads the smell of the Cold War and the McCarthy Tribunal.
It is here that the principle of "pre-crime" is developed, "pre-crime", that is, what is now more or less official doctrine of the White House.
In Dick's world, which looks terribly like ours, mutants look to the future - and the police are approaching.
"We are capturing individuals who have not violated any law," the head of the agency said.
"We catch them before they can commit a violent crime."
And, "There are no serious criminals in our society, but we have a squad full of criminals." You read time streams.
They assume that evil is happening, and prevent the criminal thought from being put into action.
Dick's narrative acts like the blueprint for anti-terror laws and the NSA's eavesdropping.
Anticipation of the attack: This is how Obama’s drone philosophy and practice work.
But Dick's story is not over.
The police chief complains that there is no more division of powers, the military controls everyday life - and what is left of the state.
Then the watchman himself is monitored and transferred to a future crime.
The system is spinning through.
It's perfect, but it's a lie.
It invents its own prerequisites.
Accepts mistakes and sacrifices not only in the purchase, but builds on them.
The system creates the danger it fights.
Reading Philip K. Dick is always about getting closer to the truth.
Angela Merkel's claims in Russia
Former U.S. intelligence expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in his Russian asylum in the U.S. spy case surrounding Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Representatives of the German federal prosecutor’s office could either ask questions in writing or meet the 30-year-old personally in Russia, the agency Interfax reported.
Earlier yesterday, the Greens-Bundestag MP Hans-Christian Ströbele was the first German politician to meet with Snowden in Moscow to talk to him about the affair.
NSA revelations reinforce corporate paranoia over state surveillance
On a mild day at the end of August, a German police helicopter flew deep over the US consulate in Frankfurt am Main, Germany’s financial capital.
On instructions from the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection and Counter-Terrorism (BVT), the German internal intelligence service, he should photograph the roof of the US outpost, which is less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Federal Bank.
According to German media, the BVT wanted to prove the presence of surveillance antennas and the action led to a change of heart between the US and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin.
James Clapper, U.S. Director of National Intelligence, reiterated in September that the U.S. did not use any means of foreign espionage “to steal the operating secrets of foreign companies on behalf of U.S. companies so that they could expand their international competitiveness or their profits.”
But since Edward Snowden, a former whistleblower employee, began releasing his horn of U.S. surveillance secrets, European governments and corporate leaders are no longer sure they can take the director to the floor.
Reports that the U.S. National Security Agency is spying on Brazilian oil firm Petrobas and acquiring data from U.S. cloud providers including Google and Yahoo have brought the company’s paranoia to a new height due to state surveillance.
The barrel overflowed with revelations that Chancellor Angela Merkel’s phone was messed up, possibly for ten years.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted, then business leaders are also potential targets.
Snowden has made the intensive cooperation between U.S. intelligence agencies and companies transparent.
I think it is conceivable that this data is used for mutual benefit.
“Germany needs to wake up,” explains Oliver Grün, president of BITMi, which represents small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
German companies believe the U.S. now posed almost as much risk as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, according to a survey published in July by consulting firm EY.
However, the documents leaked by Snowden have so far found no evidence that the U.S. has disclosed the operating secrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
Politicians have expressed concern that the EU lacked certain IT and Internet capabilities and should reduce its dependence on the US.
Companies are skeptical about this.
In the Bundestag, it was proposed that we should build a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again...
“That’s not how it works,” says Hasso Plattner, chairman of the German software manufacturer SAP.
If you wanted a strong European IT industry, you wouldn’t have let it die 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subsidised, from coal to cars to agriculture.
Everything except the IT industry.
Nevertheless, the reach and technical sophistication of the US spy agencies exposed by the Snowden revelations have shocked companies that had previously seen the biggest spy risk in China.
A major change is taking place in cloud computing, because European business leaders are now more aware that data stored in the US is subject to the jurisdiction there and therefore potentially endangered.
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, a trading institution, after the revelations about the US data mining activities with Prism, about ten percent of non-US-based members rejected plans to use an American provider.
Jim Snabe, deputy managing director at SAP, said: “We see a new question from customers that didn’t exist a year ago – where are my data stored and can you guarantee that they will remain physically in this jurisdiction?”
Many German business leaders are of the opinion that recent reports simply confirm what they already knew anyway, namely that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and therefore they must be guarded at all costs.
That economic espionage is taking place is no surprise.
That's always been the case.
“It has been a topic for many years and has not fundamentally changed as a result of the current discussion,” says Kurt Bock, chairman of the chemical company BASF.
The Americans are spying on us at the commercial and industrial level, as we are, because it is in the national interest to defend our companies.
Corporate management usually does not brag about the countermeasures that have been taken, as this provides advantages to attackers.
In large companies, employees have long been told that it is not advisable to bring a free USB stick to a trade fair or to leave a laptop unattended in the hotel room.
Ulrich Hackenberk, a board member at Audi, says that it has been a standard practice for years to collect the phones before a board meeting so that they cannot be used as interceptors.
The German BVT advises executives to use simple prepaid phones when traveling abroad because smartphones may be compromised.
The prepaid phones are then discarded.
However, there are concerns that small and medium-sized enterprises will remain vulnerable to hacking and surveillance.
In Germany, many of these companies are global market leaders in their respective niches.
“Small and medium-sized enterprises often lack the experience, personnel and financial resources to effectively protect business secrets from unauthorized access,” the BVT said in a report.
The U.S. warns its own companies of economic espionage by other countries.
According to the Washington Post, the US National Intelligence Estimate in February ranked France, Russia and Israel behind China as two of the countries that used to obtain economic data from the hacking.
A member of the board of a German blue chip company agreed that when it comes to economic espionage, “the French are the worst.”
Bernard Squarcini, former head of the French internal intelligence service DCRL, was quoted in an interview this month as saying: “The intelligence services know very well that all countries, even if they work together in the fight against terrorism, are spying on their allies.”
Hechingen: Messe gives answers to wedding questions
"Marriage is the most important journey of discovery that man can undertake," said the philosopher Sören Kierkegaard.
Tips, how at least the wedding party succeeds, now gave a special fair in the domain in Hechingen.
They were important providers around a wedding.
One trend: the retro look has taken hold again.
It starts with the wedding dresses.
White is must, best covered or in cream.
In the front, the dresses are often crocheted and embroidered, often with a veil, but in the back, they go down the back and often end up in a tow truck.
However, the spirits are separating, as Stefanie Koch emphasizes from the fashion house Kleidermüller.
For men, the suit with a vest and plastron dominates, but cream or brown combinations can also be chosen.
The choice of the location is important, it was explained.
Non-jewelry side rooms are not optimal, the ambience should be special.
Here, the domain drew attention to its own offer in the discount.
If you want to get ahead with the carriage, Uwe Link has an offer for you.
"But coaches are also popular for boy cell farewells," he says.
Romance is also in demand for invitation cards, flower arrangements and also for wedding pictures.
The "after-wedding photo" is becoming more and more fashionable - that is, shooting series in special places, preferably waterfalls, a few days after the party, but in wedding clothes, explained Elisabeth Keidel.
Many more details of a successful wedding were presented on Sunday in the domain.
Flower arrangement, rings, wedding table, cake and also a wizard, such as Marko Ripperger, who can entertain guests stylishly.
Not to mention the right cosmetics and nail care.
All for an unforgettable celebration.
Dog Friends Successfully
For the repeated time, the athletes of the dog-friend Bitz were successful in a rally obedience tournament.
Achim Scherrenbacher started in Kandel with two dogs; with his dog Sandy he scored 94 points in the Beginner class and secured fifth place, and with the 15-month-old Marley he brought it to 12th place with 87 points.
Susi Höpp presented herself with her Woody in Class 1 to the critical looks of the performance judge.
Parents of a Georgian teenager who died in a tragic accident believe in murder
The parents of the teenager, whose body was found in a rolled-up ring mat in the gym of his high school, are convinced that her son was murdered, the family's lawyer said on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson of Valdosta, Georgia, was found on January 11 in an upright mat standing behind the stands in the school gym.
The Lowndes County Sheriff's Investigation Officers concluded that Johnson died in a tragic accident, which the 17-year-old's family doubts, however.
“They are convinced that their son was murdered,” Benjamin Crump, the lawyer for Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, told FoxNews.com.
They would never have believed that he had died as the sheriff had concluded.
“They believe that it is devoid of any logic that violates the laws of physics as well as common sense,” Crump said.
Rather, they are convinced that the truth is being concealed to protect the person or persons responsible for their son’s death.
“Your son went to school to study and came back in a body bag,” he says.
U.S. Attorney General Michael Moore said on Thursday there would be a formal investigation into Johnson's death as a number of important questions remain unclear.
What was the cause of death?
Is his death attributable to a crime?
This was stated by Moore at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I follow the facts in whatever direction they lead.
My goal is to find out the truth.
“I believe there is a sufficient basis for a formal investigation,” he said.
Moore told reporters that the initial autopsy suggested that Johnson had died from the consequences of a "positional suffocation".
However, a second autopsy resulted in another cause of death, Moore said.
“There are a number of questions that need to be answered or confirmed,” he said.
Moore added that if there was sufficient evidence for a criminal or civil investigation into Johnson’s death, he would entrust the FBI with the investigation.
A representative of the County Sheriff’s office was not immediately ready to comment on our request on Thursday.
A court in southern Georgia on Wednesday ordered the authorities to release all surveillance videos that the investigators have verified.
The teen’s parents said they hoped the videos contained clues to how he died.
CDC Releases Allergy Guidelines for Schools
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released a set of guidelines for dealing with food allergies from children in schools.
These are the first such guidelines issued by the U.S. government as the number of school children with food allergies increases.
One in 20 children in the United States now has a food allergy.
The prevalence of food allergies among children has increased by 18 percent between 1997 and 2007, according to the CDC.
The guidelines provide information for schools to raise awareness of food allergies among teachers and staff and how to deal with children who show allergic reactions.
It is also recommended that schools have epinephrine in stock – the auto-injection of the brand EpiPen is most commonly used – in order to cope with a potentially deadly hypersensitivity reaction.
Lawmakers in the states have recently amended the regulations to make it easier for schools to keep epinephrine in stock.
The report also includes a list of typical symptoms mentioned by children who have an allergic reaction.
Children may say, “It feels like something is pressing on my tongue,” “My tongue feels like a hair is lying on it,” or “My tongue is crunching.”
Parents of intersex children can choose “gender indefinitely”
Germany is the first European nation to recognize a third gender for children born with unclear genitalia.
Newborns are no longer assigned rigidly male or female.
Under the new law, parents are no longer required to declare gender for such children, but can indicate “indefinitely” or “not specified” on the birth certificate.
The aim of the law is to take the pressure from parents so that they do not have to make hasty decisions regarding surgeries for gender allocation in newborns, and to combat discrimination against intersex people.
An intersex person said years later, “I’m neither a man nor a woman.”
I remain mutilated and full of scars by the flickering work created by doctors.
It is estimated that one in 2,000 children is not born as a boy or a girl every year.
They belong to the intersex, a group that falls under the diagnosis of “sexual differentiation disorder” (DSD), a collective term for people with atypical chromosomes, germ glands (ovaries or testicles), or unusually developed genitals.
Wallis Simpson may have been intersex.
Understanding gender identification is still not very well developed, but most experts in the U.S. advise using the best available information for gender assignment if a determination is not possible, and not waiting for the psychological and physical development of the child before deciding – if at all – to undergo surgery.
New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in the issue of gender identification, said the new German law “sounds like a good thing.”
Intersex children are an ethical dilemma.
“Some people have life-threatening conditions that require surgery, but most children don’t,” he said.
One could make a gender assignment without surgery and then wait for the identity to develop.
The scientific data on how a child develops its gender identity at all is not very accurate.
No one knows why this is happening.
It’s like the secret why people are gay.
According to a 2011 report to the European Commission, intersex people should be distinguished from transgender or transgender people because their status is not gender-related, but determined by their biological constitution, which is neither exclusively male nor female, but typically both are defined simultaneously or not clearly as one of them.
These characteristics were shown in subordinate sexual characteristics such as muscle mass, hair, breasts and stature, prioritized sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals, or in chromosome structures and hormones.
The report also provides an overview of the discrimination that intersex and transgender people face in their professional lives, as well as the extent of harassment, violence and prejudiced crime.
Boys not matching the gender picture now have a special camp.
Meanwhile, in Australia and Nepal, it is possible for adults to indicate male, female or “third gender” on official documents.
In June, Australian Norrie May-Welby, 52, was recognized as the world's first "genderless" person after a court granted lifelong retention of an "unspecified" sex status.
In addition to M and W, German passports will have a third assignment, X for intersex, according to the Ministry of the Interior.
In neighbouring France, gender issues are still controversial, according to a news release on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of French deputies from the strictly Catholic country signed a petition that the "gender theory" should be removed from school books.
The US website Catholic Online has also spoken out against the German law, stating: “If the world is skewed into a new state where sex is a decision, but sexual activity is not, then we twist two more pillars of civilization.”
The mother of a newborn from Maryland told Baby Zone she thought it would be better if babies were assigned a gender at birth.
“Parenthood is stressful enough without any further restrictions, especially if you don’t know your child’s gender,” she told the parenting website.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, children born with both male and female genders were referred to as hermaphrodites, after the attractive Greek god who had both sexes.
Ten years ago, medicine viewed sex as something that could be eradicated and then rebuilt.
But now the ethical foundations of an operation are being questioned, after it is now known how complex the gender identity is, and that doctors can also lie wrong because they don’t know how the child feels when they grow up with the sex assigned to them.
“In the mid-20th century, this was called a ‘psychiatric emergency’,” Drescher said.
If such a child was born, then the psychiatrist was not called, but the surgeon.
The prevailing theory about the treatment of children with unclear genitals goes back to Dr. John Money of Johns Hopkins University, who argued that sex is formable.
He coined the term “gender identity” and argued that social and environmental offenses—how parents raise a child—interacted with a child’s genes and hormones, defining whether a person considered himself to be male or female.
However, in a case known as "John/Joan" from 1966, his theories became controversial.
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis had been cut off by a dismembered circumcision to castrate the child completely and also to remove his testicles and then raise him as a girl.
“Money presented this case as a successful example of a transformation, but it was not,” Drescher said.
When the boy was about 15, he switched back to the male sex and married a woman.
At 38, he committed suicide.
According to Drescher, there are still doctors who would practice this model.
But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, survivors of these sex operations have come to the public, who are “not happy with the result”.
For example, with Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old author from Montana who was born with XY male chromosomes, but ambiguous genitalia.
The doctors were not clear whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never lead a “satisfactory life” as a man.
So his external organ and testicles were surgically removed shortly after birth in 1976 and he was raised as a girl.
At the age of 12, he received female hormones.
“I knew I wasn’t a girl,” he told ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was really hard to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he should be given a vaginal plastic.
But because he was depressed and knew something was wrong, he demanded his medical records.
What he found out was shocking.
I was sterilized at birth – and no one ever told me that.
Bruce was born with a DSD, through which his body could not produce enough testosterone for the development of the genitals.
After learning the truth, he switched back to male identity, received testosterone injections, and had his breasts removed.
Through the operation, he became infertile.
Today, he is fighting for others in an organization called the Interface Project for intersex people to be perceived as normal.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, managing director of the California-based advocacy group Advocates for Informed Choice, is concerned that German law can “encourage stamping and stigmatizing.”
“Many activists are concerned that the German decision could encourage parents to make quick decisions and to assign a ‘not set’ to the child,” she said.
We fear this will encourage interventions.
We think it would be better to assign the male or female gender and then wait.
But we still don’t know how the law will work, so we can only speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said her organization supports Australian law because it “allows adults to be recognized as the third sex.”
“Adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal sex,” she explained.
The German law deals with the assignment at birth.
This is not a fight to which young children should be forced at this time.
When you are an adult, you can decide on your own body.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a breast radiologist from Pittsburgh who has a daughter with a sexual differentiation disorder and supports hundreds of others in a self-help group, says the German law “authorizes” both parents and children.
Katie, the daughter of Baratz, was born with male chromosomes, but has a DSD called complete androgen resistance.
Due to the prescription order effect of the target cells for testosterone, Katie developed female characteristics.
She has a vagina, but no uterus and no ovaries.
Today Katie is 29 and married; she works at the University of Pennsylvania as an employee in child psychiatry.
Although she is infertile, she hopes to have a child through adoption or a surrogate mother.
“The law gives parents room, so they don’t have to make rushed decisions,” Baratz said.
It gives them time to do different tests and clarify things, giving them time before they write “male” or “female.”
In this way, everything is fine – you pull the child up and love it.
You have a wonderful baby and enjoy the happiness of your parents.
And you don’t have to rush into an operation that can’t be reversed.
“This includes children in the decision and eliminates the fear that parents are exaggerating because they think they are not doing the right thing,” she explained.
Ultimately, the child decides on the gender that best suits him – and that’s wonderful.
This will enable children to make their own decisions.
Unknown girl injured by gunshot from car
A 12-year-old girl in Saxony-Anhalt was injured in a car bombing.
The perpetrators allegedly fired at a group of children with an air pressure gun in Genthin on Thursday evening.
This was reported by the police in Burg.
The girl was slightly injured on the left wade.
Rescuers took the girl to the hospital.
The shot came from a small car that had passed a group of six children and had suddenly stopped.
Witnesses saw two people sitting in the car.
The perpetrators also shot at a bus stop.
A slice is broken.
Then they went away.
The police are investigating, it was said on Friday.
Until now, the Kempten Police Inspectorate can look back on a quiet Halloween night.
The officials were only called to egg-laying children twice, who threw them against house facades.
Since the homeowners recognized this in time and immediately removed the egg residues, it is also likely that no property damage has occurred.
In addition, some New Year’s Eve bulls were also set on fire in the city area, but no damage was caused here either.
A resident of the Bishop-Freundorfer-Weg reported that his car was wrapped with toilet paper and his radzierblinds were stolen.
By the time the police arrived, however, the man had found his radar blinds in the immediate vicinity, so the police did not have to continue to act.
Living with a future perspective
In fact, Waltraud Ries lives fantastically.
Your house is located in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart with lots of greenery, an old tree population, nice neighbors and also not too much traffic.
In the city it is only a few minutes by public transport.
"I hope you are not afraid of spiders?" asks Waltraud Ries, pointing to a greasy spider on the door frame.
I have been looking for a new home for my husband and myself for some time now.
But you know how difficult this is in Stuttgart.
The reason, however, is not spider phobia, but the worry of not being able to cope with the many stairs to the house and in the apartment in old age, she explains.
Also: Since a meniscus operation, the mid-fifty-year-old has had to learn on her own what it means to move from floor to floor with a handicap.
Recently, a book was published by her on the topic 'Happy living in old age - Which form of living is best for me?'.
"Our apartment is the best example of what's not going at all in old age," she begins to tell.
When she moved into the Maisonette apartment with her husband more than 20 years ago, it was just a nice apartment in the middle of the countryside.
Today, at the age of fifty, Waltraud Ries thinks differently about it.
But she also knows that she is one of the few people who are dealing with the topic of 'living in old age'.
Most people will push it as long as they can.
Only the others get old,” she says smurfingly.
Only when the pressure of suffering is really great do you worry.
"It may be too late," Ries said.
In her book, the interior designer presents 17 living models for self-determined living in old age.
“But which form of living you choose is always an individual decision,” she explains.
There is no solution for age.
Even those who can afford retirement in Tuscany or Brittany should always consider that they can also get sick.
And: 'Without good knowledge of the national language, you can also come together in Dolce Vita,' says the specialist book author to consider evictions.
Among their models are classic care models, alternative forms of housing or the often cited pensioner-WG.
In old age, everyone has their ticks and mackens
'For me it would be such a living room, but nothing,' she says with a wink.
Not at all like in a student apartment with a shared bathroom and kitchen.
'At old age, you just need your retreat rooms,' Ries said.
However, the author does not want to rule out that a senior housing community can still work.
However, this would have to be different than in the classical student-WG.
“Sometimes you just want your peace of mind,” she said.
With this opinion, it is not alone in the capital of the country.
'Most old people in Stuttgart want to stay in their own apartment for as long as possible', is also the experience of Theresa Rütten, the head of the civil service life in the age of the state capital.
Your service advises people around the topic of 'becoming older'.
Therefore, especially older people would often also take inconveniences and restrictions in order to stay in their usual environment, this is also the experience of the Stiftung Warentest.
Today, there are many ways to make the house or apartment accessible.
Ries recommends that anyone involved in the age-appropriate renovation of their home or apartment should first get thorough information and not hire the first artisan.
Today, there is also an age-appropriate conversion specialist.
Even in the rental apartment, one or another can be realized, and if it is only the toilet seat increase, the interior designer clarifies.
But it is not always possible to remodel the existing apartment according to the age and thus accessible, even if it is still so beautiful.
Waltraud Ries had to make this experience.
Although you could install a stair lift inside the apartment, the path paved with stairs to the apartment door would be the far greater obstacle.
She will continue to search until she finds the ideal object for herself and her husband.
Before the move, she is more horrified than before the spider at her apartment door.
U.S. wants to prosecute Snowden
The U.S. has not changed its position on former U.S. intelligence officer Edward Snowden.
He is also accused of illegally disclosing secret information.
Therefore, he has to face a criminal trial in the United States, U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jennifer Psaki said in Washington.
Even Snowden’s recent statements would not change that.
Earlier, after a meeting with Snowden in Moscow, German Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele had appealed to the US to stop threatening him with punishment.
Psaki stressed that Ströbel’s comments were those of a parliamentarian and not those of a member of the German government.
The secret service secretary Edward Snowden is basically ready for a conversation with the German authorities.
First, however, he wants to be clear about his situation.
This was made clear by the former NSA employee sought by the United States in an unsolicited letter published by Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele on Friday after a meeting with Snowden and forwarded to the federal government, the Bundestag and the attorney general.
According to a translation distributed by Ströbele, the writing has the following wording:
To the Competent
I was asked to write to you regarding your mass surveillance investigation.
My name is Edward Joseph Snowden and I was previously employed as a contractor or direct technical expert at the National Security Agency (NSA), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) of the United States.
In the course of my employment in these institutions, I witnessed systematic violations of the laws of my government, which caused me to act out of moral duty.
As a result of the publication of these concerns, I saw myself exposed to a serious and persistent harassment that forced me to leave my family and my homeland.
I am currently living in exile and enjoying temporary asylum granted to me by the Russian Federation in accordance with international law.
I am encouraged by the response to my political actions, both in the United States and elsewhere.
Citizens around the world and even senior officials—including the United States—have judged the revelations about a system of all-encompassing surveillance that owes no accountability to anyone as a service to the public.
These espionage revelations drew many proposals for new laws and guidelines aimed at the previously covert abuse of public trust.
The benefits to society from these findings are becoming increasingly clear; at the same time, the risks taken in purchasing have been significantly reduced.
Although the result of my efforts has been proven positive, my government still treats dissent as a breach of allegiance and seeks to criminalize political expression and indictment.
To speak the truth is not a crime.
I am confident that the Government of the United States, with the support of the international community, will adopt this repressive stance.
I hope that, once the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been resolved, I will be able to participate responsibly and legally in the clarification of the facts regarding the statements made in the media, in particular with regard to the truth and authenticity of the reports.
I look forward to having a conversation with you in your country once the situation is cleared up and thank you for your efforts to uphold international law that protects us all.
Edward Snowden testifies by Hans-Christian Ströbele
Kindergarten has found a private buyer
"The building is in good hands," says Winterlingens mayor Michael Maier.
The former kindergarten in the garden street was sold by the municipality to a private person.
The sale was approved by the City Council at its most recent meeting in the non-public part.
The building changed its owner at a "reasonable" price.
"The community is satisfied," Maier said.
The budget was set at <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100,000.
It is not yet clear how the new owner wants to use the former kindergarten.
It is right for the mayor that Winterlingen has handed over the responsibility for the building to someone else before winter and thus no longer has to deal with the entertainment of the house, such as heating, looking after the garden and cleaning the walkway.
"This effort is now gone," Maier is delighted.
Space concert at high summer temperatures
The Musikverein Hammereisenbach gives a space concert on the terrace of the inn Hammer.
When conductor Bianca Willmann lifts the baton at 7:30 p.m., the thermometer still shows 25 degrees.
About 50 listeners enjoy the sounds of the Hammrich musicians.
The president, Manuela Honeck, explains the music pieces.
In this context, Honeck thanked all those who had helped to successfully manage the first musician shock.
Obama Campaign Considers Replacement of Biden by Hillary Clinton
President Barack Obama’s closest advisers have secretly considered replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton in the 2012 election campaign, according to the New York Times.
The revelation is the most notable surprise of the long-awaited work by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann about the 2012 election campaign, “Double Down: Game Change 2012”.
The Times has a copy of the upcoming book, and she reported on Thursday night that the president’s top advisers had conducted “extensive group meetings and surveys at the end of 2011” to find out if it would look better for Obama’s waning hope of re-election if he dropped Biden.
According to Jonathan Martin, a national policy correspondent for the Times, the book thoroughly traces the history of efforts by leading campaign and White House staff, namely former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley, to measure the effect it has on the polling values of former Secretary of State Clinton vs. the Vice President.
The potential shift was a strictly guarded secret within the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen of the president’s closest advisers – including Daley, former Obama campaign manager Jim Messina, and former White House chief adviser David Axelrod and David Plouffe – knew about the proposed change.
“Double Down” claims Daley was at the forefront of efforts to exchange Biden despite her “close, personal relationship” before ultimately deciding against such a move after data showed that Clinton’s candidacy “would not significantly improve Obama’s chances.”
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the government had actually considered replacing Biden with Clinton.
“I said a whole series of things to consider, and that was one of them,” Daley told the magazine.
You have to remember that the president had terrible survey values at the time, so we thought, “For God’s sake, what are we doing?”
While Daley referred to the investigation as “provided care,” Martin told Anderson Cooper of CNN that significant effort had been made during the campaign for re-election to find out if such a move would pay off with regard to the polls.
“In campaigns, you don’t spend that much money on surveys and focus groups unless you think seriously about something,” Martin told AC360.
It is unclear, however, whether Obama knew that his team was considering an exchange.
Martin told CNN that he had asked Daley if his boss at the time knew about the potential change.
Although Daley stated that he did not believe the president was “aware” of the possible change, the former chief of staff admitted that it was “possible” that Obama was aware of it.
Martin added that “Double Down” would not provide a definitive answer to the question of whether the political probes had reached Obama’s desk.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thinks Obama knew nothing about the investigation into whether to drop Biden in the election.
“Maybe,” Martin replied.
What happens on the way to my email?
E-mail is actually an electronic letter.
When designing the Internet service, was e-mail technically implemented in the same way as the traditional mail?
In the design of early Internet services, communication was made possible.
As a result, the basic technical protocols have failed to provide a stable basis for sound correspondence.
Therefore, a traditional e-mail corresponds to an open postcard rather than a sealed letter.
If the user "Anna" sends an email to "Benni", are the computers of the two directly connected?
The e-mail program or the browser of Anna sends the e-mail to the mail server of her service provider in the first step.
For example, if you had a Gmail account, it would be Google.
This mail server sends the content to the provider that Benni uses.
On the route, the mail can run over several other servers on the Internet.
Bennie can then call the content at his provider.
Will traditional emails be read along the way through the web?
Most emails are read multiple times by software robots on the go.
The sender’s provider usually checks whether the email is running a malicious program as an attachment.
A virus check is also performed on the recipient systems.
In addition, the providers check whether it is an annoying and unwanted spam email that is immediately deleted or at least sorted away in a spam folder.
Do the robots have another task?
For systems like GMail, the robot also determines the information Google needs to place contextual advertising.
If Anna and Benni communicate via GMail about their upcoming holiday trip, Google may display relevant links to holiday offers.
Do unknown people also read the emails?
The likelihood of unauthorized people reading an email is extremely low.
Theoretically, however, this is possible.
In companies, administrators often have the opportunity to read electronic mail.
Law enforcement agencies and intelligence agencies also have legal opportunities to intercept or take notice of e-mails.
In addition to this, there are possible illegal spying operations.
Is it possible to protect emails from co-reading?
With encryption according to the OpenPGP standard, an email can be effectively encrypted against co-reading.
With high technical effort, it is also possible to conceal the metadata of an email communication, so that it is not even possible to immediately recognize who has communicated with whom.
How important are Yahoo and Google in the email market in Germany?
Yahoo and Google play only a minor role in the mostly privately-used mailboxes, according to an August 2013 study by Convios Consulting.
While Yahoo Mail’s shares had recently fallen, Google’s GMail was able to grow significantly.
Mother trapped in the woods and retired
When his elderly mother died, a man from Wolfsburg forged a plan.
He buried the dead in a forest - and continued to cash their pension and care money.
A 67-year-old Wolfsburger buried his dead mother in the woods after police investigations.
At first, he hid the death of the 89-year-old, then he hid the money for more than a year and a half.
Now the 67-year-old has to answer for fraud, a spokesman said on Friday.
Accordingly, the man hid the woman in a forest near Helmstedt.
The man was suspected already in May: at that time it was discovered that the nursing mother no longer needed medication.
He told investigators that his mother had traveled to Spain.
Because the officials found this strange, they continued to investigate.
It turned out that the two had lived in a common apartment for more than 15 years and he had last cared for them.
The 67-year-old finally admitted the death of his mother.
An autopsy revealed no evidence of a capital crime, according to police.
Want ice cream that shines in the dark?
A British entrepreneur has developed the first ice cream that shines in the dark – with the help of bees.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of marine animals and created a luminous treat.
The idea came to him after he read a research paper on quails and was able to convince Chinese scientists to artificially manufacture the luminous protein.
The ice cream reacts when consumed with the tongue, thereby raising the pH in the protein and triggering the glow.
Chris explains that the ice reacts to the heat in the mouth and glows – so the more you leak, the brighter it gets.
Charlie, founder of the ice cream company “Lick Me I’m Delicious”, says: “The product is incredible, but still in a very early stage of production, and so you get two grams of it for 200 pounds.”
The protein used in the ice cream reacts with the tongue at a neutral pH.
When the mouth warms the protein, the pH increases and the ice shines.
We have been testing it over the last few months and it seemed to us ideal to bring it to market on Halloween because it has this wonderful lighting effect.
It’s probably the most expensive ice cream I’ve ever made, because the melon fluorescent is four times more expensive than gold.
Each bullet costs me about 140 pounds.
But for that it tastes delicious.
Charlie’s Bristol-based experimental company is famous for its unusual flavours, including beer, cheese, beef and leaf gold.
But his latest creation is expected to be even more ambitious.
He says, “I’d like to develop an invisible ice cream.”
This is impossible in and of itself due to the light rupture caused by the ice crystals that make up the ice cream; but I suspect we will find a way to make it.
The ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of a quail artificially made by Chinese scientists
TSV Morsum is still without any points in the handball league after six days of play.
The team of Ingo Ehlers is coming to the derby tomorrow against TSV Daverden, who celebrated his first victory last weekend.
With this game, the season starts anew for us.
"I hope we finally have our heads free," Ehlers says with optimism.
With the exception of permanently injured Hendrik Blohme, he finally has his full squad at his disposal.
Daverden also bets on pace, just like us.
Therefore, we must keep our error rate low.
However, in the first place, it is necessary to increase the coverage, which has left everything but a safe impression.
Daverdens coach Thomas Panitz is much more relaxed after his first season win against Nordhorn.
The game was, of course, a house number.
But that’s why we’re far from the favorite, because anything can happen in the derby.
However, Panitz now wants to settle in Morsum to start a series.
Jan-Malte Jodat will be missing.
For this, the A-Jugendliche Joost Windsüß, who is active with doubles right at the A-Jugend Bundesliga HC Bremen, is celebrating his season debut.
Anyone who isn't hot in a game like this should stay home.
Halloween 2013: In Numbers
When I was little, Halloween had something magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, stay up late and dress up for the neighborhood.
Today I have become more of a Halloween muggle.
In the last two years, I have not agreed to distribute candy from my apartment, and I will probably not do it this year either.
But according to statistics, I'm a black sheep when it comes to Halloween.
The majority of Americans – 158 million, to be exact – are celebrating Halloween this year, spending a total of $6.9 billion on candy, costumes and decorations, according to the U.S. Retail Federation (NRF).
One thing I look forward to every Halloween is the trends.
The costumes will make up about 1.2 billion of the $6.9 billion spent, according to the NRF.
This year, exciting undiscovered objects are the last scream.
Women no longer have to cover themselves in sexy clothes, they can now also embody seductive food such as pizza, hamburgers or carrots.
As for men, I expect a lot of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead, and I bet the Daft Punk spacemen will make it into the Instagram feeds this year.
According to Google, the most popular costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I guess there's nothing wrong with tradition.
We dressed our dogs last year and were not alone to my surprise.
In fact, Americans are spending $330 million this year on costumes for their pets, according to the NRF.
There are a lot of hot dogs.
As far as sweets are concerned, we are not clumsy.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion this year, according to The Nielsen Company.
That’s about 270 million kilograms of chocolate bars, candy bars, candy bars and rubber bears.
So good news for the U.S. Department of Commerce, according to 41 million people who are pulling through the neighborhood with the saying “sweet or sour”.
In fact, we’re going to buy over 40 million kilograms of chocolate for Halloween and, let’s face it, we’re going to eat it.
The only thing we don’t want to consume is the sugary candy corn; nevertheless, 15 million kilograms of it are sold for Halloween, according to the National Association of Candy Manufacturers.
That's about nine billion corn grains.
It's a riddle I haven't been able to solve yet.
Nothing belongs to Halloween anymore than houses where it spits.
They have great names like "Terror Behind the Walls" (which by the way is in a real prison), "Howl-O-Scream" and "The House of Shock".
There are actually 1,200 officially recognized ghost houses in the United States that make $500 million in revenue, according to America Haunts, and that includes the wonderful photos where you just pee in your pants and put your friends on Facebook, where you don't get rid of them again, and then the guy who you're pressing on comes out like a comment.
But let's finally get to the pumpkins.
Charlie Brown introduced us to the Big Pumpkin when we were kids, and carving a pumpkin lantern is like decorating the Christmas tree – something we made from a young age.
Fortunately, the “baby in the pumpkin” trend didn’t start until last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us grew up cutting the pumpkin rather than sitting in it.
This year, Americans will spend about $106 million on pumpkins, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
The pumpkin lantern, which is slowly rotting in the front yard, probably comes from Illinois, where 245 million kilograms of pumpkins were harvested this year.
If you want to score right, then call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California and carve something pretty out of their 921 kilos of pumpkin.
Home fire in Helmbrechts: rescuers mount charred corpse
The firefighters had to leave Helmbrechts late on Thursday evening.
A three-family house in the district of Hof catches fire at night on Friday.
Rescue workers have recovered a charred body from the house.
Rescue workers have found a charred body in a three-family house during a fire in Helmbrechts.
Whether it is a resident is still unclear, a spokesman for the Bayreuth police said.
Late Thursday night, it had burned down on the ground floor of the house.
When the firefighters arrived, the flames had already struck out of a window.
The police went into the apartment and found the body in a room.
This and another room burned out completely.
The entire ground floor was damaged.
All the other residents were not at home during the fire, the police spokesman said.
The building is no longer habitable.
The exact cause of the fire was not clear at first.
Germany’s largest state church has launched an offensive to promote the pastor’s profession.
The background is a possible parishioner shortage: The Evangelical Lutheran Land Church in Hanover expects that the number of its currently around 1,800 pastors and pastors will halve according to the current situation by 2030.
For young people today, the profession is very attractive and offers good prospects for the future, said Pastor Mathis Burfien (43) in an interview with the Evangelical Press Service.
It is attractive to be able to determine the work and daily course itself.
With Burfien, the state church for the first time commissioned a full-time pastor to inspire young people to study theology.
At present, fewer and fewer young people decide to study theology after graduation.
Burfien traces this back to the process of de-churchization: "The voice of God is silent, the world is loud".
The profession is characterized by great freedom and diversity.
I am the master of my calendar and can put my focus where it matters to me.
Pastors could be very close to people as pastors.
They earned as much as teachers and could live well from it.
Surely, in the free economy, more would be paid, but theologians would have a safe employer for that.
This comes to the young people of today, who are concerned not only with a career, but with a sense of work.
According to the Landeskirche, which covers three quarters of Lower Saxony, around 60 pastors are currently retired each year.
At the same time, about 40 graduates of a theology degree begin their vicariate.
In sparsely populated outskirts such as Harz, Emsland or Wendland, it may be difficult to occupy jobs in the future.
Among other things, Burfien wants to organize study days for young people and also invite celebrities who have studied theology.
The theology program offers a broad education.
You can even become a federal president.
Land Rover Rally Series Announced
Inside there are racing seats and six-point belts as well as a free speaker system.
The options range from reinforced brakes, a service package with support from Bowler Works mechanics and logistical support to vehicle storage between events.
Drew Bowler, Managing Director of Bowler Motorsport, explains: “The rally customers who come to Bowler have changed.”
They are not all experienced racers, but people who are looking for excitement and adventure as well as an accessible path to world-class events.
We are excited to be able to open this path in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA and believe that the format opens up new opportunities to experience the different rally disciplines in the UK and abroad and prepare newcomers for the hardships and reality of Rally Raid.
We really enjoyed developing the Defender Challenge wagons – it’s going to be an entertaining championship.
In addition, the Defender Challenge will feature a training and testing day in February, as well as the option to participate in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East.
Firefighter called to rescue a puppy that was stuck 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous boulder in a quarry
Cockerspaniel bitch Ruby had run away after a minor traffic accident
Three days later she was discovered by a walker in a quarry in her miserable location
Firefighters sailed off to the rock wall and saved the dog from safe death
The firefighters managed to secure a puppy that was stuck on a 15-meter-high protrusion in a rock wall.
Ruby, a nine-month-old Cocker Spaniel dog, escaped after a car crash on Sunday afternoon and survived alone for three days before being rescued from a quarry on Wednesday.
Scott Alderson, 25, and his friend Becky Hall, 20, to whom the dog belongs, came to the flappit quarry in Denholme, West Yorkshire to take Ruby back in and thank the firefighters of the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They had desperately searched for their missing dog and posted calls for help on social networks when she had escaped into the quarry after the small traffic accident.
Around 14:15 on Wednesday, a walker running his dog saw the stranded ruby on the 15-metre-high heel in the quarry.
The Cleckheaton Fire Station technical rescue team rushed to the scene and sailed off to rescue Ruby, who was then transported in a dog box upstairs.
Andy Clayton, a specialist on the technical rescue team, said: “She was in a dangerous situation.
It was located in the middle of the rock wall – 15 meters from the top and the bottom.
She didn’t move a muscle during her rescue – she was like frozen.
But now she's fine.
She then ate a few dog cakes.
This was a rather unusual operation.
The fact that the dog was discovered is unbelievable.
Peter Lau, a specialist on the technical rescue team, said: “Ruby was a huge lucky guy.”
There was a possibility that she was very seriously injured or worse.
Ruby was taken to the veterinarian for examination, but he found nothing but exhaustion and dehydration.
Becky Hall of Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: “Watching the rescue was scary.”
I couldn’t believe she was really up there.
It was wonderful to hold them back in my arms.
The veterinarian explained that if the exhaustion had become too big and it had collapsed, it would probably have crashed.
The firefighters did a great job.
It was really brave what they did.
We are just so grateful and each of them was absolutely incredible.
Scott Alderson of Keighley added: "We were afraid she would fall down, but she stayed up."
The firefighters were great.
I can't believe where she was.
Mick Jagger says he never hooked up with Katy Perry when she was 18.
In an interview with an Australian radio station this week, the pop star said she worked as a background singer on Jagger's 2004 song "Old Habits Die Hard".
Perry explained that she had dined with the altrocker at night, and that "he bullied me when I was 18."
She added: “It’s been a long time and he was very kind to me.”
In a statement, a spokesman for Jaggers, 70, said on Thursday that he “categorically denies that he has ever made any attempts to approach Katy Perry.”
The representative added, “Maybe she confused him with someone else.”
Perry was one of the singers who had a guest appearance on the Rolling Stones tour this year.
Their new album "Prism" was ranked number one this week.
George Kerevan: European detachment gives the Scots the choice
A new day, a new horror story of independence.
This time we are warned that an independent Scotland is required to join the Schengen area as a condition for EU membership.
This provides the keyword for stories about passport controls in Berwick and a barbed wire secured border along the Hadrian's Wall.
Indeed, the Strathclyde model pointed out the potential economic benefits that would bring more freedom of travel in the rest of Europe, but this was not expected to play a role in the headlines.
Nor has anyone mentioned that EU member states often bend their strict rules when it is more favorable for them.
Since Scotland is not currently part of the Schengen area, the continued disregard for Brussels would only be a small concession in return for what you really want from the Scots.
Not really a story.
And one that has come so far in the years that it already resembles a fossil: The first time I heard the “Independence means passport controls” duck at least 40 years ago.
An interesting point is lost in the constant repetition of this ancient history.
Why should one expect an independent Scotland to dance after the European pipe?
Why exchange the London yoke for the Brussels yoke, especially now?
These are the real European news: the great post-war plan to unify Europe has come to a standstill.
With the euro crisis, the project Europe officially died.
Everywhere in the EU, parties gain ground that are hostile to the EU or want to throw the euro overboard as a community currency.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Alternative for Germany party – founded only this year – was able to win nearly five million votes in the September Bundestag elections and thus effectively expel the Free Democrats (the equivalent of the British Liberal Democrats) from the Bundestag.
There has always been domestic resistance to the plan to create a federalist Europe.
However, the current economic crisis is a turning point.
Due to the strict austerity policy imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank in connection with the forced jacket, into which the respective national economy is forced by holding on to the common currency, many people have considered that the project Europe has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments causing excessive budget deficits – this was only the case in Greece.
Instead, the Eurosystem has nailed its members to exchange rates that are advantageous for German exporters – and German politicians would like to let that happen.
Without the possibility of depreciation of the local currency, southern Europe finds itself with a built-in productivity disadvantage compared to Germany.
The only way is to cut wages and public spending – driven by Berlin.
Behind the current state and monetary problems lies a deep-rooted European productivity problem.
As a result of the “green” energy directives enacted by Brussels – a code for subsidizing French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers – European industry pays twice for electricity and quadruples for gas compared to the United States.
This is a crippling cost disadvantage, as we have already seen in Grangemouth.
All of the world’s payroll bills do not protect the European petrochemical industry from being pushed into the corner by cheap American shale gas.
As a result, a revolt is drawing up, especially in France, the former cheerleader of the EU.
After the war, the political elite of France saw the EU as a vehicle to keep Germany in check and raise Paris to the heights of Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a gateway to political legitimacy, and Europe has imposed its own economic policy, which the French economy is struggling with.
The result: Marine Le Pen’s right-wing, EU-hostile Front National just won a decisive by-election, placing the ruling socialists in third place.
The Front National is now the most popular party in France with 24 percent of the vote – a timely warning to the UK Labour Party that it cannot assume that a split in the right spectrum would automatically mean benefits to the left.
What does Le Pen do with its newly gained popularity among white working-class French?
She wants to use the EU elections next year to forge an anti-EU, anti-community currency bloc in the European Parliament.
If the anti-EU parties do well in these elections – and this is very possible – then for the first time such a bloc could dominate the European Parliament.
This is the point I want to go further: In the not too distant future, the growing resentment towards the EU and the single currency will come together to abolish the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but rather it will become something like the “Europe of the (sovereign) nations” that General de Gaulle favored.
Germany and some of its satellite economies may hold onto the euro, but France and southern Europe will return to their own currencies.
I expect the UK to distance itself from this project in the hope of getting involved with the US.
However, Washington’s growing interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will stand alone in the Atlantic rain.
Where is Scotland in all of this?
We can choose to be a region of (the last consequence) Little England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests – which also includes telling Berlin and Brussels what they can put themselves where.
I suspect Scotland could do well in a looser European union if we keep our own currency.
Cooperation with other similarly thought countries is easier for nations in a non-federal Europe.
Otherwise, we should consider equating it with Norway and maintaining our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland is – remarkably – the most successful political movement against austerity in Europe and has won a spectacular majority in 2011 due to the rejection of the proposed (and undertaken) cuts that Labour Finance Minister Alistair Darling and the ensuing Tory-Lib Demworden had.
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to choose independence now, only to get a policy of austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early puberty: growing up faster
African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white peers, research shows.
Physical changes do not immediately mean puberty.
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible
Experts believe that epidemic obesity is a trigger of early puberty
The trend towards early puberty is less pronounced in boys
Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist who specializes in child health and family issues.
Should a mother be worried if her daughter already grows breasts and pubic hair at the age of seven or eight?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida, pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these early physical changes were relatively normal among American girls and represented a new norm.
“I spend a lot of time calming down parents – usually this is not a sign that puberty is fast approaching,” Kaplowitz said.
Obvious signs of development, such as growing breasts, pubic and armpit hair, as well as body odor, appear earlier in girls.
However, there was only a slight shift in the age of menarche (the appearance of the first regular bleeding) in the last 40 years.
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, slightly less than 12.75 in 1970.
“When breast development begins, it takes at least two to three years to develop menarche,” said Kaplowitz, also author of the book “Early Puberty in Girls: The Essential Guide to Dealing with This Common Problem.”
Time is the most accurate test of how puberty progresses.
It is controversial what actually marks the beginning of puberty, but it is considered “pregnancy” when breast enlargement is accompanied by a growth boost before the age of eight.
In most cases, the process slows down or stagnates – something that a pediatrician can monitor closely.
In case of faster progress, tests may be indicated by an endichronologist to rule out serious problems such as tumors or cysts.
There are treatment methods for delaying an early menstruation and the defense of another consequence: premature aging of the bones, which can ultimately lead to inhibition of growth and thus small body growth in adults.
Recommendations for drug or hormonal therapy are based on the child’s age, developmental speed, growth rate and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is cautious about drugs, but he admits: “Suppressing puberty can alleviate behavioral problems and the feelings of girls, unlike being their peers.”
The other big problem is understandable: Parents just don’t want their very young daughters to have the period.
“They worry about the risk of pregnancy or how they handle the hygienic side,” Kaplowitz said.
“It was a shock,” recalls a woman whose daughter had ten days.
Although there were first signs and we had talked about menstruation, she was emotionally unprepared.
She came home frightened and excited from school because she was the first in her circle of friends.
There are many widely published theories about the causes of early puberty.
However, there is no conclusive evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media are causative.
Boys, like girls, come into puberty earlier.
Kaplowitz believes that the most convincing premise is the epidemic of obesity.
He supported a 2001 study of girls between the ages of six and nine that establishes a link between body fat and puberty.
Other research supports this conclusion, but there are many other factors that played a role.
In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white counterparts.
There are different explanations for this.
Globally, early puberty seems to be influenced by all sorts of things, from economic conditions to climate to genes.
Another mystery: Although boys grow facial and pubic hair earlier, the trend towards a full-fledged early puberty is not as pronounced as in girls.
Other doctors at the AAP conference underlined the complexity of the topic.
The appearance of acne and pubic hair is common even in babies and toddlers.
“We need to be careful how we identify the true beginning of puberty,” said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at Gorieb Children’s Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to get advice from their pediatrician on how to talk to their child.
“This may mean that you have to have a conversation earlier than expected,” Kaplowitz said.
If you stay calm, the child usually responds well.
Girls who blossom early need insurance that the process is a normal part of life, even if it occurs earlier than thought.
Jumbo manufacturers are arguing over seat width in the face of large orders
There has been a dispute between leading aircraft manufacturers over the width of seats in the tourist class on long-haul flights, indicating the tone for a bitter collision at the Dubai Airshow this month.
The controversy revolves around the width of seats offered to passengers on long-haul flights in the tourist class – not always those for which airlines make the most efforts, but this designated space is the key to efficiency claims on the latest aircraft from Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
Airbus this week demanded an industry standard requiring a seat width of at least 46 cm (18 inches) in the tourist class, but the U.S. arch rival Boeing says that should be decided by airlines.
The dispute comes at a time when aircraft manufacturers are competing to sell even larger versions of their two-engine long-haul aircraft, and expect record orders at the event from November 17 to 21.
How the rear of the aircraft is designed – especially whether there are rows of nine or ten seats – is crucial for the stated economic results that the new “mini-jumbo” design is expected to deliver.
Boeing claims its modernized “777X” holds 406 seats in the tourist class that are over 17 inches wide, allowing ten per row.
Airbus explains that the competing version of the A350 carried 350 people in 18-inch wide seats in the tourist class, with there being nine per row.
Aircraft giants often share technical details through advertising in the professional press.
Airbus is now appealing directly to the public ahead of the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X is expected to make the race with over 100 orders.
Recently, the company presented an ad that could be the beginning of a new ad war and showed donors an image of three people squeezed together in a restaurant, with the title, “Would you accept that?”
“Boeing is proposing long-haul flights in seats that are narrower than regional turboprops,” said Airbus chief sales officer John Leahy.
In the face of changing eating habits, people get fatter, but airplane seats have not changed radically.
Between the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747 defined modern long-haul travel, and the end of the century, the weight of the male average American between the ages of 40 and 49 increased by ten percent, according to data from the U.S. Department of Health.
According to U.S. health statistics, the waist circumference of the male average American in the 21st century is 100.8 cm.
Airbus says its rival adheres to a seat concept from the 1950s when the average body circumference of the freshly-baptized “Jet Set” was narrower.
According to Airbus, studies have shown that an additional inch (2.54 cm) per seat increases sleep quality by 53 percent.
Boeing denies Airbus' figures on the seat dimensions and says it is not up to the manufacturers to decide how airlines are balancing airfares and facilities.
The company also explains that, according to research, the experience on the plane depends on more than the width of the seat.
“It’s really about giving airlines the flexibility to do what they think they need to do to be successful,” said Kent Craver, Boeing’s cockpit expert.
They don’t want us to dictate to them what makes them profitable.
They know their business better than anyone else.
For passengers, it is about more elbow freedom, but for manufacturers, it will increasingly be a topic that can have an impact on sales.
Behind the controversy lies a race for aircraft orders with an estimated volume of at least $700 billion at list prices in the coming decades, which could sustainably affect the export balance of the United States or Europe.
As Reuters first reported in July, the seat layout is the driving force behind the fight over the new jets.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim 20 percent more efficiency per seat in their latest two-engine long-haul designs than the market leader in this segment, the 365-seat Boeing 77-300ER.
Boeing’s statements on the results depend in part on the fact that the 777X with its ten seats per row is compared to the original nine-seat design in the 777.
The increased cost per unit is still lower than with the currently used machines with ten seats per row.
“Boeing is squeezing more seats into its aircraft to make it more competitive with our products,” said Kevin Keniston, Head of Passenger Comfort at European Airbus.
On the other hand, analysts say full cabins with ten seats per row on existing 777s indicated that many passengers opted for the tighter arrangement, which could be accompanied by cheaper airfares.
“Eighteen-inch seat width would be great for passengers, but the reality is that from an economic point of view, the Airbus offer is driven by the threat from the 777,” said Mary Kirby, cabin installation expert, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not offer seats, but a catalogue of suppliers from which airlines can choose.
The world-famous jet sellers even carry bandwidth with them to match the facility to the competition.
Even if they praise comfort, all manufacturers also offer jets with high-density design for low-cost airlines and regional flights.
Airbus offers an A350 with ten-seat rows, but has not yet sold one, according to its own statement.
Until recently, Airbus has emphasized the importance of greater adaptability of the cabins and offered wide seats on the aisles for some jets.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets, experts say the reputation for a new industry standard is likely to stifle, but could distract from the wave of 777X sales.
New anti-nicotine vaccine could make the pleasure of smoking go away
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could spoil the fun of smoking.
A single dose of the vaccine could protect mice from nicotine addiction for a lifetime.
Further tests on humans are needed, which may take a few more years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said the first results are good.
“We are very hopeful that this type of vaccination strategy can once again help millions of smokers who have tried to quit trying all the methods available on the market but have had to experience that their nicotine addiction is stronger than these approaches,” Cornell said.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified to contain the genetic information for the production of nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells, which then produce a constant stream of antibodies.
The antibodies chase the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before they reach the brain, causing a smoker to experience no nicotine high.
In trials, vaccinated mice given nicotine maintained their normal activity levels.
Mice without vaccination, on the other hand, would have taken “a break,” the researchers explained, a sign that the nicotine had reached their brains.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Former tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
The vaccinations had to be given so often to maintain the level of antibodies that they were expensive and impractical.
But the cost of the new vaccine is likely to be significantly lower, as it transforms liver cells into antibody factories.
As Professor Crystal said, a future vaccine for humans, if it is completely safe, could be given to children before they were tempted to try a cigarette, thus preventing nicotine addiction.
However, it is more likely that smokers would use it to stop.
“They know that when they start smoking again, they don’t feel comfortable with the nicotine vaccine anymore, and that helps them quit the habit,” he explains.
British scientists said the results were interesting, but at the same time warned that further research was needed.
Tripodi denies being influenced by Obeid
Former Labor Party minister Joe Tripodi from New South Wales is being investigated by state corruption oversight.
The former NSW minister denies having changed the maritime lease rules at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who owned covert holdings on three lands on state-controlled land.
The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) on Friday expanded its investigations into whether Obeid influenced various ministers of state to extend lease agreements at Circular Quay, where the Obeids operated two restaurants and a café, without tender after their expiration in August 2005.
It is now being investigated for the allegation that Tripodi knew of Obeid’s covert interest in the plots after Tripodi’s former deputy chief of staff Lynne Ashpole said accordingly on Thursday.
In years of talks that began in 2005, the government had pushed for public tenders for the lease agreements.
The tenants were against it and also wanted longer durations.
In 2009, the lease contracts for the companies at Circular Quay, which brought the Obeids $2.5 million annually, were renewed without a public tender.
Tripodi, who served as port minister from February 2006 to November 2009, had originally opted for public tenders.
But he denied having made the changes at the request of Obeid, who, as Tripodi confirmed, had pushed for a reform of the government’s lease arrangements.
A telephone record submitted by the ICAC showed conversations between Obeid, Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who had moved to the port ministry after working under Obeid in the fisheries authority, from August to September 2007.
“Was the issue discussed in these telephone conversations the development of commercial leasing arrangements?” asked Deputy Commissioner Anthony Whealy Tripodi.
“No,” answered Tripodi.
I can't remember what was discussed, but it definitely wasn't.
Definitely not between me and Mr. Obeid.
Israeli fighter jets attack target in Syria, official sources say
Israeli fighter jets attacked a target in the Syrian port of Latakia on Thursday night, a senior government official told Fox News.
The official did not explain what the target was, but said it was at least one.
According to the Associated Press, the targets were Russian SA-125 missiles.
At least twice this year, Israel has carried out airstrikes on missile deliveries in Syria.
Foreign workers with 457 visas could be subjected to “authenticity test”
The government is considering an “authenticity test” for foreign workers with a 457 visa as part of expanded measures.
Should the test be introduced, it would be used over a criterion designed to prevent the 457 from being used to occupy unskilled jobs or as a back door for the arrival of family and friends to Australia.
A government discussion proposal was released today after former Labor Party MP Maxine McKew condemned the government’s comments regarding foreign workers because they could be perceived as insulting by Australia’s neighbors.
“Noisy statements like ‘foreigners should stand behind’ and ‘australians should stand first’ are a very unpleasant relapse at a time when unions were calling for a protected labour market,” she told the Australia India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that white workers should be protected – and if some in the region echoed this historic artifact, I wouldn’t be surprised.
The discussion proposal outlines twelve measures that were once considered by the former Minister of Immigration Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday to discuss human smuggling, has implemented five of the recommended changes, the others are still under consideration.
If the "authenticity criterion" is adopted, then someone applying for a visa could be checked to see if "the application is genuine in cases where the applicant is related or personally related to the holder or a relevant person of the supporting company."
Companies could also be required to account for the number of 457 visa holders after companies that initially wanted to support only a small number of workers eventually hired hundreds in the past.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker allegedly died of a heart attack after arriving on Christmas Island this week on a refugee boat.
The troubled nine-year-old son of the man who had come to Australia with him has been cared for by an adult cousin who was also on the boat since his father’s death on Wednesday.
Australian authorities took the man to Christmas Island Hospital, where he died.
The UK government has announced a study to increase the benefits of the HS2 rail project for Scotland.
In the work of HS2 Ltd, it is proposed to implement high-speed connections between Scotland and the north of England as early as the beginning of Phase 1 in 2026.
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said the project “will bring Britain closer together.”
Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was delighted to work with the UK government on this plan.
Phase 1 consists of a new high-speed rail connection between London and the West Midlands.
After completing Phase 2, there will be connections to Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government corrected the estimated cost of building the high-speed road between London and Northern England from <0xC2><0xA3>32.7 billion to <0xC2><0xA3>42.6 billion.
The UK government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, has commissioned HS2 Ltd to look for further route capacity and travel time improvements for Northern England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of a journey time of ultimately three hours or less from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London.
Baroness Kramer said: “Our goal for HS2 is a truly national route network that brings the UK and its cities closer together.”
We are moving forward with HS2 because it brings huge benefits.
Without it, we are facing a capacity crisis in our rail network.
But it is also about the connection between 18 UK cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which is improved thanks to HS2.
Scottish Secretary of State Alistair Carmichael commented: “Today’s announcement is good news for Scotland.”
On behalf of the Scottish government, Keith Brown urged Carmichael to make an "unambiguous" commitment to Scottish involvement in the HS2 network.
Brown said: “The high-speed rail connection carries the potential for enormous economic benefits for Scotland, but at the same time the economic strength of Scotland provides an argument for fast rail connections across the UK.”
Therefore, we are pleased to work as a partner of the UK government and to explore the options for a high-speed rail connection in Scotland that creates benefits for all and complements the Glasgow-Edinburgh connection that the Scottish government is already planning.
I look forward to reviewing the investigation report with the British ministers next year and deciding on the next steps together.
Regulations on electronic devices in aircraft remain in force in Australia for the time being
Australian air passengers must continue to turn off tablets and smartphones at take-off and landing, despite efforts in the US to loosen regulations for such devices.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) allows U.S. airlines to change their specifications so that passengers can read, watch or play videos on their devices during critical flight phases as long as they are in “flight mode.”
During most of the flight, passengers are already allowed to do so, but many people find it annoying that they are not allowed to read their e-books when taking off and landing.
Australian companies are observing the decision that requires U.S. airlines to do tons of work to implement it, but they are not pursuing immediate plans to change their regulations.
CASA also said it would review the announcement, but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical phases of flight in Australia still apply.
“The CASA does not currently have any specific regulations regarding the use of electronic devices in the aircraft,” the statement said.
The subject is subject to regulations that require airlines to maintain safety at all times and passengers to follow the safety instructions given by cabin crew.
Virgin has already held talks with CASA about expanding the use of its Wi-Fi entertainment system on flights and said it is open to changes, but these should be initiated by the legislature.
“We would welcome a review of CASA’s approval of electronic devices as we believe this would improve the customer experience after we now offer (wireless entertainment) during the flight,” a spokesperson said.
Qantas said it will continue to comply with the current regulations until further notice.
“Our current guidelines stipulate that electronic devices should not be used at launch and landing, and we currently have no plans to change that,” the company said in a statement.
The FAA regulations apply to U.S. airlines.
However, we are always interested in developments in regulations that passengers can benefit from, and we will certainly take a close look at the FAA decision and the reasons behind it.
The decision affects U.S. companies differently depending on the age of the fleet.
They need to prove that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference from mobile devices, and change manuals, training materials, hand luggage programs, and customer instruction.
“After an airline has confirmed the tolerance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use portable, lighter electronic devices such as tablets, e-book readers and smartphones at any height,” the FAA said in a statement.
In rare cases, in case of poor visibility, the crew will instruct the passengers to turn off the equipment during the landing.
The group also recommended storing heavier equipment safely under the seat or in the compartments above the seats during take-off and landing.
Before the revierderby against Schalke, fellow BVB trailers with light rockets had provided ugly scenes in the Veltins Arena.
Borussia Dortmund then announced the consequences.
Before the Bundesliga's Friday game against VfB Stuttgart, the ultras reacted with a silence - initially.
It was an unusual, almost ghostly acoustics that was offered to the viewer until shortly before the start of the Bundesliga match between the German vice champion Borussia Dortmund and VfB Stuttgart in Signal Iduna Park.
Most of the guests were listening to their songs.
On the other hand, the southern tribune, where the most loyal and loudest of BVB fans stand, presented itself at first in an exceptionally quiet manner: no singing, no shouting.
The podium of the Capo, which otherwise coordinates the joint incitement, remained unoccupied.
And right in front of the stands was a large flag with the inscription "Stadium Prohibition Section".
Only as goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller, as always, entered the place as the first BVB player, short-term cheers burned up.
As his teammates followed, there was loud singing and blowing scarves - but not everywhere.
There was nothing in the central blocks 12 and 13 of the southern tribune.
Also that stadium spokesman Norbert Dickel once again listed the positive experiences of the last days - derby victory, victory over Arsenal, contract extension of coach Jürgen Klopp - did not create a festive mood.
Only five minutes before the blast, the Capo climbed his podium - and the tension that had hitherto been gripped by his hands ended up in a loud scream, when Dickel, as usual, questioned the mood on the ranks in the stadium.
Finally, as always, the South Tribune was on its way - and finally here was again, as usual, the loudest place in the stadium.
And at the latest when the loud call "Derbysieger stands up" came with a blow from the southern tribune, everything was as usual.
The silence before was probably a reaction to the events of the past days.
Immediately before the revierderby at FC Schalke 04, some of the fellow BVB-trailers had fired lightning missiles into the spectators' ranks and onto the pitch - almost goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller.
The game was delayed due to the chaotic scenes.
BVB boss Hans-Joachim Watzke then received the tops of the Dortmunder Ultras in his office - and Watzke's words are believed to have been a rather uncomfortable appointment for the fans.
"There will be massive cuts for the entire ultra movement," the BVB boss announced at a podium discussion in Frankfurt on Thursday evening.
As an immediate measure, Watzke banned the Ultras from choreography for the home game against VfB Stuttgart.
“I forbade it,” he explained.
We cannot give up the zero-tolerance policy on pyrotechnics.
In addition, the ultras were shown various possibilities of punishment - until Tuesday, they now have time to decide on one.
Otherwise, according to Watzke, the BVB will impose a sanction by the end of next week.
"It's going to be cute," Watzke assured.
We can't wait to see how the reactions at the South Tribune will turn out.
Singapore’s penitentiary booms as the crisis reaches the middle class
Janani Amirthalinga exchanges a gold bracelet, a ring and a pair of earrings at a penitentiary in Singapore’s Bendemeer shopping mall to pay her daughters’ school fees.
“My husband and I just bought a house, there’s all my money in it,” says Amirthalinga.
Although she earns $3,000 (about <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1,730) each month as an administrative employee and her husband also works, the monthly family income is not enough, she explains.
In fact, demand in parts of Southeast Asia – where household debt is rising – is so high that ValueMax, where it traded, this week became the third mortgage listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange.
Firming jewelry is not only a quick way to get money – $1,300 in the case of Janani Amirthalinga – but also almost as cheap as an unsecured bank loan.
Typically, mortgages in Singapore require an effective annual rate of 17 percent, which is just above the 15.4 percent required by United Overseas Bank, a local lender with a branch in the same mall.
However, mortgage houses offer the advantage that there is no need to verify creditworthiness or proof of income, which is why loans are possible faster than with banks.
For this reason, millions of people in the region are turning to mortgages after families feel pressured by rising living costs as well as increasing household and consumer debt.
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap loans due to loose financial policies in the developed economies, low- and middle-income families are looking for mortgages to make up for the difference in a stagnant economy.
This week, the credit rating agency Standard & Poor’s growing domestic debt, mainly due to rising mortgages, described it as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have, according to the agency, the highest household debt in Asia in relation to gross domestic product.
Malaysia is at the top of the list with 80 percent of GDP, an increase of 60 percent in 2008.
Economists are also concerned about the high consumer debt in Thailand, which has barely emerged from a technical recession this week.
On Thursday, the data showed a continuing weakness in exports and a decline in consumer demand.
“In the end, this means that given rising costs, people in the middle to lower segment (the income scale) will try to supplement their income wherever possible,” says Song Seng Wun, economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Historical peaks in gold prices over the past two years have further strengthened the trend towards the pledge of personal items as people seize the opportunity to turn the family’s jewelry into cash.
In Singapore, about 70 percent of the pledged items in the city-state’s 200 pledge houses are gold.
People say, “The gold price looks good, let’s pledge Grandmother’s gold chain and get it back next month.”
The largest Thai mortgage operator, EasyMoney, has seen a 20 percent customer growth in its branches in recent months.
The growth in the mortgage business is so strong that ValueMax, the operator of the branch in Bendemeer and 15 others in Singapore, wants to expand not only to the neighboring Malaysia – where the company operates four homes – but also outside Asia, said Yeah Lee Ching, Managing Director of ValueMax.
The company finances this with 60 percent of the $66 million it raised this week in the Singapore Stock Exchange.
While some lenders have fallen into the crossfire due to high interest rates, Yeah explains that mortgages not only offer lower interest rates than other lenders, but also do not directly raise debts.
“Customers lend items they already own, and liquidating personal valuables doesn’t increase budget savings,” she explains.
The mortgage lending business is increasingly accepted socially as short-term, secured financing.
Also, not all people who use mortgages are in financial difficulties.
Rich people from Singapore also come to ValueMax’s stores to pledge gold bars and Rolex watches, for which they receive up to 60 percent of the purchase price in cash.
Customers from all walks of life come to us.
“This includes wealthy people who borrow something for a business or an investment in the short term, or small businesses who have to bridge bottlenecks in the cash flow,” says Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
NSA sucks data from Google and Yahoo - Snowden wants to help
Secret Service Revealer Edward Snowden has a principled interest in helping Germany solve the ever-increasing NSA spy business.
According to the presentation of the Green-Bundestag MP Hans-Christian Ströbele, his surprising meeting with Snowden in Russia was about the conditions under which the former intelligence officer would testify at a German prosecutor’s office or before a committee of inquiry.
Snowden referred to his complicated legal situation, Ströbele told ARD magazine "Panorama".
Rescue package of over 325 million Australian dollars for Tasmanian health care
The Australian government insists on the harsh conditions linked to the over $325 million Australian bailout for Tasmanian health care to ensure the state government cannot waste the money.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth will take "immediate action" to avert a crisis caused by an aging population of the island state, a higher rate of chronic diseases and systemic restrictions.
The funding for a period of four years was decided after government consultations with independent Tasmanian MP Andrew Wilkie.
“The government has launched an emergency rescue package that we believe addresses the unique challenges facing the state,” Plibersek said.
The $325 million package includes $31 million of immediate assistance for election benefits.
A further 2,600 surgeries, including orthopedic interventions and gray star treatments, will eliminate residues.
In addition, there is money for day clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better follow-up to hospital stays, specialist training, mental health services, and the introduction of an electronic health data record system in local hospitals.
“These investments are in line with the ideas that affected clinic staff have told me that they are the best way to improve the Tasmanian health system,” said Tanya Plibersek.
The minister insisted on a strict accountability and accountability of the Tasmanian government.
The state would have to maintain the current level of funding in order to receive money from the Commonwealth, and report monthly on where the additional funds were spent.
A three-member commission will be set up to ensure that the state provides health services as effectively and efficiently as possible.
As Wilkie explained today, the $325 million would be of little use if “they were not accompanied by genuine reforms that would put the public health system of Tasmania on a more sustainable course.”
Despite this, he praised the government for responding to his urgent request for help, which he first expressed to the prime minister in early May.
“I am confident that federal aid will make a major contribution to removing the state’s public health system from the care list,” Wilkie said.
According to the state government, these electoral benefits will largely outweigh the recent cuts.
But the health policy spokesman at the federal level, Peter Dutton, believes that today’s announcement is only a “patch solution.”
“We are in today’s situation because the Labor State government has withdrawn $430 million from the health care system,” he told ABC TV.
It cannot be that a state government pulls almost half a billion dollars out of the system and inserts 300 million into the Commonwealth and then pretends to be the good news.
Dutton urged Plibersek to ensure that not a single dollar of the bailout package is spent on additional bureaucracy.
Guillaume Nicloux’ adaptation of the novel by Denis Diderot convinces with exceptional production equipment and contemporary details, but it is also more expensive than necessary.
Set in France in the 1760s, it tells the gripping story of Suzanne, a young noble who is sent to the monastery by her family.
When she rebels, she is confronted with the extreme cruelty of an extremely sadistic superior and becomes the object of another’s erotic fascination.
The film never slips away into lucidity or sensationalism – and that’s his problem.
The solemn seriousness with which the film is told also makes it a tormenting penance shirt for the audience.
Syria Has Destroyed Its Possibility of Producing Chemical Weapons, According to a Surveillance Group
Syria has destroyed important chemical weapons and toxic gas ammunition facilities, the global chemical weapons monitoring group said on Thursday, as heavy clashes broke out in the north of the country near one of the sites where toxic substances are allegedly stored.
Also on Thursday, a Syrian activist group announced that more than 120,000 people had been killed since the beginning of the civil war three years ago.
The announcement of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) came a day before the date
On 1 November, the Hague-based Damascus organization set up to destroy or make “inoperable” all facilities for the manufacture of chemical weapons, including all machines for the mixing of chemicals into poison gas and filling of ammunition.
The completion of this process, which is basically the first stage of destruction, is an important milestone in an ambitious timetable aimed at the destruction of all chemical weapons in Syria by mid-2014.
The destruction of the facilities means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
Damascus, however, still has to start destroying the existing weapons and supplies.
According to estimates, there are about 1,000 tons of chemicals and weapons in the country, including mustard gas and the nerve gas sarin.
The announcement came at a time when fighting took place in the city of Safira on Thursday, experts say there is a production facility for chemical weapons as well as warehouses, the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported.
The activist group, which tracks the death toll through a network of activists in Syria, said on Thursday that 120.296 people had died.
There were 61,067 civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the government side, 29,954 of them belonged to the army of President Bashar Assad, 18,678 are government-friendly fighters and 187 Lebanese Hezbollah militias.
Also among the dead are 2,202 deserted army soldiers and 5,375 opposition fighters, many of them foreigners.
On July 25, the UN estimated the number of deaths in this conflict since March 2011 at 100,000.
This number has not yet been updated.
The conflict forced about two million people to flee the country.
Assad’s troops have been fighting for weeks in Safira against the rebels, many of whom have ties to al-Qaeda groups.
The observatory said there were losses on both sides on Thursday, but did not give details.
The fighting underscores the danger posed by the chemical weapons inspectors, as their mission to liberate Syria from its toxic arsenal is a race against time amidst a roaring civil war.
According to the OPCW, which is working closely with the United Nations, the team is “now convinced that it has seen and experienced the destruction of all the important production and mixing/filling facilities mentioned by Syria.”
“Therefore, no further inspection activities are currently planned.”
Earlier this week, the inspectors said they had completed the first round of inspections and visited 21 of the 23 sites indicated by Damascus.
Due to security concerns, it was not possible to visit two facilities, the inspectors said.
On Thursday, the OPWC said the two sites had been “abandoned ... and the existing chemical weapons program objects there had been relocated to other mentioned facilities that had been inspected.”
It was not immediately clear whether the site in Safira was one of the two facilities that the OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria has submitted a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which must be approved by the OPWC Executive Committee next month.
“I take my hat off the bravery and courage that you have all shown in fulfilling the most challenging mission ever performed by this organization,” said Ahmed Uzumcu, Director-General of the Monitoring Organization, in a commentary published by OPCW.
For three years now, the mainly Sunni Muslim rebels in this civil war have been fighting against Assad’s government and its security forces, which belong to many members of the Alawites, a split of Shia Islam.
In view of further developments, the head of the observation group, Rami Abdurrahman, said there was a strong explosion on Wednesday in an air defense facility in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion is not known, he said.
Anger over conviction of Bali bombers
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people who died in the Bali bombing in 2002 reacted angrily to the verdict for the last of the instigators, which was brought to court as Umar Patek was in her view to be shot by the state.
Patek, who was on the run for nearly ten years as one of Southeast Asia’s most wanted people, was sentenced to 20 years in prison yesterday for his role in building explosives for the bombing.
He could be released after 15 years.
The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder for attacking two nightclubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, killing 202 people, including 88 Australians, and injuring many others.
A prosecution also took place in a number of terrorism-related charges, including a wave of explosive attacks on churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
The prosecutor’s office had demanded a life sentence, even though it could have applied for the death penalty for the man, who is also known as a master bomb builder because of his reputation as a “demolition man”.
The decision has aroused painful memories of June Corteen, a mother from Perth who lost her 39-year-old twin daughters Jane and Jenny in the devastation caused by Patek and his co-conspirators nearly ten years ago.
Fighting with tears, she said Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really mean, he should follow in the footsteps of the other guys.
"You should put him in front of a firing squad," Corteen told AAP.
I have to live every day with the fact that I will not have any more grandchildren and I will never see my daughters again.
The Sari Club was equated to the ground when a huge bomb exploded in a small truck parked in front of the nightclub shortly after 11 p.m. on October 12, 2002.
Peter Hughes was at Paddy's Bar, where just 20 seconds earlier a suicide bomber had a backpack filled with explosives exploded.
He fell into a coma for a month after the attack and "died" three times while hanging on to a life support system.
Hughes said Patek deserved the same fate as the other three members of the terrorist cell Jemaah Islamiah – Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra – who were responsible for the bloodbath and were executed four years ago.
Really, this guy should get the death penalty before everyone else.
To leave him alive – no, there is no reason to leave him alive.
Getting 20 years after he killed 202 people and injured many hundreds is not much.
Patek is the last of the Bali bombers to stand trial.
He escaped nearly a decade of arrest, but was eventually arrested in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where U.S. forces killed former al-Qaida chief Osama bin Laden nearly four months later.
During the negotiation, an FBI agent said intelligence reports indicated that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden with the aim of rebuilding the connection between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaeda.
“He didn’t stand up,” Corteen said.
Until recently, he has shown no remorse for how much suffering he has inflicted on other people.
The verdict came ahead of the tenth anniversary of this year’s attack, which is being celebrated in Bali and Australia.
“There will be a lot of tears this year,” Corteen said.
Patek can still appeal his verdict.
FAA: Passengers can now use electronic devices on airplanes (but do not conduct cell phone calls)
Passengers can now use their electronic devices to read, work, play, listen to music and watch movies, but not phone, according to new guidelines issued Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the United States.
However, passengers should not expect these changes to be implemented immediately.
How quickly they would be implemented depends on the respective airline, FAA staff member Michael Huerta said at a press conference.
Airlines must prove to the FAA that aircraft comply with the new guidelines and that they have updated the flight crew training manuals as well as the provisions for storing the equipment in accordance with the new regulations.
The FAA said it had already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices in aircraft.
Among these airlines were Delta and JetBlue.
“Depending on the state of the plan, we could approve the extended use of electronic devices very soon,” the FAA said in a statement.
Currently, passengers have to turn off smartphones, tablets and other devices when the airplane doors are closed.
They are only allowed to restart until the aircraft has reached a height of three kilometers and the captain gives the green light.
Passengers must turn it off again when they enter landing and are not allowed to restart until the plane has landed.
According to the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are protected against electronic interference could allow their passengers to use the devices even during take-off, landing and rolling, the FAA said.
Most new transport aircraft and other aircraft that have been upgraded to use Wi-Fi at higher altitudes should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the professional flight attendants’ association, welcomed the changes.
“If the new regulation is implemented safely – and we are working closely with the airline in this regard – both sides will benefit from it,” Glading said.
We are frankly tired of having to feel like guardians on this issue.
However, internet connections for browsing, exchanging emails, text messages or downloading data under three kilometers remained prohibited, the authority explained.
Passengers are asked to put smartphones, tablets and other devices into flight mode.
So still no “Words With Friends”, the Scrabble-like online game that actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011, when he had to leave a jet of American Airlines publicly because he refused to turn off the device while the plane was parked on the runway.
And heavier devices like laptops still need to be stored, as there is a risk of injury here if they fly through the cabin.
Mobile phone calls during the flight are also prohibited.
The regulatory authority for telephone calls lies with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), not the FAA.
FAA may lift ban on certain electronic devices at launch and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board, a national transport safety expert, told CBS News that mobile phones would still be considered a risk.
“Handys are really a problem, not only because they could potentially cause interference to navigation devices, but because we know from the FCC that airborne transmission can also interfere with transmitters,” Rosenker said.
An industry advisory committee set up by the FAA to investigate the issue recommended last month that the government allow a wider use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years, pressure has increased on the FAA to ease restrictions on use.
Critics such as Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri are of the view that there are no valid security grounds for the ban.
Restrictions are also increasingly difficult to enforce because the use of devices has become ubiquitous.
In some studies, it is reported that up to a third of passengers forget or ignore turning off the device.
In 1966, the FAA began restricting the use of electronic devices by air travelers after reports of navigation and communication equipment malfunctions were made known by passenger-carried UHF radios, which were the latest technology trend at the time.
New aircraft are far more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed and approved by the FAA so that they do not care about electronic interference.
Airlines have been offering passengers Wi-Fi for several years when the flight altitude is reached.
The aircraft adapted to Wi-Fi systems are also insensitive to interference.
The vast majority of passenger aircraft should be suitable for the stronger use of electronic devices under the new guidelines, Huerta said.
Today’s electronic devices generally emit significantly less radio radiation than previous generations.
For example, e-readers only emit minimal radiation when you flip.
However, when downloading or sending data, the transmission values are stronger.
Amazon.com is one of the proponents of easing restrictions on the use of devices by passengers.
In 2011, company employees loaded a passenger plane full of Kindle e-readers and made a test flight to identify problems, but could not detect any.
Members of the FAA Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings regarding the risk of using devices.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers said he believes the disruption by the devices is real, even if the risk is minimal.
Other committee members said there were only isolated reports of pilots speaking out for aircraft systems to be disrupted by the devices, and most of them are very old.
However, the committee recommended that the FAA allow pilots to order the passengers to shut down the equipment when instrument landing under poor visibility conditions.
A group from the travel industry welcomed the changes and described them as a reasonable adjustment for travelers who would be heavily equipped with technology today.
“We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not at odds with safety,” said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.
Rescued bird released by air rescue service of North Sea drilling island
A bird flying to the coast by air rescue service, which had been found exhausted on a North Sea drilling island, was released back into nature.
The water rally was flown by helicopter to Aberdeen last month, where it was unraveled by the Scottish animal welfare organisation SPCA at its rescue center in Alloa.
Colin Seddon, head of the center, said: “This water rally was probably a wintertime migratory bird from northern Europe that was stopped by the strong winds over the North Sea.”
Apparently the exhausted bird sought refuge on the drilling rig.
He added: “He couldn’t fly any further, so we were contacted for help.”
When she was released, the water rally was fit and healthy again.
Is Europe’s elite ready to do business with the UK?
Business for Britain was launched in April with the intention of bringing the economy to a table and defining what those who care for prosperity and work in the UK want to change on our relations with the EU.
To this end, we commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey among UK economic leaders and asked them what they think about the UK, the economy and the EU.
YouGov surveyed more than 1,000 business executives, representing approximately UK corporate sizes, sectors and regions.
The results of the survey will surprise many.
We have found that the vast majority of companies are now exporting outside of Europe, focusing on countries that are modernizing and growing while states in the EU are stagnating.
They want the government to foster new trade ties with countries such as China, India and Brazil, instead of stopping the long and strenuous process of reforming the dark EU institutions.
Asked about their views on certain legal issues – from antitrust law to product legislation – the majority of business leaders believe that control over these key competencies should be brought back to Westminster.
There was general dissatisfaction with the single market, as, according to the companies, the costs of the Brussels regulations would now outweigh the benefits of being part of Europe’s trade area – even 40% of large companies agreed to the ones that are traditionally the most European-friendly.
Finally, and that probably says the most, our survey of economic leaders showed that a clear majority of the UK wants a course towards a change in the agreement and a relationship with the EU based on trade, not politics.
This insight, found in companies of all sizes and leading corporations, shows that the economy is pushing for a “sensitive change” that brings the lever of action back to the UK.
It’s all about a lot – a change to the deal and better conditions for the UK would lead to a 16 percent change of opinion in favor of staying in the EU in a referendum.
The Prime Minister should have no doubts: This survey shows that the British economy is behind its plan for renegotiating the British conditions for EU membership.
It also shows that companies expect a renegotiation to significantly shift power relations back to the UK.
A better deal for the UK economy is possible and increasingly necessary as the eurozone moves towards a closer economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be jobs and growth in the UK, as the results of our survey show, which means for companies a stronger focus on trade and a fundamental change in the Brussels approach to regulations.
Alexei Miller of Gazprom describes pipeline in Bulgaria as the beginning of a new gas pipeline
The construction of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria marks the start of one of Europe’s largest energy projects, the Gazprom Board of Directors said.
“Today’s event is a milestone: construction work on the Bulgarian section of the South Stream gas pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe, has begun,” Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller said in a statement Thursday.
The project is a key element for the energy security of the entire European continent.
South Stream aims to diversify Russia’s export routes through Europe.
A contractual dispute between Gazprom and its counterparts in Ukraine, where most of Russia’s gas is stored for Europe, creates an increased risk on conventional routes, as can be heard from the official side.
Miller said the direct link to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, meant that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries were “forever” excluded.
Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from South Stream at discounted rates when the entire project goes into operation in 2015.
According to Gazprom, construction work in other subordinate countries will begin on the planned route by the end of the year.
The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 62.3 billion cubic meters of natural gas.
For national and international investors, there is no way past the real estate location in Germany.
The economic framework data are correct, and the funding opportunities are excellent.
This has been the tenor of the 9th day of real estate of the stock exchange newspaper.
The German real estate markets benefit from the economic strength and the good economic conditions in the country compared to Europe.
This was pointed out by Christian Ulbrich, CEO Europe, Middle East and Africa of Jones Lang LaSalle, on the 9th real estate day of the stock exchange newspaper.
The look at the transaction volume shows how sought-after German commercial real estate is, Ulbrich said.
In the first three quarters of this year, it increased by 31% compared to the previous year’s period.
In the UK, the increase was only 6%, while in France it was 19%.
"Real estate investments offer an attractive rate of interest," said Ulbrich.
The yield gap between real estate and federal bonds is at a historically high level.
The FAA loosens restrictions on the use of electronic devices in aircraft – even if phone calls with the phone remain prohibited.

Royal Commission Hearing: Two YMCA Employees Charged with Sexual Offences Against Jonathan Lord
Two YMCA employees from New South Wales (NSW) were charged with child-related sexual offences before charges were filed against Caringbah childminder Jonathan Lord in 2011, as the Royal Commission on Sexual Abuse of Children found out.
However, in the opening statement before the Commission, the YMCA had stated that it had “never had anything to do with an incident of sexual abuse of children in the organization.”
Managing Director Phillip Hare was interviewed on a case where one YMCA employee had been charged with child pornography offences, and another where a YMCA Caringbah Hall sports teacher had been convicted of abuse of children entrusted to him.
Hare told Gail Furness, one of the Commission’s assistant lawyers, that he knew about the first case but did not know about the second.
He acknowledged that the YMCA’s opening statement to the Commission was also inaccurate in the claim that “there were external audits of the YMCA in which the YMCA was recognized as the frontline in child safety”.
Rather, evidence before the Commission shows that the YMCA was informed that it received the second lowest rating out of four possible in a quality audit by the Department of Education and Communities in August of the year.
Hare, who started with the YMCA at 21, admitted that the management “failed downwards from me” in Lord’s hiring and did not ensure that employees were aware of their obligations to report violations of the child safety guidelines.
Earlier this year, Lord had been convicted of sexually assaulting twelve boys during his two-year tenure for the YMCA.
He was sentenced to at least six years in prison.
Hare, however, denied that the YMCA had a cultural problem that prevented employees from reporting Lord’s violations regarding the safety of children.
The staff said they had observed violations, including that Lord was alone with children, cared for them privately as a babysitter, had them sit on his lap, told one that he loved it, and had children play with his phone.
Danielle Ockwell, whose supervisor was Lord and who had asked for training on child protection because she was concerned about his behavior, said that Jacqui Barnat, who was the Lords' supervisor at YMCA Caringbah, was "very intimidating and most of the time very inaccessible."
The CEO stated that he would not accept statements from employees that they would not dare to return their report to their superiors.
Instead, he said, her friendship with Lord had impaired her judgment, which was why they had not reported him.
Hare said he had told the board of YMCA NSW his view that the lesson the organization had to learn from the “Jonathan Lord Incident” was “not reporting” by employees, and the board had agreed to it.
Hare said the decision to urge employees to sign secrecy obligations shortly after the allegations occurred had been made by YMCA’s child services director, Liam Whitley.
He said this should prevent contamination of the evidence, but that had been "overzealous" and poorly implemented.
The YMCA NSW was not a child-safe organization at the time Jonathan Lord was employed there between 2009 and 2011, said Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University, an expert on sexual child abuse, the Commission.
He explained that there were "serious problems" with the recruitment, review, integration, training and supervision of employees.
The hearing was postponed until December 20.
Tony Blair said he would take the opportunity to return as British Prime Minister, but admitted that a comeback was unlikely.
In an interview this evening on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of his resignation, the 59-year-old announced his views on various domestic policy issues.
Since his resignation in June 2007 after a decade as head of state, Blair has largely avoided commenting on British politics, and his comments are mostly limited to foreign policy and his role as envoy of the Middle East Peacekeepers Quartet.
Asked if he would like to return to the prime minister's office, Blair was quoted by the London Evening Standard as saying, "Yes, sure, but it's unlikely that this will happen, so ..."
When the horse show experts arrived in crowds in Cardiff to select the Horse of the Year, they were aware that a fierce competition was imminent.
But no one was prepared for the three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
The Knirps, who isn’t even in kindergarten yet and only made his first steps a few months ago, and his Shetland Pony Toffee gently hit the three laps and took the first prize – leaving behind 30 adult opponents.
The inseparable couple, both equal in size, were praised for their appearance, behavior and style at the annual competition hosted by the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry near Cardiff.
While competing against men and women with elegant melons, he had put on his plate hat at a naughty angle and led the two-year-old Toffee through the ring.
Fenton was praised by the jurors for his natural abilities in dealing with the pony, which lie far beyond his age.
And Toffee received top marks for his performance and personality.
Fenton had received Toffee as a gift for his third birthday last March and has practiced with the Shetland pony every day since.
His mother, Donna, 30, said: “Fenton and Toffee are a great team.”
They had to compete against the entire participant field and left the field with a gold cup and a rosette.
It was only the second time he had competed with Toffee, and we were all thrilled when he won.
Completely strangers in the arena thought him so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him.
The little boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale, South Wales, follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been showing horses for over ten years.
Howells said, “The whole audience was electrified and everyone cheered and applauded him.”
He ran on sand the entire length of the arena and although he looked so tiny, he did fantastic work.
Fenton is crazy about animals – he loves horses, tractors and farms and has two chickens he takes care of.
As he started, it won’t be long before he’s on the “Horse of the Year” look – and I’m sure he’ll do well.
A spokesman for the annual horse show said: “Fenton is only three, but he knows how to deal with his pony.”
Together they are a great team.
The jurors rated Fenton and Toffee after how well they had beaten themselves and presented themselves in the demo ring.
They pay attention to good cooperation between Pony and Leader – and there Fenton and Toffee were the best in the ring.
I’m sure Fenton’s cute clothes contributed their part, which really fit perfectly for the occasion.
Chinese newspaper to be "reformed" after appeal
A Chinese newspaper that had called for the release of a reporter accused of defamation on the front page was to be reformed, a press regulator said.
The Guangzhou-based New Express had issued a rare public call for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
Chen later admitted on television that he had accepted bribes to falsify reports about a state-owned company.
Now, the New Express is undergoing a "comprehensive rectification", the regulator said.
The "Retification Order" was issued by the Guangdong Authority for Press and Publications, Radio, Film and Television.
Preliminary investigations revealed that the New Express, which belongs to the Yangcheng Evening News Group, published several inaccurate reports about the listed company Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013.
“The editorial management of the Neue Express was disorderly,” the regulator said in a statement.
She said it was decided to “impose an administrative penalty for Chen Yongzhou and withdraw his reporter license.”
In addition, the Yangcheng Evening News Group was instructed to undertake a complete rectification of the New Express and recommended that the relevant officials at the New Express be identified and immediately reviewed by the leadership team of the New Express.
Chen had written several articles for the New Express in which he reported on alleged financial irregularities at a construction machinery manufacturer called Zoomlion.
After he was arrested, the newspaper published two calls for his release on the front page and stood behind his journalistic work.
But then Chen appeared on state television and admitted that he had published false reports against payment.
“In this case, I damaged Zoomlion as well as the entire news industry and its ability to win the public’s trust,” he told state news channel CCTV.
I did it primarily because I was looking for money and fame.
I realized that I had acted wrongly.
Following Chen's apology, the Neue Express posted an apology on the front page, stating that it had failed to verify the reports correctly.
Several known suspects have recently made confessions on television.
Experts say confessions are still routinely enforced, despite a law change earlier this year that prohibited authorities from forcing someone to blame themselves.
Discovered drug tunnel with its own railway between the United States and Mexico
One of the most sophisticated tunnels for drug smuggling between the U.S. and Mexico, which was fully equipped with lighting, ventilation and electric rail operations, has now been discovered.
The U.S. authorities described the 120-by-90-centimeter tunnel as one of the most sophisticated passages they had ever found.
The tunnel, which runs in a zigzag pattern over a length of almost six football fields, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, USA.
There are countless inconspicuous warehouses in the area, making it easier to hide drug-laden trucks.
The tunnel was closed before drugs could be transported unrecognized, authorities said.
The discovery of the tunnel secured eight and a half tons of marijuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine, according to the court’s records.
Three men who were allegedly working as drivers were charged with possession and intentional sale of marijuana and cocaine.
In the event of a conviction, they face prison sentences between ten years and life.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers rely on an extensive underground network of drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth major passage that has been discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered after the marijuana harvest in central Mexico in October, challenging the drug cartels on how to quickly bring their product to consumers.
In 2010, authorities found a nearly 640-metre-long railroad passage that ran from a kitchen in a Tijuana apartment building to two warehouses in San Diego.
Orlando Bloom and Miranda Kerr still love each other
Actor Orlando Bloom and model Miranda Kerr want to go their separate ways in the future.
In an interview, however, Bloom said he and Kerr still love each other.
Miranda Kerr and Orlando Bloom are the parents of two-year-old Flynn.
Actor Orlando Bloom has spoken out on the separation from his wife, top model Miranda Kerr.
In an interview with U.S. journalist Katie Couric, which was scheduled to air on Friday (local time), Bloom said, “Life sometimes doesn’t go exactly the way we plan or hope.”
Kerr and he still loved each other, the 36-year-old said.
"We will support and love each other as Flynn's parents."
Kerr and Bloom have been married since 2010, and their son Flynn was born in 2011.
According to Lexika, veganism is subject to vegetarianism, but it differs from this in a very significant way.
For while vegetarians allow themselves to eat cream cakes, ice cream or a strong edamer, these slemishes are not on the menu of a vegan.
Milk, cheese, egg, in addition to the renunciation of meat and fish, the vegan leaves off all consumption of animal products - honey is also denied.
What remains, you might ask, but with a closer look at it, the vegan diet world is characterized by a considerable ingenuity.
"Bread spreads are very popular," explains Ute Henkelmann, the owner of the local reform house, which provides a variety of special products for vegans.
Reuben Proctor also likes to visit the shop in the Domgasse.
The native New Zealander has been a vegan for 13 years, in Lampertheim he finds (almost) everything he needs to live. "In 1997 I changed my diet and became a vegetarian".
At the turn of the century, the next step was taken and I became a vegan.
"But the belief came not only because of the diet, but because of the choice of shoes," says Proctor, who prefers artificial leather to normal leather.
He realized that in other everyday affairs there are no animal products.
First and foremost, being vegan is an ethic.
“I don’t want animals to die for me,” Proctor says the Vegan maxim that extends to the entire consumption pattern.
Instead of grieving for burgers, stirring eggs or rubber bears, the vegan quickly discovered completely new products, the enthusiasm increased.
"It's a double bonus," Proctor says today, "in fact, being vegan does not represent a renunciation, not an asceticism, but it is an enrichment." The assumption that reducing the choice of food options with dietary change, Proctor is more likely to refer to the power of habit.
And it is precisely these conditionings that made some attempts so well-meaning fail.
“The addiction factor is a very crucial factor that causes many to quit quickly, similar to smoking,” Proctor concludes.
And it turns: "Certain tastes are not to be attached to the animal."
Often it is the spices or the type of preparation that make up the taste.
"But you can also create the same effect in other ways," the vegan explains.
For example, Proctor brings aubergines, mushrooms and some vegan sausages to a barbecue.
It pays attention to a balanced, varied diet, in which it should also taste delicious.
Of course, you want to have something between your teeth, which is legitimate.
“It’s supposed to taste, but that’s not just reducing it to animal food,” Proctor said.
Health damage up to eating disorders, another widespread assumption, he did not suffer.
For me, the change was a positive aspect.
I do not take in foreign cholesterol and have an increased vitamin content.
There are high-performance athletes who only eat vegan.
"My blood counts are fine, I often get checked," Proctor says.
In particular, many veganism critics warn of vitamin B12 deficiency.
“Since animals are fed with feed instead of grazing on the pasture, it is questionable whether the vitamin B12 content in the meat you buy in the refrigerator is high,” Proctor said.
For vegans, there is also the possibility to take the coenzyme in the form of tablets.
“My B12 levels are fine,” he explains.
Proctor does not have to go far for food procurement.
After all, basic foods are everywhere and every supermarket now has soy milk and other products.
Everything I need I can find on site.
From time to time I buy something special.
"Many people overlook the fact that only the finished products are expensive, but this is known to be the case with 'ordinary' finished products."
However, the preparation of vegan dishes is much cheaper and less time consuming than is commonly accepted.
"There's a lot to discover in the home kitchen, with a few small sniffs you can achieve good, if not partially better results," says Proctor.
Margarine instead of butter, a little more baking powder and carbonic acid instead of eggs, with his vegan cheesecakes, Proctor was also able to amaze his parents-in-law.
Family celebrations give the vegan a new spice.
This is dynamic, when you cook together, it has a new importance.
“The situations that can arise are as different as the people themselves,” Proctor says.
But, of course, skepticism has already come to him.
You don't like my food anymore?
"Should I feel bad now because I drink milk?" - in such questions you have to act as a vegan with a fingertip feeling.
“I don’t reject people, I’m part of this society,” Proctor said.
And in more detail, the everyday world does not appear to be as vegan stranger as assumed - and the vegan is not as restricted in everyday life as is commonly assumed.
Fast food is also allowed.
There are potatoes everywhere!
"Many donor stores offer falafel, or just a vegetarian yufka," Proctor says.
In a pizzeria, he avoids pasta dishes, or just orders a pizza without cheese, all a matter of custom.
The restaurants are slowly catching up.
"When I started to eat vegan 13 years ago, everything was much more difficult," the New Zealander can find a development: "You have to talk to people, make them aware of it."
"If there are enough demands, they may be inclined to supplement the menu," he hopes.
Vegan restaurants evolve, such as the Kombüse in Mannheim or the Café Vogelfrei.
Proctor wants other restaurants to have at least one vegan dish on the menu.
Basically, there are vegan dishes for everyone.
Anyone can eat them, so they are the exact opposite of exclusive.
"Meat dishes, on the other hand, are exclusive, in the truest sense of the word, because they exclude others," Proctor notes.
“If you want to avoid food scandals, veganism is a safe way to make most of it impossible from the start,” Proctor says.
However, buying vegan products can be a bit tricky at first.
Especially if one learns to understand that even peanuts can contain animal additives as colouring agents, one seems to quickly leave the courage with the observance of ethics in so many obstacles and traps.
This is not the only reason why Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen have written a book: "Veganissimo - Animal Ingredients and Their Alternatives" explains the many ingredients that are buried in food but also in detergents.
"Once in a while you develop a scanner look and know what signs and logos you have to pay attention to "Sometimes it's better to take small steps than to stand or stumble," Proctor knows.
Veganism, it is an important moral fingerprint that strikes the consciousness.
He may not quite be able to let go of his habits, but at least he can teach the consumer to question his habits critically.
The exchange operator Nasdaq OMX keeps its customers in breath.
Trading on the Nasdaq Options Market was interrupted on Friday afternoon German time.
In a statement, the operator blamed technical problems.
The other eleven U.S. options markets, including two of the Nasdaq OMX, continued their business unhindered.
The latest incident continues a whole series of smaller and larger breakdowns at the stock exchange operator.
Only on Tuesday, the Nasdaq indexes had not been calculated for an hour due to errors in data transport.
In August of this year, there were two crashes in just one week.
Initially, U.S. investment bank Goldman Sachs had sent massively flawed purchase orders to the options markets due to technical problems.
After that, the stock exchange operators took almost a whole day to review and delete the orders.
Two days later, half of all U.S. equities traded was halted for several hours due to a computer crash on the Nasdaq stock exchange.
Last year, Facebook’s stock market went up in popularity.
The Nasdaq systems had not grown the flood of buy and sell orders, the SEC later found out and fined the company a record $10 million fine.
Konstanz: Radler kills 63-year-old
The accident was reported by police when a 26-year-old man on Thursday evening, around 10 p.m., was travelling irregularly on a ladies' bike on the left sidewalk from the station square towards the marketplace.
When a 63-year-old man suddenly stepped on the sidewalk from a local, the cyclist could no longer brake in time, according to police.
In the following collision, the pedestrian was pressed against the wall of the house, went to the ground in the further course and a square wound about 15 centimeters long was inflicted on the head.
A rescue team took the injured to the hospital for medical treatment.
British police hand over extradition order to Assange
The British police today handed over an extradition order to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who sought refuge at the Ecuadorian embassy in London and applied for asylum.
Scotland Yard said the 40-year-old Australian had been given a “call to stand up” asking him to appear in a police station, adding that if he did not comply, he would face arrest.
Assange threatens extradition to Sweden on charges of a sexual offence after his options under British law have been exhausted since the Supreme Court rejected his objection to extradition earlier this month.
Fearing that Stockholm would extradite him to the United States, he had sought refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in London on 19 June and asked the South American country for political asylum.
Scotland Yard has "invited a 40-year-old man to stand at a police station at a time we chose," a spokesman said.
He continues to violate the conditions of his release on bail.
The embassy did not comment on the submission of the police request.
Assange fears that he will be extradited from Sweden to the United States and charged there with possible espionage charges after posting over 250,000 diplomatic messages on the WikiLeaks disclosure website.
A driver who was hit with 210 km/h and hot drink between his legs gets <0xC2><0xA3>1,000 penalty
A driver was fined <0xC2><0xA3>1,000 for driving up to 210 km/h and a hot drink between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, from Tiptree, Essex, was stopped on May 27 with his Mercedes Benz on the A120 at Braintree.
After the police stopped him, they discovered the drink cup between his legs.
In Colchester County Court, Howie pleaded guilty without the necessary care and attention.
He received seven points and a six-month driving ban.
Howie was also sentenced to pay costs of <0xC2><0xA3>90 and a surcharge of <0xC2><0xA3>100.
Tax for foreign property owners against London's speculative bubble
The Treasury Department has provisionally revised the CGT measure, but is still awaiting the final decision of Chancellor of the Treasury George Osborne, who in the 2012 budget had imposed a stamp tax of 7% on homes that cost more than two million pounds, as well as annual fees for buyers who own homes as a company and not as individuals.
Already, the income from the stamp tax on residential property in the districts of Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea, which amounted to <0xC2><0xA3>708 million in the 2012/13 tax year, exceeds the revenues for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the northeast, northwest, Yorkshire and the Humber region combined.
Cook said: “After the increases in stamp duty on high-priced homes and the introduction of the associated legislation against circumvention, it can hardly be argued that high-quality properties are taxed too low, regardless of the impact of the outdated municipal tax system.”
“But this move could make some foreign investors more cautious when it comes to buying real estate in London, or stop owners from selling it,” he added.
Top-class real estate – the top five to ten percent of the housing market by price – in London’s wealthy South West Belt stretching from Fulham to Wimbledon rose by a record 11.8% last year.
Central London's prices grew steadily at 5.6 per cent annually, but were overshadowed by an emerging "domestic market" in which the southwestern part of the city, the north (7.4 per cent) and the east (6.5 per cent) experienced an upward trend, according to a Savills study.
Scientists were able to shed more light on the relationship between a dog’s tail waving and his mood.
Previous research had shown that happy dogs with the tail barked more to the right (from the dog’s point of view) while nervous dogs had the left side.
But now scientists say that other dogs can perceive these subtle differences and react to them.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trento, said: “In humans, it is well known that the left and right hemispheres of the brain respond differently to stimuli that evoke positive or negative emotions.”
Here we have tried to look at this in other species.
He also noted that in dogs, just like in humans, the right half of the brain is responsible for the movement of the left side and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres played different roles in the feelings.
To learn more about how dogs react to the side-tails of their peers, the researchers monitored the animals while watching these films of other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of the four-leggeds and analyzed the behavior.
We will probably soon understand why the tail moves in one direction, in the other.
Professor Vallortigara said: “We showed the dogs films with dogs – either a true-to-life version or a silhouette to eliminate distracting other aspects, and we were able to control the movement of the tail more to the left or right.”
When the animals saw how an otherwise expressionless dog moved its tail to the right (seen from the perspective of the barking dog), they remained completely relaxed.
However, if the tail tilt was mainly to the left (again from the perspective of the dog that races), their heart rate rose and they looked restless.
According to Professor Vallortigara, the dogs do not intentionally communicate with each other through these movements.
Rather, he is convinced that the dogs would have learned from experience what movements to worry about and when not.
He said, “If you have different encounters with other dogs and waving your tail in one direction is more of a friendly behavior and the right side is more of a less friendly behavior, then you react based on these experiences.”
The researchers say the findings could help dog owners, veterinarians and trainers to better understand their pet’s emotions.
John Bradshaw, an expert on dog behavior and a guest fellow at the University of Bristol’s Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, said this was not the first study to investigate whether left and right were important for dogs.
Last year, a team at the University of Lincoln found that dogs turn their heads to the left when looking at an aggressive dog, and to the right when looking at a satisfied dog.
Another research paper at the University of Victoria in Canada stated: “Dogs are more likely to approach a robotic dog when his ‘tail’ races to the left rather than the right, rather than becoming restless – just the opposite of the Italian study.”
According to him, the differences could be that the dogs in the various studies did not interpret the animals in the films or the robot dogs as dogs.
A study of how dogs react to real dogs could help, he explained.
“While there is considerable evidence for many different mammals that the two brain halves are used for different purposes, many of the details still need to be determined – and dogs are no exception,” Bradshaw said.
However, since their behavior can be easily recorded, it will probably not be long before we understand why the tail sometimes moves in one direction, sometimes in the other.
Arctic Monkeys postpone performance in Glasgow due to Alex Turner’s illness
The rock band Arctic Monkeys has postponed a performance in Glasgow after its lead singer became ill with pharyngitis.
The band from Sheffield is scheduled to play in Hydro on Friday.

Pope Francis appoints first cardinals in February
Pope Francis will appoint new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time on February 22, as the Vatican announced on Thursday.
Cardinals are the highest clergy in the Catholic Church after the Pope and they are also the ones who elect a pope, so that Francis will appoint the first group of men who will ultimately participate in the election of his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, a cardinal who has reached the age of 80 can no longer participate in the papal election – this applies to a group of 120 “elected cardinals”.
In a statement announcing the news, Father Federico Lombardi, a spokesman for the Vatican, said a meeting of all the cardinals would take place before the ceremony for the appointment of the new cardinals, also known as the Consistory.
“Pope Francis has decided to announce his decision to convene the Consistory in February in advance so that other meetings that require the participation of cardinals from all over the world can be planned,” Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said the number of eligible cardinals is likely to drop by February.
He explained that a pope would normally appoint as many cardinals as necessary so that the number of eligible cardinals would again be 120, and as many cardinals over 80 as he would like.
The Consistory next year is important because it is the first since Francis was elected in March this year, Valero said.
At present, there is a certain overhang on the part of Europe and in particular Italy.
“It will be interesting to see if the new pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance,” he said.
Forty percent of Catholics live in South America, but they have only a small number of cardinals.
The cardinals will also be the first to be appointed since the formation of the Council of Cardinals, founded by Francis, a group of eight cardinals from all over the world who are tasked with finding ways to reform the Church.
In the past, the Pope decided everything alone.
“Now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him,” Valero said.
He said it was "well possible" for Francis to ask the cardinals for advice.
But so far we have not been in this situation – this is all completely new.
Valero said that typically the bishops from large places would be called cardinals, but Francis is "full of surprises - so we don't know who he appoints".
GM recalls new pickup trucks in the U.S. to repair the seat backrest
General Motors is recalling nearly 19,000 of its brand-new 2014 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup trucks to fix a problem with the manually adjustable seat backrest, the U.S. vehicle safety regulator said in a statement Friday.
In some of the cars, there may be a defect in the mechanism for resetting the front seat backrest.
For this reason, they do not comply with the Federal directives for vehicle safety on head restraints.
“If driven from the rear of the vehicle, it is possible that the head restraint does not protect the occupants properly, so there is an increased risk of injury,” the NHTSA said in a statement.
The recalled models were produced between August 1 and September 10.
The delivery of the GM trucks began in June and represents the most important model launch of the leading U.S. car manufacturer since the insolvency restructuring in 2009.
GM informed the vehicle owners about the defect in the first half of October.
The NHTSA was unable to review the notification letter due to the 16-day government shutdown, which negatively impacted car sales in October.
Sales of the Silverado and Sierra trucks, which were redesigned for the 2014 model year, increased by 20 percent in the first ten months of the year, GM said on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado and 16,503 Sierra pickup trucks.
The GM stock rose 1.4 percent on the New York Stock Exchange to $37.47 on Friday afternoon.
The Desperation of an Obama Voter
I have elected President Obama twice in the hope that change is possible.
He says Obama has made commendable efforts that have been thwarted by Republican blockade tactics.
The blockade policy does not excuse Obamacare’s website problems, the drone attacks
Obama’s memoirs of the 2008 election campaign are a sad reminder of what would have been possible
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second year student at Harvard Medical School.
I am currently reading a terribly sad book.
It’s a book that I thought would cheer me up during the bleak second year of my medical school and give me hope again.
It is called "The Audacity to Win" and describes Barack Obama's memoirs of the 2008 presidential election.
When I finish my patient records in the evening and go to bed, the book takes me back to a time when politics inspired millions and a speech could take my breath away.
The election was a landslide victory and news speakers stopped to highlight the historical significance of this hour.
My classmates wept for joy and my parents gathered all the newspapers they could find.
A young team of visionaries was on their way to the White House and the nation was ready for change.
When Obama took office in 2008, he had an approval rating of 82%.
And then I close the book.
Switching back to the present is an evil awakening, as if you are being pulled out of a dream.
It’s hard to remember these optimistic times – they seem to be a vague reminder, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
In the years since I gave my vote for the first time, something has actually changed.
But it's just nothing I could have imagined.
I acknowledge the great and varied things Obama has accomplished, from the passage of the Affordable Care Act for Health Insurance to the military withdrawal from Iraq, the end of the forced concealment of homosexuality in the army and the killing of Osama bin Laden.
I, too, believe that the party-political blockade tactics have tipped too many aspirations to advance our nation: immigration reform, a public option for health insurance and the closure of Guantanamo Bay, to name just a few.
But after defending the Obama administration against colleagues and acquaintances countless times, I have come to the end with my attempts to explain.
I have reached a point of political despair.
The Republican blockade policy cannot explain why it is permissible to intercept foreign heads of state or to kill innocent children by drones overseas.
It cannot explain why the National Security Agency collects data about the privacy of Americans and why whistleblowers who reveal state misconduct are being punished.
It cannot explain why Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, was murdered without trial, nor why public funding and spending limits are being circumvented during the presidential election.
It does not justify the results of a report that says the White House’s efforts to calm the media are the “most aggressive ... since the Nixon administration.”
And most recently, it can’t excuse the inability to design a simple website in the more than three years since the passage of the Affordable Care Act.
I don't know if that's what I should have expected.
Whether I should have understood at the age of 18 that the work of government could contradict the political campaigns that preceded it.
Obviously, the MP office is not a predictable course, as an opposition party and random events such as the Newtown massacre shape the public discussion.
But when I look at the examples mentioned above, they seem to have largely been elected by the government itself.
And that's what bothers me the most.
I elected Obama again in 2012, not because I was thrilled with his candidacy.
Mitt Romney was a confusing and unbiased alternative, he seemed unable to determine his direction and positions.
I had the impression that a second term for Obama, free from the pressure of future elections, would fulfill the hope we had heard of for so long.
But with Obama’s approval ratings dropping below 45% this week, the book’s return to 2008 has become all the more difficult.
It awakens in me the longing for the many promises that have dissolved in the air.
This week I read a section in the book that describes how Obama had to put a heavy loss against Clinton in the Pennsylvania presidential election.
In a meeting with the voters after the decision, he told his employees that they would have to come back to course and follow the purpose of their cause.
“I want us to find our magic,” he said.
We need to remember who we are.
It's five years later, Mr. President, and I couldn't agree more strongly with you.
The views expressed in this commentary are exclusively those of Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer claims Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest during parental leave
Billionaire and lawmaker Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott was in a conflict of interest with his plans for parental leave because his daughters could become pregnant and therefore benefit from it.
The mining magnate, who is in a legal dispute over the payment of $6 million in CO2 taxes, made the claim when he wanted to wipe questions off the table about whether he was in a conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which are important for deciding whether to abolish or reduce carbon and mining taxes.
But Palmer claimed that only ministers could have conflicts of interest and Abbott’s daughters would personally benefit from the laws.
“He’s in a big conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave, because if one of his daughters gets pregnant, he has a direct interest in whether or not she gets vacation,” Palmer said.
Two months after the election, the Palmer Electoral Commission officially declared the winner of the Fairfax Sunshine Coast seat by 53 votes.
Palmer called for a revision of the vote counting process so that it would move faster.
Tony Abbott's daughters Frances and Bridget.
Should these elections be decided two months after the end of the voting?
“We need a better system,” he said.
Why shouldn't we have a system where you walk in, type data into a computer, pick it up right away, and then get the result at 6:30 p.m.?
Palmer also criticized the use of pencils when marking ballot papers.
Do you use them because you can erase the results if you don’t like them?
Nowadays to vote with pencils is unbelievable.
The Election Commission has examined the options for an electronic election and recently published a joint bill with New Zealand.
Palmer, 59, said his policy included an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he would take his new office “very seriously”.
A public office is a service to the public.
“We aspire to no reward other than that of history, namely that we can serve in a critical time of this community,” he said.
RBS suspends two foreign exchange traders
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its foreign exchange department, so two people familiar with the situation; this is another indication that the global government investigation into the alleged manipulations in the foreign exchange market is rapidly taking off.
Some of the world’s largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, confirmed that they are cooperating with authorities in the investigations into the world’s largest financial market, on which $5.3 trillion per day change owners.
The two dealers would be the first RBS employees to be suspended in the expanding investigation that the scandal surrounding the Libor interbank business entails.
The bank, which did not comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month that it had received information requests from authorities.
“Our investigations on this issue are continuing and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and other regulators,” the bank said in a statement.
Last month, people close to the situation reported that RBS forwarded the records of emails and instant messages sent from and to a previous merchant to the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority.
This trader, Richard Usher, had left RBS in 2010 and is said to have been vacated from his current position as European head of forex spot trading at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, head of European spot trading at Citi, was on leave this week and Matt Gardiner, former chief currency trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended at Standard Chartered this week.
None of these dealers were accused of any misconduct.
Bankers at Barclays and Citigroup were part of Usher’s Instant Message group, people close to the situation said.
UBS announced this week that it had taken steps against some of its employees after the Swiss regulator Finma said it was investigating an alleged manipulation of the foreign exchange market at a number of Swiss banks.
At least six authorities worldwide – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss Competition Authority Weko, the FCA, the U.S. Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are currently examining allegations that bankers have agreed on transactions on the currency market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also initiated internal investigations or received information requests from authorities, people familiar with the situation said.
Banks comb through instant messages and emails from several years looking for instances of misconduct.
The news of these investigations has thrown traders into turmoil in an area that has been one of the most profitable trading units of investment banks in recent years, but this year was under pressure because low volatility in currencies limits the chances for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to downplay the deal, saying it is almost impossible to manipulate the expanded and highly liquid forex market, but leading traders believe this is not necessarily true.
One leading trader noted that despite the enormous daily volume of forex trading, the fragmentation of liquidity between the different trading platforms and the increasing use of their own internal platforms by banks means that “even with very low ticket prices, one can influence the market”.
The news came out on the same day that Credit Suisse announced it had terminated a trader of its London Exchange Traded Funds office this week after causing a loss of nearly $6 million at the end of last year.
The bank promptly informed the competent authorities and cooperates with them.
“We are sure that the dealer has acted alone and that the matter is contained,” Credit Suisse said.
Painted the building fence on the Bechtle grounds
A group of citizens' initiative "Swiss Wiese" has embellished the building fence on the Bechtle property on the spa promenade in Bad Herrenalb.
In addition, it cleaned and widened the footpath, according to a press release.
The planned cover of the decaying house in the back of the property had not been allowed for security reasons, as the site is in danger of slipping off.
Alfred Abel, who currently manages the property, had agreed with his colleague Reinhard Domke to cancel the embellishment action from the BI.
Before the action of the BI, a banner with the message "We are for it" had been attached.
However, this did not disturb the approximately 20 members of the Citizens’ Initiative in their action.
Their motto on the big poster was "We are against building ruins".
In doing so, she wanted to point out the danger of even larger ruins on the Swiss meadow - should the giant project one day fail.
In conversation with many passers-by in front of the "construction site", it became clear that some citizens believe that the realization of the project of the city will be better for many, although not a few have the same questions about the dimension of the project presented as the BI.
But they are beginning to resign because the city is further delaying these responses, the BI said.
As you can hear, the mayor’s public statements also have an impact.
May had said in the town council meeting that he feared the out for the thermal bath should the population vote against the plans for a bathing and wellness complex on the Swiss meadow in the citizens’ decision.
Some seem frightened by this, others feel it as a "plump blackmail attempt" on the population, according to the press release of the BI.
The BI thanked the donors for the color and all the helpers.
Rangnick skeletons for Schiris: Mane no swan king
As satisfied as Ralf Rangnick is with the current high form of Bundesliga leader Red Bull Salzburg, so disappointed was the sports director of the "Bullen" from the referees.
"There is currently a dangerous tendency for Mane and Alan to be pushed into the category of pigeon kings," he defended the two offensive whirlwinds at a press conference in Salzburg on Thursday.
The latest occasion for Rangnick's criticism was Yellow for Mane at 3:0 against Grödig last Sunday, when the Senegalese was destined to be an alleged actor - which, of course, was not, as the TV pictures showed.
"A blatant misdecision," said Rangnick, who described referee Harkam as "totally overwhelmed."
Harkam also contributed "his part" to the escalation between Salzburg coach Roger Schmidt and Grödig coach Adi Hütter after the match.
He defended his German compatriot decisively: "I would have behaved the same in every single situation as Roger Schmidt".
Schmidt himself does not want to have any contact with his colleague after the Scharmützel with Hütter.
I don't know why.
"Because I'm the one who was insulted," the 46-year-old said.
However, in view of the success, Rangnick voted for a hymn of praise.
"There are only two words for that: really good," he said.
There's not much to say.
Above all, the way the team plays is impressive.
Let's keep it that way.
There will be hardly any frame changes in the winter transfer period.
There are no great reasons to change anything.
"Except for a player who wants to leave the club," Rangnick said.
Supreme Court Confirms Obama's Health Act
It’s a big victory for the Obama administration: The U.S. Supreme Court today ruled that the health law closely tied to Barack Obama is constitutional.
With five to four votes, the judges ruled that the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act – forcing U.S. citizens to take out health insurance or pay a penalty by 2014 – is constitutional under the state’s tax authority.
Supreme Judge John Roberts sided with the four more liberal members of the House, while Judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito, and Kennedy decided against it.
The court also confirmed the remaining sections of the 2,700-page law, and also held that the provision of the Health Act that states either extend the access requirements for Medicaid or otherwise remove all state Medicaid grants would be unconstitutional or unconstitutional.
The lawsuit was filed by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
The bill had been vehemently rejected by all leading Republican presidential candidates, including final challenger Mitt Romney, in the 2012 election campaign.
Norway: Norwegian town lights up with giant mirrors
With huge mirrors, the inhabitants of a Norwegian village have brought light into their dark valley.
Due to the low degree of sunshine, the Rjukan, located in the Vestfjord valley, usually sinks from autumn to spring in the shade of the surrounding mountains.
With three gigantic reflectors at a height of 45 meters, a century-long dream came true on Wednesday.
"Finally!" said Mayor Steinar Bergsland at the launch ceremony on TV2.
Some valley dwellers set up sun chairs, others put on sunglasses for safety reasons.
Until now, sun-hungry people had to ride a cable car to a nearby summit in the winter.
Ten years ago, local artist Martin Andersen presented the proposal to direct the rays with mirrors into the valley.
However, this basic idea has existed in the town since 1913.
After several years of debate, the city council finally approved the project, which cost 5 million crowns (around 615,000 euros).
A similar construction has been providing winter sunshine to the Italian Alpine resort of Viganella for several years.
Post hardly learns on Sundays
"Many citizens will not have noticed yet, the red dots for the Sunday emptiness are still on various mailboxes of the core city and the districts, but if you read the small print on the yellow containers of Post AG, you quickly find that the emptiness does not take place on Sundays and holidays," the FDP says.
A request from the FDP confirmed this.
On Sundays and public holidays, only in front of the post office in Ernst-Ludwig-Straße 36 and in Jakob-Müller-Straße 1 in Hüttenfeld are empty.
Whether in Hofheim and Rosengarten it will still be emptied on Sunday will not be answered in the answer to the FDP's request.
FDP social and youth policy spokesman Fritz Röhrenbeck wants to check this out.
The Sunday emptiness is an important postal service, especially at appointment post.
"This dilutes this undertaking radically and unreasonably despite the price increase for letters in January 2013".
Thomas Bittner, chairman of the Liberals' group and city council, supports his group colleagues: "What annoys me is the fact that here secretly the emptying times are changed or even deleted."
The post office is a mile away from the citizens.
"At least the mailboxes in the Neuschloß and Rosengarten districts have to be emptied again on Sundays," said Bittner and Röhrenbeck unisono.
Also valid for the core city, especially non-mobile fellow citizens would also have to be able to reach a mailbox with Sunday emptying on foot.
Röhrenbeck asked the city council if the city administration was planning talks with the post office about the matter.
Mayor Erich Maier replied that the post had not communicated with Lampertheim.
However, there is also a Sunday emptiness in Hofheim.
Your party has been in favour of privatization.
"Then decisions will be made elsewhere," Maier said.
Frankfurt parking fees are expected to rise sharply
Parking in Frankfurt could soon become more delicately expensive.
The city’s magistrate will be advising on a proposal by transport dezernent Stefan Majer (Greens) this morning.
Accordingly, the parking fees should be increased by 50 percent.
However, this is not to increase the prices, but to reduce the time interval of parking clocks and ticket machines from 30 to 20 minutes.
In December, the City Council will have to decide.
The Retail Committee of the IHK Frankfurt considers this "not a good idea".
The possibility of parking directly in front of the shop is "a not to be underestimated advantage for smaller retailers".
The transport club Germany believes that an increase after two decades is "quite appropriate and, in fact, long overdue".
Public transport will also be more expensive.
Freudenstadt: Fast Actions Surprise Hosts
With a narrow squad, the men of TSV Freudenstadt had to compete against the TG Gönningen of the Swabian Alb in the Schiller-Schulturhalle in Reutlingen.
The Elblers were on the other side of the net with an experienced team.
But soon it turned out that they, even due to age, could not keep up with the rapid actions of the joy cities.
With the hard and placed blows, the gönningers made themselves extremely difficult.
They repeatedly missed the passes and attacks played by Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz cleanly through the network center and were not present at the block defense.
Two high first sentence gains clearly expressed the superiority of the joy cities in all respects.
In view of this overwhelming and game-defining performance, the third set was then won somewhat lazy and lustless to the 3:0 finish (25:13, 25:14, 25:22).
On November 2nd, with TV Baiersbronn, which was able to make its mark in Nagold, a much more powerful opponent will be on the field.
TSV Freudenstadt I: Dominik Bauernle, Yannik Büchle, Sebastian Dölker, Felix Pälchen, Stefan Räller, Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz.
In the B-Class, the second teams from Baiersbronn and Freudenstadt faced each other in the Murgtalhalle in Baiersbronn.
They delivered a hard-fought two-hour match.
Nervousness on both sides caused mistakes and point gifts in the ball acceptance; even in the passes the precision was sometimes deficient and in some critical game scenes the overzealous prevented the look for possible points gains.
However, in this highly balanced match, Marcus Blasutto’s TSV team was consistently matched by the great physical effort and a delightful commitment of both teams.
Care day at the small English hut
On the fifth nursing day following the Natura 2000 project in the Upper Hotzenwald, a group of dedicated participants met at the small English hut in Ibach.
Due to suggestions from the population, the view into the valley in the area of the hut should be cut off on this day, said Mayor Helmut Kaiser.
Many hikers, according to Kaiser, referred to this area as the splendor of the gorge path, where the landscape offers the ideal setting for magnificent views.
He thanked the attendees for their willingness to cooperate and stressed that the day of care was an appropriate instrument to strengthen the connection between man and nature.
It offers every citizen the opportunity to put accents in nature itself.
At the same time as the tourist aspect, ecological consideration can also be found.
This ecological aspect was explained by Friederike Tribukait from the Department of Nature Conservation of the Government Presidency of Freiburg following the welcome by Landrat Tilman Bollacher, who had assumed the patronage and wished the action a good success.
According to Tribukait, the tourist destination of the far-sightedness covers itself with the aim of preserving the now heavily expanded old pasture field with its specific protected habitat types through opening and connection to the still existing pastures.
Certain species such as rare butterflies and grasshoppers cannot overcome barriers in the form of forest surfaces.
You need these free compounds for conservation.
Tribukait said she did not want to miss breaking a lance for the planned biosphere area at this point.
The current measure is not only seamlessly integrated into this planning.
A biosphere area also offers the opportunity for sustainable economic and ecological development based on the internationally recognized Unesco status and thus a continuous complement to what has been achieved with the Life project and the previous care days for the future.
After these various presentations, district manager Christoph Wehle and Life project manager Cornelia Bischoff divided the helpers into groups.
The larger trees had already been knocked out in advance, the forestry tractor is available if necessary.
A group of helpers should take care of the release of vinegar bushes and the maintenance of a dry stone bar.
The goal was to have a free view of the viewpoint.
Löffingen: Köpfler still the only candidate
Information on the Internet: Although Baarstädtchen Löffingen can be called an attractive city with its 7514 inhabitants, an intact infrastructure, a forward-looking school, children, youth and seniors policy, as well as its own municipal works, no second mayor candidate has yet applied.
The only candidate for the succession of Mayor Norbert Brugger, who is no longer a candidate for age reasons, is the 46-year-old bank merchant and businessman Dieter Köpfler from Löffingen.
The application deadline will end on Monday, November 11th, at 6 p.m.
Google, Samsung, Huawei sued over Nortel patents
The group, which holds thousands of previous Nortel patents, on Thursday filed an avalanche of patent infringement lawsuits against mobile phone manufacturers, including Google, the company it overbidden in the insolvency auction of Nortel.
Rockstar, the consortium that bought Nortel patents for $4.5 billion, sued Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies for patent infringement in the U.S. District Court in Texas.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, BlackBerry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google has been charged with seven patent infringements.
The patents concern technology that matches search terms on the Internet with relevant advertising, according to the lawsuit, which hits the core of Google’s search engine business.
Representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not immediately reachable.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC are making phones that work with Google’s Android operating system, which is in fierce competition with Apple and Microsoft’s mobile products.
In 2011, Google made an initial bid of over $900 million for Nortel patents.
Google has increased its offer several times, most recently offering $4.4 billion.
After being outsourced to Rockstar’s Nortel patents, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, a business that was also partly motivated by Motorola’s patent library.
“Although Google has failed to acquire the patents at the auction, Google has infringed the patents and continues to do so,” the letter said.
Rockstar is demanding high damages from Google as it claims Google’s patent infringement was intentional, the accusation said.
Egypt vows first freely elected president
Mohammed Mursi is taking the oath of office, but his day of triumph should not mean the end of political disputes in Egypt.
Islamist Mohammed Mursi promised a “new Egypt” when he was sworn in as the country’s first freely elected president, succeeding Husni Mubarak, who had been expelled from office 16 months earlier.
With his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Mursi also became the first freely elected Islamist president of the Arab world and Egypt’s fifth head of state since the overthrow of the monarchy about 60 years ago.
He took the oath before the 18 judges of the court, dressed in black robes, which has its seat on the Nile and is modeled on an ancient Egyptian temple.
"We are striving for a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic," Mursi said at the ceremony, which was broadcast live on state television.
“Today, the Egyptian people have laid the foundation for a new life – absolute freedom, real democracy and stability,” said 60-year-old Morsi, an engineer trained in the United States and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that has been mostly considered a banned organization by the respective government since its founding 84 years ago.
Hundreds of soldiers and police were guarding the building when Mursi arrived shortly after eleven o'clock local time in a small car convoy.
Only a few hundred supporters had gathered before the court to applaud the new president, and unlike the presidential hype of the Mubarak era, traffic was only temporarily stopped so that the car convoy could cross the usually busy road that connects the city center with the southern suburbs.
As an uncharismatic “replacement wheel” of the Brotherhood, his personal prestige has increased since his victory and a Friday speech in which he presented himself not only as a candidate of the Islamists, but all those who wanted to bring the 2011 uprising’s aspirations against the authoritarian Mubarak to an end.
“Egypt today is a civil, national, constitutional and modern state,” Morsi, dressed in a blue suit with a red tie, told the judges in the wooden-painted chamber in which he took the oath of office.
Later, Mursi went to the University of Cairo, where he was to give his inaugural address.
He was officially greeted by an army chapel that played the national anthem, which he listened to in a position of wealth.
Military leader Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi was present.
Upon his arrival, he was greeted by hundreds of attendees in the largest auditorium of the university with choirs of "The army and the people are one hand".
Established in 1908 as a bastion of secular education, the University of Cairo developed into a stronghold of Islamist student groups in the 1970s.
Mursi took a symbolic oath on Friday in Tahir Square, the birthplace of the uprising that led to the end of Mubarak’s authoritarian rule last year, and vowed to reclaim presidential powers that the military council had assumed from the head of state who had been expelled from office.
But by taking the official oath before the court and not as usual before Parliament, he bows to the will of the military, indicating that the power struggle will continue.
Mursi’s speech in Tahir Square was full of dramatic populist gestures.
Falkenberger Discothek provides two great evenings
The new season in the Falkenberg discotheque "Blue Velvet" has begun.
On Friday night it is called "Pump this party", on Saturday night it continues with a Ü 25 party.
Fat beats and cool sounds are of course promised by the organizers on both days.
Worker crashed from ladder: seriously injured
On Thursday, when a defective external sensor was replaced, a 51-year-old worker in Eggelsberg crashed from a ladder and seriously injured himself.
The man from Lamprechtshausen wanted to replace a defective heating sensor on the outside facade of a inn.
As he climbed the ladder, which lay on the roof, it slipped away and the man fell on the concrete floor.
He suffered serious injuries and was taken to the Salzburg State Hospital with the rescue helicopter "Christophorus 6".
Rape in South Africa: Twice life imprisonment
Nine months after the brutal rape and mutilation of a 17-year-old girl in South Africa, the perpetrator was sentenced to life imprisonment on Friday.
This was reported by SABC.
The victim later died from the consequences of the serious injuries.
John Kana had already been found guilty of the crime at the beginning of the week.
The act had sparked nationwide horror.
The then 21-year-old had raped Anene Booysen in February in an industrial site in Bredasdorp near Cape Town.
For 14 hours, the doctors fought for the survival of the victim, but in vain.
The sight of the youth was so horrifying that the nurses and nurses needed psychological assistance.
Kana had admitted during the trial to having been in a bar on the night of the deed with the Boys.
He also confessed to beating and raping her, but denied responsibility for the girl's death.
The police had initially assumed several perpetrators, but released two suspects from detention because the evidence against them was insufficient.
The prosecution also stressed during the trial that it was convinced that Kana was alone at the time of the attack.
Rape is already a daily occurrence in South Africa: there are about 64,000 complaints of sexual violence every year.
That is almost ten times as much as in Germany, which with 82 million people has significantly more inhabitants than South Africa (50 million).
Police and women’s associations in South Africa estimate the dark numbers for sexual violence to be 10- to 25-fold.
Jumbo visits the Black Forest ham
Jumbo in search of the "best ham in the world": For the TV show "Galileo", the Pro7 star visited Bonndorf.
The speaker makes it clear at the beginning: the most important thing for the ham is the pork chops, the turbomast is not a good prerequisite.
Can ham, which you get in any supermarket, be a quality product?
As head of the large ham factory in the Black Forest, Uli explains Jumbo how the company "Adler" works in Bonndorf.
"Germany's favorite ham", as Jumbo announces the Black Forest ham.
Only with hair protection and a robe will he enter the factory.
Jumbo also needs to disinfect his hands before he can use the microphone.
Jumbo to be strengthened at fast food in Waldshut
"Here I work in huge quantities," the TV makers, Black Forest ham as a mass product amaze.
16,000 colonies a week speak for themselves.
Weight, fat content, colour: Uli explains what quality matters.
Most pigs are slaughtered at the age of six months.
Television with a level?
Details such as the pH of the meat also play a role.
The darker the meat, the higher the pH.
"I'm looking forward to seeing Roberto Blanco measure what happens next," Jumbo said.
Here the level of private television in pure culture is presented.
But watching is still worth it.
The spectator sees that the decomposition of the colons continues to be handmade.
Because: Black Forest ham is traditionally found without bone in the shelf.
The secret of the ham is the spice mix with the salt.
Smoke tower and smoke fire visually resemble a "submarine".
The trick: here in the smoke, fir branches provide the special taste of the black forest ham.
20 days in the smoke finally make the ham almost black.
"Now the disk is disappearing in the jumbo," he announces the test power supply.
"It's really delicious," said the TV star.
This will allow all the participants to live.
Did you think travel agencies belong to the past thanks to the Internet?
Flight Centre seems to be resisting the trend.
The company has increased its profit outlook for the full year and expects record revenues from vacationers in Australia and the UK.
The travel company now expects an adjusted year-on-year profit before taxes of between $325 million and $340 million, compared to $305 million to $315 million in its previous forecast.
If the current target values are reached, that means growth of 12 to 17 percent compared to the record gain of $290.4 million in 2011/12.
As CEO Graham Turner announced, Flight Centre achieved 8% profit in the first half of the year and recorded a strong start in the second half, especially in the Australian and UK private business.
“Since the beginning of the year, our ten countries have been profitable and some of them are well on track towards record yearly revenues before interest and taxes,” he said.
These include Australia and the UK, which are typically among our strongest earners.
In Australia, the leisure industry recovered in the second half of the year, offsetting a slightly weaker market for business travel.
Similarly, Flight Centre’s leisure business in the UK was doing well, while business customers spent less here as well.
The U.S. business recovered from the seasonally weaker first half of the year, so that for the third year in a row, a profit is expected for the full year.
Flight Centre’s shares rose 3 cents to $38.20 yesterday.
Schools are being stopped to focus more on mathematics, spelling and grammar
In English literature courses, students will have to deal with at least a piece of Shakespeare, a 19th-century novel, romantic poetry, and contemporary British novels from 1914 onwards.
The exam also includes "unseen texts" to encourage broader reading.
The combined course of English literature and language will be abolished.
Starting in 2015, students will be required to take an independent GCSE language exam, with strong incentives to choose English literature as a separate qualification.
The Ministry of Education will publish tomorrow the new curriculums for English and Mathematics – the first subjects to be radically redesigned.
Other core subjects will be changed next year.
In a separate initiative, Ofqual, the Audit Authority, will announce a reorganization of the GCSE structures, including a new rating system and less coursework.
In a speech last summer, Education Minister Michael Gove said that there is “a broad consensus that we need to reform our examination system in order to restore public confidence,” emphasizing that the GCSES would “become more challenging, ambitious and rigorous.”
Studies show that English schools spend less time on mathematics – 116 hours per year or three hours per week per school year – than in most other countries.
On the other hand, Australian schools teach an average of 143 hours a year and students in Singapore receive 138 hours.
While there will be no formal requirement to provide more time for mathematics in the schedule, coalition circles say that the comprehensive math test – combined with a stronger emphasis on the subject in rankings – will likely encourage schools to start more hours.
The curriculum focuses more on "problems from real life", including financial mathematics.
Beautiful animals and tasty cakes lure
The most beautiful rabbits of different breeds and colours will be presented at the Kreisverbandsleistungsschau this weekend in the Bürgerhaus.
The evaluations were already made on Thursday
Once again, the local association W514 is hosting this large exhibition.
Breeders of the clubs in the district of Soest show their best animals as well as young Wickeder hobbyists show their rabbits.
On Thursday, six judges conducted the assessment of the numerous rabbits and were able to distinguish outstanding animals.
Visitors to the show are well informed, as the assessment of all animals is attached to the cages.
The official opening of the exhibition will be held by Mayor Hermann Arndt on Saturday at 2.30 p.m.
The rabbit show is open to all visitors on Saturdays from 10 a.m. and on Sundays from 10 a.m. to 3.30 p.m., followed by the victory ceremony.
Guests are also invited to a fun-filled tombola and a tasty cafeteria.

Salem: Johanna Rahner at the Ecumenical Conversation Forum
The next Ecumenical Conversation Forum on Monday, October 21, at the Neues Museum of the Castle will focus on the theme "To Hell with Hell - Theological Considerations on Today's Handling of the Last Things".
The speaker is Professor Johanna Rahner.
The Ecumenical Dialogue Forum is an initiative of the Catholic and Evangelical Churches of Salem, of the Castle of Salem and of the Cultural Office of Bodenseekreis.
Johanna Rahner wants to explore in the forum the question of how people today classify the "last things" after death.
Had men in the past centuries known too much about it, and in doing so had placed their trust in those images of heaven and hell, "which shape our conceptions to this day," then the contemporary prophetic doctrine of the hopes of fulfillment is rather characterized by some embarrassment or even speechlessness.
"Christians and Christians have been duly driven out of hope by religious criticism," she said.
She has "proved us with so many question marks that we seem to have lost the exclamation marks".
Johanna Rahner continues: “But the decisive challenge remains the annoyance of death.”
This is associated with the question of that longing, "which dreams that in the end everything will be good".
Johanna Rahner, born 1962 in Baden-Baden, studied Catholic Theology and Biology from 1982 to 1989 at the Albert-Ludwigs-Universität Freiburg.
She received her doctorate in 1997 at Dr. theol., also in Freiburg.
The Habilitation for Fundamental Theology and Ecumenical Theology followed in 2003 at the Westphalian Wilhelms University.
Since 2010, Johanna Rahner has held a Chair of Systematic Theology at the Institute of Catholic Theology at the University of Kassel.
Geislingen: More than 100 young Catholics from Kleine Heuberg reaffirm their faith
In two services, 101 15- and 16-year-old youths of the pastoral unit Am Kleinen Heuberg have been established.
The service was accompanied by the group Laudato-Si in the morning, and by the youth choir The Spirit in the afternoon.
With the reception of the firm sacrament, the young people said yes to their baptism and asked for the power of the Holy Spirit.
In recent months, under the leadership of Deacon Reiner Dehner and with the help of numerous community members, the firmlings had prepared themselves for the great feast day.
In various projects, they learned about various tasks of Christian community life and experienced the Youth Day together in Untermachtal.
Illmensee: Second mountain bike race excites participants
In the beautiful weather, 214 cyclists came to Illmensee to take the round trip through the hills around the lake.
This is what Ulrich Knobel of the Illmensee Sportverein announces.
Among the participants, especially on the short distance over 15 kilometers and 300 meters of altitude, were also numerous cyclists who wanted to practice their hobby once in a competitive atmosphere.
Two junior drivers of the German top class were also at the start of this competition: Felix Bader from Bad Waldsee and Pascal Treubel from Aach-Linz came with the recommendation of good placements at the German Championships.
Both of them were able to leave the field as expected.
As in the previous year, Felix Bader was able to save a small time lead to the finish line and defended his title as the overall winner of the short distance.
In second place, Pascal Treubel was again placed.
For the ladies, it was Theresa Duelli from Team Nightmare who made it to the top of the winning ladder.
In second and third place came Anne Adel from Illmensee and Leonie Fahrer from Owingen.
A pleasant development is the increasing number of drivers who live or work in the community.
Not only in terms of performance, the entire range of athletes was represented.
The age structure ranged from ten years for the youngest to over 70 years for the oldest starters.
In the main race this year there were even more absolute top athletes at the start.
Four drivers were able to stand out from the top regional drivers.
This includes Philipp Pangerl, a mountain bike semi-professional from the Black Tusk racing team.
Pangerl and a teammate have already been world champions in twelve-hour driving twice.
This year he became European champion in this special discipline.
With Roland Ballerstedt, who already has two German championship titles in duathlon.
After 45 kilometers and 900 meters of altitude, there was a lash finish in the finish line in front of the Three Lakes Hall.
Pangerl was the first to cross the finish line.
Just one second behind, the routineist Ballerstedt was able to secure the second place in the overall score.
At the same time, Hermann and Warthmann were third overall.
In the women's rating, Christiane Cohsmann was the fastest time in the main race.
Areane Blersch from Binzwangen secured the second place ahead of Natascha Werner from Stuttgart.
Athletes and helpers were very satisfied with the smooth and well-organized course of the event.
En route through mud, rivers and jungles for free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle brings free medical care to remote villages in Cameroon
Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend treating hundreds of patients
In the West African country there are not many doctors, only one in 5,000 people
Vote here or with your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is in the top 10 of CNN Heroes of 2013.
You can vote for him or one of the other heroes in the top 10 to choose him as "CNN Hero of the Year".
The winner receives $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched as his sick father repeatedly lost consciousness and traveled to hospitals that did not have the means to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident near Yaoundé, Cameroon's capital, in 1981.
At first he had only a broken arm, but then an inflammation formed that spread to his brain, causing a hematoma that would affect him for the rest of his life.
“There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon,” said Georges Bwelle.
We would have taken him out of Cameroon if we had the money.
Instead, Bwelle spent years accompanying his father to crowded clinics and hospitals to get the treatment they had to offer.
“It’s not easy,” commented Bwelle.
You can leave the house at five in the morning and run to the hospital to be the first, and you are not the first.
There are a lot of patients.
Some people even die because they have to wait.
The situation has hardly changed since Bwelle’s father died in 2002.
There is only one doctor per 5,000 people in Cameroon, according to the World Health Organization.
In contrast, in the United States, the ratio is with a doctor for 413 people.
But even if there was a doctor for her, most Cameroonians couldn’t afford the visit.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line and nearly three-quarters of the country’s health spending is private.
“The only problem they have is poverty,” says Bwelle.
Poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life.
To see his father and so many of his compatriots suffering in Bwelle matured the decision to do something against it.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers performed 700 free operations last year.
He became a doctor himself and works as a vascular surgeon at the Central Hospital in Yaoundé.
In addition, he founded a non-profit organization called ASCOVIME, which travels to rural areas on weekends and offers free medical care there.
Since 2008, he and his volunteer group have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 people force themselves into minibuses and drive with their medical equipment on the roof over unfastened terrain to the villages in need of help.
Not always everything goes smoothly.
More than once they had to push the vehicles through rivers and mud.
But when they arrive, they will be welcomed like heroes: a feast, singing and dancing and the best accommodation the place has to offer.
In these villages, free medical care is really a reason to celebrate and bloom – with his wide smile and limitless energy – is happy to attend the joyful celebration.
The next morning, the team starts examining hundreds of patients.
“We treat 500 people per ride,” says Bwelle.
They come from a radius of 60 kilometers around the village – and that on foot.
Each of these weekend clinics offers medical care in a number of areas.
Many people are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others receive crutches, donated glasses, or free birth certificates – a document required for school, but many poor families simply cannot afford it.
In the evening, the team performs simple operations with local anesthesia.
The surgeries usually take place in a school, town hall, or apartment; after the procedure, patients get up and go to the rest area to make room for the next person.
The lighting for the surgery and disinfection equipment is powered by the generator of the group and so Bwelle and his volunteers work until the early hours of Sunday morning.
It’s an exhausting curriculum, but the village musicians usually help keep the team motivated.
“They’re drumming all night so we can stay awake and continue our work,” says Bwelle.
On Sunday, the team then returns to the city, tired but proud of the work done.
The group – a mixture of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students – has performed 700 free surgeries last year and knows that its work is making a huge difference to the people it helps.
One man explained that the free surgery of a fracture of the ankle that he had received now enabled him to work again.
“It’s changing the future of my family,” he said.
In addition to the weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon in the hospital, Bwelle also works at night in private clinics in Yaoundé.
With this second job, he finances 60% of his non-profit activity, according to Bwelle; the rest comes from private donations.
“I really don’t know when he’s sleeping,” says Katie O’Malley, who is in her second year at Drexel University in Philadelphia studying medicine and volunteering in the Bwelles group.
He is either always in the hospital or trying to raise money for the organization so that he can go on these campaigns.
For medical and nursing students like O’Malley who come from the U.S. and Europe and support bloating, this is a chance to gain hands-on experiences they would never get at home.
“We can be in surgery where we help to clot blood or hold the instruments for Dr. Bwelle,” O’Malley said.
This would never be possible in America as a medical student in the second year.
Students usually pay for their trip to Cameroon themselves and often bring donated medical supplies.
Once in Yaoundé, Bwelle takes care of accommodation, transportation and directions.
“He’s a hero,” O’Malley said.
He dedicates his life to this organization and his desire to help the Cameroonian people knows no boundaries.
For Bwelle, almost constant work is not a burden.
Helping others to have a happier life and thus fulfilling a promise he made to his father brings him great joy.
“I’m so happy when I do this job,” Bwelle says.
And I think of my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
I do it to make people laugh again and to relieve the pain.

Excellently mastered the fight
The role of Santiago, the old man in Hemingway's novel "The Old Man and the Sea", is cut on the body by Horst Janson.
Janson himself is an old rabbit in his craft, the art of acting.
No one can do anything to the old man Santiago when fishing.
The two complement each other just great.
It is almost thought to be able to see the wrinkles in the neck of the old man, of which the fisherman Manolo speaks.
If Santiago is tired of sitting in the chair bent by life, this is real with Janson.
In addition, the role of the old fisherman is through and through a character role that Janson masters excellently.
Hemingway told the story of a fighter, a brave man who does not give up and ultimately wins the fight against the fish through his knowledge and also his willpower.
Janson is on stage for a long time as a solo performer.
He manages to focus the attention of the audience on himself, so that his monologues are not boring for a moment.
His efforts to finally pull the fish to the surface of the water are so real that viewers forget that the sea is only made up of blue-lit water bottles.
Director Jens Hasselmann lets the old man act in the boat in front of the fishing village.
In the course of the performance, he highlights the active scene: the Santiago hut, the bar of singer Marie-Luise Gunst, who sings the Cuban sense of life with her songs and her glorious voice.
The four musicians play Cuba’s rhythm and are also guests of the bar.
Tourism: Descent to the Romans
At about 120 meters in length, a sewage channel from the Roman period is preserved below Cologne.
Those who visit Cologne will not pass the cathedral.
Around 157 meters high, the two towers rise into the sky and make it the second tallest church building in Europe.
However, few visitors who admire the two filigree church towers suspect that there is also a lot to discover under the cathedral.
Rainer Schulze is an expert in the Cologne Underworld.
Meeting point for his guided tours is the Cologne-Tourism Service Center directly at the Cathedral.
The tour starts quite unspectacularly: "We start in the underground garage," says Schulze.
In the seventies, the city fathers wanted a self-sufficient city, and therefore only what was not too large remained of the remnants of the old city walls.
Therefore, most users of the car park today also rush past the Roman remains and just drop off their car.
But if you take a closer look, you will discover an archaeological site separated by metal grid bars in the park deck D2.
You can see about five meters high ruins of hand-sized stones.
"These are the remains of the Roman city walls that were built in the second half of the first century AD," Schulze says.
Before returning to daylight, Schulze lets the participants on the upper level of the park take a look at a dark, 15-metre-deep shaft.
This is the fountain of the old dome, which unfortunately is hardly perceived.
The next stop of the tour is the Praetorium, and here the participants descend back into the depths.
Here we experience the seat of the once most powerful man north of the Alps, the Pretor of the CCAA.
What CCAA means, a visitor wants to know.
"The abbreviation stands for "Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium", which in good German means as much as "city of Roman law and city of the Agrippians, founded under Emperor Claudius at the site of the altar for the imperial cult".
And the praetorium is the former governor's palace, the center of power of the Roman Empire on the Rhine.
From the hallway of the exhibition leads a tunnel access to the Roman sewage canal, which is preserved here at about 120 meters in length.
"You can quietly walk a bit along the so-called Cloaca Maxima if you want," Schulze cheers the guests up.
Schulze still has a surprise.
After collecting the key at the checkout, he leads the group to a 16-metre-deep, walkable shaft.
“We are now in the Mikwe, a ritual Jewish bath,” he explains.
The Jewish community built their bath deep into the ground to get to the groundwater, which was essential for the ritual washings.
To this day, at the lower end of the Mikwe, whose origins date back to the eighth century, different water levels can be read through varying levels of the Rhine.
The Mikwe will be part of an archaeological zone on the Town Hall Square, for which construction work is expected to begin shortly.
However, a few years will pass until completion.
Leg almost cut off: reissue of Rocker process
A bloody attack in the rocker environment is rolled up again after more than four years.
A trial for attempted murder, dangerous bodily injury and property damage against two 30-year-olds has begun before the district court of Frankfurt (Oder).
It is accompanied by strict security measures.
The defendants were silent at the start.
They are said to have been active in the rocker scene and then belonged to the bandits.
The prosecutors accuse them of stabbed and hitting three men in a car together with unknown accomplices in Finowfurt in June 2009.
All the victims were seriously injured, a man almost lost his leg.
The victims are said to have belonged to the competing group Hells Angels.
One is said to have been a high-ranking member from Berlin.
Apparently, there was a chase with several cars.
According to the indictment, it was about area fights and a demonstration of power.
The two defendants were acquitted in early 2012.
A court spokesman said at the time it could not be proven that the men were actually involved in the bloody fight.
The perpetrators were wearing masks and were not identified.
The Bundesgerichtshof revoked the judgment after review of the public prosecutor’s office and referred it back to the district court for re-trial.
One of the defendants is currently in execution for another offense.
At the outset, it was mainly about the reconstruction of the processes in the night.
The investigating commissioner was charged as a witness.
In the center were cell phone conversations of the accused and other people who had been intercepted by the police.
The hard thing is that Rockers almost always stick to a law that’s better for them in court — and don’t make statements.
This also applies to the victims.
In the first trial, only one of the victims had unpacked.
Attorney General Stefan Golfier of the Frankfurt (Oder) Public Prosecutor's Office said on demand that new traces had emerged since the last trial.
Eleven more negotiating days are set for the process.
The disposable company does not think
The night was long, the music loud and the mood good, but at some point it goes home.
Only: In the bellies of the people on the passenger and back seat, the hunger is noticeable.
Of course, one or the other cocktail or drink may be responsible for this!
What’s closer than going to the next drive-in to give yourself a little?
I admit, I like to be with you when you go to the fast food holes late at night or early in the morning.
A few fries, a coke, a burger - and then nothing like going home and going to bed!
But on the way home, the obvious differences between me and other hungry disco walkers are noticeable.
After all, what does it take to throw your fast food bags out of the car window with regularity?!
Especially on weekends, discarded paper bags lie on the roadsides and on parking lots.
"Why?" I wonder.
Are people too deaf to take the bags home or to the next trash can?
It’s not just that the paperwork spoils the landscape.
Bags have also already covered transport facilities such as dashboards and thus triggered accidents.
But the said "disposal society" doesn't think about it, probably doesn't even know what that word actually means.
If you travel more often in the evenings, especially with several people in the car, you know what a back seat can look like after a busy night: clothes, bottles and other garbage pile up there.
There would be a few bags more or less, but also nothing - unlike the street, where no one wants to trample on the food leftovers of others.
I already see the day coming when the cities and communities will have to take a silly break - and the fast food chains will have to ask for a pledge for their bags.
Obama's Retreat in Health Policy
After fierce criticism yesterday, President Obama made a withdrawal from his often repeated, unambiguous promise: “If you like your health insurance, you can keep it.”
After hundreds of thousands received a letter of resignation from their insurer, Republicans accused the president in recent days of deceiving the American public.
Yesterday, Obama relativized his original promise.
“The vast majority of citizens who have working health insurance can keep them,” he said in a speech in Boston.
In response to the numerous media reports on the dismissals, Obama urged those Americans who received such communications to look for new insurance in the free market.
Most citizens could thus get better, more comprehensive health insurance for the same price or cheaper than predicted.
“You have a better offer,” he said.
The government described it as not surprising that the five percent of the population who have taken out insurance themselves would have to look for a different rate because their contract does not meet the new standards under the Affordable Care Act.
"I want to tell these Americans very directly: they deserved better," Sebelius said at a hearing before the House Energy and Trade Committee in Washington.
Sebelius, who is responsible for implementing the Affordable Care Act, said the launch of the online platform had been “miserable” since October.
“I’m just as frustrated and angry as everyone else,” she said.
I am determined to regain your trust.
This statement by an outraged Sebelius to a counsellor sitting behind her at yesterday’s House hearing was recorded after a dispute with Republican MP Billy Long from Missouri about whether she should be obliged to participate in Obamacare.
After more than three hours of hearings, Long Sebelius repeatedly questioned why the “architect” of the Affordable Care Act had not voluntarily renounced state-sponsored insurance to enter into a tariff with HealthCare.gov, which she now wants to sell to millions of Americans.
The government in Jerusalem does not confirm the attack on Syrian air base
A U.S. government official who wanted to remain anonymous told CNN on Thursday that Israeli fighter jets had attacked an air base in Syria’s Latakia the day before.
The targets were "missiles and related equipment" that the Israeli government feared were destined for Lebanese Hezbollah, CNN reported.
Syrian and Lebanese media as well as the Arab broadcaster Al-Arabiya had previously reported that the base in the port city of Latakia had been shot at at night from Wednesday to Thursday, and blamed the Israelis for it.
The Israeli TV channel Channel 2 showed satellite images of the base in Latakia, showing Russian S-125 Neva missiles as well as a battery of SA-3 missiles, which, according to Channel 2, have a range of 35 kilometers and can carry warheads up to 70 kilograms.
Uncertain The government in Jerusalem has not officially confirmed the attack.
However, the Reuters news agency also quoted an anonymous Israeli government official as saying he believes Israel carried out the attack, but is not sure.
An Israeli Defense Ministry spokesman said: “We are not commenting on these reports.”
Journalist Ron Ben-Yishai stressed in the Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper that the Syrian regime had already tried, in part successfully, to deliver ground-to-air missiles to Hezbollah.
The Israeli government has repeatedly warned that any attempt by Syria to supply Hezbollah with chemical or other dangerous weapons would mean crossing a “red line” followed by a military response.
In an unprecedented admission, John Kerry said U.S. espionage was “inappropriately far too far.”
John Kerry, with an unexpected admission, pointed to a softening of the defensive stance of the United States with regard to its surveillance programs, saying that espionage in certain cases “has gone too far inappropriately.”
The foreign minister also admitted that he, along with Barack Obama, assumed responsibility for switching to “autopilot” when the explosive revelations of whistleblower Edward Snowden about the NSA’s espionage activities became public.
Due to the leaked information, the US government has entered a diplomatic storm of indignation on the part of its allies.
Speaking at the Open Government conference in London, Kerry said: “Without question, the president and I and others in the government have learned of some things that happened almost via autopilot, simply because of the ability to do so, which dates back to World War II and the difficult years of the Cold War, and of course, to 9/11.”
Subsequently, he was the first high-ranking member of the U.S. government to admit that U.S. espionage had crossed a border, but also stressed that no rights had been abused.
He said, “In some cases, this has gone too far inappropriately.”
The President is determined to create clarity and therefore conducts a thorough investigation so that no one has to feel that abuse is taking place here.
I assure you that the rights of innocent persons in this process will not be affected.
Kerry, however, insisted that the NSA was a force for good and that its surveillance operations had saved many lives.
He added: “We’re dealing with a new world where people are willing to blow themselves up.”
There is radical extremism in the world, committed to killing people, blowing up and attacking governments.
So what if you were able to intercept and stop it before it happens?
We have actually prevented plane crashes, attacks on buildings and the killing of people, because we have learned in advance of such plans.
Meanwhile, U.S. lawmakers will travel to Europe to dispel concerns over alleged U.S. espionage and convince Europeans of the need to continue to work with the U.S. in the anti-terrorism efforts, the chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs said on Tuesday.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said he spoke to representatives of the European Parliament and other individuals this week and was concerned about their threats to stop participating in anti-terror organizations due to frustration over surveillance by the National Security Agency.
“It is very important for the national security interests of the United States that Europeans remain on board with regard to our joint counter-terrorism efforts,” Murphy, who sits in the Senate for the first time as a Democrat and chairs the Senate Subcommittee on Foreign Relations and European Affairs, said in an interview.
In addition, I am going to Europe to make it clear that we must continue to work together in the fight against terrorism, regardless of their anger over the NSA programs.
Media reports that the NSA has captured millions of phone data in Europe have strained relations with some U.S. allies, although the head of the intelligence service said this week that the reports were inaccurate and were based on a misunderstanding of the metadata collected by NATO allies and the United States.
Other revelations cited documents handed down by Snowden that the NSA monitored the phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel and up to 34 other heads of state worldwide.
The head of the national intelligence, James Clapper, defended espionage among allies as necessary and declared that this was customary on both sides.
In all the turmoil, Murphy said his authority is preparing the congress trip to take place this year, and hoped the delegation would include members from both parties and chambers.
The names of the other participating Members will be published in the coming days.
He said the exact itinerary would still be worked out.
While Murphy stressed that the purpose of the trip was to improve relationships, he also said there would be some "serious words".
He said European governments should be honest with their people about the kind of spy programs they have used themselves for years.
“While we can change our surveillance programs to better protect the rights of Europeans, they must also accept the fact that we are not the only ones spying,” Murphy said.
Meanwhile, John Kerry is planning a trip to the Middle East and Poland over the weekend to deal with the resentment over US strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as US surveillance activities.
A stubborn injury on the ankle threatens to prevent Nicolai Müller's use in the Bundesliga away game of FSV Mainz 05 at FC Augsburg.
Mainz asks for the use of Nicolai Müller.
Tomorrow he will try to train with the team.
So far, he has only been able to do so individually.
"We will decide on his deployment in the short term," said coach Thomas Tuchel.
The 40-year-old hopes to have his best scorer with six goals.
Because the Mainzers already have to give up the injured performers Niki Zimling, Julian Baumgartlinger and Niko Bungert.
Australian woman pleads against imprisonment in Thailand
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney, who was sentenced to 15 days in prison in Phuket for falsely claiming to have been raped by a taxi driver, has appealed against the verdict and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was first found guilty by a provincial court in Phuket on June 15 after she told Thai police that a local taxi driver had raped her in the morning on Sunday, June 10, while two other men detained her.
Later, however, the footage of a video camera showed that she had safely arrived at her hotel after being separated from her Australian boyfriend.
Police in Phuket interrogated Bamford for two days until they confessed to making up the story.
Until the trial, she was in police custody.
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-day prison sentence in a low-security detention facility on the outskirts of Phuket, rather than an adult women’s prison.
She is the daughter of Peter Tunks, a former player of the Australian Rubgy League, who turned to the Foreign Ministry in Canberra for help for his daughter.
Tunks told the Sunday Telegraph in Sydney that the whole family was “extremely concerned” about his daughter’s well-being and wanted her back in Australia.
“Of course, we’re worried, but we hope she’ll be home as soon as possible,” Tunks said.
Bamford has appealed against the verdict and is on bail of 50,000 baht.
In Australian reports it was read that in the meantime she is vacationing in the resort of Krabi in southern Thailand.
The court heard that Bamford was being represented by a local lawyer in Phuket and had been warned that the appeal could also lead to a higher sentence of up to two years in an adult prison.
However, it is also possible that after the recent assassination of travel merchant Michelle Smith in Phuket, Thailand may be trying to improve its hit tourist image, and therefore there is an acquittal.
