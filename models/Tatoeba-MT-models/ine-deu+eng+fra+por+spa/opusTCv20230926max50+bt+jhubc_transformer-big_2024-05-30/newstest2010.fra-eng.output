Barack Obama will be the fourth U.S. President to receive the Nobel Peace Prize
U.S. President Barack Obama will fly to Oslo, Norway, to spend 26 hours there and be the fourth U.S. president in history to receive the Nobel Peace Prize.
The $1.4 million diploma, medal and cheque will be given to him for his outstanding efforts to strengthen global diplomacy and collaboration among nations.
The head of the White House and his wife Michelle will land in the morning in the Norwegian metropolis and have a busy schedule.
He will first visit the Nobel Institute, where he will meet for the first time the five members of the Committee who chose him in October from 172 people and 33 organizations.
The presidential couple's schedule then includes an interview with King Harald V of Norway and Queen Sonja.
The visit will culminate in the afternoon at a solemn ceremony where Obama will receive the prestigious award.
He will be the fourth U.S. president to receive it, but only the third to be awarded the award in the Committee’s own home.
The White House announced in advance that Obama would talk about the war in Afghanistan during the award ceremony.
The president does not want to avoid this topic because he is aware that he receives this award by being a president who is currently waged a war in two countries.
He stepped up the war effort a few days ago by sending additional units to Afghanistan, which none of his critics will forget to stress.
At the ceremony, Obama will also receive a gold medal, a diploma and a check of ten million Swedish kronor (approximately 1.1 million euros).
He intends to donate them to charities, but he has not yet decided which ones.
His programme will then take him and his wife to a banquet including, in addition to the king and queen of Norway, the head of government and 250 other guests.
Obama was rather reluctant to that price at first.
He mentioned, for example, having the feeling that he did not fully deserve it.
He also repeated several times that this is not a prize for himself alone, but for all those who defend the same values as him.
As soon as the announcement was made, he said it would be an “invitation to action.”
A Nature Defender Accused of Blackmail
The police in Litom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice accused the president of the society of nature protectors of Litom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice of blackmail.
On several occasions last year he appealed for several construction procedures and demanded money from investors for his personal profit in exchange for the withdrawal of his appeal, said Alena Romová, spokeswoman for the Litom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice police.
The president of the Society of Nature Protectors of Litom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice is Lubomír Studni<0xC4><0x8D>ka.
He is currently in detention and faces up to three years in prison.
Waste sorting bins are not perfumed in Brno
In Prague everyone can sort their beverage packaging, while in the villages of South Moravia you fall on sorting buckets at every corner of the street.
What about Brno?
There, you would need to take several minutes before finding the right buckets.
I do not mean that we would not sort the waste at all in Brno.
But I feel that the municipal councillors of our city, the second largest city in the country, are not interested enough in this problem.
Brno is in the stone age of sorting waste not only because citizens can still sort only paper, glass and PVC, but especially given the number of bins dedicated to these wastes.
Have you ever tried to throw a plastic bottle in the city center?
It is a whole science, which requires above all time and nerves of steel.
The only place I have found at the moment is the place of Moravia opposite Potrefena Husa.
That Mr. Onderka and his colleagues do not like me, but it seems to me very little.
Not to mention the fact that in other areas of the city it is not a sinecure either.
So in the end, many of my friends don’t sort their waste.
By laziness.
It makes them a trot to get to the buckets.
I'm not surprised by them.
I myself, after a party, offered to throw away a few bottles of glass and PVC.
Except that I didn't see any colored buckets on Kounicova street.
Fortunately, I found the right place by taking the tram.
That said, the waste was overflowing.
After all, it is the center of Brno, which is supposed to represent the city best, right?!
It is likely that ecology and a supposed aestheticism do not interest the socialists of Brno too much.
They prefer to buy in the city a first-league hockey spot that embarrasses the city throughout the country, rather than buying a few extra buckets and offering the sorting of more raw materials for a cleaner Brno.
I’m glad I was able to confirm my impression with official statistics after spending some time on the internet.
According to the data of the company EKO-KOM, Brno is really the worst of the whole region of South Moravia.
Paroubek's budget removed pensions and sick leave
After the left has grown, despite the government's advice, farmers or even civil servants, there may be a lack of money for pensions, sick leave or housing savings.
But also for interest on state debt or international judicial proceedings.
This will increase the problems of those who will rule in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and Communists imposed the increase for certain classes, they were based on the fact that the government will make loans for sensitive expenses, pensions or sick leave. "It's just putting the problems back to later, mining the ground," Janota said.
It is important to know that interest on borrowed money is increasing and will have to be repaid sooner or later.
The state doesn’t really have a choice as to where to draw money.
If it does not reduce social benefits or its expenses, it will have to increase taxes.
To all those who the left has now grown: the firefighters, the teachers, the farmers.
And then, to their children.
People will touch them and should not be afraid for their pensions or health insurance, of which 1.8 billion have disappeared.
But at the expense of a greater indebtedness of the state - next year it will not be missing 163 billion in cash, but more.
Despite Minister Janota’s efforts, debt will thus grow more rapidly and with it, interest-related expenses.
The state will need money to repay it and it will no longer be enough to slightly increase VAT or decrease maternity leave as the government did in its deficit package.
It will also be missing $5 billion to complete the construction of roads and railways due to the transfer of money to a few groups of voters.
These are mainly sections that have already been decided and started, and it is not possible to modify the projects to reduce costs.
At most, keep them, which is not free either.
This means delaying or stopping 30 major construction sites, and the collection of European funds is also in danger, according to Karel Hanzelka, a spokesman for the Ministry of Transport.
The <0xC4><0x8C>SSD proposed to solve the financial deficit very wisely - it will draw on the dividends of the <0xC4><0x8C>EZ (electricity supplier and distributor), which the state owns for the most part, and will feed the transport fund.
The concern is that the amount of dividends is never certain and that it is in no case a bottomless pit.
Last year, 18 billion were navigated from the <0xC4><0x8C>EZ to the budget.
Each year, dividends are used to pay for the removal of environmental damage, to complete the pension accounts, or as a reserve for the pending pension reform.
Moreover, this trick increases the real budget deficit by 5.7 per cent of GNP according to EU rules.
And it's far from the end of the transfer carnival.
The budget for various compensations for victims of communism and crimes, and even housing savings, has fallen by almost three billion.
It is not certain that the state can act without this money.
It's a lottery.
If we lose an international procedure, we will have to pay for it anyway, Janota said.
The minister will then have to save on the departmental side or, at worst, touch the government budget reserve.
One hundred million is also missing from the two-billion-dollar state treasury project, which should allow online tracking of the expenditures of each administration.
The first stage will begin in January.
If the finance minister finds no money elsewhere, the project will have to be stopped and sanctions will take place, Janota warns.
Your next smartphone will master two operating systems
In the future, Americans are considering a mobile phone that will allow the user to switch from one operating system to another by pressing a single button.
The projects that have been revealed seem promising.
Just one button and you switch from Windows Mobile to Android in a few seconds.
It is precisely this possibility that is the goal of the American company VMware, which mainly deals with the development of virtualization software for computers.
We will allow you to manage two user profiles at the same time on your mobile phone.
You can alternate between them, you can differentiate them in personal and professional
Both will work at the same time, said Srinivas Krishnamurti of VMware in an interview with Computerworld magazine.
It was presented in November last year and it was first demonstrated a few days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
Virtualization on smartphones is by no means fiction.
VMware has already successfully presented a test version to journalists, a smartphone equipped with two operating systems.
This is a modified Nokia N800 with a 128 MB RAM, which simultaneously ran the mentioned Windows Mobile and Android systems.
The development of new technologies for mobile phones is booming.
VMware is now collaborating with European and U.S. carriers to test virtualization on smartphones, and customers are expected to have access to current devices in 2012.
The lack of snow in the mountains haunts hoteliers
Desert slopes are not a problem only for slope operators.
The lack of snow discourages people from booking their ski stays in hotels and guesthouses.
As a result, it is always possible to find free rooms for all winter dates, including Christmas and New Year.
We have a lot of visits on our site.
Internet users browse through the offers, ask for prices but do not dare to commit to booking at the moment.
And if they call us, they immediately ask if there will be snow or mud at Christmas,” said Martin Jandura, operator of the Spindl.Info news portal.
If you want to spend the New Year of your dreams in <0xC5><0xA0>pindler<0xC5><0xAF>v Ml<0xC3><0xBD>n, it is better not to hesitate to book.
If we give priority to savings and the quality of accommodation comes only afterwards, then we can try to wait a few more days.
The hoteliers of <0xC5><0xA0>pindler currently offer only one week stays for the New Year.
I think they will try to put them in again for a while, but they will also give in and accept shorter periods.
And then the number of free rooms will quickly decrease," Jandura said.
The tourist agency Ingtours du Vrchlabí also offers free beds for all winter periods.
We are most interested in the Christmas week at the moment, it is not completely sold.
There is still, say, half of the rooms in our offer.
That's why we've already prepared some cheaper last minute Christmas breaks," said Ingtours director Petr Schiefert.
The Vrchlabí tourist agency may also offer New Year's Eve in Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e, but there are fewer vacancies.
The first fourteen days of February leave just as well, the remaining winter stays sell on average.
This year, interest in winter holidays has been negatively influenced by the fact that there is still no snow in Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e.
People are waiting for her to start falling.
No one wants to spend the winter in the mountains without snow.
If the tracks overlap during the week, Christmas will be complete too,” Schiefert thinks.
Conversely, the occupancy of the Hotel Horizont in Pec pod Sn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE>kou is slightly higher than last year.
We have an improvement of about five percent.
We still have a few last places for the New Year as well as for Christmas.
There is great interest during the holidays of January of the Poles and February sells well too," says Karel Rada, director of the best hotel in Pec.
The Omnia hotel near the central parking lot of Jánské Lázn<0xC4><0x9B> is also complete at eighty percent during the New Year period.
On the contrary, half of the beds remain empty at Christmas in the newest hotel in Jánské Lázn<0xC4><0x9B>.
This year we were pleasantly surprised by the month of January, where we already have sixty percent occupancy at present.
February is a little weaker for now but as soon as the snow falls, interest in stays in the Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e will certainly still grow, said Omnia hotel manager Erik Sporysch.
However, hoteliers in Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e should not expect more snow.
Thursday will be cooler and if there is rain, it should be snowy in the mountains.
But afterwards, the weather should warm up, reports Ji<0xC5><0x99>í Jakubsk<0xC3><0xBD> from the Hradec station of the Czech hydrometeorological institute.
USA: Repetition is the Mother of Wisdom
It even becomes comic, the diligent effort with which Barack Obama, president with the reputation of being wise, reproduces his predecessor’s strategy on the Afghan issue, which he himself considered to be quite simple.
When he finally let his long-awaited doctrine sweat, it turned out that he had copied it on carbon paper since Bush’s Iraqi script three years ago.
Not content with using the phrase “like Iraq” several times in the text, he did not hesitate to use the title of Bush’s January 2007 speech as the title of his own speech: “A New Way Forward.”
At the same time, he personally criticized Bush’s idea of sending new reinforcements to a civil war-consumed Iraq as “irresponsible and a catastrophic decision in its consequences.”
The following months, however, showed that Bush’s strategy, which emanated from the recommendations of the campaign commanders, was the only possible and likely to be successful to such an extent that the newspapers at present do not speak at all about Iraq.
This did not improve Bush's reputation, that is, objectively speaking, he left his successor in a much more favorable final situation than one might expect.
Barack Obama hopes the miracle will happen again in Afghanistan
Again, it was the campaign commanders who asked him for an increase in the military contingent, including the commander of the Afghan operation, General Stanley McCristal, who even harshly criticized the White House’s reluctance despite its habits of subordination.
He asked for 40,000 men so that he could make the situation more favorable.
The president hesitated for three months, but in the absence of a better option, he at least cheated the 10,000-strong general.
It succeeded in dismantling the promise of an additional 5,000 from Europe, even though it originally counted on 10,000.
What is causing the most problems in the entire Obama strategy seems to be his intention to withdraw the armies from Afghanistan within 18 months and to complete the whole process within three years. The whole Obama doctrine brings more questions than it provides answers.
Many doubt that an increase of half will bring the same fruits as progress in Iraq.
Despite the fratricidal wars of recent years, Iraqi society is relatively well organized and its leaders honor the agreements.
The situation in Afghanistan is marked by the exact opposite: no one can be counted on and no treaty is respected.
In these conditions, it is difficult to prepare Afghan security forces, accustomed to changing leaders day by day according to what they arrange.
Political institutions, although officially founded, will remain only the powder behind which patriarchal ethnic relations will proliferate.
It is singularly complex to balance the interests of the various ethnic groups in view of the lack of clarity about the relations, which are still complicated by Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Even the foundation of a "quick state to act", which is the basic goal of the operation, does not seem to be very real.
The time horizon of Obama’s strategy makes him perplexed by his voluntarism.
In the last eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only worsened and is now on the brink of chaos.
Only a purely romantic and out of reality heart can be convinced that the little soldiers sent into the turmoil of war in view of their "prompt return home" will bring there a real miracle.
From a political point of view, setting a date for the withdrawal of troops is purely irresponsible since the Taliban will regard it as an indirect admission of American defeat.
The latest NATO summit showed that the Europeans’ willingness to participate in military operations in Afghanistan is oriented towards the negative.
European politicians do not know or want to explain to their constituents how the security in Germany or Italy is linked to a war in the Hindu Kush mountains.
Another factor capable of radically altering the situation is the evolution of events related to Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the increased sanctions have no effect on the Iranians, the Americans will face the very difficult question of resolving the problem through the use of military force.
This will have to be answered, for example, at a time when, according to Obama, America will come to the victorious withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan.
Any such solution will, however, lead to a dramatic reversal of the Afghan situation.
The only rutine for Obama is the fact that there are three years left until the presidential election and therefore there is still enough time for him to plan a new strategy, in case it turns out to be a total fiasco.
Goldman Sachs executives will no longer receive cash bonuses
Senior executives at Goldman Sachs will no longer receive cash bonuses this year.
The company announced this in response to strong criticism of its salary practices.
The group of 30 top executives will receive shares instead of money, which they will not be able to resell until five years.
The shares may be withdrawn from the executives in case they take too much risk.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs is thus at the forefront of the effort aimed at linking remuneration with long-term performance on Wall Street.
I suppose Wall Street is well aware of the overall meaning that needs to be taken, said former investment banker Douglas Elliott of JPMorgan.
The concern lies in the details, he added.
Bank Goldman Sachs has become the target of criticism after setting aside nearly $17 billion in bonuses in the first three quarters of this year.
For the current year, the total amount of premiums is likely to exceed $20 billion despite the measure announced today, according to Reuters.
With the onset of the financial crisis, strong premiums in the banking sector have become a sensitive policy topic in many countries.
Britain announced on Wednesday that it plans to allocate a single tax of fifty percent to bankers’ bonuses exceeding <0xC2><0xA3>25,000.
France is preparing similar measures.
This year, women have won Nobel Prizes in all fields except physics.
There are five women, a record number, who today in Stockholm received the Nobel Prize in technical and literary disciplines from the King of Sweden Charles XVI Gustave.
In addition to the four scientists there was also the German writer of Romanian origin Herta Müller.
Two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, have been awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine for their research in the field of chromosomes.
The Chemistry Prize was awarded to Israeli Ada Jonath with American Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz for clarifying the structure and function of ribosomes
The last winner received the Nobel Prize in Economics, the American Elinor Ostrom with her compatriot Oliver Williamson, for their analysis of economic governance.
The only technical discipline that didn’t have a winner this year was physics.
This award was presented today to Charles Kao for his research in the field of optical fibers and George Smith with Willard Boyle for their invention of CCD chips, which are currently the basis of all digital cameras, fax or astronomical glasses.
Each laureate has received the diploma, Nobel Medal and the Certificate of Acquiring the Monetary Award.
It reaches ten million Swedish kronor in each category. (approximately 1.1 million euros)
If one of them has several winners, they will share the reward among themselves.
The long-awaited Nobel Peace Prize has already been presented this afternoon in Oslo, Norway, to US President Barack Obama.
In his speech, he acknowledged the controversial nature of his award since he is only at the beginning of his journey and is also at the head of a country engaged in two wars - Iraq and Afghanistan.
In the discharge of his policy, he added that in some situations war is indispensable to obtain peace, even if the price is high.
Minister Janota is considering resigning. Klaus invited him to the Castle
President Václav Klaus will receive Finance Minister Eduard Janota on Friday morning, who weighs his stay in the government due to his disagreement with the state budget for the next year as it was voted by the House of Representatives
It is estimated that the budget and perhaps also Janota's position in the cabinet will be on the agenda for their Friday meeting.
Klaus also criticizes the budget.
According to him, the deficit is too large, which further exacerbates the public finance crisis.
Presidential spokesman Radim Ochvat informed about the meeting.
Janota then wants to discuss her role on Monday with Prime Minister Jan Fischer.
According to the budget legislation that will be submitted to the signature of Klaus, it is a deficit of 163 billion crowns that the Czech Republic should manage.
Nevertheless, the Chamber of Deputies on Wednesday validated the proposals of the left regarding money transfers and increased the salaries of civil servants, the functioning of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government blamed the proposals of the Social Democrats for indirectly increasing the budget deficit.
For this reason, a violent disagreement arose between the left, on the one hand, the government, Klaus, and the right, on the other, which questioned the future of Fischer's cabinet, which had been formed by agreement between the ODS, the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD and the Green Party.
Critics say the budget, as voted by MEPs, removes the austerity package passed by Fischer's government, which he believes must contain the government's debt.
Klaus, who can ratify the state budget law but is not obliged to do so, said today at a breakfast of discussions with entrepreneurs, that politicians have long neglected the "serious problem" of the "irresistible deficiency" of public finances.
In his view, there is now no favourable solution.
Only a strong government could bring improvement if it could rely on a broader consensus of political parties, according to the president.
ODS President Mirek Topolánek said the budget was frightening and that the government should question its future existence.
The vice-president of the ODS Petr Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as told <0xC4><0x8C>TK that the idea of an administrative office supported by the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, the ODS and the Greens is clearly no longer working.
In his reaction, Prime Minister Fischer called such words "drastic verdicts".
The head of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD Ji<0xC5><0x99>í Paroubek reacted to Topolánek, saying that the budget deficit prepared for this year by the former government of Topolánek is frightening and that it will exceed 200 billion crowns.
On Wednesday, the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD called the ratification of the state budget for the next year a success.
The People's Party was also pleased.
Morgan Freeman to play Mandela in Clint Eastwood's new movie
Despite criticism that the main roles are played by American actors, South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film Invictus - Invaincu will expose the world a lot about the country, its fights and its victories.
The story is about sports, race relations, and Nelson Mandela.
Oscar-winning American actor Morgan Freeman stars in the film about the life of Nelson Mandela, a tireless fighter against the racist apartheid regime in South Africa and the first black president.
Freeman said that it was an eighty-nine-year-old Mandela who asked him to play him in the film.
Matt Damon plays another important role.
I said, "If I have to incarnate you, I should be able to see you personally.
The seventy-two-year-old actor who was awarded an award for his role in Clint Eastwood's Million Dollar Baby drama located in the middle of boxing has, for example, played the leader of a movement against slavery himself become a slave, a fictional president of the USA, and even the God of 'Evan All-P' is important for some people.
The former South African statesman has been jailed for 27 years for his hard work in ending apartheid in South Africa.
He was released in 1990 and became president of the country for four years.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus is a Latin word meaning undefeated and it is the title of a poem by the English author William Ernest Henley published in 1875.
The challenge was to talk like him.
The film tells the true story of the joint efforts of Nelson Mandela and the captain of the South African rugby team Francois to unify the country.The newly elected President Mandela knows that his country remains still and always divided racially and economically after apartheid.
He is convinced that he can unite his people through sport and decides to unite the rugby players who are among the outsiders of the world.
The South African team will eventually progress to the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked a few years to bring Mandela’s story to the big screen.
“I had no other goal but to play this role in a way that brought him closer to reality,” Freeman said.
The biggest challenge for me, of course, was to talk like him.
The actor said that if he and the international politician were in the same region, he would have tried to meet Mandela, to have dinner with him, to be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing for him was to shake his hand.
I realized that when I shake your hand, I’m recovering from your energy, it’s transmitted and I felt like I knew how you’re feeling, he said.
It is important for me to try to become another person.
Matt Damon plays in the film François Pienaar, the captain of a national rugby team in which there are a majority of white players.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in the tough middle of rugby.
For him, his first meeting with Pienaar at his home was a big surprise.
I remember when I knocked on the door of the house, he opened me and the first thing I said to Francois Pienaar was, 'I look a lot bigger in the movie.'
Despite the differences between actors and actual models, Invictus under the direction of director Eastwood received positive reviews and there is even talk of ambitions for the Oscars.
Film critic Todd McCarthy of the Daily Variety summed up his appreciation in these words: "It's a very good story, a very well made film."
In movie reviews on rottentomatoes.com, Invictus received 76 percent positive reviews.
The mystery of the aura in Norway is solved: the Russians were testing a rocket
A strange luminous phenomenon of unknown origin has been observed above Norway.
The Russian Defense Ministry said it had tested an intercontinental ballistic missile not far from the Norwegian border.
However, the launch was still a failure and the "Bulava"-type missile that was originally supposed to be the pride of the Russian army gradually became the nightmare of Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Its repeated presence during the rocket tests did not have the expected effect on the success of test flights.
Most of the time, either Bulava didn't fly, or she got hurt in the middle of the flight.
Russian Newspaper Speaks of "Bulava" as "Missile That Doesn't Fly"
A missile that does not fly but shines
This 13th trial was going on normally at the beginning.
It was only at the end of the flight that there was again damage to the aircraft.
It was apparently the engine on the third floor of the rocket that exploded.
This time, "Bulava" flew the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donskij that was sailing under the surface of the White Sea.
This type of missile can be precisely fired from a moving and submerged vessel
This is why the mysterious light over Norway caused by an unidentified flying object was probably caused by a defective "Bulava".
The Norwegians did not doubt for a moment that it was a Russian rocket.
The generals argue that this time we can't talk about failure at all.
The first two stages of the rocket withstood and the failure affected only the third.
In the previous cases, the engines experienced failures on the first floor.
Although none of the test launches went smoothly, the Department of Defense leadership considers that only six out of thirteen were failures.
This success rate of almost fifty percent thus fills the generals with optimism and they always say that one day "Bulava" will fly without problems and that it will even take ten hypersonic nuclear cores with a total weight of 1.15 tons.
The legendary Fetissov signed at 51 years old a one-year contract with CSKA Moscow
Legendary defender Viatcheslav Fetissov will again appear in a professional match at the age of 51.
The former world champion, Olympic champion and Stanley Cup holder will lend a hand to his CSKA Moscow team in need and will probably make his entry already during Friday's match against Petrograd.
Fetissov, who ended his career at the age of forty in 1998, is currently the president of the CSKA.
After the injury of Denis Kuliash we urgently need another defender.
Fetissov trains regularly and agrees to help the team.
We still have to settle some details about the form, says club coach Sergey Nyemtchinov, quoted by the AP agency.
It has not been specified whether the comeback of the legendary hockey player will concern only one match.
I think Fetissov is one of those who are able to strengthen the minds of other players, Nyemtchinov said.
According to AP, in the case of his return to the ice, Fetissov thus becomes the oldest Russian professional hockey player.
In the NHL, legendary forward Gordie Howe played an entire season for Hartford and scored 15 goals and 26 assists.
The oldest of the famous quintet Fetissov, Kassatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov is one of the best hockey players and among those with the most success.
Under the colors of the Soviet Union he won gold twice at the Olympic Games, seven world championship titles, he triumphed at the Canada Cup as well as the junior world championship.
In the second part of his career, he also received tributes in the NHL where he twice held the Stanley Cup.
He has been a member of the Hockey Hall of Fame since 2001.
Hyundai listened to the unions and cancels all overtime
The management of the Hyundai plant in No<0xC5><0xA1>ovice has agreed with the unions to cancel all overtime.
It was precisely because of the frequent overtime that the unions declared a state of emergency on Monday.
Hyundai factory spokesman Petr Van<0xC4><0x9B>k confirmed this.
The leadership, however, wants to agree with the unions on a Saturday that will be working again this year.
We cannot give up our production plan, it is essential, that is why voluntary overtime was proposed on Saturday, December 19, knowing that there would be two teams, Van<0xC4><0x9B>k said.
The website Sedmi<0xC4><0x8D>ka.cz said the company offered a bonus of 400 Czech crowns to employees who would be part of the team on Saturday.
It will also be awarded posterarily for the day worked on November 28.
The company, according to Van<0xC4><0x9B>k, has decided to change the way it motivates its employees in exchange for overtime.
Either they receive the surcharge for the extra hours, or they can lay a replacement leave on December 28 and thus extend their holidays to the end of the year indicated Van<0xC4><0x9B>k.
In addition to this, all employees present on Saturday will receive compensation for transportation costs and for their lunch.
Given that overtime was the hottest and most urgent point in the comments and demands of unions like employees who spontaneously stopped production last week, management made the immediate decision to cancel all overtime for the month of December, Van<0xC4><0x9B>k said.
Until last week, the employees of the car factory were forced to work almost daily two extra hours in addition to their eight hours.
The unions intend to cancel the state of strike after signing the agreement.
The next negotiation between the management of the car factory and the unions is scheduled to take place on Friday afternoon.
Trade union leader Petr Kucha<0xC5><0x99> said on Wednesday they were ready to end the strike if they agreed on their demands and signed a joint document.
The situation in the factory culminated last Wednesday when nearly 400 employees spontaneously went on strike due to incessant overtime.
They also protested against poor wage conditions and alleged bizutage.
The management defended itself with the fact that employees had to work as an extra to meet the requirements for the production of automobiles.
At the announcement of the strike on Monday, the unions also called for workers who have stopped production to be subject to no sanctions.
The unions are asking the company to reduce overtime to a minimum.
In addition, they want a compensation of 5,000 crowns (approximately <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>209) for these.
The Hyundai car factory in No<0xC5><0xA1>ovice currently employs 2,000 people.
It began serial production last year in November.
It has produced approximately 80,000 vehicles by September of this year, with a production capacity of 200,000 cars per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that works on "persistent" HIV viruses too
A team of Czech and German scientists is testing new combinations that can slow the spread of the HIV virus in the body.
The main advantage of the enhanced substance is that it also acts on viruses that have already developed immunity to drugs.
This reality takes, in some cases, the upper hand over the fact that the combination does not act as intensely on the common variants of the virus as well as some drugs already available.
It is not possible to cure AIDS at this time.
However, it is possible to radically prolong the life of patients through a mixture of drugs that prevent the multiplication of the HIV virus in the body.
Their consumption, however, causes a number of side effects.
In addition, the suppression of this multiplication has the effect of developing what are called resistant viruses to which drugs no longer have an effect.
The work of experts from three institutions, the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, the V<0xC5><0xA0>CHT Prague and the University of Heidelberg paves the way for a way to cope with the resistance of the virus.
They have shown that substances called metallocarbons act on the protein responsible for the multiplication of the HIV virus.
Metalocarbons are a combination of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
This combination blocks the development of the virus in a different way from all drugs used so far and that is why they could overcome the problem of resistance.
The work of the researchers leads them to discover new "improved" substances, based on their knowledge of the molecular mechanics of their bonds on the proteins of the virus.
The metallocarbons have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multi-walled cages are formed by the boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms and connected by a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
A treacherous and resistant virus.
HIV protease is a protein of the HIV virus that is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without the division of the HIV virus caused by the HIV protease, no mature infectious particles of the virus would have been born.
If HIV protease is stopped, it will also stop the spread of the virus in the patient's body, the researchers explain in a press release published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In their work published in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, scientists describe a series of combinations in which two pairs of cages (see table) are connected by a short organic chain, which is then systematically modified.
A little weaker but more reliable.
The efficacy of this series of substances on HIV proteases has been tested in test tubes as well as in its resistant variants, obtained from HIV-contaminated patients.
On the current version of the enzyme, the effect of metallocarbons is not as strong as on clinical drugs, however, it does not weaken on resistant versions to which the current drugs are often ineffective.
The metallocarbons, with their unique mechanism of action and their other properties such as biological and chemical stability, their low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical modifications are therefore interesting combinations to be examined further in order to go towards the development of drugs effective against HIV, says Pavlina de <0xC5><0x98>ezá<0xC4><0x8D>ová's biochemical and laboratory science department.
A dispute over the budget. The ODS takes care of Fischer, who defends himself
The president of the ODS (Democratic Civic Party), Mirek Topolánek described the ratified budget for the following year as "effraying" and according to him, the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should question its existence.
The Prime Minister called the ODS's remarks a drastic verdict.
He says take some time to analyze.
ODS spokesman Petr Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as said the idea of an administrative cabinet backed by the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, the ODS and the Green Party was clearly no longer working.
According to Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as, the head of government should decide whether he is in the House of Representatives supporting the minority that is concerned about fighting the growing deficit, or whether he is concerned about staying in office with the help of the parliamentary left.
Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as warned that the positions of the ODS and the Social Democrats in relation to the issue of public deficits are diametrically opposed.
The House of Representatives on Wednesday ratified the budget for 2010, with proposals for amendments amounting to CZK 12 billion included by the left.
The Chamber increased the amount of money allocated to civil servants' salaries, the functioning of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government's grievance against the proposals of the Social Democrats was the fact that they indirectly increased the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic is expected to manage a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
The ODS left the room before the vote, thus obeying the government's request that a modified budget be a less bad variant than an interim budget.
Disappointment and uselessness
Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and a sense of futility, Prime Minister Jan Fischer said the government will continue to reflect on the current situation.
Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as is convinced that if Janota threatens to step down if the proposed amendments are ratified, the situation could be different.
According to Czech Television, Janota held a meeting with the prime minister on Monday after her transition to government:
At the same time, he indicated that he was wondering whether he would remain in office.
His disappointment with the budget negotiations is the reason for this.
If Fischer decides to continue fighting the budget deficit, Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as believes that the representatives of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, who imposed the budget changes, have no place in the government.
The Prime Minister should also make it clear that he will resign if the House ratifies other deficit-increasing laws such as those affecting health insurance, pensions, or reform of the Services Act.
Topolánek: Ministers appointed by the ODS are not at issue.
This is the business of the head of government Fischer and the whole government.
The ministers appointed by the ODS did nothing detrimental, Topolánek said in a textual statement from the United States.
He recalled that deputy ministers in some ministries are demanding TOP 09, which voted against the budget.
Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as stressed that if Fischer decides to resign in the face of a fight against the amount of the public finance deficit, "it is quite logical and correct that he is based on the left-wing majority that is currently in the House."
That said, he should not expect the support and tolerance of the Democrats.
I haven't thought about it and once it's on the agenda then I'll dedicate myself to it," Defence Minister Martin Barták, elected to the government by the Democrats, told reporters from the House.
Prime Minister Fischer took off in the afternoon for a debate at the European Council in Brussels.
The ODS stepped back at the request of the Prime Minister.
Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as stressed at the same time that the ODS would probably have voted Wednesday against the amended budget if it had not explicitly asked the Democrats to allow the budget to be voted on.
We do not feel that we are orphans, we are not small children, he responded to the question of whether the ODS had not suffered reproaches from the President of the Party in the House or in the country when negotiating the budget.
I did not notice that my vote would have been omitted.
I already knew at the time when I gave up my mandate that what would follow in the coming months would be a Bolshevism of the House and the destruction of all that was positive, Topolánek himself responded.
According to the new schedules of the <0xC4><0x8C>D there will be fewer trains for identical fares.
The Czech Railways will abolish or limit some less-charged express or regional trains from 13 December and will instead strengthen some others.
Total transport coverage will decrease by 2% on the date of entry into force of the new schedules compared to today.
Most rates will not change, including basic rates and discounted rates.
For example, the inhabitants of the Ostrava region will have more connections to the capital, the Railways will add a pendolino ram.
On the contrary, an express will cease to serve Bratislava.
There will also be fewer fast trains on the Prague - Písek - <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice line, the Prague - Letohrad direct line will be radically reduced.
At the regional level, the largest reduction in transport affects the Hradec Králové region by a total of eight per cent, while Prague and its surroundings can look forward to an increase.
Two overnight trains on the Prague - Tábor - <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice line are also cancelled and the traffic of some express trains on the Prague - Písek - <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice line will be reduced to just a few days in the week.
Among the biggest transformations, we can see the introduction of a new direct line from Milovice to Prague: at the moment the inhabitants of Milovice have to change to Lysá nad Labem.
This is the fifteenth line of the Esko suburb system, whose opening is possible thanks to the completion of the electrification of the line between Lysá nad Labem and Milovice.
The long-distance lines to the capital will have their final destination at Prague’s main station (Prague Hlavní nádra<0xC5><0xBE>í).
<0xC4><0x8C>D will introduce more SC Pendolino lines between Prague and Ostrava and trains to <0xC5><0xA0>umperk/Jeseník will depart at two-hour intervals.
Travelers will no longer be able to take the Pendolino to Bratislava from 13 December.
The bill this year for regional railways: an additional 200 million crowns.
Express trains are ordered and paid for by the Ministry of Transport and will pay Railways next year a total of four billion crowns to settle the visible losses, the same amount as this year. Regional trains are ordered by the regions who will pay for them by a total of eight billion three billion next year, knowing that the high state will participate in the same.
This year, regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
Railways recently signed a contract for ten years, until now the duration was still one year.
Railways appreciate the system, which is also why they have not resorted to a price hike for the vast majority of transport tickets.
Changes will only affect <0xC4><0x8C>D Net one-day tickets and eLi<0xC5><0xA1>ka discounted internet tickets.
For travelers without a discount card, the price of <0xC4><0x8C>D Net will increase from 450 to 600 crowns.
The price of eLi<0xC5><0xA1>ka will again depend on the route travelled, while until then it was valid between cities of a region of your choice and was at a unique rate of 160 crowns.
Philippine rebels still detain more than 50 people, children released
The rebels kidnapped 75 people in the south of the Philippines today, including some elementary school students and their teachers.
It was the AFP agency that informed, but spoke at the origin of only 65 hostages.
The 17 children were released after eight hours, along with one of the teachers.
The hostage-taking took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
It is reported that about 19 rebels used the hostages as human shields during an escape from the police.
Local negotiators are now trying to find an agreement for the release of the remaining hostages.
According to AFP, the rebels belong to the New People's Army (NPA), which is the armed branch of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to AFP, police first prosecuted the kidnappers following violence caused during a settlement of accounts between two family clans.
Martial law was declared in the province of Maguindanao in the south of the Philippines due to a recent massacre in which 57 people were killed.
Among the victims of the November 23 massacre linked to the elections of the governor's administration there were 30 journalists.
The governor of this southern Philippine province was arrested on suspicion of involvement in the massacre, along with his father Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of the influential Ampatuan line.
The island of Mindanao also includes active Muslim separatists.
However, they renewed peace talks with the Philippine government on Tuesday.
The history of South Africa concerns everyone, according to Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
Clint Eastwood's new Hollywood film is coming to the US theaters in the next few days, titled Invictus (the official Czech title is Invictus: Nepora<0xC5><0xBE>en<0xC3><0xBD>), and tells a part of the life of former South African President Nelson Mandela.
The role of the world-renowned apartheid fighter has returned to Morgan Freeman, who was chosen years ago by Mandela himself to embody it.
The second male role of the legendary South African rugby champion was attributed to Matt Damon.
With the arrival of the film in theaters, the feedback of critics and the public is heard.
Nelson Mandela 's
Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela was born on 18 June 1918 in Mvezu, South Africa.
In 1988 he won the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought, and in 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize alongside Klerk.
He was President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
The film holds high hopes as it is presented at a time when, on the one hand, South Africa is in full preparation for the World Cup, and, on the other hand, because the media is agitated by worrying news about the increase in racial conflicts and discrimination of the inhabitants from the black majority in power.
According to the AP, the reactions to the new film are currently rather positive in South Africa, despite the frequent reservations issued towards the main roles where Hollywood stars "pave".
Morgan Freeman is proud of the film, however, by taking his own terms.
I have dreamed of this role for many years and I have prepared myself well.
I have also met with Nelson Mandela many times in person to be able – as they say – to recover from his energy, he said at the film’s official premiere in Los Angeles.
I think it’s a good thing if we have the opportunity to remember Mandela’s personality and message through the film.
This is the history of the Republic of South Africa, but it concerns every individual, he added.
Wearing the national rugby team jersey
The film based on the story of the novel by the British writer John Carlin the title is freely translated. In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the play that gave its creation to the people depicts the South African human rights defender during his presidency.
Morgan Freeman tries during the film to gather two racial groups of a long-divided population and, like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he wears the South African team's national jersey on the World Cup lawn, which South Africa won at the time.
To have shown himself on the jersey lawn, which is considered sacred in South Africa, Mandela had long been ovated fourteen years ago mainly by the white public and was recognized by the white populations.
Let's hope that the football championship will succeed in bringing people back together in one nation, said rugby player Chester Williams, who in 1995 was the only "black" of the national team.
It remains to be seen whether the tense South African situation will improve.
South African whites, however, are skeptical as recently told in an interview for LN Christopher Dawson, a rugby fan who fled to Britain.
The championship starts on June 11, 2010.
A transformer worth tens of millions of crowns in flames in the Louny region
A fire engulfed in the morning a transformer of the company <0xC4><0x8C>eps from the distribution center near the municipality of V<0xC3><0xBD><0xC5><0xA1>kov na Lounsku.
According to Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Marvan, spokesman for the <0xC3><0x9A>stí firefighters, there are six units operating on the fire.
They originally intended to let the transformer consume itself, but they reviewed their opinion and extinguished the fire with a mixture of water, foam and a special substance.
The cause is a technical defect, an internal short circuit of the transformer.
No one was injured and according to the spokeswoman of the company Pavla Mandatova the incident does not endanger the safe operation of the transmission assembly.
The damage is estimated at a few tens of millions of crowns, the exact number can be known once the fire is extinguished.
According to Mandatova, the destroyed transformer will have to be replaced by a new one.
She adds that in ten years of activity, the company <0xC4><0x8C>eps has not experienced anything similar and that incidents of this type are isolated.
Electricity supplies have not been disrupted, says <0xC4><0x8C>EZ company spokeswoman for North Bohemia So<0xC5><0x88>a Holingerova Hendrychova, the operation of homes, administrations and industries has not been influenced by the fire of the processing station.
A.s. <0xC4><0x8C>eps is the exclusive operator in the Czech territory of transmission sets and power lines of 400 kV and 220 kV.
It maintains, renovates and develops 39 distribution stations with 67 transformers transferring electrical energy from the transport assemblies to the distribution assemblies and lines with a length of 4,339 kilometers.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura to sue for defamation against three prefects of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD
Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura, owner of the Student Agency, will file a defamation lawsuit against three Democratic social prefects today.
And specifically against Michal Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek from the region of South Moravia, against Radko Martínka from the region of Pardubice and against the prefect of the region of Olomouc Martin Tesa<0xC5><0x99>ík.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura indicated it in Twenty Minutes of Radio <0xC5><0xBD>urnál.
The complaint relates to the company's attempt to operate regional railways in certain regions.
All regions, however, ended up signing long-term contracts with the Czech Railways.
All three have attacked us and claim that we are making the fine mouths, while we have only made an offer for what they wanted themselves.
They claim that we are more expensive than the Czech Railways, which is not true because we know the prices of the Czech Railways that were signed last week.
So all we have to do is defend ourselves.
This is in exchange for slander at the Student Agency company, Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura told Radio<0xC5><0xBE>urnál.
He also indicated that he had evidence that no region had acted in accordance with European law.
We are preparing a complaint to the European Commission.
Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek considers Mr. Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura’s complaint to be the continuation of his media show that serves as free advertising for his company and for his person.
I am of course willing to defend my name and the name of my region and I call on the other prefects to do the same.
I suppose this will be an opportunity to show clearly that it is precisely Mr. Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura who manipulates public opinion and resorts to false and false arguments about regional rail transport, says Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura already informed last week that he will invest a few million crowns in an advertisement that will mention the unfavourable actions of the regions.
He told Radio<0xC5><0xBD>urnál that he would interrupt the campaign after Christmas and that he would resume it after the New Year.
He said the campaign will target corruption in the broad sense.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura began its campaign after the regions agreed to entrust the Czech Railways with the operation of railway links for an order of about 150 billion crowns, without issuing tenders.
According to Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura, such a way of acting is illegal and contrary to the position of the European Court of Justice.
According to him, his criticism of rail transport in the regions even brought to Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura threats from a member of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD.
The only threat was that if we didn't stop, we could lose our bus licenses.
He presented himself as a member of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, I do not know who he is, but I will not say his name, Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura told Radio<0xC5><0xBE>urnál today.
Pneumococcal vaccination will be free and optional
Pneumococcal vaccination will reverse old habits as early as January.
It will be the first to be free and at the same time optional for families.
Voices are already rising, saying compulsory vaccination would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of free pneumococcal vaccination are culminating.
The Pharmaceutical Institute already sets the maximum prices for vaccines that health insurance will pay.
Specialists also see clearly in the vaccination process.
A new vaccination.
Free vaccines for children in August.
Since January, children born last year from August 2 can be vaccinated free of charge against pneumococcal disease.
The condition is that they have not yet been vaccinated.
If you started vaccination last year or earlier, you will have to pay for the following vaccinations yourself.
The first dose of the vaccine should be administered between the 3rd and 5th month of the child.
Last year, a quarter of families voluntarily vaccinated their children against pneumococcal disease.
However, the parents paid 1,600 crowns or more for a dose.
Vaccination of the youngest requires four doses.
Specialists estimate that every year health insurance spends 300 to 450,000 crowns in vaccine doses.
However, they save on the medical care that unvaccinated children would need.
So far, the state has spent about 500,000 crowns a year on all children's vaccinations.
The refunded vaccination was introduced with the "Janota package".
Pneumococcals are the cause of inflammation of the middle ear but also of serious infections including meningitis and blood poisoning.
According to investigations in hospitals, there are up to 28 deaths of children under the age of 10 caused by pneumococcal infections.
Aside from the Czech Republic, about 40 other countries have introduced the refunded vaccination.
Will vaccination be compulsory?
There are warnings about a possible vaccination obligation in the future.
Starting in January, it must be settled by insurance and optional.
For example, the president of the Nahlas Rudolf Kalovsk<0xC3><0xBD> association indicated that compulsory vaccination would be more positive.
Its association has long promoted the vaccination against pneumococcal diseases.
At an international conference in which our association participated, the specialists were not really satisfied with the fact that we have an optional vaccination.
It's not ideal.
On the other hand, we are pleased to have been able to impose at least this.
I think this is a direction that must now be followed, Kalovsk<0xC3><0xBD> said.
But the Ministry of Health does not want to change the pneumococcal vaccination process.
We are not considering it at all at the moment, said its spokesman Vlastimil Sr<0xC5><0xA1>e<0xC5><0x88>.
Optional vaccination has its drawbacks, doctors say.
Hana Cabrnochová, president of the Society of Paediatric Specialists, acknowledges that vaccination based on volunteerism is flawed.
If all the children were vaccinated, one could consider a reduction in the renewals of vaccinations "In the situation where the vaccine costs such a sum I understand the decision making the vaccination optional" says Cabrnochová, however.
Experts predict that as early as next year, more than 80 percent of new parents will have their babies vaccinated.
Pneumococcal vaccination marks a break also because it is the first vaccination of children that is funded by insurance and not the state.
Cabrnochová explains that insurance should release funds for prevention, thus saving on possible future medical care.
Doctors will have to buy their own products.
This is, however, related to the concerns of pediatric practitioners, who are concerned with the purchase of vaccines.
The original intention was to have the vaccines purchased by insurance companies, with doctors receiving them in the same way as other state-provided vaccine products.
Some MEPs, however, feared that this would allow insurance to "deduct the amounts from health insurance".
Thus, doctors will have to buy the products and wait for insurance to reimburse them.
According to estimates, pediatricians will have to individually invest nearly 40,000 crowns per month in vaccines, which is an important amount.
It's not going to be easy, according to Cabrnochová.
The son of an American artist involved in a "museum theft"
Frank Frazetta's son, a renowned illustrator, was accused of trying to steal paintings worth $20 million (<0xC2><0xA3>12 million) from his father's museum.
In Pennsylvania, police said Alfonso Frank Frazetta had been arrested while loading 90 paintings in his vehicle and in a trailer.
According to her, Mr. Frazetta and another man used a mechanical shovel to force the entrance to the museum, in the Pocono Mountains region.
Mr. Frazetta Senior, 81, is famous for his drawings of characters such as Conan the Barbarian and Tarzan.
At the time of the incident, the artist was in Florida, the Associated Press (AP) news agency reported.
AP cited a police official as saying the young Mr. Frazetta may have been motivated by a family dispute.
According to a police statement, Mr Frazetta Jr., 52, claims to have been authorized by his father to "enter the museum, by any means, to transport the paintings to a storage facility," the agency reported.
Mr. Frazetta Senior denied giving such an authorization, the agency said.
The Labour Party advocates the increase in the budget tax.
Ministers defended the tax increases and spending cuts announced in the pre-Budget report, despite criticism from the opposition, businesses and trade unions.
The Tories said Alistair Darling "missed" an opportunity to show that he was serious about reducing the deficit by postponing his decisions until after the election.
The Chancellor also drew attention to low wages and average wages.
Among its main proposals is a 0.5% increase in Social Security and a 1% cap on public wages from 2011 onwards.
The Anger of Social Security
Trade unions have protested that low wages are being penalized by a recession of which they are not responsible and warned that "problems" are being announced.
The decline in Social Security - which will get about <0xC2><0xA3>3 billion a year - has angered the business world, because it is, according to him, a tax on jobs while the goal should be a revival of the economy.
The increase, reserved for those earning more than <0xC2><0xA3>20,000 per year, will affect about 10 million workers.
PRINCIPAL POINTS OF THE PRE-BUDGET REPORT
Social Security will increase by 0.5% from April 2011
The economy will fall further than the expected 4.75% this year
New 50% tax on bankers bonuses
The increase in corporate income tax for small corporations has been abandoned
Discounts on taxes on electric cars and wind turbines
2.5% increase in pensions
According to Treasury estimates, a person who earns <0xC2><0xA3>30,000 will lose <0xC2><0xA3>90 per year and a person who earns <0xC2><0xA3>40,000 will lose <0xC2><0xA3>190, while a person who earns <0xC2><0xA3>10,000 per year will earn <0xC2><0xA3>110 more.
The ministers said their goal of halving the deficit by 2013 led to "difficult decisions" but insisted that 60% of the burden of additional taxes would weigh on the top 5% of employees.
Treasury Secretary Stephen Timms refuted a tax increase and stressed that a decrease in spending was a "drop in the ocean" compared to what was needed.
"These figures are important, they will allow us to double the deficit, which will be absolutely essential over the next four years," he told the BBC.
Mr. Timms said he was confident and that the growth of the economy would start again by the end of the year.
However, Labour's forecasts for economic growth - which will influence the amount it will have to borrow and the speed at which the deficit will be filled - have been questioned after the Chancellor was forced to revise his first figures.
In his speech, he said the economy would likely fall by 4.75% this year — much worse than the 3.5% decline predicted in April — while the borrowing would be 3 billion GDP higher than the previous estimate.
"Opportunity Missed"
The Conservatives, who will launch a new publicity campaign on Thursday warning against Labour's "debt crisis," said the plan to borrow <0xC2><0xA3>789 billion over the next six years was not viable.
The ministers failed to present a credible plan on how to repay, they added, "cynically" avoiding difficult choices until after the elections - which are due to take place in June 2010.
"They didn't present anything meaningful about what they were going to do," said Philip Hammond, Chief Secretary to the Ghost Cabinet Treasury. "They had the opportunity to do it and they missed it."
"Important announcements will be made after the election, regardless of the winner."
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labour insists that schools, hospitals and the police will be protected from further cuts, contrary to Tory proposals that would lead to a faster and more significant reduction in the deficit.
But the Lib Dems claimed that the money raised through tax increases and spending reductions would be used to support next year’s spending rather than to reduce the deficit, claiming that the plans were “built on wind.”
Nick Robinson, the BBC’s political editor, said the announcements’ schedule – such as the increase in inflation for certain disability benefits in April, mentioned above – would leave the Chancellor facing propaganda accusations, with the money simply recovered the following year.
However, Labour insists that additional assistance is being provided when people need it most and that the situation will be reviewed in September 2010.
"False budget"
Although ministers did not release details of spending beyond 2011, economists said it was clear that public spending restrictions would only begin to be felt in the medium term.
The highly respected Institute for Fiscal Studies has stated that the Chancellor's figures imply substantial reductions in the future in many areas, potentially including transportation, higher education, science and defence.
“The pain is actually only postponed,” said its Director, Robert Chote.
“The most important announcements will be made after the election, regardless of the winner,” added Roger Bootle, Economic Advisor to Deloitte’s accountants.
"This was a false pre-budget report. Markets are aware of it."
FBI Investigates "Arrests of Americans in Pakistan"
The FBI is investigating the arrest in Pakistan of five U.S. reporters suspected of extremist links.
The men were arrested during a raid on a house in Sarghoda in eastern Punjab province, the U.S. embassy in Pakistan told the BBC.
The FBI said it was investigating whether they were the same men who were reported missing from their home in the U.S. state of Virginia last month.
The U.S. Department of State said it was also looking for information about these people.
Three of them are presented as being of Pakistani descent, one of Egyptian heritage and the other of Yemeni origin.
If they are U.S. citizens, of course, we would like to know what the charges are against them and under what conditions they are detained," said spokesman Ian Kelly.
FBI spokeswoman Katherine Schweit said the agency was aware of the arrests and was in contact with the families of the missing students.
“We are working with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identity and the nature of their activities there, and whether it is really the students who are being reported missing,” she said.
The Pakistani embassy in Washington said the men had been arrested in a house owned by one of their uncles.
She said the house was already being monitored by local police and that no charges had yet been brought against the men arrested.
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton declined any comment on the arrests, the Reuters news agency reported, but she said the United States should "work more closely with Afghanistan and Pakistan to try to root out the infrastructure of terrorism that continues to recruit and train people."
The five students were reported missing from their homes by their families in North Virginia at the end of November.
Amnesty condemns "abuse" of Iranians
Human rights have been less respected than ever in the last 20 years, according to a report by Amnesty International.
The report presents "repetitions of violations" by the regime, before and after the June presidential election campaign.
One man quoted in the report claimed that he had been beaten and burned with cigarettes. Another said that he had been threatened with rape.
Iran has denied previous criticisms of its lack of respect for human rights.
Authorities said such criticism was politically motivated.
Thousands of people have been arrested and dozens killed in Iran after President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad’s contested election led to the largest public demonstrations since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Dozens have been sentenced to prison terms and prosecutors say at least five people have been sentenced to death.
Jon Leyne, a BBC correspondent in Tehran, now in London, says that at the beginning of the protests, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei acknowledged some of the allegations of abuse, ordering the closure of the Kahrizak detention center.
But since then, the authorities have not tolerated any criticism, our correspondent said.
"False Confession"
Amnesty International reported the case of a 26-year-old computer student, Ebrahim Mehtari, who claimed to have been accused of “working with Facebook networks” and protesting the election results.
“They often hit me in the face,” he was quoted as saying.
"I was burned with cigarettes, under my eyes, on my neck, on my head... They threatened to execute me and humiliated me."
After five days, he signed a false confession and was released and left in the street, still in blood and half-conscious, Amnesty said.
In August, the losing election candidate, Mehdi Karroubi, claimed that protesters detained after the election were tortured to death in prison and that others were raped.
The Iranian authorities denied the allegations of rape, but admitted that abuses had taken place.
Amnesty also cited the case of a former detainee who said he had been locked up in a container with 75 other people, for more than eight weeks, in a detention center in Kahrizak.
Amnesty has accepted that the Iranian Parliament and the judiciary set up a committee to investigate post-election disturbances and the government's response, but it has said the mandate and powers of these bodies were unclear and the results of the parliamentary committee had not been made public.
The group said at least 90 people had been arrested over the past three weeks in order to prevent further demonstrations.
Ski slopes built in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow has been used to turn the Bristol site into a competition track.
The Piste in the Park event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders competing for cash prizes.
At the top of the Brandon Hill Park track, a small springboard preceded a 100m long track.
John Hickman, a fourth-year medical student, said the view from the top of the track was beautiful but rather intimidating.
It is a beautiful view, with all the lights of the city shining down below.
Here are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the country – real talents,” he added.
Awards have rewarded the best turns - or figures made on the track.
After the party on Thursday night, the snow will be left to melt.
Always them and us

Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Some readers will be attracted by this new book, admirers of the author's last work, "Why the French don't like the scarf" (2006), an elegant and well-documented study on a problem that has divided and worried the country for about fifteen years and whose effects are still felt today.
Mr. Bowen’s latest book presents a much broader and more ambitious plot.
A good anthropologist, he not only wants to know what politicians and the media are saying about Islam in France, but what is currently happening in the country.
He spent many months in the mosques, schools and institutes that now provide in France what Mr. Bozen calls "Muslim spaces" for the 5m-6m Muslims.
He is very good at listening and reproducing the debates between teachers and students on the issues that concern them most.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or in the town hall (or both)?
Should the evolution and rights of homosexuals be taught to young Muslims?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim?
Can a Muslim use an interest-based banking system to get a loan?
It is these practical problems, he says, that are the daily batch, rather than the political dramas that concern the media.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, all unknown to the general public, except perhaps Tariq Ramadan, an Arab Muslim born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open the debate on how to be both a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They do not push the debate to the end.
Conservatives do not believe in the idea of a French or European Islam.
Intellectuals and activists who have been interviewed by Mr. Bowen generally agree with their counterparts advocates of a Sunni purist Islam associated with Saudi Arabia who today make up a small part of the Muslims of Europe.
Bowen believes that the values of Muslims and the secularism of the French could be compatible.
But a compromise can only be achieved with the efforts of each side.
He wonders how much French politicians (and the intellectual elite so virulently guarding secularism) are really committed to pluralism.
According to him, Muslims were not spoiled, compared to Catholics, Protestants and Jews who also had to make historical compromises with secular republicanism.
Rather than a growing pragmatism, it detects a “narrowness of key values.”
After reading this book, one is tempted to say "yes, but not yet."
The darkest view in the world
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than any other place on the planet.
The ice that composes it is melting at an alarming rate, taking with it a life that cannot survive elsewhere.
Oil, gas, shipping and fishing are navigating new open waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now writers in their wake.
In "On a thin layer of ice", Richard Ellis, writer and illustrator, paints a natural history of the symbol of the Great North, the polar bear.
A connoisseur of the history and complicated policies of whaling, he describes the long tradition of Arctic explorers who proved themselves by hunting the white bear.
The encounter with Admiral Nelson, then a brave 14-year-old aspiring man who had only the tip of his musket to fight, is certainly a myth, but the rest is true.
The young bears, caught swimming alongside their mother, just killed, were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
At the beginning of the 20th century, a famous show gathered 75 bears at the same time.
Even today, the size of a zoo is still generally a millionth of the area needed for a free adult. the climate is rarely indicated: a polar bear living in Singapore has become green because of the algae growing in its thick fur.

Mr. Ellis tells the stories of other writers and historians and often returns to the threat that hunters pose to the survival of species.
Although banned in Norway, America and Russia, killings continue in Greenland and Canada where helicopter fighters and Inuit motor-skiers use powerful assault rifles to hunt their game.
Ironically, it is in the northernmost waters of these two hunting nations that the ice will remain the longest.
In his new book, “After the Ice,” Alun Anderson, a former editor-in-chief of New Scientist, offers a clear and frightening summary of Arctic science and a captivating insight into what the future might be there.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospheric scientists nor oceanographers can accurately relate the speed of change.
It's not a mistake to try.
In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Fridtjof Nansen’s pioneering voyages gave the first information about the melting of the glacier.
The Cold War submarines then mapped the relief changes underneath it.
Satellite surveillance and probes placed on icebergs are of great help, but most of the work is done by hardened men, camping in the cold.
Mr. Anderson contemplates the extraordinary and tiny world of the arctic ice-dependent system, formed by freezing-pressed brine-water nets.
But from the bear mentioned above to the microscopic wonders contained in the ice, everything will be lost with the disappearance of summer ice, expected between 2013 and 2050.
“In a few months, maybe it’ll be our turn.”
Marines, among the 6,000 people who laid crowns on graves in Arlington
De'Angelo Robinson, 19, took a seven-hour bus ride to lay a simple crown on the grave of a soldier he had never met.
For him and for the other Marines who made the trip from Camp Johnson to Jacksonville, North Carolina, to Arlington National Cemetery to decorate the tombs, this day was dedicated to greeting the men and women who were once in their place.
In a few months, from where we will be sent, we risk being in their place, Robinson said of the fallen soldiers.
If that happened to me, I would want someone to do the same for me, that’s why I’m just trying to show respect.
He was one of 6,000 volunteers who gathered Saturday morning to lay crowns on the veterans' graves, in different sections of the Arlington Cemetery Ceremony.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, owner of the Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, launched the commemoration and others decided to decorate several hundred graves in the Arlington Ceremony cemetery.
Now, to continue an 18-year-old tradition, Morrill and his wife Karen travel each year, stopping in different cities on their way, to organize commemorations in honor of the military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a non-profit association, Wreaths Across America, which aims to promote the event in all other states.
This year, volunteers placed more than 16,000 crowns on the tombs of Arlington Cemetery, around the Pentagon, on the tombs of Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, in Battery Park in New York City, and on the site of the United Airlines Flight 93 Memorial in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second year in a row, the Walmart Foundation has donated more than $15,000 to purchase and transport the crowns.
Charleen Hunt, 70, of Westminster, said she made the trip to Arlington in honor of her husband, a late career soldier.
Although her husband is not buried in Arlington, Hunt said that for her, this gesture was a way to thank those who had sacrificed themselves.
It is a small gesture that civilians can make to support our troops, she said.
It's like visiting a family grave.
Embodied in several layers of warm clothing, the volunteers walked between the lawns and the extensive hills of the cemetery.
Volunteers chose ancient tombs, dating back to World War I and World War II, as well as the Vietnam War, as these are not visited as often as the new tombs, the organizers said.
The mood was optimistic, as children played and couples held hands, wearing fresh pine crowns on grey graves.
Each round crown had a dark green color, with a small red butterfly knot on top.
Close by, there was silence on Section 60, where most veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried.
The United Service Organizations gave 1,000 crowns to decorate the section but the dark mood of the current wars filled the area.
Some people cried without hiding, others prayed, and families and friends supported each other in the cold air.
Some read out loud the names engraved in the stone while others leaned to see the little black and white information cards, plunged into the wet earth for those whose tomb had not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many mothers in tears on her son's grave.
She left Zanesfield, Ohio and had driven eight hours to come to collect on the grave of Marine Sergeant GunneryDavid Shane Spicer, who died in combat in July.
No one should ever forget what makes us free...my son paid for it, she said.
"A long time after I'm gone, I want someone to remember him."
U.S. Citizen Arrested by Cuban Authorities
The Cuban government has arrested a U.S. citizen who was distributing mobile phones and laptops in the country, U.S. State Department services said.
The citizen, who has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc., based in Bethesda.
The company works on projects for clients such as the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
The consular authorities as well as the U.S. Interest Section in Havana are trying to gain access to the detainee who was arrested on December 5.
The specific accusations have not been made public, although under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor can be arrested on the pretext of being "dangerous".
All so-called revolutionary activities, including moderate protests and critical writings, entail the risk of arrest.
Anti-government graffiti and speeches are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has a growing community of bloggers, led by Yoani Sánchez, a popular commentator who often writes about how they are married and they are followed and harassed by government agents.
Sánchez has made several requests to leave the country to receive awards, but the authorizations have always been denied.
The detention of a U.S. citizen may increase tensions between the Communist Brotherhood government in Cuba and the Obama administration, which is pursuing a “sweet” approach to improving relations with the island.
The announcement of the arrest was first reported by the New York Times on Friday night.
The new U.S. policy insists that the Cuban government take concrete steps, such as releasing political prisoners and creating more space for the opposition, so that the U.S. can do the same.
Mobile phones and laptops are allowed in Cuba, although it is new and desirable consumer goods in a country or the average salary of a civil servant is $15 per month.
This year alone, the Cuban government granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones; they are mainly used for texting or for a 15-minute conversation that corresponds to a day’s pay.
On the island, the use of the Internet is extremely limited.
It is available in luxury hotels and for foreign visitors in the country, as well as in some government buildings, such as universities.
Cubans who want to connect often have to communicate their name to the government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
Detention of an American in Cuba is rare.
Most of the few Americans imprisoned in Cuba are behind bars for crimes such as drug trafficking, says Gloria Berbena, a press attaché with the U.S. Interests Section in Havana.
Berbena said she could not provide more information about the arrest.
Arrest and detention is a big mistake.
An activity that, in any other open society, would be allowed -- to distribute mobile phones for free -- is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, Director of the Americas program of the Human Rights Watch group, which recently published a severe report on freedoms in Cuba, called "New Castro, even Cuba", referring to the installation of Raúl Castro as a leader.
According to Vivanco, an accused is often arrested, tried and imprisoned on the same day.
He said that any solution would likely be political and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction to the United States, at a time when the two countries are starting a better dialogue.
Pakistani authorities prevent plot to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday, Pakistani authorities spotted an organization allegedly plotting to send five men from North Virginia to Afghanistan to kill U.S. troops, saying they hoped the case would dismantle a large network of terrorist recruiters who search the Internet for radicalized young men.
Investigators said they were chasing a hidden insurgent personality, known as Saifullah, who invited these men to Pakistan after discovering them when one of them made comments approving the terrorist waves on the YouTube video site on the Internet.
Arriving in Pakistan, these men were guided by Saifullah who tried to help them reach the remote region of Pakistan's tribal belt, home to al-Qaida and its terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani intelligence official who was informed of the case said Saturday that Saifullah had failed to convince al-Qaeda commanders that these men were not involved in the CIA’s plot to infiltrate the terrorist network.
As a result, they have been isolated for days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the forbidden mountains of the northeast, and have become a refuge from terrorism.
They were seen as infiltrators.
That is why they were rejected, said a representative of the authorities who expressed the condition of anonymity due to the confidentiality of the case.
The representative of the authorities stated that the men were determined and were still trying to obtain the necessary authorizations to enter the al-Qaida camps when they were arrested by Pakistani law enforcement.
The case of these five men -- who remain in Pakistan and are questioned by the FBI -- emphasizes the crucial role of recruiters in identifying potential terrorists, and perhaps more importantly, in determining who to trust.
Since the September 11, 2001 attacks, U.S. intelligence services have prioritized infiltrating men into the al-Qaida network.
The organization's recruiters play the role of barrier guards, refusing entry to those who do not show serious commitment and those who may turn out to be spies.
According to analysts, potential U.S. recruits are being studied closely by al-Qaeda.
But they are also very attractive to the group because of their potential access to U.S. targets and their propaganda value.
However, Evan Kohlmann, an expert at the US-based NEFA Foundation, said terrorist groups also need to pay more and more attention in recent years in choosing the people they accept because the US intelligence services have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you’re trying to infiltrate someone into these groups, what better way than to follow their recruitment pattern than so many other people have already followed?
The model is the one that is increasingly on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of protesters in Copenhagen call for "action" for climate change
Tens of thousands of protesters took to the streets here on Saturday, calling for more climate action from negotiators working at the city’s Bella Convention Center.
The number of protesters was estimated at 100,000, but 25,000 according to police estimates.
The event took place relatively peacefully, although a small number of masked activists lit some explosives near a set of government buildings in downtown.
On this day when little has happened during the UN-sponsored climate talks, thousands of activists marched through the city, deploying banners in English saying "There is no planet B" and one in Spanish, declaring "The Earth says it's done."
Several celebrities joined the protests, including Danish top model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said that traveling to her mother’s home country, Peru, opened her eyes to the tearful problems facing the country due to the impact of climate change that is already occurring.
That’s one of the reasons I’ve decided to join the big march — to pass the word and call on leaders around the world to make fair, ambitious and committed decisions,” she said.
It is not an easy task, but it must be undertaken, it is no longer possible to avoid it.
Police prevented protesters from getting too close to Bella Center and said they had arrested 19 people on the grounds that they were wearing a mask or were in possession of pocket knives.
Police prevented protesters from getting too close to Bella Center and said they had arrested 19 people on the grounds that they were wearing a mask or were in possession of pocket knives.
According to a passer-by who asked to remain anonymous because of his involvement in climate discussions, activists wearing black masks and clothes lit several explosives near Copenhagen’s main canal, which is surrounded by several ministries.
They were throwing them near buildings, he said, adding that these were first rockets, followed by "some big explosions".
Inside the Palace of Congress, people gathered around television screens to follow the march, throughout the afternoon.
But it seems that the protesters failed to awaken the consciousness of key authorities such as China’s climate representative Su Wei.
When asked if he thought a demonstration would have a positive impact on international deliberations, he replied in English, “In fact, it’s something I wasn’t aware of.
He then continued in Mandarin, declaring "Because the event is important, I can't hear what's going on outside."
He observed that walking might seem harmful or useful from the perspective.
It shows the interest of the general public and different sectors on the subject of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "you can also say that they disrupt negotiations or that they harm the freedom of others."
Test Results Reveal Persistent Differences Between Races
Last week’s federal report on math results brought good news for Washington D.C. public schools.
Although the District still lags far behind head offices, the report shows that Grade 4 and Grade 5 (cm1-cm2) have made much greater progress over the past two years than in cities such as Atlanta, Chicago, and New York.
But what emerges from the latest figures of the National Assessment of Educational Progress is the persistent gap between the results of African Americans and whites, both locally and nationally.
The average scores of Grade 4 (cm1) white children in Washington D.C. have increased, over the past two years, from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), but those of their African-American classmates have only increased by three points, from 209 to 212.
The success gap actually increased between 2007 and 2009, from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of African Americans in Grade 8 (4th) generally remains steady, dropping only by one point, from 245 to 244.
The average white score was not included in the test results because the sample was not large enough.
The overall view over a six-year period is no more encouraging.
In 2003, the gap between blacks and whites in Grade 4 class (cm1), when the District's first NAEP report was published, was 60 points (262 to 202).
Although the results obtained by the children in both groups increased during this period, the difference only decreased to 58 points.
Last week, some defenders in the District expressed concern that the increase celebrated by the group's head of educational institutions Michelle A. Rhee and the Mayor, Adrian M. Fenty (Democratic) were driven by white students who were already good elements.
This would mean that we raised the aggregate by considering the elements at the top of the scale, which is problematic and annoying, said Jeff Smith, Director of D.C. Voice, a nonprofit group that advocates equality in District education.
I don’t jump for joy for one or two points won, said Kwame R. Brown, a fellow Democrat, a D.C. Board member whose daughter is in Grade 4, at Eaton Elementary.
Often critical of Rhee’s management style, Brown said the message from the test results is that the city’s middle schools (colleges) desperately need attention.
Really, you always want to see the positive signs and I respect that.
But what’s scary is that we don’t devote enough time and energy to our middle schools.
Rhee said the District needed to continue to find better ways to meet the needs of students in difficulty.
This fall, for example, some teachers were trained to use a new method of reading, the Wilson Reading System, aimed at elementary and early-college schoolchildren who did not incorporate the basics of reading earlier in their schooling and who are quite late compared to their peers.
Every day, the math program, for grade 6 (6th) Kindergarten classes, focuses on real-life games and experiences, as they were set up in the District by former head Clifford Janey, who is also to be credited for the progress of NAEP reported last week.
I simply think we need to continue to work to deliver better interventions to these lower-class students, Rhee said.
Others believe that NAEP's results raise the question of whether Rhee can continue to raise overall system results while providing the money and resources for schools with less good results to reduce the gap.
This is a dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a teaching trainer at the University of Berkeley in California who studies the results of city tests.
The conventional policy solution is to dedicate your resources and management reforms to schools located in Washington’s poorest neighborhoods.
Therefore, this targeting can have political repercussions that hamper this important program.
But the problem, of course, is that like other Superintendents of schools, she tries to use the middle class of whites and blacks.
We focus on ensuring the development of a system of good schools.
We need to strengthen our neighborhood schools so that all families, no matter where they come from, can be assured that their children will be able to get excellent public education.
Janey, now Superintendent of Newark Schools, said in an interview this week that one of the key elements to reducing the success gap was the duration of the traditional public school, now 180 days in the Washington District, to be in competition with Charter Schools.
It takes about 200 days to have the strength to change, said Janey, who came to an agreement with his teachers' union last year to get 185 days, which he considers a "starting point" to get another raise in the next contract.
Making Higher Education a Promise for the Future
The bus stopped in Gettysburg College with a long whistle.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, comes down and blinks a moment at the sight of the white columns, brick facades and green lawns.
Graciela’s parents had only been able to finish high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a university campus.
Also, while she and other Grade 8 (4th) students from the group explored Gettysburg where tuition fees are $38,690 a year, her attitude was less that of an impressed new student than enthusiastic.
"That's where I'm going to study!" exclaimed Graciela, who wanted to study medicine, as the guide guided them to the entrance of the Science Building.
Youpi, really? she said, thinking, when she was referred to the low ratio law teacher-student.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh that the children visited during their three-day discovery trip and now they had fully embedded the message: The question is not whether you go to university:
The question is where.
Although this question still arises widely for the large number of American children born to Hispanic immigrant parents who left high school where they became parents in adolescence, they are also hundreds of thousands to benefit from university education that will allow them to enter the middle class.
In fact, "one in five Hispanics in the 'second generation' pursues high school studies -- a remarkable success given that so many of their immigrant parents, most of them from Mexico or Central America, entered the United States without having completed high school.
Their success is important, say the researchers, they are paving the way for the next generations who will play an important role in the country's workforce.
The researchers who study the batters claim that they have a natural affinity with school and an innate need to succeed.
Many are also those whose parents set high goals for their children and who find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
Mentoring programs also play a very important role in helping Graciela and millions of children like her get to college -- especially if her efforts are regular and long-term.
When you look at children from low-income families with parents who do not have the experience and skills to help them navigate the system, any intervention, at any time, will not help them, said Patricia Gándara, a researcher at Davis, University of California, who studied Latin American students.
We need to think about providing a support network for these children, from kindergarten to high school.
The federal program that funded the visit to Graciela universities is a good example.
Known as GEAR UP, it provides more than $300 million a year to local school systems to organize university preparation programs that begin when low-income family students are in middle school and continue through to the end of high school years.
Since 1999, the program has been followed by more than 10 million students, with more than 60 percent entering university, according to the U.S. Department of Education.
Iraqi Oil Ministry Gets Deals With 10 Foreign Oil Companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government managed to attract major oil companies to rebuild its struggling infrastructure during two auctions that ended Saturday.
The 10 agreements reached by the Iraqi Ministry of Oil with foreign oil companies suggest that oil companies from China, Russia and Europe are about to play a major role in the restoration of Iraq's oil industry, invalidated by decades of war and sanctions.
U.S. companies are departing with a stake in only two of the 10 auctioned fields.
Seven U.S. companies had paid to participate in the second auction that began on Friday.
The only one who put up an auction lost.
Two U.S. companies won contracts for the fields auctioned in June.
The low representation of U.S. oil giants in the opening of the oil sector in Iraq surprised analysts.
Iraq has finally opened its doors, after six years of war, and instead of American companies, Asian and European companies are opening the way, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum, an Internet news site.
It will take a long time before another offer is made in Iraq.
Security concerns, corroborated by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday, and political instability as U.S. military troops retreated have hampered U.S. oil companies, preventing them from entering Iraq with more force, which has the world’s third-largest crude oil reserves, analysts say.
U.S. companies were, in some cases, disadvantaged due to their rivals, especially Chinese and other government-controlled energy companies, whose labor costs were significantly lower and were more willing to take risks because they did not have to report to shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only U.S. companies to obtain contracts with the Department.
Major U.S. companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which have maintained strong ties with the Iraqi oil ministry and have provided it with their technical advice, have left empty-handed.
Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the two main shareholders in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The state-owned Chinese National Petroleum Corp. has auctioned more contracts than other companies and is releasing significant stakes in contracts for two main fields.
We all know that China is becoming a major economy, as well as a technological power, said Assam Jihad, a spokesman for the Ministry of Petroleum.
We are confident that the Chinese company will be on an equal footing with its competitors and will fulfil its commitments in Iraq.
The companies pre-selected to bid made bids that were then compared to the per barrel rate that the department agreed to pay to motivate production above current levels for each field.
One of al-Qaida's main organizers was reportedly killed in Pakistan.
It appears that a US missile, which struck along the border with Afghanistan, killed one of the organizers of al-Qaida operations this week, U.S. counter-espionage authorities said on Friday.
If the information is confirmed, this would be the second deadly attack against one of the terrorist leaders this fall.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arab men suspected of being killed by a pair of missiles fired at their car on Tuesday near the town of Miran Shah in North Waziristan province, according to U.S. sources and Pakistani authorities in the region.
Local authorities said the missiles were fired by an unmanned plane of the CIA type used inside Pakistan’s anarchist tribal border.
They were driving a white car heading towards the Afghan border when the car was hit, a Pakistani civilian intelligence official said, speaking on Miran Shah's phone.
Officials said the suspected local activists rushed to the scene and quickly confiscated what remained of the "totally shattered bodies".
It was utterly impossible for local authorities to verify the identities of the victims, but the two U.S. counter-terrorism representatives provided unspecified evidence that Somalia was among the dead.
Somali was described as one of the al-Qaida military organizers who led the group's terrorist operations outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
Its role was to organize plots around the world, said one of the authorities who wished to remain anonymous, citing the sensitive nature of the air strikes inside Pakistani territory.
Given its central role, this probably included conspiracies of attacks against the United States and Europe.
He followed the strategic instructions of al-Qaida leaders and translated them into action plans for possible terrorist attacks.
A second U.S. official said Somalia had made rapid progress in the ranks of al-Qaeda and had very good relations with other extremist groups in the region.
It may not be known to the general American public, but that does not diminish the threat it poses to us and our allies, the second official spokesman said.
If his death is confirmed, Somali would be the second major al-Qaida figure or the second Taliban leader killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, leader of a faction of militants in the tribal belt, as well as three other operators.
The pace of attacks by CIA drones has declined since the summer, from about six operations per month to two, according to figures provided by the Long War Journal, a website moderated by a nonprofit group.
This decline may be due to improved tactics by terrorist groups that have stepped up to reduce their vulnerability while also ruthlessly killing suspected whistleblowers, the site says.
UN Special Envoy in Kabul withdraws
UN Special Envoy to Afghanistan Kai Eide said on Friday he would step down in March, at the end of a tumultuous term stained with widespread corruption allegations during the UN-backed presidential election.
Eide’s departure comes as the Obama administration has decided to send 30,000 additional troops to Afghanistan.
The U.N. envoy said he supported the increase but expressed concern about the U.S. schedule for a troop withdrawal that would begin in 18 months and would force other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the development of our security forces in Afghanistan, send the right signal to the Afghans and remind them that they can trust the international community, Eide said in a phone interview in Kabul.
Our commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international officials helping the political transition in Afghanistan.
The military increase must be copied by civilians, he said.
Eide said he would not resign but would simply honor the commitment he made to his family in March to spend only two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to warn the United Nations.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon now knows he has time to find a replacement.
“I just said it’s best to start looking for my replacement,” Eide said.
When I came here, there was a two-month gap between my predecessor’s departure and my arrival.
According to UN officials, Ban has already started looking for a replacement.
Representatives say the name Staffan di Mistura has been cited; it is an Italian-Swiss citizen who recently chaired a UN mission in Baghdad and Jean-Marie Guehenno, a Frenchman who previously led UN peacekeeping operations.
Eide’s reputation in Afghanistan was put to the test after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, accused him in September of favoring President Hamid Karzai during the presidential election and concealing evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide denied these allegations but said Galbraith's accusations -- who were thanked -- "have been detrimental to the mission as there was already a good dose of skepticism regarding international observation of elections."
Eide said he had proposed the appointment of a civilian representative to coordinate the relief of U.S. forces in Afghanistan.
He also urged UN officials to allow his successor to hire more personnel from the United States and other Western countries than is assigned to the mission in Afghanistan, saying that this would give them more confidence in how their money is spent.
Eide expressed his frustration about the limits of his powers in Afghanistan, saying that heavy UN hiring regulations were hampering his ability to bring in new talent.
The UN rules are such that I have been able to recruit only one person since May, he said.
It's catastrophic and it can't last.
Gates: Iran must face additional sanctions
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said on Friday that the world's major powers would soon impose "important additional sanctions" on Iran due to its inability to engage in talks on nuclear ambitions.
Gates, speaking in front of a 300-strong U.S. troop base in northern Iraq, during a week-long visit to war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, dedramatized the possibility of military action against the Islamic Republic.
There is no good option in Iran, he said, in response to a soldier’s question about the possibility of such an end.
One of the things that weighs on me the most is that if I’ve learned something in Iraq over the last six years, it’s the unpredictable side inherent in war.
The Obama administration is considering a set of sanctions that would target Iran’s military and political elite, but Gates said some of those sanctions could also affect Iranians on the street.
He said a "set of motivations and punishments" might be needed to persuade the Iranian government that it would actually be less secure with nuclear weapons" because "his people would suffer enormously" from these sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement by White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the administration joined European leaders in a warning that Iran will face "probable" consequences if it does not bring its nuclear program back in full compliance with the UN Security Council and its monitoring body.
Iran continues to say that it wants to develop its nuclear experiment only for a peaceful purpose.
In the Geneva talks on 1 October, he indicated that he would resume dialogue on reducing his nuclear program and agreed to abandon a significant portion of its enriched uranium storage, in exchange for fuel desperately needed for a medical research reactor.
The administration has pushed for such an agreement, a way to build trust on both sides and save time for negotiations.
Since then, Iran appears to have drifted away from attempts at a deal — in part, experts say, because Iranian leadership is divided on whether or not to engage with the United States.
Frankly, in my opinion, Iran's stiffening in the face of some of the international community's proposals for which they had actually given their agreement in early October, has pushed the international community, including Russians and Chinese, to join in what they had not considered, in terms of additional significant sanctions against Iranians, said.
President Obama set December 31 as a deadline for Iran to respond to the proposals, before turning to other options, including pursuing what Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called “increased sanctions.”
In a statement Thursday in New York, Iran's mission to the United Nations denounced what it called "unfounded allegations" by some members of the Security Council on Iran's nuclear activities and said it agreed to continue talks with the United States and five other major global powers, "to achieve a satisfactory long-term solution".
Gates, who was due to return to Washington late Friday, met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki in the morning before boarding a plane to the rich oil region of Kurdish to meet troops in Kirkuk, Kurdish and Irbil.
Tensions persist between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq, particularly with regard to borders, property rights and income sharing.
Gates urged both sides to reduce the potential conflict to avoid any delays in U.S. plans to reduce U.S. troops from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
U.S. officials quoted Gates as saying to Massoud Barzani, president of Kurdistan’s regional government: “We will preserve your security, your prosperity and your autonomy within a unified Iraq.”
We will not abandon you.”
In aging China, a change of direction
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters telling them, "Mother Earth is too tired to accommodate more children" and "An extra baby is an extra grave."
They learned the lesson so well that the Shanghai government authorities, alarmed by the inadequate birth rate of their city and the aging population, radically changed direction this summer and began encouraging young couples to have more than one child; their reaction was instantaneous and firm: never.
We have already given all our time and all our energy to one child.
We have no second left, said Wang, 31, Director of Human Resources and who has an 8-month-old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the single child policy in China, creating two generations of unique children notoriously with good cheeks and spoiled, dubbed the "little emperors", a population crisis threatens the country.
According to the UN, the average birth rate fell by 1.8 children per couple compared to six when the policy was implemented.
The distribution of the population, while the number of residents aged 60 and over is expected to explode, from 16.7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 percent in 2050. This figure is well above the overall average of about 20 percent.
This imbalance is even worse in rich coastal cities with a highly educated population, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and over represented nearly 22 percent of the population of registered residents in Shanghai, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of the Shanghai Municipal Population and Family Planning Commission, said that fertile couples should have babies in order to “help reduce the proportion of the aging population and prevent a shortage of labor in the future.”
Shanghai is about to become “as old – but not as rich, however – as developed countries such as Japan and Sweden,” she said.
Progressive mitigation
Written in the country's constitution in 1978, China's single-child policy is, to date, undoubtedly the most controversial obligation introduced by the Communist government.
Couples who violate this policy may have to pay colossal fines -- up to three times their annual income -- and face discrimination in the workplace.
The Chinese authorities have given the police the duty to help the country avoid a dangerous trend for its natural resources, while human rights lawyers have denounced abuses in the implementation of this policy.
In rural areas, some authorities have forced pregnant women with a second child to have an abortion.
In addition, many couples have resorted to selective abortions leading to an abnormally high boys-girl ratio.
In recent years, the authorities responsible for the population have gradually softened their position on the single child policy.
In 2004, they granted more exceptions to the rule -- including for city residents, members of ethnic minorities, and cases where men and women are already single children -- and in 2007 they softened many of their harsh slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute of Population Research at Beijing University, said central government authorities recently discussed even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the partners is an only child.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage births.
In no time, posters encouraging families to have only one child were replaced by copies of retail regulations that have the right to have a second child and how to apply for authorization.
The city government has sent family planning officials and volunteers to meet couples, at their homes, and slip prospectuses under their doorsteps.
He also promised to provide psychological and financial advice to those who would like to have more than one child.
According to the head of family planning, the answer was disappointing.
Disappointing response
Although officials in a rural Shanghai suburban city say they saw an increase in file requests for couples wishing a second child after the campaign launched, the more urban district reported that there was no change.
The municipality of Huinan, with a population of 115,000, for example, still receives only four to five requests per month.
Shanghai officials, disappointed, say that despite the campaign, the number of births in the city in 2010 is still expected to be only about 165,000 -- slightly higher than 2009 but lower than 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee in Shanghai’s Caolu municipality, said financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people don’t want to have more children.
They want to provide for their first child, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said they would love to have two children and are legally allowed to do so.
But like many Chinese, they only have the minimum health insurance and life insurance provided by the government.
Without social protection, they say, the decision would be irresponsible.
Westerners mistakenly believe that single-child policy is a rights issue, said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is seven months pregnant with the couple’s first child.
It's true, we're being robbed of the chance to have more than one child.
But the problem is not just the law.
It's the money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons to explain their hesitation.
Wang, Human Resources Manager, said she only wanted a single child because she was one of her own. "We were the center of the family and we used to have everyone taking care of us."
We don’t have the habit of taking care of someone else and we really don’t want to take care of others.”
Chen Zijian, 42 years old and owner of a translation company, says this more crudely.
For middle-class couples working in pairs, who lower the birth rate, he says, you have to be selfish in order to succeed.
People in their 20s or 30s grew up watching their parents fight in the early days of capitalist China and don’t want to have that lifestyle themselves, he says.
Even a single child demands a lot of time from his parents, he says.
A mother must give up at least two years of her social life.
Then there are the space problems -- "You need to change your apartment" -- and the planning -- "When your child is only 9 months old, you need to write his resume to get a place in the best kindergarten."
Most of his friends are ready for this experience once, Chen says, but not two.
Our generation is the first to benefit from a higher standard of living, he says.
We don’t want to make too many sacrifices.
The United Nations group has plans for emission reductions
The UN-sponsored climate conference -- so far characterized by disorganized assignments and mutual recriminations -- came back under the spotlight on Friday, due to the publication of a document highlighting the next ambitious reductions in greenhouse gases over the next 40 years, with most industrialized nations lagging behind.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases, highlighted the remaining obstacles, as much as it shed light on the path to take.
But it has been seen as a major breakthrough in the time-consuming negotiations, with more than 100 leaders from around the world arriving in Copenhagen next week.
Written by a UN ad hoc working group, the text does not say how much wealthy countries would give to the poor to cope with global warming, in the current and long term.
And it offers a wide range of options for key issues, including how developed economies and new emerging economies could reduce their carbon production and what would be the upper limit of the global temperature rise that those in charge would be willing to tolerate.
It gives great flexibility to the process, said John Coequyt, Representative to Washington from the Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who wrote six pages of the document, studied a 180-page negotiating text to focus on what the UN’s Executive Secretary-General on climate change, Yvo de Boer, described as the “full picture.”
It sets out the guidelines for a possible agreement in which industrial nations would collectively reduce their emissions in 2020 from 25 to 45 per cent compared to 1990 levels, while major developing countries would, during the same period, reduce theirs from 15 to 30 per cent.
Together, countries would reduce emissions by 50-95 percent by 2050.
The European Union also relaunched negotiations on Friday, promising to provide $3.6 billion a year over the next three years to help poorer countries adapt to the impacts of climate change -- to cope with floods and drought or to avoid deforestation.
However, on Friday, the same verbal altercations occurred, which have dominated the negotiations since last week.
U.S. Climate Negotiation Representative Todd Stern rejected any discussion requiring the reduction of greenhouse gases by industrialized countries, compared to the voluntary efforts made by major emerging economies, if these were not funded by developed countries.
This change is a signal that the Obama administration is becoming harder on China than the Bush administration was two years ago.
The United States will not sign an agreement without the efforts and actions of major developing countries, Stern said, who also regretted that the text does not insist enough to ensure that the cuts could be verified by external observers.
Stern made his comments an hour after China's deputy foreign minister, He Yafei, said the US chief negotiator, either lacking "reasonable" or was "extremely irresponsible" for saying earlier this week that the United States would not financially help China fight climate change.
With the future economic trajectories of the major world powers at stake, flaws have emerged both within the third world and between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current battle is more about saving individual economies than saving the planet, with China and the United States arguing about their respective obligations while the poorer nations insist that the two dozen most influential countries ignore the scientific imperatives to act more courageously.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said it was not surprising that major powers were fighting to know who should suffer the costs of reducing greenhouse gases, even though vulnerable countries had become more aggressive in their attempt to hold big emitters accountable for their actions.
It is really a game in which a new economic hegemony is developed, said Ulate, who is also Climate Advisor for Mexico and Central America for International Conservation.
Some of these countries more vulnerable to the impacts of climate change have indicated that they will continue to put pressure to obtain a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although most major participants say negotiations will lead to at least a political agreement.
The Alliance of Small Island States, which has 43 members, drafted a 24-page treaty early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, head of the European Commission’s climate unit, said the actions of the small island states “put political pressure on the complete political process,” partly because they are now unified and are calling on emerging economies such as China and India to take action.
Debates became an urgent matter, as delegates focused on resolving most of the issues before the heads of government reached an agreement.
High-level officials such as the Indian Environment Minister, Jairam Ramesh, and the Chinese Deputy Minister got off their plane and rushed into the Bella Center building to attend closed-door meetings and news conferences, so that they could make claims that will be studied during the following week.
The real picture of the rally -- in which 13,000 people come and go from the Palace of Congress every day -- guitarist activists present night shows mocking countries they believe are betraying themselves and that proposals are written and distributed on paper rather than by email -- is a real challenge.
The intensity is only increasing: almost all important ministers are here and no later than Wednesday, 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen.
We are entering the grand court, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, Vice President for Global Policy at Conservation International.
The heavy weights are coming.
In Britain, the first train at 225 km/h will redefine Monday’s syndrome
At 5:13 a.m. on Monday morning, a whistle will blow through the night to signal the departure of a train that will mark a transport revolution in Britain.
The country's first high-speed suburban train will reach 225 km/h, as it runs from Ashford, Kent, to London St Pancras, covering 93 km in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Minister of Transport, will be joined by Dame Kelly Holmes aboard the first Javelin suburban train outside London.
He hopes the new service will allow Britain to integrate an international network of fast and reliable trains and connect the major Midlands, North and Scotland conurbations to London.
The small lost holes will become thriving suburban cities, the durations of business trips will be much shorter and the passage of the plane and car to the train will reduce national carbon emissions while reducing traffic jams on the roads.
In theory, the three main political parties adhere to this project.
But the <0xC2><0xA3>10 billion needed to build a new rail network, the inevitable planning battle, and fears of environmental hazards risk damaging Britain’s high-speed lines.
According to The Times, High Speed Two (HS2), a company set up in January to produce a feasibility report for the government, will return its document to Lord Adonis on December 30.
This will allow it to obtain a detailed map of the route of the next step planned for the high-speed network.
The new line connecting London to the West Midlands will be drawn within five meters of the urban area and sites where environmental impacts can be controversial.
In the countryside, the plan will be drawn up to 25 meters from the final route.
It is also planned that HS2 presents three options for a larger high-speed network, going north.
Lord Adonis will respond in the spring.
The preferred options are highlighted in a Y configuration for which a high-speed line will go all the way to the West Midlands.
The line will split in two to or near Birmingham, with one branch going west of the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and another going northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line will cross Scotland.
"It looks like it's going to be the best performance option," said a rail professional.
When completed, the travel time between London and Edinburgh will be reduced to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first branch, which will not open until 2025, will allow all passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to a current one-hour journey.
The proposals will allow the train to travel at 400km/h, making the British network the fastest in the world.
The initial route is designed to allow trains 400m long and able to carry 1100 people.
Up to 18 trains per hour can operate from London to Birmingham.
A terminal that can accommodate 20,000 passengers per hour would be needed.
Given the constraints of space, it is expected that an existing station will be expanded to receive the network at high speed.
Experts in the rail industry say that only St Pancras International or Euston offer this possibility.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not he believes the project should be implemented, but longer public consultations and planning procedures mean that a final decision will not be made before a general election.
Even if it launches the machine, the network will have to be built part by part.
Trains will first be forced to roll off high-speed lines on existing rails north of Birmingham, retaining journey times between London and Scotland of more than three hours.
This seems to be the best solution to ensure a transition from aircraft to trains, constituting a reference point for the rail revolution.
Taxpayers Repay <0xC2><0xA3>75,000 Loan for Tory Orangery
Alan Duncan, a leading Tory MP, paid the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year to reimburse the cost of an orangery he built in his home in his constituency.
The party leader, who was downgraded by David Cameron for complaining that members of parliament were “entertained,” increased his loan by <0xC2><0xA3>75,000 to build an oak extension to his second home in Rutland.
He had been allowed to pay extra interest, amounting to hundreds of pounds per month, to the taxpayer.
The Commons authorities received the complaints at the time and were not questioned by Sir Thomas Legg, who conducts a check on members' expenses. Last night, Duncan said that the complaints could not be "clearer or simpler".
Mr. Duncan, one of the wealthiest members of parliament, owns a two-storey house in a village in his Rutland - Melton constituency.
The neighboring houses were sold for nearly a million pounds.
The ground floor includes a kitchen, living room and dining room, but the Emoluments Office says Mr. Duncan needed more space.
Last year, he added a veranda to the house, describing it in his plans as an orange grove.
Neighbors describe it as a "veranda for pleasure".
Mr. Duncan was not asked to provide an explanation for the increase in borrowing during a recent investigation by the Committee on Privileges and Standards of the Commons regarding his provisions on pre-borrowing.
The Committee acquitted him last month of any allegations of non-compliance after an investigation into his expenses.
In 2004, Mr. Duncan changed the legal security of the GBP 271,406 loan from his London property to the home of his constituency he purchased in 1991, the year before becoming a member of parliament.
Documents released this week show that Mr. Duncan claimed about <0xC2><0xA3>1,400 per month of borrowing interest until March last year.
In April, its demands increased by more than <0xC2><0xA3>1,800 per month.
The interest rate on Mr. Duncan's RBS loan was unchanged at that time, suggesting that all increases were intended to fund the GBP 75,000 loan.
The standard variable interest rate RBS rose from 7.94 percent in December 2007 to 4 percent in March this year, without moving ever since.
The latest publication by the Commons authorities shows that Mr. Duncan continued to demand <0xC2><0xA3>1,250 in May.
Duncan lost his position as head of the ghost office in September after a covert journalist filmed him declaring that members of parliament had to survive "on budget" after the spending scandal.
In fact, it's now national, you have to live "on budget" and you're treated like "of the m...e"
He said: "I spent my money on my garden and asked for a small part, based on what was right.
I could have asked for more, but I didn’t.”
The member of parliament, a millionaire since his former position as an oil negotiator, began having to explain his spending in May after it appeared that he had asked for thousands of pounds for his garden, before agreeing with the expenses office that this "could be considered excessive".
An activist dug a <0xC2><0xA3>1 hole in M. Duncan’s lawn in protest after it was revealed he had asked for <0xC2><0xA3>4,000 for three years.
Asked about the increase in borrowing last night, Mr. Duncan said, "It was for major improvements, approved both by the Fee Office and by Legg."
He added: “There is no problem of stealing or drafting or using the rules or anything.
It was quite clear, in the rules, authorized, etc.
It couldn’t have been cleaner or simpler.”
Believers, come and see the calendar of Brighton Advent
Brighton Beach Cabins have found a new way to promote the winter months, an interactive Advent calendar.
Beyond, an alternative church group that encourages spiritual exploration through creativity, invited 24 owners to decorate their cabin for each December day, using as a theme Christmas songs.
The event began on 1 December, when visitors were allowed to visit the last cabin, from 5:30 p.m. to 6:30 p.m., every day, with pasta and hot wine served free of charge.
The Christmas songs chosen so far include "I Saw Three Ships, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel and The First Christmas", for which the cabin features the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a Hove TV marketing assistant, is an unpaid priest from the Diocese of Chichester and Director of Beyond.
He said: “We want religion to be closer to people in a post-Christian society.
"As a Church, why do we expect people to enter an old strange building? It seems to me that the Church should get closer to people and celebrate in a more captivating way.
"The idea of the Advent calendar from the beach cabin came right after a conversation with a few friends, during a dinner.
Brighton is such a creative and vibrant place and we try to experience and represent that through spirituality.”
Strong mobilisation in Copenhagen and around the world for climate change
Tens of thousands of people marched on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding agreement on combating global warming, around the world and in Copenhagen, where police conducted several hundred arrests.
At least thirty thousand people, according to the police, a hundred thousand according to the organizers, paraded in the cold in the Danish capital, on the margins of the United Nations Climate Conference, charged with reaching by Friday an agreement that could enter into force on January 1, 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, Danish president of the climate conference, the growing mobilization on climate around the world, illustrated by these demonstrations, helped make “the political price” of a failure in Copenhagen very high.
Incidents in the Danish capital occurred shortly after the march left, when a group of 300 protesters, all dressed in black, broke windows with pavements and hammers, an AFP journalist said.
Anti- riot police immediately intervened without any preparation.
In total, the police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people, mainly members of the "Black Blocs", these ultra-violent groups that were illustrated in particular at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, in April.
The Climate Justice Action Coalition (CJA), one of the organizers of the protest, denounced the conditions under which hundreds of activists were detained "without distinction", stressing that a hundred of them "were still held in the street on Saturday night" and "minted and kept in an extremely cold position in spite of the protest."
Parliament party, the rather good kid, took the lead of the Bella Center, the negotiating site.
The protesters stopped about 500 metres from the building, without attempting to enter.
A stage had been set up to welcome the scheduled speakers, before a candlelight vigil with the participation of the former South African Archbishop of Cape, Desmond Tutu.
Most of the protesters had come by bus and train from major European cities, but many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, were also present as well as Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly in waterproof blue sky, had formed a first rally in the morning in Copenhagen at the call of Friends of the Earth, who intended to form "blue tides" for "justice for the climate".
Today, we are going down the streets to demand reparation for the ecological debt in favor of the South, said Lidy Nacpil, a Philippine activist from the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can’t keep saying: we have time, said Benin singer Angélique Kidjo.
There are rivers that dry up in Africa, rivers where you can walk like never before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, born in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the alter-globalist movement has moved closer to environmental organizations.
The French MEP José Bové, a figure of alterglobalism, explained that he came to Copenhagen for "linking climate justice and social justice": "Today, there is no break between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world".
The Asia-Pacific region, which is home to many islands that are particularly vulnerable to warming, had sparked protests.
Some 50,000 people, according to the organizers, had taken to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, a few hundred people, mostly students, paraded in red, wearing bandanas boasting solar energy.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, but also in Canada, rallies of a few hundred protesters also took place to call for vigorous action against climate change.
In France, the events organized by the network "350" brought together a few hundred people, including in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
A few dozen people gathered in Geneva.
Separatist Abkhazia has elected its president, Georgia denounces a "farce"
Abkhazia elected its president on Saturday, just over a year after Moscow recognized this pro-Russian separatist region of Georgia, while Tbilisi denounces a "farce".
Some 131,000 people were called to participate in this first election after the August 2008 Russo-Georgian war for control of South Ossetia, another Georgian secessionist territory recognized by Russia.
The polling stations closed at 17:00 GMT.
The participation rate was 58% a few hours before closing, according to officials of the Abkhaz Electoral Commission.
The first preliminary results were to be announced on Saturday-Sunday night.
The five candidates, including outgoing President Sergei Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which condemned the holding of the election.
This election is a farce.
Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili "regrets that Abkhazia fell under the total occupation of Russia," his spokesman Manana Manjgaladze said.
Apart from Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela have recognized the independence of this territory of 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world considers it as part of Georgia illegally occupied by Russian troops.
After separating from Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict, which killed several thousand people, Abkhazia seeks to show through this election that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a stage in our new life, our new era as an independent state, said to AFP Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian, who claimed to have voted for Bagapch.
She was among the voters who went to the polling station in a school in Sukhumi, the capital, in a pretty white building with a few palm trees in front of the entrance.
The question of Russian domination is at the heart of the presidential election in this region of sumptuous landscapes, on the edge of the Black Sea.
Vast panels showing Mr. Bagapch alongside the Russian President and Prime Minister, Dmitry Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, are installed a little everywhere in this small territory of 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, in the west of the country, the head of the district, Beslan Archba, reserved a warm welcome to the Russian officials who came to monitor the election.
We, the Abkhaz people, are grateful, he said during a small ceremony, in reference to Moscow's support, in particular the decision to recognize the independence of Abkhazia.
I hope that your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations, replied Alexei Ostrovsky, a member of the Russian parliament, lifting a glass of vodka.
The opposition, represented in the election by former Vice President Raoul Khadjimba and two businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticizes the agreements reached with Moscow last year, such as the one giving Russia control of the Abkhaz railways for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, says he does not support either the current power or the opposition.
A 50% majority plus one vote is required to win the election.
If no candidate reaches this threshold, a second round must be held within two weeks.
Climate: protests in the world, incidents in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people marched around the world on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding agreement at the Copenhagen Climate Conference, where the police, about who lives, intercepted nearly 700 people on the margins of an imposing demonstration.
Thirty thousand people, according to the police, a hundred thousand according to the organizers, marched in the cold afternoon in the Danish capital, which welcomes delegates from 193 countries until December 18, in search of an agreement that should enter into force on January 1, 2013.
Parliament Party, the overall good kid, took the lead of the Bella Center, where negotiations take place.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the center, without trying to enter.
A stage had been set up to welcome the scheduled speakers, before a candlelight vigil with the participation of the former South African Archbishop of Cape, Desmond Tutu.
A few moments after the march left, a group of a few hundred protesters, all dressed in black, armed with bricks and hammers, broke windows, an AFP journalist said.
Anti-mobbing police immediately surrounded them and intervened without a trace, throwing several of them to the ground.
The police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people, specifying that they were mainly members of the "Blacks Blocs", these ultra-violent groups that were illustrated in particular at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, in April.
In the late afternoon, a police officer was injured in the jaw by a pavement and four cars burned near a squat during incidents that led to the arrest of about twenty people, according to police.
We have eyes on extremist groups, police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen warned, as law enforcement helicopters turned in the sky.
The majority of the protesters, who came by bus and train from the major cities of Germany, London, Amsterdam or Milan, were of European origin.
But many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, were also present as well as Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly in waterproof blue sky, had formed a first rally in the morning in Copenhagen at the call of Friends of the Earth, who intended to form "blue tides" for "justice for the climate".
Today, we are going down the streets to demand reparation for the ecological debt in favor of the South, said Lidy Nacpil, a Philippine activist from the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.

There are rivers that dry up in Africa, there are rivers where you can walk when you have never done it before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, born in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the alter-globalist movement has moved closer to environmental organizations.
French MEP José Bové, a figure of alterglobalism, told AFP he had come to Copenhagen to "link climate justice and social justice": "Today, there is no break between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world".
Oxfam has mobilized several personalities, including Danish model Helena Christensen, former UN refugee commissioner Mary Robinson, to address the crowd.
The Asia-Pacific region, which is home to many islands that are particularly vulnerable to warming, had sparked protests.
Some 50,000 people, according to the organizers, had taken to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, a few hundred people, mostly students, protested, dressed in red and wearing bandanas boasting solar energy in front of the city hall of the Philippine capital.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, rallies of a few hundred protesters also took place to call for action against climate change.
In France, the events organized by the network "350" brought together a few hundred people, including in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).

The geo-history comes out strengthened from the reform of the general high school, according to Chatel
The Minister of National Education Luc Chatel said in an interview to appear in the JDD Sunday that history and geography were "strengthened" out of the reform of the general high school, despite the abolition of their compulsory teaching in the scientific terminal.
From now on, undergraduate students will have every four hours a week and the same program for a shared shared culture, says Chatel.
According to the minister, "it is necessary to get out of hypocrisy" because, according to him, "Sector S is no longer a scientific sector" but "in general, it concentrates the best students".
The ES and L branches cannot remain sub-branches of the S, he continues, emphasizing again: "I have also not heard many historians and intellectuals get angry at the absence of history-geography in terminals in high schools of technology".
On Saturday, an Ifop poll published in L’Humanité revealed that nearly seven out of ten (69%) French people disapproved of the government’s plan to abolish compulsory history-geography education in Terminal S. Many intellectuals and teachers also criticized this suppression, as well as the left and some right-wing elected officials.
The minister, on the other hand, added that there was "no question" of deleting the philosophy from the S-terminal program.
Luc Chatel also defended teacher training reform, while 16 organizations (students and trade unions) called for a day of mobilization Tuesday to protest against the project, which they say sacrifices the educational training of future teachers.
In Master 2 (M2), they will pass an eligibility test at the beginning of the year that will focus on their discipline, and then at the end of the year an admissions test that will focus on their ability to teach, the minister explained.
They will also take internships in situation during the M2 year and then be a first year in front of students as internship teachers.
If you add all the internships offered before the competition, you already get more attendance in front of the students, or more than 300 hours, he continued.
Finally, the Minister indicates that he will propose "the individual right to education, which does not exist in National Education".
He also reaffirmed the plan to remove the school card "by 2012".
A Normal Sup, experts have 15 minutes to convince about the climate
Fifteen minutes to talk about the issues of the Copenhagen summit: this is the challenge that Jean Jouzel, Vice-Chairman of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) invited by the École Normale Supérieure de la rue d'Ulm, took up on Saturday morning.
Jean Jouzel, also Nobel Peace Prize laureate, inaugurated the first of the "Ernest" conferences, a day consisting of a series of expert interventions, of fifteen minutes each, filmed and open to the public, a journalist from AFP found.
We wanted to do something that catches people and makes them want to know more, explained on the sidelines of the conference Edouard Hannezo, 22, one of the organizers of this day that takes its name from the one given by the students to the fish of the school basin.
Around 20 speakers are selected from among the experts in their discipline and selected for their charismatic side, he said.
Regarding global warming, "you can talk for hours, but you can also talk about key goals in a few minutes," Jean Jouzel, who spoke without notes, but using graphics, in front of about fifty people.
This is part of our role as a scientist, he stressed, hoping the listeners will keep in mind that "the Copenhagen conference is based on an extremely serious scientific dossier".
Videos from these conferences will be made available online on the school’s website from December 15.
The next day "Ernest" is scheduled for February, followed by others at a bi-monthly pace.
Delays in payments: anger from prison overseers, planned actions
The unions of prison watchdogs called on Friday for a "general mobilization" to demand the payment by the end of the year holidays of bonuses and overtime, the payment of which was postponed to January for budgetary reasons.
FO-Penitentiary (2nd Surveillance Union) has asked staff who will not be in service to protest in front of the prisons on Tuesday morning and to "block" them, to "denounce the theft of their dues".
The CGT-penitentiary (3rd trade union of the profession) calls them to "meet in general assemblies in the different prisons for a strong mobilization", deeming "honorable and unacceptable" the non-payment in December of the "overtimes, night, Sunday and holiday bonuses" worked in October.
And the first watchdog syndicate, the Federal Autonomous Prison Union (UFAP/UNSA), "calls for general mobilization (...) to raise discontent and anger".
The Prison Administration Directorate and the Department of Justice explain that overtime increased significantly in 2009 and not all of it was budgeted, but assure that the remaining hours will be paid in January.
The Chancellery said at the end of the day that Michèle Alliot-Marie had sent a letter to the unions of supervisors guaranteeing that this payment would be made next month.
I am not unaware of the efforts made by staff to operate and modernize our prison system, the Minister of Justice wrote in this letter.
I asked the management of the prison administration to put in place a set of measures without delay to ensure that this situation arising from a poor assessment of the number of overtime hours does not happen again in the future, adds Ms. Alliot-Marie.
The December salary will therefore be lean, except for management staff benefiting from the famous bonuses of functions and objectives, Ufap/Unsa regretted, for whom "budget constraints have a good back".
It is a pure scandal, the interregional union FO of Marseille was indignant, announcing its decision to boycott until a new order "all meetings and convocations".
Staff will not come to work on their Sundays and holidays if those in October are not regularized in December, the same for overtime, FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne also threatens.
At a time when we are increasing our tasks and our missions without increasing our staff, it is more than regrettable to dare to take the money of the staff, estimates the CGT-Penitentiary of Bordeaux.
According to the trade unions, the situation is not the same in all regions, some being less disadvantaged than others.
But anyway, the account is not there, said Ufap Secretary General Jean-François Forget.
For Christmas, Obama says he’s offering “more cool stuff” than he gets
U.S. President Barack Obama, who is about to spend his first Christmas as a family in the White House, told Oprah Winfrey that he had a simple gift rule: “I give things nicer than the ones I get.”
As part of a special show that will air on ABC on Sunday evening, the president and his wife Michelle offer an insight into how they plan to celebrate the end of the year in their new and prestigious home.
Even Bo, the little four-legged companion of the family will be at the party.
Santa also loves Bo, said Michelle Obama, specifying that the dog would "of course" have a gift, according to excerpts from the show aired in advance.
And Michelle Obama faked her husband’s claims about the quality of the gifts he receives: “Certainly not, I offered you nice gifts last year,” she joked.
Absolutely, he was forced to concede before responding with humor by pointing his finger at the first lady's pearl necklace: "Who gave you this?"
During this one-hour show, in a relaxed atmosphere, with the famous hostess who was a fervent supporter of Barack Obama during the presidential campaign, the president and his wife also remembered their favorite gifts as children.
Barack Obama mentioned a ten-speed bike, but also a basketball that his Kenyan father rarely saw offered him at Christmas.
I remember this time when I met my dad came to see us for Christmas and he gave me a basketball, the president said.
It was only much later in my life that I realized that he was the one who gave me this ball.
The First Lady remembered her side of her dollhouse.
I didn’t really know how to arrange a house so I had lined up all the furniture against the wall, rather than arranging them around the fireplace, but I loved this little dollhouse,” said Michelle Obama.
Johnny Hallyday Replayed, RTL Says He's in Artificial Coma
Johnny Hallyday was re-operated in Los Angeles due to significant "injuries" after an operation in France, but the situation is "under control" according to his entourage, while RTL claims the singer was placed in an artificial coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker was resurrected on Wednesday night to Thursday at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles after American doctors found "injuries resulting from the operation" of the herniated disc in Paris on November 26, his press service said in Paris, stating that these injuries had "reparated an operation".
The singer's press service, however, was reassuring that the situation was "under control", while announcing that a new medical bulletin would be communicated within 48 hours at the latest.
According to RTL, Johnny Hallyday was in an artificial coma to avoid “pain and complications.”
It is only in 48 hours that we will have a little more certainty about the condition of the patient when he has opened an eye, adds RTL.
Questioned by AFP, the press service has neither confirmed nor commented on the information.
RTL also claims that "according to some sources" no drains would have been laid after the first operation in Paris.
The rocker had been operated on at the Monceau Park International Clinic for this herniated disc.
The intervention, scheduled for several days, had been performed by neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known physician in the artistic environment.
He was not available Thursday night to comment on RTL's information.
Following the operation he performed on Johnny Hallyday, the singer was hospitalized Monday at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles for an infection following the intervention.
Singer Eddy Mitchell, a close friend of Johnny Hallyday, said on RTL on Thursday that his friend was going through "a bad pass," but said he had "no worries" about rocking him, which is "a beat".
He called me just before he left for Los Angeles, and I told him it was bullshit because doing twelve hours of air travel after such an operation is not playable,” Mitchell said.
On Wednesday evening, the singer's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, wanted to reassure himself, saying that Johnny Hallyday "reacted satisfactorily to antibiotics" and that the infection was "inhibited".
Mr. Camus also said he had spoken to Laeticia, the singer's wife, and had not noticed any particular concern.
But the singer's health problems have only multiplied since July when he was hospitalized for nine days following a fall on his yacht.
Two months later, to the general surprise, Johnny Hallyday had revealed that he had been operated on for a “small colon cancer” and then for a mild infection.
At the end of September, the singer resumed as planned his long "Tour 66", presented as his farewell tour.
But since then, every health issue has been commented on a lot. Fans and journalists have noticed the singer’s difficulties moving on stage.
In mid-November, his entourage even had to deny a new hospitalization.
Euro-2009/small basin: Bousquet's first on her fetish distance
Frenchman Frédérick Bousquet, triple-medallist at the 2009 World Cup in the Grand Basin, won an international title on Thursday over a distance he particularly likes, the 50m free swimming, during the Euro-2009 in the small basin in Istanbul.
The first day of this competition where the suits are allowed for the last time saw only three world records beaten while waiting for a draw.
One was improved by the Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto on 200 m 4 swims and the other two by Russia in relays gentlemen 4x50 m 4 swims.
A regret for Bousquet, who lagged on the world record of the 50 m freestyle, of which he holds the mark in the large basin (20.94).
On one of the two queen distances of swimming, the 50 m free, is the 28-year-old Frenchman who prevailed in 20 sec 53 in a final where ten swimmers took the start against eight usually, a first at the international level.
Bousquet overtook Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84) but failed to lower the world mark (20.30) as he had envisaged.
We can always dream better and in this case, I had said that if the world record was within my reach, I would try it.
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers were wearing polyurethane suits, which will be banned from 1 January.
Originating 238 world records since February 2008, these combinations end their epic in Istanbul, which had hosted the first ones in 1999, at the same competition.
The use of the combinations did not serve this time to the German Paul Biedermann, double world champion in the Grand Basin this summer in Rome, world records at the key.
The young swimmer failed to lower his 400m free-swimming mark (3:32.77) but still prevailed by scoring the second best time of his career (3:34.55), ahead of Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and Danish Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
I didn’t really get into this race.
I knew I couldn’t break a world record this time, but I managed to defend my title and accomplished my mission.
Lobintsev will be a serious rival in the future, Biedermann explained.
US: Zola owned sarcophagus panel awarded $1.5 million
A Roman sarcophagus panel belonging to French writer Emile Zola was auctioned on Thursday for $1.5 million, well above his estimate, art dealer Sotheby's announced.
This two-meter-long 63-cm-high front panel, dating from the 3rd century A.D., was estimated at between $150,000 and $250,000.
The marble "representing four Dionysian scenes in a sophisticated architectural setting, surrounded by satyrs and sparrows, is a rare piece, there are only four or five in the world," Florent Heintz, vice president of antiquity art auctions at Sobyine, told AFP on Tuesday.
It was sold among a hundred lots.
The sale is still ongoing but this lot is certainly the one on which buyers have bid the most so far, Sotheby's spokesman Dan Abernethy told AFP.
The discovery of the acquisition of this marble by Emile Zola goes back a few days.
The panel remained in Rome for nearly 300 years in the famous collection of the Borghese family, then appeared successively at the French actress Cécile Sorel, who had made it part of her bathtub in her particular Parisian hotel, and at Paul Reynaud, minister under the Third Republic in France and briefly president of the Council before the accession to power.
It was a 50-year-old shadow zone.
By searching the Louvre database, Florent Heintz discovered that this panel was part of an "Emile Zola succession" opened in 1903, a year after the death of the author of "Thérèse Raquin" and the fresco of the "Rougon-Macquart".
Aborted Departure Attempt of Zelaya from Honduras to Mexico
Mexico on Thursday considered that the conditions were no longer met for the transfer to its territory of the ousted president of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, who was refused an exemption led by the putschist government.
At the moment, after a telephone conversation overnight with President Zelaya, everything seems to indicate that the possibilities for this transfer are not reunited, said Mexican Foreign Minister Patricia Espinosa.
Arriving in El Salvador on Wednesday to bring back Mr Zelaya, the Mexican government plane departed to its place of origin, according to a source from the Migration Directorate General.
The putschist government wanted to force Zelaya to "resign" and seek political asylum abroad to grant him a bailout.
But the ousted president refused, because he wanted to go to Mexico as a visiting head of state.
The putschist government "has experienced a new failure in wanting me to resign from my charge ... they wanted me to resign," Zelaya told Globo radio on Thursday, on which he has often spoken since the beginning of the political crisis that has lasted for five months in the Central American country.
I can stay here for ten years, here I have my guitar, added playing some chords the deposed president, who has been a refugee at the Brazilian embassy in Tegucigalpa for two and a half months.
The embassy of Mexico has submitted a request for safe conduct, but unfortunately we cannot accept it because it does not contain an asylum application, said the interior minister of the putschist government, Oscar Raul Matute, on Wednesday on Honduran radio HRN.
I am not asking for asylum from any country, Manuel Zelaya said in an interview with Telesur, which is headquartered in Caracas.
A possible departure from Honduras will have to take place as president of the Honduran people, he stressed.
Rumors of Zelaya’s departure had mobilized supporters of the ousted president on Wednesday, who came to gather around the Brazilian embassy, where the military reinforced their siege.
Brazil’s Foreign Minister Celso Amorim has criticized the government’s stance.
This demonstrates the marginal character of this government in relation to international norms, he said.
Zelaya, who had approached Venezuelan socialist President Hugo Chavez, was overthrown on June 28, the day he held a popular consultation to prepare for his re-election, against the advice of the Supreme Court, the army and Congress.
Exiled to Costa Rica, he had returned by surprise on September 21 and had taken refuge at the Brazilian embassy.
If he comes out, he will be arrested to answer for the crime of "high treason" accused by the justice, according to the putschist government.
Putschist President Roberto Micheletti managed to hold a presidential election on November 29 to replace Zelaya.
Porfirio Lobo was elected during the controversial election recognized by the United States but contested by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil.
Three days later, Congress voted massively against Zelaya’s return to power until the end of his term on January 27.
Wall Street rises, US trade balance fuels optimism
The New York Stock Exchange ended up on Thursday, with U.S. trade balance figures showing a recovery in activity from both the U.S. and its partners: the Dow Jones won 0.67% and the Nasdaq 0.33%.
According to the definitive closing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 68.78 points to 10,405.83 points, and the dominant technology Nasdaq, from 7.13 points to 2,190.06 points.
Standard & Poor's 500 expanded index was awarded 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1,102.35 points.
We have good news from different parts of the economy, said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
But this remains anecdotal, she tempered, saying the market was focused on “half full glass.”
According to Peter Cardillo, of Avalon Partners, investors mainly focused on the figures of the U.S. trade balance, "which show that the activity is improving in the fourth quarter".
The U.S. trade deficit fell 7.6% in October from September to $32.9 billion.
Analysts, on the other hand, expected an increase in the deficit.
Both imports and exports have increased.
The big news is the growth in trade volumes, especially for goods exports, which reflects the growth in the economies of the main U.S. trading partners, said Christopher Cornell, of the research firm Economy.com.
On the other hand, new enrollments in the U.S. have risen against expectations last week to reach 474,000 applications.
But over the past four weeks, the average number of new job seekers “has fallen to the lowest level in a year,” said Scott Marcouiller, of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market has fallen.
The yield of the 10-year Treasury bond rose to 3.482% against 3.423% Tuesday night and that of the 30-year bond to 4.492% against 4.408% the day before.
Cuba: Hundreds of supporters of power question the "White Ladies"
A few hundred supporters of the Cuban government on Thursday questioned the wives of political prisoners gathered in Havana for World Human Rights Day, and prevented another demonstration for which about a dozen dissidents were arrested.
About forty "white ladies", wives or close friends of political prisoners, were scourged in the street by supporters of Raul Castro's government as they marched to the center of the capital to demand the release of political prisoners, an AFP journalist found.
Down the Yankees!, "mercenaries!", "the street belongs to the revolutionaries!", "Vive Fidel and Raul!" shouted, the fist lifted, the supporters of power to the dissidents.
The latter were escorted by civilian officers who came to "ensure their protection".
The day before, a similar demonstration had taken place against the "Ladies in White" in Havana, without any injuries or arrests.
But in the Havana neighborhood of Vedado, a dozen dissidents who were also preparing to protest on Thursday for the International Human Rights Day were arrested by police officers in civilian clothes, an AFP journalist said.
The police have forced dissidents into civilian vehicles who have been confounded by supporters of the government, according to the journalist.
Interceptions of dissidents under similar circumstances usually last only a few hours.
Winners of the 2005 Sakharov Prize of the European Parliament, the "White Ladies" had organized an unauthorized march to "demand the release of all political prisoners", 200 according to the dissent, said one of their leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband Hector Maceda is serving a 20-year prison sentence.
Mr. Maceda is part of the group of 75 Cuban dissidents arrested in March 2003, 53 of whom remain in custody.
The Cuban authorities consider the opponents as "mercenaries" or "agents" on the balance of their declared enemy, the United States.
Rarely, Cuban television reported on Thursday's demonstration of pro-government activists against "counter-revolutionaries".
Cuba, led by a single party, the Communist Party, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of violating rights and freedoms, including freedom of expression.
Forced man kills an octogenarian with a knife and wounds 5 in Clichy-la-Garenne
A gunman armed with two knives killed an eight-year-old and injured five others in the city centre of Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine), an hour into the crowd, Thursday at the end of the day.
According to the first elements of the investigation, the 28-year-old assailant allegedly struck with two knives and for indefinite reasons, an octogenarian, in or in front of a pharmacy on 85 boulevard Jean-Jaurès, police sources and witnesses said.
Gravely injured, the old man, born in 1929 according to an official of the Alliance police union, died in the hospital as a result of his injuries.
In or in front of the same pharmacy, he then took a couple, whose wife was pregnant.
The 30-year-old man interposed and was injured.
The first two victims, seriously injured, were admitted to the hospital where the octogenary died.
The other injured person's days are in danger, with vital organs apparently affected, according to police sources.
The pregnant woman then became uncomfortable and was reportedly hospitalized "in shock," according to a police source.
The gunman, who appeared under the influence of alcohol or drugs, according to a police source, then fled to the street, still Boulevard Jean Jaurès.
He allegedly injured two passers-by, apparently by chance: a 30-year-old and a 40-year-old, the latter severely.
The script was confusing in the evening.
He was armed with two butcher knives that he was carrying in a cross behind his back, said Arnaud Pressé, an official of the Alliance trade union in Hauts-de-Seine.
Several passers-by, including young people, according to testimonies collected by AFP, tried to control the man.
I saw a 30-year-old guy in a green jacket.
Three young men tried to intercept him.
They didn't get there because the guy was stubborn, Alberto, a waiter at a nearby bar, reported.
A crowd fell on him, including a municipal police officer who broke his wrist, he added.
Also boulevard Jean-Jaurès, at the height of No. 61, two municipal police officers, including their manager, tried to interpelle the armed man and were wounded by fist, according to police sources.
The events took place in one of the main arteries of Clichy-la-Garenne, where there are many shops.
Passengers came to tell me that there was an injured person outside.
I went out, I saw a 70-year-old person on the ground, I put him in a safe position, and I saw a very important wound to the abdomen, said to AFP Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist.
Five minutes later, a second person of about thirty years of age arrived, wounded by a knife.
These are national police personnel who arrested the man with no identity papers.
The Nanterre Public Prosecutor's Office has seized the investigation from the Hauts-de-Seine Departmental Judicial Police Service (SDPJ 92).
The man was hospitalized Thursday night.
He had not yet been heard in his custody.
A police source did not rule out him being admitted to a psychiatric hospital.
According to another police source, it took six police officers to control him at the Clichy police station where he was taken.
He was "in a state of overexcitement" as "all the forced ones of this species whose forces multiply under the effect of action".
USA: Polanski's lawyer again calls for abandonment of prosecutions
The lawyer of Franco-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski once again claimed Thursday in Los Angeles (California, west of the United States), the abandonment of the prosecution against his client, currently assigned to residence in Switzerland for a case of more than 30 years of morality.
Chad Hummel, the director's lawyer for the "Pianist", denounced three judges of the appeals court of the second district of California for serious procedural errors at the time of the facts, in 1977.
I call for the dismissal of charges here and now, Hummel said, before adding that the behavior of the judge in charge of the case at the time, Laurence Rittenband, "was cold in the back."
According to him, Judge Rittenband, who has since died, reportedly discussed, before serving his sentence, with a prosecutor who told him Roman Polanski deserved to be imprisoned -- a serious misdemeanor.
This discussion had been revealed in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" (Roman Polanski, sought and desired), from the mouth of the prosecutor in question, David Wells.
But Wells finally declared at the end of September that he had "lied" to the author of the documentary.
In the event that the court refused to abandon the prosecution, Mr. Hummel called for a trial, which would allow him to present the evidence of his argument.
The prosecution reiterated the argument already developed in the first instance, namely that no abandonment of the charges could be seriously considered until Roman Polanski would appear before the court.
The 76-year-old filmmaker fled the United States in 1978, before his sentence, for "illegal sexual relations" with a 13-year-old minor.
He has never put his feet back in the United States since.
Los Angeles County Deputy Prosecutor Phyllis Asayama said Roman Polanski “must be there to present himself to the hearing.”
In this case, do we want to send the message, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other accused, that it is possible to escape?, asked Ms. Asayama.
For her, the filmmaker "demands a favor from the court, while despising his authority".
One of the three judges -- who now have 90 days to make their decision -- also stressed that "there were other alternatives to the escape".
Mr. Hummel was not the only one asking for the abandonment of the prosecutions against Roman Polanski.
Samantha Geimer’s lawyer, the victim, also called, once again, for the end of the prosecution.
Recalling that her client no longer tolerates being harassed at every turn of the Polanski case, she added: "No one in this room can say that the procedure was fair.
Thirty-two years is enough.”
Roman Polanski was arrested on September 26 in Switzerland on a U.S. arrest warrant.
After more than two months behind bars, he was assigned to reside in his Gstaad cottage, awaiting possible extradition.
Wall Street ends without direction, hampered by dollar rise
The New York Stock Exchange ended without direction on Friday, in a market drawn between better-than-expected indicators in the United States and the rise in the dollar: the Dow Jones won 0.63% but the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to definitive closing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 65.67 points to 10.471.50 points, while the technology-dominant Nasdaq dropped 0.55 points to 2.190.31 points.
The expanded Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1,106.41 points.
Honestly, the market is very quiet, said Mace Blicksilver, of Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains in narrow margins, the volume of trade has become very low and I think this will remain the case until the end of the year.
The trend was supported by the publication of better-than-expected economic indicators, which "contributed to improving market opinion on the robustness of economic recovery," Schwab's analysts summarized.
In the U.S., retail sales rose 1.3% in November for the second month in a row and far more than expected.
In addition, U.S. consumer confidence improved sharply in December to 73.4 from 67.4 the previous month, according to the University of Michigan's preliminary index estimate.
However, the indices have been hampered by a further rise in the dollar, the highest in two months compared to the euro, which "push down sectors sensitive to the economic situation," Deutsche Bank's Owen Fitzpatrick said.
Technological values have thus lost ground.
The bond market has fallen.
The yield of the 10-year Treasury bond rose to 3,540% from 3.482% on Wednesday night and that of the 30-year bond to 4.497% from 4.492% the day before.
Miss World's Election Again in South Africa
After a month of travel across South Africa, the 112 Miss World candidates are set to cross the last straight line on Saturday to realize their dream: to be elected the most beautiful woman in the world in front of a billion viewers.
At this great beauty fair held for the second year in a row in the vicinity of Johannesburg, five of them have already won their ticket for the semi-finals.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta of Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo of Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino of Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma of Canada were elected Miss Sportive or Miss Top Model during their African stay.
It was a real whirlwind.
Visiting beautiful cities like Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Town was extraordinary.
“I’ve seen so many things and experienced so many experiences!” exclaims Miss Sierra Leone.
This competition, which takes place for the ninth time in South Africa, will be broadcast live on Saturday from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, starting at 17:00 (15:00 GMT).
I couldn't have dreamed of a better country to hand over my crown.
This experience has been fascinating.
I’m happy to have lived it twice, says Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of the southern summer.
For the young Russian, her second stay in South Africa was marked by many exchanges with the candidates and the rediscovery of "breathtaking landscapes in this country".
After a month of galas, rehearsals, press meetings and safari, the Misses are now focusing on the competition.
Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to follow in the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, elected in 2000 and present at this election, as well as those of Aishwarya Rai in 1994, who both became Bollywood stars.
It’s every woman’s dream to be crowned the most beautiful in the world, but it’s not just about appearance.
We are the ambassadors of our countries and I want to go home with the crown, Miss India launches with a wide smile.
According to the organizers, music and dance will score this 59th edition.
The candidates will parade in a traditional costume and of course in a swimsuit.
The show will be hosted by TV presenter, Chinese Angela Chow, former South African beauty queen Michelle McLean and Miss World committee leader Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that it knows how to welcome the world with a warmth and pride that is hard to match, says Julia Morley, president of Miss Monde.
The candidates took a safari like last year, visited the famous township of Soweto, but this time by bike, and tasted the local cuisine.
They also met with South African President Jacob Zuma, who shook their hand.
Not common for a head of state, notes Miss Sierra Leone.
Their most beautiful memory will undoubtedly remain the draw in Cape Town (southwest) for the June 2010 World Cup, a way for the country to promote the event a little more.
I've been dating people I never thought I'd be able to get close to.
I will undoubtedly return for the 2010 World Cup, excites Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
Johnny Hallyday's news "is very positive," according to his son David
Johnny Hallyday's news "is very positive," his son David said on Friday when he arrived at the Los Angeles airport where he was due to go to his father's hospital bed for several days.
The news is very positive.
It's very strong, it's going very well, David Hallyday told the press on his way out of the plane that was taking him out of Paris shortly after 1pm local time (21pm GMT).
The singer's son, the relaxed air, said he was going "very quickly" to Cedars-Sinai hospital in Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday was admitted on Monday for an infection following a disc hernia operation on Nov. 26 in Paris.
The singer was "placed in an artificial coma tonight in Los Angeles for comfort reasons, to prevent him from suffering and to be able to administer his treatment," the press service said.
Johnny Hallyday had already been placed in an artificial coma by doctors at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles, where he was admitted on Monday for an infection following a disc hernia operation on November 26 in Paris.
The singer had to be re-operated on the night of Wednesday to Thursday due to significant injuries resulting from this intervention.
His wife, Laeticia, went to French high school in Los Angeles on Friday morning, where their daughter Jade attended a school show, a photographer from AFP found.
The head of orthopedic and traumatological surgery at the Hospital de la Pitié-Salpêtrière, Yves Catoné, announced that he would visit the singer in Los Angeles on Monday.
The producer violently questioned Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, the neurosurgeon who operated on the singer on November 26 at the Monceau Park International Clinic in Paris.
We were told it was a massacre.
Los Angeles surgeons said they were outraged, Camus said.
I have heard about a possible legal process to come, he said.
Camus said Johnny Hallyday had "departed far too quickly for Los Angeles, with the permission of the Parisian surgeon."
I had this doctor in person online who assured me that there was no problem for this trip and it surprised me, given that I myself had two herniated discs, he added.
Earlier on RTL, he had indicated that the singer had apparently "departed without drain, without anything", after his Paris operation.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is very well known in the artistic environment.
He had operated on the actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius, a few days before her death, in a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine where he was exercising at the time.
In 2007, he had also operated on actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to absorb a hematoma following a cerebral haemorrhage.
But he is also a doctor with a reputation for sulfur, repeatedly convicted by the courts, in cases of medical responsibility, as well as for tax fraud and fraud.
Olivier Metzner, the lawyer of the Order of Doctors, accused him of being "a man without scruples" prosecuted "regularly" before the Council of the Order, and who is "far from being recommended".
After several days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux spoke Friday through his lawyer, David Koubbi.
He said the intervention was "perfectly well" and that post-operative examinations were "normal".
The operation "was not hemorrhagic and therefore did not require a drain," he added.
In any case, the singer’s tour, whose health problems have been multiplying since this summer, seems between parentheses.
Obviously, a resumption of the tour on January 8 (in Amiens, ndlr) as planned, it seems very short, Mr. Camus said.
The association UDF raises the tone and summons the New Centre to no longer use its acronym
The UDF association, controlled by François Bayrou's MoDem, reacted Friday to the OPA attempt by the president of the New Centre, Hervé Morin, on the acronym of the former Giscard d'Estaing party, urging him not to use it on any media anymore, under penalty of prosecution.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to regain the acronym UDF, judging that François Bayrou did not deserve to defend his political legacy after stretching out his hand to the left.
The Minister of Defence, whose party is a partner of the UMP, had also planned to confirm this strategy Saturday before the National Council of the NC.
To support his approach, he received the support of MEP Hervé de Charette (former UMP former NC) who claimed ownership of the UDF trademark for being the first to file it in 2004 at the National Institute of Industrial Property.
But Friday night, the UDF office, controlled by the friends of François Bayrou who do not intend to let themselves be dispossessed, came out of its silence to launch a warning to the minister and the MP, summoning them to no longer use the acronym and to pass on to them the ownership of the trademark.
You have multiplied, in recent days, the statements indicating that you would propose to your political movement to retake the acronym UDF, wrote the association in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the bureau, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez du MoDem, as well as Senator Jean Arthuis of the Alliance centriste.
You also thought it was good to keep track of your militant material and on the page of your site, the name of this movement, the +New Center+, the slogan +Today's UDF+, also note the signatories of the mail.
As you do not know, you have no right to use this acronym, explains the UDF office, which warns the NC to "immediately remove the mention of the UDF name from any media as well as from (its) website".
He also asks Hervé de Charette "to pass on the ownership of (the) trademark to its legitimate rights holders".
If you did not, the courts would be seized to enforce the law and the legitimate rights of UDF members, warn the signatories.
In their letter, they specify that the UDF "has been a full political movement since 1978" and recall that Mr. Morin and his friends had "made the choice" to leave him in 2007 "to create a competing movement, as others had done in 2002, to create the UMP".
According to them, the New Centre has no right to use the acronym UDF (Union for French Democracy).
They also recall that the last congress of the UDF voted in 2007 its membership in the MoDem for three years and the creation of an office charged with defending the "material and moral interests" of the formation founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, the office continues, "when he filed the trademark", he was "no longer a member of the UDF for three years", but at the UMP.
He scandalously and fraudulently takes advantage of the absence of filing the acronym UDF to perform it on his behalf.
This indelicacy is turning into a crime, they denounce, before ironizing on the NC strategy: "It seems to us that in politics, as in life, it is more worthy to make a name for oneself than to try to get out of anonymity by fraudulently taking a name to which one is not entitled".
Liliane Bettencourt case: François-Marie Banier to be tried for abuse of weakness
The court of Nanterre decided on Friday to judge the artist François-Marie Banier in order to determine, if, as accused by the daughter of billionaire Liliane Bettencourt, he took advantage of a state of weakness of the octogenary for the plunder of a part of his fortune.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his star photos, will be tried on April 15 and 16, 2010 for abuse of weakness, a crime punishable by a maximum of three years in prison and a fine of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>375,000.
This decision means that there will be a trial in this case worthy of a saga about one of the richest families in France, in which mother and daughter tear themselves apart while holding the reins of the L'Oréal cosmetics empire.
But the 15th Correctional Chamber also ordered that a medical expertise of 87-year-old Liliane Bettencourt should be conducted collegiately by three doctors.
The heir and main shareholder of L'Oréal has always refused to undergo such a review, at least not under the conditions proposed by the Nanterre Public Prosecutor's Office during the investigation.
The doctors appointed on Friday will have to submit a report before March 10, 2010, stating in particular whether Liliane Bettencourt was able to find herself in a state of weakness and at what periods.
I think she'll submit.
I'll talk to her about it," Mrs Bettencourt's lawyer, Georges Kiejman, said at the end of the hearing.
Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers' lawyer, Olivier Metzner, welcomed the court's decision.
This is excellent news (...) The expertise will show that he (Mr Banier) has manipulated this elderly lady that we must protect, he said.
For the past two years, Liliane Bettencourt's only daughter has filed criminal charges against François-Marie Banier, a photographer and artist who she accuses of taking advantage of her mother's weakness for years to obtain a billion euros of donations, in the form of checks or contracts.
For her part, Liliane Bettencourt has always denied having been manipulated by the photographer, whom she considers a long-time friend.
While the court was due to examine the admissibility of the action initiated by Ms Bettencourt-Meyers, lawyers' pleas sometimes turned to the large family unpacking on Friday.
Thus, Liliane Bettencourt's lawyer reported three letters sent by her client (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to her notary, in which she said she was suspicious of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers' husband.
In the 2003 letter, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to the lawyer: "Could you explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier once, twice a day for fifteen years.
I haven’t been able to talk to her since her marriage.”
For its part, the Nanterre Public Prosecutor's Office once again ruled that the complainant was inadmissible to act, especially since a guardianship judge has in recent days refused to give effect to her request to open a judicial protection procedure for her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "has full capacity to act in justice, she is not under protection and has no guardian.
No one else has to act in his place," said the prosecutor's representative, Marie-Chrsitine Daubigney.
The court finally decided that it would rule once the trial had taken place on Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers' admissibility.
Management revolution or the end of economic intelligence?
If nothing changes in the governance of major French companies, our struggle for the development of economic intelligence will have been futile.
For more than a decade, the attitude of the management of large companies towards its employees, recalls the position of companies towards consumers before the marketing revolution: it is to make employees adhere to certain "values" from above as it was once thought, to impose on consumers the products of the technicians.
By putting the customer at the heart of the company, the marketing revolution has put the strategies of conquering the markets back in place... although the authoritarian temptation to impose products disconnected from customer preference factors regularly returns!
Demobilization of employees can lead to deadly demoralization.
Suicides in France Telecom, PSA or Renault are just the emerging part of a much more general phenomenon that affects executives in particular.
This demobilization seriously undermines the development of all the intellectual functions of the company, including R&D and, moreover, economic intelligence.
Indeed, the IE "requires from all stakeholders (...) a proactive approach and a forward-looking vision"; it requires a commitment on the part of employees that authoritarian management revenues totally contradict.
That is why we are calling for a management revolution that would be to put employees at the center of the company’s concerns as much as the customer.
The relative usefulness of internal opinion polls
Will internal opinion polls – such as the questionnaire submitted by Orange to its employees – encourage this revolution in managerial practices?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
- First of all because I have been able to see that, in the face of a new situation, any structure finally, after many detours, comes to prioritize... what she has always done!
Second, because authoritarianism – one of the pathologies of power – grows in proportion to the importance of its own failures.
- Finally, because most leaders have a simplistic view of human behavior.
From the major schools of engineers, they have a mechanistic interpretation of psychology.
They adopt, for intellectual comfort, the old behaviorist theory, recently reactivated by the US "neurosciences" and widely disseminated, without their knowledge, by the institutes of study and the media.
Thus, by suggesting that it is possible to handle the "levers" (sic) of the engagement of the cadres, a recent survey by Ipsos published in Le Figaro.fr comforts the leaders in a posture of mechanistic governance, unsuitable for the world of today.
Identify and measure mobilization factors
On the contrary, the managerial revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern enterprises presupposes adopting a finalist vision of human behavior.
It consists in integrating, in any reasoning or governance practice, a fundamental finding: for employees, commitment to the company is only possible if it clearly appears as a means of realizing part of their dreams, ambitions, and projects.
Currently, only studies from the Motif Functional Analysis adopt this conception of employee motivations.
These studies have shown that they judge their company based on a predetermined doxa that allows them, through their perceived image of the company, to evaluate what it offers them to realize their life projects.
By identifying and measuring these mobilization factors, business leaders can control, predict and anticipate their "social performance" and put their human resources management "in place".
They thus create a ground for the concerted development of robust and effective economic intelligence.
Oslo Speech: "Just War" Worth Praising Right to Obama
The American right welcomed the speech delivered on Friday in Oslo by Barack Obama, satisfied that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize defended the concept of a "just war" against the enemies of the United States.
The Conservatives, who had endorsed the award to Mr. Obama on October 9, applauded the presidential speech this time, along with Sarah Palin, a former vice-presidential candidate in the 2008 election.
“I liked what he said,” Palin, a member of the Republican Party’s right wing, told USA Today, adding that she herself addressed the theme of war “sometimes necessary” in her memoirs that have just been published.
War is, of course, the last thing Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
We need to stop these terrorists all over the place, she said.
Obama, who inherited the two wars of his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan, used Thursday in Oslo to justify the use of force, a way to explain his decision to send 30,000 additional soldiers to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, said the president had done a “very good job” in Oslo.
I found the speech to be really good, said the former Speaker of the House of Representatives, who particularly appreciated the mention of "the existence of evil in the world" in the presidential speech.
In some ways, I found this speech quite historic, said Mr. Gingrich, interviewed on the radio show "The Takeaway".
The former elector, considered by some to be a possible candidate for the Republican nomination for the 2012 presidential election, said he was delighted to see "a leftist president" reminding members of the Nobel Committee "that they would not be free and could not award a peace prize if the use of force did not exist".
For Michael Gerson, former penman of George W. Bush reconverted columnist to the Washington Post, Obama made “a very American speech.”
In addition to presenting himself as a "citizen of the world" as "he always does", "he spoke like an American president", reminding Europeans "that they live in a security bubble that they did not create and that they do not do much to preserve it," said Gerson.
Among the few on the right to be unconvinced, a Bush-era hawk, former U.N. ambassador John Bolton, called the speech "outland, bumpy and uninspired" on the National Review Online site.
On the left of the president, Democratic Representative Dennis Kucinich was alarmed to see Barack Obama justify the use of force.
When one wraps war in the notion of justice, one can easily justify the massacre of innocents, he warned.
The center-left press, however, remained commendable in the President's place.
The Los Angeles Times, while continuing to think that the Nobel Prize was awarded prematurely to Obama, called his speech "superproduction" even for a speaker known for his talent.
Oslo's speech "should serve as a roadmap to guide international decisions against conflict, poverty and oppression," the California daily reported.
Obama “made the right speech,” the New York Times said, judging him “at the same time dark and uplifting.”
Three marathons for a deal that saves Christmas supplies
After three marathon negotiation sessions, road trade unions and TLF, the only employers' organization to remain to the end, reached an agreement Friday night that puts an end to the strike slogan and the heavy threat to Christmas supplies.
At the signing session on Friday evening, the Secretary of State for Transport, Dominique Bussereau, "rejoiced" about this agreement, after several negotiation sessions, which began on Wednesday morning.
After a second night of talks, the negotiators left early Friday morning, hoping to sign the agreement quickly by the end of the morning.
And this even if three employer organizations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) had knocked on the door.
But it took more than six hours for a meeting to begin at 11 a.m. for everyone to agree and for the text to be signed at 6 p.m.
The conflict "would have been very detrimental to businesses" and "it was to be feared that it would disrupt the end of the year holidays," Bussereau said.
The text foresees a wage increase of 4% for the lowest wages (in local and regional road transport), and of 2.9% for the highest (international transport).
At the hourly rate, for low-wages, "we go from 8.72 euros to 9.06.
It's not much, but we start from a very long way, explained Patrice Clos (FO).
Either we will give the order to our activists that there are no blockades, no blockades of the supply centers.
But you can always have some reluctants who are not happy, he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of TLF, welcomed "a good deal", although it was "difficult to grant the increases on high wages given the international competition".
According to him, the increases will be on the order of 170 euros monthly for low wages and 100 to 120 euros for the highest.
This is the agreement of common sense and respect for employees, Maxime Dumont (CFDT) said, while Thierry Douine (CFTC) hailed "a historic agreement".
Richard Jaubert (CGT) called it an "acceptable compromise".
The agreement also provides for the revaluation of travel costs of 3%, and the holding of general status of road transport in the first half of 2010, which will include addressing the issue of a 13th month and a modernization of the collective agreement.
Mr. Bussereau recalled that "a reduction of 100 million euros in employer charges" has been the subject of a government amendment to the draft amending Finance Act for 2009, voted in the night of Thursday to Friday by the National Assembly.
The government will ask the Senate to vote "in the same terms".
The signing of TLF allows the agreement to apply firstly to companies belonging to this organization, and secondly, to the whole profession, in the event of an extension by the Minister of Labour.
It will be done “as soon as possible,” said Bussereau.
The opposition of employers' organizations can only delay the process.
The FNTR denounced a "dupes market", as the 100 million euros "had already been promised to the sector to compensate for part of the carbon tax".
The Secretary of State for Transportation has forced us to negotiate in the emergency, not in conclusion of a shared analysis, but to not bother the turkey eaters of the next New Year's Eve, lamented the Unostra.
For the Other, the agreement risks "digging the grave of a very large number of SMEs in the sector in the next 12 months".
RER A: disturbances this weekend, unions dissatisfied with the proposals of the RATP
The disturbances on the RER A, France's largest urban public transport line, will continue over the weekend, while a meeting on Friday on the 2nd day of strike between trade unions and RATP management has left them hungry for their premium application.
Saturday and Sunday, for this important shopping weekend before Christmas, there will only be trains between 10am and 8pm, due to one in two trains on the central section (between La Défense and Nation) and one in four trains outside the central section.
Interconnection with the SNCF will be suspended in Nanterre Prefecture, forcing passengers to change trains.
Galeries Lafayette, which expects 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that "RATP is making efforts to serve the big stores".
The RER A across from the west is the Parisian agglomeration.
The RATP section runs from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, about one in two trains ran in peak hours, and almost no rafts in hollow hours, as planned.
As on Thursday, there was no cohue on the docks, the Francilians having organized themselves.
Thus, in the early morning, the station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was much less crowded than usual, especially due to the absence of college and high school students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, a 29-year-old engineer, explained that he woke up "thirty hours earlier, to be sure to arrive on time".
The Saint-Lazare station was not saturated, the SNCF said, which had provided for the supervision of officers and law enforcement.
The RER A operated by the SNCF from or to Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or departed from Saint-Lazare station to reach the subways.
New general assemblies of strikers will be held on Saturday and Sunday, which will examine the results, deemed "lean" by the unions, of a meeting with the leadership on Friday afternoon.
The Director of RER proposes to negotiate a specific protocol for RER A on all aspects, working time, career development, etc.
This is not what drivers want, who are demanding a premium due, according to Thierry Garon (South).
The RATP even puts its proposals for premiums between parentheses, the CGT was indignant, stressing that the management "was not ready to solve a problem when in the roads and the SNCF it is done".
A new meeting is scheduled on Monday for "a wider review of the conditions for practicing the profession," the RATP said.
This also prompted the unions to say that the company "jokes with the users of the weekend".
In the morning, some 150 drivers had invaded an establishment committee at the headquarters in Paris.
It was then that the leadership, which had so far refused to discuss during the strike, had suggested the meeting "in an effort to appease".
The conflict threatens to widen at RER B on Tuesday, after a notice by UNSA and Independents.
The unions are demanding a premium of 120 euros (Unsa) to 150 euros including 30 euros variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, South, Independents) and complaining about the deterioration of working conditions on this line per million daily travelers.
The RER drivers, all in the second part of their career, receive from 2,200 to 2,700 euros in gross as well as 600 to 650 euros in bonuses, for shifted hours, Sundays and holidays.
Turkish justice dissolves pro-Kurdish party, heavy decision of consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court ruled on Friday the dissolution of the country's main pro-Kurdish party, a decision that was immediately followed by demonstrations of anger in the Kurdish community, in the southeast of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision could greatly complicate the task of the government, which has just reached out to the Kurdish community to try to end 25 years of conflict.
The Party for a Democratic Society (DTP) was dissolved because it had become a "foyer of activities detrimental to the independence of the state and its indivisible unity," Court President Hasim Kiliç told reporters after four days of deliberations.
The decision was taken unanimously by 11 judges, while a qualified seven-vote majority was required to pronounce the dissolution, Kiliç said, adding that 37 of the party's executives, including its president Ahmet Türk and MP Aysel Tugluk, were banned from political life for five years.
The judge also announced the lifting of the parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Mr. Türk and Ms. Tugluk and the confiscation of the party's assets by the Treasury.
The DTP has 21 seats in Parliament (out of 550).
Its leaders had warned before the verdict that MPs would leave Parliament rather than sit as unlabeled parliamentarians.
The decision follows proceedings initiated in 2007 by the Prosecutor of the Court of Cassation Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya, who accuses the DTP of obeying the "directives" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), considered a terrorist organization by Ankara and many countries.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political showcase for the PKK rebels.
The party, however, says it has "no organic ties" with the PKK but refuses to call it a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The court’s verdict comes as the government has just reached out to the Kurdish community by proposing a series of measures to strengthen its rights, to try to tarnish Kurdish support for the PKK and end the conflict.
DTP leaders said a dissolution could lead to an escalation of tensions in southeastern Anatolia, where numerous demonstrations against the detention conditions of PKK leader Abdullah <0xC3><0x96>calan have degenerated into clashes with police in recent weeks.
As soon as justice was announced, a thousand protesters gathered in front of the DTP premises in Diyarbakir, the major city in the southeast, which is mostly Kurdish.
Law enforcement fired tear grenades and used water cannons, while protesters threw Molotov cocktails or stones, with fronds.
Hundreds of people also protested in Istanbul.
After the verdict, Türk said the court’s decision would “deepen despair.”
Turkey cannot solve this issue (Kurdish, ndlr) by banning a party, he told the press.
The government, formed by a party from the Islamist movement, also deplored the decision.
We are in principle opposed to the closure of the parties.
This does not solve anything, Energy Minister Taner Yildiz said.
This decision is a total torpedo to the democratic openness launched by the government, commented political analyst Ahmet Insel.
One can, of course, expect a reaction from the PKK, he added.
On Thursday, the PKK claimed an attack that killed seven soldiers three days earlier in northern Turkey, one of the deadliest in recent months.
The first snow can fall.
What Wolfgang Brauburger wants is a very rigorous winter.
But the head of the road clearance and sandblasting service (FES) says that this is not to bother citizens.
This is simply so that agents can test the vehicle technique and learn how to master them well.
And according to meteorologists, this could well be for this weekend.
More than 300 agents and 120 vehicles stand ready to tackle snow and ice.
The ESF is following a very elaborate plan here.
Mr. Brauburger explains that as soon as it starts to snow on the city of Frankfurt and temperatures fall below zero, large sandblasting vehicles run 20 main routes (called routes A).
This includes high-traffic streets, main arteries, such as the Neue Weg and the Hanauer Landstraße.
Also included are fire access, public transport routes, pedestrian areas and sloping streets such as the Atzelbergstraße.
ESF officers begin their service at three in the morning.
If necessary, the 1040 kilometers of road should be salted with a road foundation that adheres well, in a maximum of 3 hours.
This is why the ESF service starts at 3 a.m. "so that the roads are clear when the daily migration traffic begins".
There or it becomes more difficult, it is when the snow begins to fall at 7:30 in the morning.
This poses problems, says the head of the road clearing and sandblasting service "because no motorist is willing to let the salting vehicles pass".
Then, if it does not snow anymore, we take care of access roads and service roads - such as the Rat-Beil-Straße.
The secondary roads and side streets come last.
Mr Brauburger knows well that this always causes some complaints.
At five o'clock in the morning, the ESF pedestrian team sets out to prioritize clearance of areas and passages deemed dangerous.
As for cycle paths, EDF services are generally unable to deal with them.
Mr. Brauburger states that there is a special service in Frankfurt, which is responsible for monitoring the state of the bridges between 22:00 and 4:30.
As ice forms very quickly on these surfaces, salting vehicles intervene as soon as the temperature drops below 2 degrees.
There are also times when the police resort to this special service in case of need.
The Cradle of Dinosaurs
The Tawa hallae resembled other carnivorous dinosaurs: this biped was about 2 meters long by 1.50m high, its hind limbs were powerful, its elongated skull was provided with sharp and curved teeth, its short arms ended in a sickle claw and it had a long tail.
If this species had lived a few million years later, it would have had nothing exceptional.
But, as Sertling Nesbitt of the University of Texas at Austin and colleagues report in Thursday’s Science magazine, the Tawa hallae is one of the first dinosaurs to have these morphological characteristics.
This animal lived 215 million years ago in New Mexico, which at the time was part of the emerging lands of the supercontinent, the Pangea, and was located towards the equator.
Sertling Nesbitt says that the discovery of the Tawa lights up the evolution of the first dinosaurs.
Indeed, it informs us about the kinship ties, the distribution and the characteristics of the latter.
In 2006, Sertling Nesbitt undertook excavations with other paleontologists on the Gohst Ranch site in northern New Mexico.
Randall Irmis of the Utah Museum of Natural History and a member of the excavation team says that they sometimes found a dozen bones in one day, which is absolutely unique for a sedimentary layer dating back to the Triassic.
Scientists quickly realized that some of these bones belonged to a new species.
The excavations updated the remains of five specimens.
A discovery that confirms theories about the beginnings of the evolution of dinosaurs.
The researchers named it Tawa after the Hopi Indian word for the sun god.
For Sterling Nesbitt, this is an exceptional discovery: dinosaur fossils from the Triassic are extremely rare and are limited to a few fragments of incomplete bones.
Not all paleontologists share this enthusiasm.
For example, Martin Sander of the University of Bonn does not find this discovery particularly spectacular, however, he states that it confirms some theories about the beginnings of the evolution of dinosaurs.
According to the current state of knowledge, dinosaurs appeared on Earth about 230 million years ago.
However, most of the oldest fossils are fragmented and incomplete, making it very difficult to classify the first dinosaurs.
Experts wonder, among other things, at what time the saurians divided themselves into three major groups of evolution: the theropods (carnivores) which include the tyrannosaur and the velociraptor that appeared later and from which descend the birds, the sauropods, quadrupeds along the neck, and those that are related to them are the trivore part of which are the trivore and the herbial ones.
According to the studies of S. Nesbitt and his colleagues, the Tawa is one of the first theropods.
This species has an interesting relationship of both primitive and developed characteristics, says S. Nesbitt.
Researchers have found clues that suggest that the Tawa hallae possessed small airbags in its bones at the level of the skull, just like birds that are the descendants of theropods.
These small air pockets make it easier for birds to breathe compared to mammals.
It seems that in the Tawa hallae, the vertebrae were also partially filled with air.
According to Randall Irmis, the Tawa is one of the oldest theropods with small airbags in its bones.
Since the related lineage of the immense sauropods also possessed airbags and a lightweight body, it can be thought that their common ancestor already had this beneficial innovation.
Three successive waves of migration to North America.
Since the earliest known dinosaurs lived in South America, the researchers concluded that the saurians had appeared there.
As a result, the three major lines of evolution split and spread from South America to the rest of the world, i.e. the whole of the emerging lands that formed the Pangea supercontinent.
This seems to be confirmed by the fact that the team of paleontologists also discovered the remains of two other theropods that are not particularly related to it.
The three species cannot descend from a common ancestor who would have migrated, the researchers say.
Alan Turner of the New York Museum of Natural History and co-author of Science Studies magazine says there would have been at least three waves of migration to North America.
There are, of course, some contradictions.
Martin Sander, a paleontologist in Bonn, says there is an even older species, the silesaurus, which lived in present-day Poland and belongs to a group related to dinosaurs.
According to him, this could give a wrong view because there are a large number of dinosaur fossils in South America that have been preserved while virtually none are found on other continents.
On the other hand, how dinosaurs managed to become the dominant tetrapods of the secondary era when they came from a relatively rare collateral line of the reptile branch remains a mystery to this day.
At the time of the Triassic, dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other reptiles, such as with the ancestors of current crocodiles and with many other Saurians.
Towards the end of the Triassic, the dinosaurs spread across the planet, thus fostering the development of many new species, while others, which were related to them, disappeared between the Triassic and Jurassic.
Such a success, however, is not eternal.
To explain this transformation, Martin Sander sees two hypotheses.
There may have been a massive extinction at which dinosaurs randomly survived while other reptiles would have disappeared.
Or else, the dinosaurs were better suited and so they were able to eliminate the competition on the ground.
In any case, such a success is not eternal.
150 million years later, the fall of a meteorite favored the flourishing of a group of animals that had also developed during the Triassic and that since then was vegetation in the shadows: they were mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and there are signatories from all over the world.
There are those of professors from the University of Toronto, the University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna or the University of Berkeley in California.
There are those of lecturers from the University of Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
The police evacuation of the J.W. Goethe University casino in Frankfurt is making waves around the world.
278 professors and teachers from J.W. Goethe University as well as other higher education institutions in Germany, Europe and North and South America express their solidarity with the protesting students of the Westend Campus.
In a statement written in German and English theycondemn the intervention of the police demanded by the university's steering committee.
Last week, University President Werner Müller-Estler ordered the evacuation of buildings occupied by students and teachers on strike after walls and works of art were painted with graffiti.
Five students were injured in the evacuation.
The signatories consider that the degradations did not justify "such a violent intervention by the police commando against students and teachers who had organized their own classes".
Evacuation is an "unacceptable" violation of freedom of research and education.
Focusing attention exclusively on acts of vandalism serves only to "delegitimate and criminalize the protest" and tries to make the reasons for the mobilization forgotten.
The University's Steering Committee has thus avoided debates that would nevertheless be indispensable.
Law enforcement officers require that criminal proceedings initiated be immediately suspended.
The majority of the occupants did not participate in the degradation.
Legitimation of protests
The youth of the Verdi trade union in the service sector and the German Confederation of Trade Unions (DGB) show solidarity with the students.
The protests are just a legitimate expression of growing concern for our own future, says Alexander Klein, regional secretary of the Verdi youth union.
As for the Minister of Science of the Land of Hesse Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU), she took action for the action undertaken by the President of the University and the police.
We thank the President of the University.
Any occupation and degradation of the sites is totally unacceptable, she told the Wiesbaden regional parliament on Thursday during the TV show Aktuelle Stunde.
We understand the meaning of the protests but do not accept vandalism, said the CDU member of the regional parliament Peter Beuth.
The SPD opposition parliamentary groups, the Greens and the Left (the Left) did not share this view.
The CSU takes the pretext of a few painted walls to criminalize the protests, said Janine Wissler of the Left Party (Linke)
Instead of reflecting on the students’ arguments and claims, they are evacuated.
The Left Party has filed a motion summoning the Minister of the Interior to submit a report on the conditions of police intervention.
The new “Silicon-valley”
For a long time it had the reputation of a secret city, forbidden to Western visitors.
Zelenograd, one of the ten districts of Moscow, was, under the Soviet regime, a place of secret weapons research, under strict surveillance.
Today, with its 216,000 inhabitants 37 km from the center of Moscow, the municipality has the reputation of being the Soviet "Silicon Valley".
There are important production and research sites in micro- and nanoelectronics.
Since September 2008, representatives from Zelenograd have established links with Riedberg, the place of the Frankfurt sciences – with the academic institutes and companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There were mutual meetings and last Wednesday representatives of Zelenograd and Riedberg ratified a “Protocol of Close Collaboration”.
The signatories were the Deputy Mayor of Moscow Yuri Rosljak and the Prefect Anatoly Smimov of Zelenograd for the Russian delegation, Edwin Schwarz head of the project section for Frankfurt.
In 2010, representatives of the FIZ and SMEs, whose strength is scientific research, will go to Zelenograd for a seminar.
Scientific exchanges
This is a sustainable scientific exchange.
But also economic relations.
It will allow FIZ companies to enter the expanding Russian market.
On the contrary, Russian scientific societies want to get contracts in Germany.
Zelenograd is home to famous Soviet research institutes and companies.
It includes the Moscow Institute of Electrical Engineering, the major firms Citronics and Rossijskaja-Elektronika.
The municipality was founded in 1958 as a "planned socialist city" for weapons research.
Zelenograd (literally “Green City”) takes its name from the wooded hills in the heart of which the research centers are located.
Project S21: a brake for Stuttgart
The scale of the Stuttgart 21 project cannot be placed high enough.
For its supporters, it is nothing less than a “new heart of Europe”.
S21 is much more than the burial of a railway station, more than a colossal construction project that will plunge the heart of the capital of Baden-Württemberg into a desperate chaos of construction sites for a decade.
Stuttgart 21 was born from the spirit of the 80s.
The main railway stations, with tracks ending in the city, had the reputation at the time of being the relics of 19th-century transport technology that had the effect of brakeing modern rail traffic because it used to take a lot of time to get the locomotives from the rear to the front.
Arrival, short stop, departure – that’s what you have to do.
That is why the headline stations must disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart too: a train station, which is located about halfway on the Trans-European Railroad between Paris and Budapest / Bratislava hence the slogan "heart of Europe".
The realisation of the S21 project is really about to begin, although the visions of the 1980s have long been incompatible with reality.
Even the most ambitious planners recognized that the cost of burying the station in the respective capitals of Hesse and Bavaria was exorbitant.
In fact, head-line stations no longer really pose entry and exit problems since there are modern, reversible trains with car rails and pilot car at both ends.
However, the construction of Stuttgart 21 is now launched alongside the new inter-city line to Ulm.
Regional and municipal policies have won it.
The railway company is on the side of the party because it is the taxpayer who is making the cost of the biggest infrastructure project in the Federal Republic and not the public enterprise.
From an urban point of view, this project is relatively well justified.
We get an urban space that – if you believe the graphics of computer-generated planners – will be very green.
For the rail transport system the S21 is harmful.
The crossing station and the enlargement of the section are designed for human trafficking that was attributed - and this is typical of the 1980s - to huge growth.
At the time, there was no competition for cheap flights.
Modern traffic policy should first focus on strengthening freight traffic because rail transport is much more environmentally friendly than trucking on the road.
But the new route, with its slopes, is not suitable for freight trains.
The S21, and this is much more serious, indirectly concerns many other rail projects.
For example, six billion euros will be engulfed in the Souabe project.
That's the official figure.
Experts think that ten to fifteen billion is more realistic.
One thing is certain, in the next decade this money will be missing for other junction points and congestion in the network.
In all, the Ministry of Transport lists sixty major projects.
One of the most important is the enlargement of the section through the Rhine Valley by 180 good kilometers.
Since 1987, this line has been built at a slow pace.
It would be really urgent to push the mushroom in depth here.
But the S21 project has the effect of a brake shoe.
The Rhine Valley itinerary is about to become the bottleneck of international commodity traffic in the heart of Europe.
The government is reviewing the ruling on the airport
In the Wiesbaden Regional Parliament, the Land Government referred to the possibility of appealing the judgment of the Administrative Court of Hesse concerning the prohibition of night flight.
Economics Minister Dieter Posch (FDP) announced that the CDU/FDP coalition had commissioned experts to examine from a legal point of view the ruling of the Administrative Tribunal, which is a document of more than 400 pages.
The Kassel Court had justified in a written document that the Land should adapt the regulation on the prohibition of night flights in the event that the project to build the northwest runway of Frankfurt Airport would be realized.
Authorization to land for 17 aircraft between 11 a.m. and 5 a.m., as envisaged by the Land government, is not compatible with the legal protection of citizens against night air pollution.
The coalition must have decided by January 4 if it wants to appeal against the ruling.
The opposition criticizes this deadline and tries to pressure the government representative to appeal to the Federal Administrative Tribunal in Leipzig.
The leader of the SPD parliamentary group Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel invites the CDU and the FDP to return to their pre-election promise of banning night theft, otherwise it will be condensed as a total failure to a given word.
It is very difficult to be allowed to keep his word, said the leader of the Greens Tarek Al-Wazir, referring to the electoral slogan of the FDP "We keep our promises".
Minister Dieter Posch refutes the accusations of Schäfer-Gümbel, who claims that the Land government is still trying to authorize night flights using "avocado and robbery".
It takes time to carry out a specific legal review.
The coalition does not want to make a decision on the basis of a "first quick impression".
The decision must be legally sound, says Stefan Müller (FDP).
The opposition's interpretation of its faction's statements on the prohibition of night flights is completely erroneous.
U.S. Banks Repay Allowed Aid
The major U.S. banks, deeply affected by the crisis, are breaking away from their ties to the state.
Bank of America announced on Wednesday that it had fully repaid the Treasury $45 billion (more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>30 billion), corresponding to the aid granted under the Tarp bailout plan.
The American television channel CNBC reported in a report that Citigroup was also considering repaying the aid received.
Banking institutions thus seek to get rid of the restrictions imposed, which accompanied the acceptance of amounts, such as the limitation of bonuses awarded to managers and the settlement of higher fees.
The Bank of Americaa launched a capital increase by selling securities to investors that brought it $19 billion in fresh money.
The rest of the money comes from the bank's cash registers, which are well filled thanks to the sale of several branches from other sectors.
Last Wednesday evening, Kenneth Lewis, the CEO of Bank of America, expressed his gratitude to U.S. taxpayers: the capital injection has helped significantly to overcome a difficult period.
The banking institution had assumed its capabilities by acquiring investment bank Merrill Lynch at the height of the financial turmoil.
The Citigroup is also considering acquiring money on the financial markets in order to free itself from the tutelage of the state.
The U.S. bank could launch a $20 billion capital increase on Thursday, CNBC reported, citing the banking community.
The Citigroup spokesman did not want to comment on this information.
In June, banks Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had reimbursed the public funds they had benefited from.
Accelerated Election
Eventually, everything happened faster than expected.
Just two weeks after the dismissal of the current editor-in-chief Nikolaus Brender by the Board of Directors of the German broadcaster ZDF, the successor has already been appointed.
The committee wanted to vote last night to make the appointment.
Peter Frey, who runs the Berlin editorial office of ZDF, was the big favorite.
However, the chain did not want to confirm - officially - the vote in order not to anticipate the procedure.
However, it appears that there was also a desire not to further harm ZDF's Superintendent Markus Schächter in the event that the proposal would not be accepted by the Board of Directors.
Frey, who is Schächter's candidate, needed the vote of 9 of the 14 members of the Commission.
The result of the vote was not yet known at the end of the drafting of this edition.
Two weeks ago, Schächter proposed to the Board of Directors to extend Nikolaus Brender’s contract by five years, but this was rejected.
Only seven members of the Council had declared themselves in favour of Brender's reappointment and seven others had voted against, and Brender's impeachment by vote was a foreseeable failure for Schächter.
Indeed, the CDU, which is a majority in the Board of Directors, had already indicated several weeks before the vote that it did not want to reinstate Brender.
It was Roland Koch, the Prime Minister of the Land of Hesse, who organized a league against the editor-in-chief.
He had refused to extend the contract of the highly esteemed editor-in-chief by citing the fact that the ZDF's eavesdropping rate had fallen under Brender.
This is why protests were still taking place, almost until the vote, whipping up the growing political influence exerted on the ZDF.
In the end, there were even 35 public law experts who had interfered in the debate and who felt that Koch’s way of acting was unconstitutional.
But it's not going to help.
Peter Frey: Who is he?
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied political science, pedagogy and Romance languages (Spanish).
He then worked at the Südwestfunk (Rhineland-Palatinate radio station) and the Frankfurter Rundschau (German daily newspaper of national scope).
In 1983 he became editor at the ZDF first in the "heute-journal" news magazine (journal of today).
Then his journey continues: from 1988 to 1990 he was the deputy editor-in-chief of the time; then correspondent in Washington in 1991/1992, then and until 1998 he was the head and presenter of the "Morgenmagazins" (two-monthly information show presented in the morning); until 2001 he was responsible for the ZDA foreign policy department.
After Brender’s disgrace, while he had just been voted Journalist of the Year by the magazine Medium Magazin, the Greens announced that they would file a constitutional complaint.
Koch’s opponent on the Board of Directors, the Prime Minister of Rhineland-Palatinate Kurt Beck, said last week that the Länder should transform the ZDF Intergovernmental Treaty so that the Intendant’s staff proposals cannot be blocked by a partial political majority.
However, Beck does not intend to ask for the removal of political figures from the ZDF’s supervisory committees.
Peter Frey, Brender's likely successor, had skillfully maneuvered with the Board of Directors by vehemently criticizing the commission in its decision to dismiss Brender.
Thanks to this proof of journalistic independence, Schächter was able to propose him for the position of editor-in-chief without losing face, just as the Board of Directors could elect him without being suspected of placing a political supporter in the position.
In the arithmetic representations of the parties, Frey is ranked liberal of the left.
Great cleaning in the university studies
Partial success for students: after a year of educational strike, the Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs of the Länder decided to be more conciliatory: at a meeting between the Ministers and the delegates of the Rectors' Conference, an agreement was reached stating that the working conditions of Bachelor or Master students should be improved.
In the future, students should be able to complete their studies.
In particular, they agreed to lighten the weight of the examinations: a single examination must allow the chosen study module to be completed.
In addition, the workload will need to be reconsidered to ensure "realistic and acceptable proportions".
Political authorities and higher education institutions wish to facilitate the recognition of exams between universities and abroad.
The Länder are also committed to organising more flexible common structural requirements for the Bachelor and Master courses.
At the regional level, there should be no different regulations from one country to another.
Less Examinations
Since the start of student protests in June last year, the Ministers of Education of the Länder and the rectors of universities have been using the phrase "studyability" in their mouths.
But for the first time, this expression seems to take on a concrete meaning.
The Accreditation Board has decided to considerably reduce the number of certain exams: "Each module must normally be able to be completed by a single exam," reads a 30-page paper on future conditions for admission to university cycles.
Reinhold Grimm, Chairman of the Accreditation Board, said that by significantly reducing the burden of exams, we should be able to stop slippages, which were significantly detrimental to studyability.
In addition, "studyability" should be the decisive criterion for the organisation of studies in the future.
The modules as well as the background should be carefully examined to see if one can avoid this feeling of suffocation that is sometimes felt in the choice of courses.
Hamburg/Berlin - According to the latest knowledge in RAID on Kunduz, the opposition believes that Defence Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) is guilty of deliberate deception.
Students should "have the opportunity and the maneuverability necessary to enable and foster personal initiative".
The new regulation will cover access to new academic cycles but will also be adapted to existing cycles.
These cycles must be "reaccredited" every 5 years, which means, however, that only in 2015 will all cycles be reviewed.
There are 10 competent accreditation agencies throughout the federal territory that depend on the accreditation councils created by the Länder.
In October, the Ministers of Education had put some pressure on the Länder to impose a burden on the agencies so that the programmes were not overloaded and the examination regime not too strict.
In some Länder, universities and specialized higher education institutions have already consulted with their regional ministries to take appropriate action.
To date, Rhineland-Palatinate is the only country to have agreed to allocate more resources to the development of the Bologna process.
With these funds, universities must organize tutorial programs and strengthen the educational guidance offices as well as the examination offices and the service of international relations
The Länder and the universities provide for a budget of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>10 million.
In early 2010, the government wanted to introduce an amendment to the Higher Education Institutions Act in Parliament.
As a result, it will only be necessary to pass a single exam to complete his studies.
The organisation of the studies will have to be more flexible, the recognition of the notes of other higher education institutions must be guaranteed and access to the Master must be simplified.
By the end of next year, the "studyability" of all academic cycles will have to be examined.
On Thursday, the government and the opposition again debated the question of the conditions of study in the country.
Decisions were appreciated, but criticisms were heard.
The Federal President of the Union of Socialist Students said he would like to see the organization of education policy no longer take place "behind the closed doors" of ministers and university rectors.
At the latest after the educational strike, students as concerned persons should be able to express themselves a little.
The future graduates of higher education received the support of the President of the Delegates of the Rectors Conference (HRK) Margret Wintermantel: "The experience of the students is very useful to us," she said Thursday during a meeting with the Ministers of Education of the Länder with whom the HRK is working on a joint reform project.
For the Union of Education and Science (GEW) decisions made in Bonn do not go far enough. It demands the right and opportunity for each Bachelor graduate to enroll in a Master's cycle.
Andreas Keller, member of the GEW Steering Committee, also asks that the Länder assure today's Bachelor students that tomorrow there will be enough places for Master's studies and as good study conditions as possible.
As a result, the Länder need to hire more trainees.
On the other hand, the Ministers of Education did not mention the possibility of facilitating access to the Master.
More than a footnote on Herta Müller
It is with these words "Arrived in Germany and it is beautiful, almost more control..." that a work by the poet Werner Söllner begins, in which he thematizes in snippets of disturbing phrases, the experiences of a dissident who arrived in Germany who gained freedom but at the same time lost his linguistic territory.
Werner Söllner, born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, was first a teacher of German and English in Bucharest and later a director of collections in a youth publishing house before moving to Frankfurt am Main.
Söllner has received various literary awards; in 1993 he held the coveted chair of poetry at Goethe University Frankfurt and since 2002 he has been director of the Hessian literary forum at the artist house of Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
He made a lot of talk about him in non-literary circles last Tuesday at a congress in Munich, whose theme was "German literature in Romania in the mirror and the distorting mirror of your Securitate files".
Visibly destabilized and embarrassed, Söllner made a statement in which he acknowledged before his fellow German-Romanian writers such as Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer that he had collaborated as an informant for the Securitate political police.
Söllner received the German Language Award in 1989 together with some of the participants.
Enlistment trials had insidiously begun in 1971.
I am, concludes Söllner, “so someone who has not been able to resist sufficiently the intimidation attempts of the Securitate”.
The poet Werner Söllner is the informant Walter (IM Walter).
Almost simultaneously with the awarding of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller and her exemplary literary detachments with the mechanisms of the power of the dictatorship, the literary scene is shaken and in particular the community of German authors from Romania, by a case that clearly shows the abysses and the baseness of a political system.
Werner Söllner is, as far as we can tell from current knowledge, not only guilty but also a victim.
In his own file Securitate, IM Walter played a role, assures literature specialist Michael Markel after Söllner's confession and he refers to the positive influence of IM Walter who had interceded in his favor.
“He could have pulled him out of all the difficult situations at the time,” according to Markel.
Markel felt the moral need to make this comment.
The form in which Söllner made his statement and in front of this audience was unexpected, however, the confession of a former dissident of his collaboration with the Romanian secret services is in fact not so surprising.
Germany is a pleasant reserve for the spies of the Securitate had already written Herta Müller in July in the newspaper "Die Zeit", after reading the 914 pages of her own file.
It can be assumed that the victims have made speculations and have sometimes guessed which real names were last hiding the names of borrowers Sorin, Voicu and also Walter.
Unlike in Germany, where in the meantime the consultation of the Stasi files is a reliable process, the attitude towards the legacy of the Securitate files is still very confusing.
Systematic clarification has been continually counteracted and slowed down in recent years.
It was only in 1999 that a national council corresponding to the Birthler institution was created to work on the assimilation of the Securitate archives (CNSAS) but the return of the files has rather delayed since then.
There has been a law since 2005 that defines the management of archives.
That the influence of former members of the Securitate in Romania is still very large, is confirmed by the interview of a former head of the Securitate of Temesvar who, after the announcement of the award of the Nobel Prize to Herta Müller, spoke in a very disdainful way towards the winner.
She had a psychosis, and in the end she had only been questioned once.
The infamy of power thought it could be expressed here, without any genes, under the guise of freedom of expression.
Certainly, many unavoidable questions are associated with the Söllner case as it so often occurs in a context of hidden guilt.
The weighted reaction of the listeners, Söllner admits, gives hope that the continuation of this chapter will be defined more by a thirst for knowledge than by accusations and a sense of shame.
On the genesis of the work of Herta Müller, who received the Nobel Prize yesterday, it is more than a note at the bottom of the page.
Unrest in the Champions League
We had the impression that a representative was arriving there, pulled with four pins coming straight from a nice Christmas party, on which the sporting goods manufacturer had spread his goods when the new VFB coach Christian Gross climbed at midnight less the quarter in a Mercedes Class C, which he had just called the supplier, a bag.
The man, whose bald skull drew attention, allowed himself to be driven into the city which was still foreign to him.
Otherwise, our fifty-year-old could have driven himself – he hadn’t drunk alcohol and he wasn’t drunk with happiness either.
He had a nice evening but tomorrow we had to get back to work.
'Cause it was about to start.
The words of Switzerland that we had just started three days earlier were clear: "We have reached the eighth final", i.e. in the Champions League thanks to our 3:1 against Unirea Urziceni of Romania ", but we must not let ourselves be blinded by the success. It will be a brutal fight to not retake".
The “great work” awaits us on Sunday.
Here, it is about repeating in Mainz the results of the Champions League on a daily basis.
And it will be necessary to overcome the weaknesses that surfaced after the three expeditionary goals of Marica (5.), Träsch (8.) and Pogrebnyak (11.)
Lottery draw
The eighth final of the Champions League (outgoing match 16./17. + 23./24 February/return match 9./10. + 16./17. March) will be drawn on 18 December in Nyon.
The joy of the fulminant successor of Babbel was therefore moderate.
And the joy was not only moderate in the one who had brought good luck, who had passed on to the unstable Stuttgart professionals, an unfailing motivation and the pleasure of playing.
I went to see the players and told them they had to focus on their strengths, I advised them to be braver, explained the "plumber of souls" - Gross - the recipe for success that sounded so good that it no longer made any effects with the caregiver Babbel.
It triggered a certain magic, Jens Lehmann – a supporter of Babbel – confesses, “in football when there is a new impulse sometimes things happen that one would never have thought possible.”
And Sami Khedira, who, after weeks of break for injury, advanced to the rank of the best player thanks to his dynamism, tried to describe the "phenomenon" observed by a proverbial "fresh wind" and the method of work of the new boss: "It's someone who goes into action and demands discipline.
That’s what we need in the current situation.”
Apparently Babbel was missing.
VfB Stuttgart has not yet crossed the cap, warns manager Horst Heldt
At the moment, VfB Stuttgart especially needs tenacity.
Like Gross, the players and the manager are careful not to overestimate the victory against a totally outdated and weakened defense of Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow before having had a bad wake-up at Leverkusen with the 0:4, objected Khedira.
Horst Heldt, the manager, said that they had achieved one of the goals of the season but that there were others that were still a long way off.
We have not yet crossed the difficult path.
That Heldt on his 40th birthday did not have the heart to celebrate, even after the first home win in three months, is due to the events of the weekend that a television interview of goalkeeper Jens Lehmann made bounce back just before the start of the game.
There are decisions that others make and not Jens, Heldt would counter, in response to Lehmann’s harsh criticism.
He had accused the management of style weakness and said she had decided to change coach under pressure from puberty fans.
Lehmann had also judged as a sign of a lack of sovereignty and jealousy that his day off after the matches had been suppressed.
Lehmann’s statements were “marked by pure selfishness” Heldt pushed down and announced consequences for the goalkeeper.
They were no longer in danger of becoming friends for life for these two 40-year-olds.
In any cast, they agreed on everything else, that is, without the group's prior work by the replaced coach, strong sporting and combative representation would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants were "for the most part successful," Heldt and Lehmann replied in choir – and even the man in the plastic bag acquiesced.
Category: World Heavyweight Championships
Hot fight in Bern: Kevin Johnson the challenger constantly provoked the world champion Vitali Klitschko verbally and gestually.
But after twelve difficult rounds the Ukrainian defends his title of world heavyweight champion according to the version of the WBC federation.
With the unanimity of the judges, he prevailed on the points.
Hamburg – Vitali Klitschko retains his title as world heavyweight champion.
The WBC federation announced that on Saturday night the 38-year-old champion had won a points victory at the unanimous vote of the judges against American Kevin Johnson (120:10).
For the third time Klitschko has defended his title since his comeback on stage in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainian had already won twice the title of world champion of the WBO and WBC federations.
Unfortunately, he failed the long-awaited KO.
Klitschko, who won 39 times in 41 professional fights, had to admit twice his defeat due to injuries.
The challenger Johnson had to accept his first defeat in the 24th fight.
In the Arena of Bern, in front of 17,000 spectators, the great Klitschko wanted to dictate the fight, from the top of its 2.02 meters, by his left.
Johnson, eleven centimeters smaller who, before the duel, had announced the end of the Klitschko era, managed to avoid the champion's blows, thus preventing Klitschko from getting his dangerous right against him into play.
Johnson, too passive in action for a challenger, has mostly tried to pass the rounds.
Although he continued to provoke Klitschko in words and gestures, his blows rarely reached the champion.
He is still the second boxer after Timo Hoffman in the year 2000, having exceeded with Klitschko the distance of the twelve rounds.
The challenger had made a lot of noise in the Swiss capital before the fight.
He insulted Klitschko, calling him a "vulnerable zombie" who "is not really capable".
During the weigh-in on Friday, the champion couldn't help but provoke Johnson by dropping his sunglasses from his nose "to be able to see his eyes".
Fourth win since Klitschko's comeback.
Klitschko won again in his fourth fight since his comeback on October 11, 2008.
After a nearly four-year break, he had beaten then-Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and recovered "his" WBC belt that he had previously had to give up without fighting.
This year, defending his championship title, he won the fight against Juan Carlos Gomez of Cuba and in September against Chris Arreola of the USA.
“I just took a shot in this fight and I’m in perfect shape,” Klitschko said to explain his quick return to the ring.
His dream is to try to bring together in the family the four most important titles.
His brother Vladimir is a champion of the WBO and IBF federations.
But it is the British David Haye who, having dethroned the great Nikolai Walujew - 2.13 meters - in November, wears the belt of the WBA.
This summer, Haye had cancelled a match against Vitali Klitschko that was due to take place in September.
It would seem that his promotion company is now planning to play this match at Wembley Stadium in London.
The Kunduz case
Frontal attack by the opposition: the leader of the Greens’ parliamentary group, Jürgen Trittin, accused the Minister of Defense Guttenberg of lying in the case of the Kunduz affair.
The SPD and the Left (the Left) parties ask the Chancellor for explanations.
Hamburg/Berlin - After reviewing the latest information on the Kunduz airstrike, the opposition has accused Defence Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) of deliberately concealing certain facts.
The minister intentionally "formulated a misconception" about the deadly attack on two tanker trucks last September, the head of the Greens' parliamentary group, Jürgen Trittin, said on Saturday during the broadcast of information channel ARD "Tagesschau" (the newspaper of 20h).
Clearly, it means he lied.
The order to kill was given in total disregard of the rules of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is, in essence, the content of the report at the disposal of NATO and which was read by Mr Guttenberg, said Trittin.
Last Friday, according to new media revelations, the aim of the strike was not to destroy the stolen trucks, but to eliminate two important Taliban leaders.
According to the NATO investigation report, 142 people were killed or wounded in the U.S. airstrike that was launched at the request of German Colonel Goerg Klein, military commander of Kunduz.
On Saturday, the Greens, the SPD and the Left asked Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to speak in front of the federal parliament as soon as possible and to reveal what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Jürgen Trittin and his Green Party colleague Renate Künast are of the opinion that Ms Angela Merkel must say clearly whether the targeted massacre strategy is part of the federal government’s Afghan policy and whether the chancellery, army and intelligence services have approved this new strategy.
The Government's spokesman categorically rejects these criticisms.
The chancellorship has in no way influenced military interventions in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, voices were getting louder and louder to express doubts about the real reasons for the dismissal of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert, as this had been presented by the ministry.
According to the SPIEGEL newspaper, the information they had provided to Guttenberg about the tanker attack was both correct and complete.
Officially, they would have concealed the existence of the NATO report and hidden some annoying details from the Minister.
The two senior officials, however, suggest that they have informed the Ministry of Defence of the existence of several reports, including a two-page document from Colonel Klein and a report from the military police.
The "Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung" reports that Wichert had in the meantime requested in a letter a clarification of the facts.
So far, he has not received an answer.
On Saturday, the Department declined to comment on these allegations and referred to the federal parliamentary commission of inquiry, which was set up the following Wednesday to shed light on the facts in question.
The worlds of the dream
Some see, all awake, images and hear voices that no one else sees or hears.
It is not only in the mentally ill, or under the influence of drugs, that the boundaries between imagination and reality confuse.
As long as these phenomena manifest themselves during sleep, everything is fine.
When we lie in our dark rooms, we can unhinderedly indulge in the wildest dreams and fantasies.
However, he who, awakened, experiences a dream state, hears and sees things that others do not perceive, quickly has the reputation in our Western world of being crazy or drugged, or at least of being an original.
Such images and voices do not appear only in psychiatric patients or under the influence of drugs.
It is our imagination that is at stake: it is the same neural activity that allows us to design houses, paint paintings or write novels, but that sometimes incites the boundaries between dream, madness and reality to merge.
A conscious state of awakening, taking the form of a dream, can present itself in the most diverse forms, at best it is called visions, at worst madness.
But even if the trigger and effect differ, the visions of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiences of the New Age prophet Carlos Castaneda, the secondary states of shamans, psychoses and hallucinations are attributable to very similar processes.
There are hallucinations or delusions when the balance of neurotransmitter substances in the brain - primarily dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin and achetylcholine - is broken and the interaction between different parts of the brain is disrupted.
Complex hallucinations and delusional thoughts very often manifest during schizophrenic psychosis.
The force of earthly attraction no longer has power over the person.
Since ancient times, philosophers and doctors have always looked at the relationship between madness and dreaming.
For Aristotle, hallucinations were a form of awakened dreaming; Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, found in 1861 "a great resemblance between madness and dreaming", for Sigmund Freud the dream was even "a psychosis with all the irregularities, imaginations, delusions and sensory illusions that the composing".
We are in the fall of 2001 when Henning T turns into a comic book character.
His body is in two dimensions with crisp colors.
The earthly attraction no longer has power over him, he flies at the edge of the ceiling.
He feels a blow.
Behind him are winged, grimacing devil creatures, their mouths bleed, showing their teeth.
They chase him, kick him with heavy flamboyant boots, throw him against the walls, he feels pain all over the body.
Toning, nasty voices, screaming, coming out of the walls and the radio.
He can no longer bear those voices that insult and humiliate him.
Henning T. pulls two cables from his stereo, actually a loop and attaches it to a hook attached to the ceiling.
He climbs on a baffle and passes the loop around the neck.
He's jumping.
The loop is detached.
Let this be a lesson to you, shout the voices in a choir to rip off his tympanum. "Go to a clinic and get yourself cured!"
Today Henning T. is 40 years old, he has lived six acute psychoses, the last date of 2 years, the first of almost 20 years.
It was triggered by LSD.
The diagnosis: schizo-affective psychosis, paranoid, in addition he is manic-depressive, he takes medications against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness, he has been married for three years.
During psychosis, I experienced terrible fears and deep despair.
Illusions are a cruel reality.
Approximately one percent of the population suffers from schizophrenia at least once in their life; in psychiatric clinics it is the most common disease after depression.
In a schizophrenia crisis, those affected can no longer distinguish between the inner world and the outer world, they find themselves in a state of hyperexcitation, which can cause them to suffer from hallucinations, megalomania, relational madness or persecution.
It is very common to hear voices—voices that command, comment, or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are not uncommon either.
The person concerned can no longer distinguish between the important and the insignificant, the brain can no longer filter the disturbing signals, the conscious is drowned under the sensations.
Just like dreaming, psychosis opens the doors to a tide of ideas and fantasies from the deeper layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is centered on the subject, according to Professor Thomas Fuchs, head of the department of psychiatry at the CHU Heidelberg (Allgemeine Psychiatrie im Universitätsklinikum).
Schizophrenia is at the center of the situation, all with a meaning centered on it.
At the same time he finds himself in a passive role, he is like in a dream, overcome by events and cannot act on them actively.
This is why schizophrenics often feel threatened, controlled, manipulated.
In general they do not have the opportunity to adjust reality, illusions are a cruel reality, waking up is excluded.
Experience a hallucination once in your life.
Unlike dream, according to Fuchs, “the sensory and spatial structure of reality that is perceived during psychosis is fundamentally preserved.”
Delusional thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, the alienation of the lived takes place in a real setting.
Why our brain makes these kinds of cabriolets is always a mystery for researchers.
Exceptional situations can cause everyone to temporarily lose their perception of reality, according to Fuchs.
But only a small number of people will develop a psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but studies on twins have shown that genes are not the only determinants.
The researchers assume that the people involved have minor brain injuries.
It is assumed that the neuronal maturation of the brain is disrupted at an early stage of development, for example by a viral infection of the mother during pregnancy, Fuchs explains.
But what remains unexplained is how the abnormality of the neural system occurs and, moreover, the fact that it does not manifest itself for many years.
Environmental factors also play a role – stress or a traumatic experience can be a trigger for psychosis, however, if there is a predisposition.
Similarly, hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychoses because they act on neurotransmitters.
When our brains heat up.
What is crazy, says psychology professor Erich Kasten of Lübeck, is that psychotics suffer from their hallucinations and take expensive drugs to get rid of them while others buy drugs that are very expensive to get.
The pleasant or unpleasant perception of illusions is often just a matter of point of view.
Kasten has been collecting reports on hallucinations and phenomena of illusory images for ten years: last year he published his findings in a book entitled "The Unreal World in Our Heads".
Hallucinations are one of the typical concomitant phenomena of psychoses, but also an impressive number of other pathologies.
These include mental disorders such as borderline or depression but also migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease or skull trauma.
It is surprising to find that under certain conditions even the brains of healthy people are prone to hallucinations.
Hallucinations, according to Kasten, consist of fragments of memories that are normally inhibited.
They take shape when the areas of the brain that process sensory perceptions are hyperactive or not sufficiently restrained; when our brain heats up but also when there is no stimulation.
Drugs can trigger this condition just like brain injury or psychosis.
But also the lack of stimulus, stress, sorrows of love or other exceptional mental states.
In recent studies, one-third of participants admit to having experienced a hallucination at least once in their lives.
In the summer of 2005 Sarah K. is 16 years old, she lives in a small town of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and she goes to high school.
A girl who does everything normal, really.
If there were no images and voices.
During the recreation, it happens that a young boy, thin, with long brown hair, addresses him.
When she answers her, her comrades look at her, astonished – no one else sees or hears this boy.
They think this shy girl is a lunatic dreamer but Sarah K does not dream, she is sure.
She wakes up, hears and sees this boy just as she sees and hears the girl sitting next to her on the bench.
It can even perceive its presence momentarily.
It's a nice feeling, she finds this young nice.
“Am I crazy?” she asks sometimes.
But she knows well that this young man and the other visions are not real and that they will disappear again.
At night, the apparitions are usually frightening.
Often the visions are heavy.
When she’s in class, it happens that she can’t take the class because the teacher is just introducing a new student to her eyes and ears while he’s invisible to others and the teacher is visibly explaining equations in the picture.
At night, the apparitions are usually frightening.
When, in the darkness of her room, she waits for the sleep that comes too rarely and far too late, she often cannot distinguish whether she is awake or already dreaming, if the images she sees, the grinning faces or the young girl with bloody cuts on her arms and legs are in front of her open eyes or iron.
Leave me alone, she cries to these creatures.
She doesn't talk about it to her parents or friends, they'd think she was crazy.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is now 20 years old.
She got her bachelor's degree last year and she lives with her friend.
A year ago the hallucinations stopped.
Since she came into contact via the Internet with psychologist Kasten she knows very well that she is not crazy.
Madness is also a work of art of despair.
When someone is socially isolated or does not have enough stimulation, the likelihood is that they will have hallucinations after a certain period of time.
I guess the brain isn't busy enough, making sure there's animation.
Sarah K., an only daughter, was afraid of other children when she was little and often played alone.
Her hallucinations began when she learned at 13 that the man she called Dad, since she was of thought age, was not her real father.
It is the same brain areas that are active for visual and acoustic hallucinations, and for real impressions and noises, so it is very difficult for people like Sarah K to make the difference between illusion and reality. "Every experience," according to Kasten "takes place in the brain, reality is formed from there.
Hallucinations are also images that form in the brain, which is why they seem so real.”
For Kasten, night dreams are also a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people are not fundamentally different from those in acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenics, a mentally healthy person is able to recognize that fantasies are not real images.
That’s why Kasten advises her patients to cherish hallucinations as a particular talent.
There is only one step between dream and hallucination.
In our too conscious world, unfortunately, we quickly tend to take imaginary experiences for pathologies, according to Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor at Heidelberg and head physician at the clinic for psychiatry and psychotherapy at the Florence Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a serious, painful disease but which also contains something positive, of creator - madness is a work of art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard studied the form of experience called oniroid, a particular form of the alteration of consciousness awakened by dream.
Oniroid experiences are very complex semi-dreams that are perceived as real by the one who lives them and that he cannot differentiate from the dream even when he is awake.
The oniroid state of consciousness manifests itself during trauma or in situations of extreme pathologies as for patients with polyradiculopathy who are fully conscious, experience motor paralysis.
According to Schmidt-Degenhard, when a human being is threatened by a loss of self and of the world, due to a total and lasting inability to move, he replaces this real situation that undermines his life, with his own imaginary world that is dissociated from reality.
It is a state of mental limitation between dreaming and hallucination.
Since it is not possible to overcome the situation in reality, a world change takes place but the real situation is represented in the imagination.
It is, in fact, an intense form of means and interpretation, in an intolerable situation in itself, an organizational capacity that is given to us, to us men, so as not to sink into the void of loss of consciousness.
Everything is real even later in the memories.
Zurich-based art historian Peter Cornelius Classen also describes his oniroid experiences in his book "Change of heart" as a soul-saving action.
He is 49 years old, at the time of his conscious departure for a trip of several days after the operation of a heart valve followed by a transplant; in the meantime, his body is doomed to remain immobile in resuscitation.
Claussen plunges into a world he has created from all parts, visiting foreign places, traveling through time. He sees himself as an old man lying in a railway sanatorium, a robot at his bedside watching over his health.
He lived in the Middle Ages among nobles who made blood-based narcotics.
He is abducted by a Greek biker who takes him to his country, surfs with his hospital bed in the snow of the Alps and meets a Korean mobster.
He is completely absorbed into this imaginary world, everything is real even later in his memories.
According to Claussen, these inner journeys are fundamentally different from any dream.
The dream is a completely different state, he writes describing what he has lived.
Unlike dreams, memories from mental journeys are extremely clear and very detailed even years later.
It can even be said that they are much more distinct and more intense than the actual experience.
The intensity of this experience explodes the horizon of our other daily experiences, according to psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Ultimately, oniroid delusions, psychoses, hallucinations, and psychedelic experiences show us how fragile our inner representations of external reality are, even in a waking state.
Any change in the state of consciousness, summarizes psychologist Kasten, “can cause a distortion of what we call reality.”
An experience that can also be quite enriching.
The first snow can fall.
Burda
At the age of 27, the children will take over from the publishing house.
Kallen’s appointment as CEO of Burda is an intermediate solution: in the longer term, Hubert Burda wants his two children to take over the press group, he told the Spiegel newspaper.
The holding company must remain a 100% family business.
Hamburg - In the long run, publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children
The two children will inherit at 27 and are firmly determined to integrate into society, Hubert Burda, 69, told Spiegel.
All details have been settled in advance.
The question of whether they will be active in the company will be asked later.
It will also be necessary to see if they are able to do so.
We cannot impose our children on 7,500 employees without knowing if they have the capacity to take care of them.
This would demolish the children as well as the company.
Burda had announced last Thursday that he was retiring from the post of President-Director-General as early as January and that his successor was Paul-Bernhard Kallen.
Kallen, 52, has been a member of the Board of Directors since 1999.
He was first and foremost responsible for the technology sector.
Later he took care of the Treasury sector, that is, he was responsible for the company's capital and after the departure of Jürgen Todenhöfer he also took over the head of marketing, the foreign sector, printing and finance.
So for the first time it is not a member of the family who is at the head of Burda editions.
Burda's children are 19 and 17 years old, respectively, and his son Felix, who was 42 years old today, died a few years ago.
The appointment of Kallen also serves as a link for the next 10 or 15 years.”
Burda specifies that the holding must remain 100% in the hands of the family.
Ruins have always occurred in families that have let themselves be driven by a capital bulimia, who have made huge unfortunate speculations thinking they could climb ever higher.
This has never been my strategy.
I have never had a dream of universal power, Burda said.
I absolutely don't see myself as the preceptor of the country as Springer could be and I don't intend to be part of these international leagues like Time, these companies have taken too much importance.
Integral Beauty
Everything you can desire, in terms of beauty and well-being, at your fingertips.
This is the objective that seems to have been set by El Corte Inglés, which has just opened in the commercial center of Callao (Madrid), a multidisciplinary space of more than 1000 m2, dedicated to the care and attention of the body.
The spa, located on the eighth floor, houses prestigious brands such as Hedonai, specialist in laser hair removal, Spaxion, with its relaxation rooms and aesthetic treatments, Luis & Tachi, hairdressers, Marina d'Or, which has a gym, or L'Occitane and its other natural cosmetics.
There is also a food radius, with especially a tea room, which offers more than 130 different types.
Spaxion offers you among other things to enjoy a relaxing massage with your companion, while contemplating the exceptional views of the capital, or rent for two hours the relaxation area to organize your own “Beauty Party” with eight of your friends and relax thanks to a jacuzzi session, massages while drinking a glass of champagne.
In total, it is 250 m2 divided into 12 rooms, where you can benefit from the most innovative facial, body and hydrotherapy treatments.
Like, for example, cavitation to fight cellulite or vibrating platforms.
The gym also has these devices, as well as virtual "trainers" who guide the steps of the customers, offering them a fully personalized treatment.
It all starts with entering your personal code on a touch screen, located in front of the device.
Several videos then show us how to properly perform our exercise program.
Its director assures that 15 minutes (including heating and stretching) are enough to work all the muscles of the body.
And, if after having our body work, we want to go through the hair salon, the Luis & Tachi brand has a room where we offer rituals of hair repair, brightness or nutrition, all personalized.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to have been the motto of this urban spa, which will be open every day of the year from 10am to 10pm.
Variety of necklines
Christmas is approaching and it is never superfluous to study the look of the stars to adapt it to our party wardrobe.
The shape of the neckline, very important for highlighting the silhouette, is one of the variables that we need to take into account.
Here are some suggestions.
The singer Fergie chose an exaggerated and very complicated neckline. This is not very advised.
Endesa and Barcelona buy electric car
The electric company Endesa, in collaboration with the Barcelona City Council, has created the “LIVE Oficina”.
This is a project aimed at developing and promoting the electric vehicle in the Catalan capital.
The “LIVE Workshop” (Logistics for the Implementation of the Electric Vehicle) will define and coordinate the roadmap for the deployment of the electric car in the city and will implement mobility agreements, by conducting procedures, coordinating, presenting grants, etc.
In addition, it will develop the MOVELE project, promote the electric car, gather the opinion and work of the sectors involved.
Ultimately, the idea is to launch what will become the transport of the future.
3 “Electric cities”
But Barcelona is not the only city that will be involved in the installation of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville join the project.
These are the three cities chosen by the government, as part of the MOVELE Plan, to launch the deployment of the electric car.
The electric company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Generalitat of Catalonia.
It aims to promote research and technological development activities in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These include activities related to energy, and in particular energy efficiency.
This is not the only initiative Endesa is taking part in when it comes to promoting the electric car.
The company participates in European-wide standardisation groups and has a set of complementary projects in progress such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees “a future of tranquility” for the engine sector
The President of the Government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, foresees "a future of tranquility" for the Spanish automotive industry, which, he recalled, constitutes the main export sector of the country.
At the presentation of the 2009 Economic Report of the President of the Government, Zapatero recalled the measures launched by the executive during the year to support the automotive sector.
“Without the Automotive Sector Competitiveness Plan, we would have today a landscape of abandonment, of closure of some of our main production sites,” said the President of the Government.
“Thanks to this plan and the decision of the brands to stay in Spain, in a very competitive sector, we can envisage a future of tranquility for the future of this industry, which is our main export sector,” he added.
In this regard, he recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, included in the Comprehensive Plan for the Automotive Sector (PIA), allocated <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>800 million to projects of 19 manufacturers and 137 subsidiaries, which mobilised an investment of more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3 billion.
The chief executive explained that this investment was intended both for the development of new models and for the modernization of existing products and processes.
Zapatero also emphasized government support measures for demand, in reference to Plan 2000E, implemented in collaboration with autonomous communities and automotive companies.
According to the President, this plan reduced the average emissions of new vehicles sold on the Spanish market by 6% and contributed to a “strong increase” in registrations, which increased by “40%” in November.
20,000 m2 of collectible cars
Madrid hosts the first edition of the International Motor Show, a meeting place for professionals and motor enthusiasts.
This initiative will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 in the Cristal Pavilion of the Casa de Campo in Madrid.
It is an exhibition area of 20,000 m2, where more than 200 national and international exhibitors will be present.
You will not only find motorcycles and collectible cars, but you will also find at ClassicAuto Madrid items of all kinds related to the world of the engine.
Thus, among the exhibitors of the pavilion, we will be able to find accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, accessories, magazines, miniatures, etc.
Hundreds of articles related to the world of the collection engine that will make the happiness of collectors and curious ones.
Among the participating companies we will find, among others, Clásicos de Mos and Good Old Times, specialists in car sales, Juan Lumbreras, catering, Coupe-Francisco Pueche, sale and catering of automobiles, or Cochera Clásicos, specialist of Mercedes Benz.
Exterior aptitude test
But the commercial activity of this fair will also include parallel activities: assemblies, sports exhibitions, aptitude tests, presentations and competitions.
Fitness tests with cars and collectible motorcycles will also take place on a staged circuit outside the exhibition park.
Mazda3 i-Stop: A sustainable sporting spirit
Mazda wants to prove that sportsmanship is not annoyed with respect for the environment.
To this end, it has just integrated on the Mazda3 the engine stop and start system, named i-Stop, a device that, at least for the moment, is only available on the 150-horsepower 2.0 gasoline engine.
This second generation of Mazda3 is distinguished by the good rating it has obtained as a whole.
The details, the finish of the vehicle, the habitability, the behavior, the mechanics, the i-Stop system...
All these aspects are remarkable on the new Mazda3.
Starting with the driver's seat, the front seats have excellent ergonomics and fastening.
The touch of the steering wheel is also particularly pleasant.
Continuing with the set formed by the dashboard and console, we see how Mazda has continued in the Japanese trend of creating a futuristic interior design, with many buttons and controls, as well as bright colors in red and blue.
This style reminds us, in part, that of the Honda Civic.
That is why we can say that both the Mazda3 and the Civic, both Japanese, contrast with the sobriety of German products, and more specifically with the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to surpass.
Continuing with the cabin, this compact Japanese car has more than enough habitability to allow four adults to travel with a high level of comfort.
In addition to all this, a large box with regular shapes.
The automatic engine stop and start system, at least for the moment, is available only on the two-liter, 150-horsepower gasoline engine and with manual six-speed change.
This engine is a real happiness. It is distinguished by its finesse, low noise, its performance and the control of its consumption.
Indeed, although the most demanded Mazda3 are diesel models, those who do not drive a large number of kilometers per year should not exclude this gasoline-powered i-Stop, both for its high speed comfort and for its controlled consumption.
Regarding the level of equipment, the model chosen for the test is the Sportive, in other words, the one with the largest number of standard elements.
Among the standard equipments, the requalig track change assistant (RVM) which removes the dead angle, the traction and stability controls, the speed controller, the photosensitive interior mirror, the onboard computer on a large screen, the parking sensors, the independent air conditioning for the rain and light sensor, the dbluoth, the dbluoth, and the bluoth.
In addition, as if this equipment was not enough, this version had the Premium Pack which, for an additional 1,500 euros, includes, among other elements, adaptable bi-xenon headlights and a BOSE audio system with disc charger.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compact cars in its class.
It is particularly distinguished by the quality of the materials used, its behavior and its high level of equipment.
In addition, those who do not drive a lot of kilometers per year will be able to opt for the i-Stop version combined only with the 2.0 gasoline engine of 150 horsepower.
The only drawback of this model is its high price, which is between 21,770 euros for the Luxury finish and 23,270 euros for the tested model, the Sportive.
In return for this significant amount, the Mazda3 will offer us a large dose of satisfaction every day.
“First” luxury
L.A. covers the red carpet of sensuality embodied by Penelope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars have dazzled us more than ever, dressed in models as elegant as sexy for the release of Nine. (Photos: Gtresonline).
Our “Pe”, as sophisticated as usual, had opted for a dark “lady”.
The Promise of FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, it is a device that only allows you to look at his e-mail, without offering the possibility even to see certain types of attachments or to browse the Internet.
He enjoyed his five minutes of fame in the United States, when Time magazine named him one of the products of the year.
In truth, it is harder to see it on the street, but the idea seems interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike Smartphones, Peek offers a very low price and monthly subscription, which is less than half of what it costs, for example, the iPhone’s data subscription.
Given its success, the company has launched two new devices: one designed exclusively for Twitter, the other with a free lifetime data service, six times more expensive than the Peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday at the Le Web event, is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation.
He is just as limited as his American grandfather, but has a surprise.
The price of its monthly subscription, around 12 euros, includes roaming throughout Europe.
Those who travel with a Smartphone already know what it means to give up data when crossing a border or desperately look for a cafeteria on the Wifi (or a Fon connection) to be able to see his mail.
The idea of roaming at a fixed price is incredibly seductive and it’s been a long time since it should work.
Indeed, some operators have special arrangements and travel options, but as far as I'm concerned, I would need to have done a Physics thesis to understand them and good glasses to read the small characters.
The repeated reminders of the European Commission to propose affordable roaming rates across Europe have had a barely perceptible effect.
Outside of his country of origin, we are reluctant to use the data, and we are not wrong.
That a small device like the FonPeek (it’s always curious that it’s called Fon while it doesn’t have Wi-Fi) offers this kind of tariffs means that operators start thinking differently and are studying different proposals that allow them to profit their data network.
Kindle is another good example, it includes downloading books and other searches on the Internet.
No subscription and no galley.
This is a connected device and you pay when you buy it and not every month.
And that’s what I hope to see one day for the FonPeek: a shopping option with lifetime access as Peek already offers it in the United States.
Not that I want to buy it.
I'm looking at my mail on my phone, thank you.
I wish it simply because I believe it is a more just formula for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
Michelle's Favorite Color
Yellow is probably the favorite color of the First Lady of the United States.
If she went to the office of Barack Obama in the presidency of the United States with a dress and a coat of this color, in fact, she chose the same to accompany her in the second, undoubtedly the most important moment of her life: the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize to Oslo.
Michelle Obama wore a very similar model on these two occasions: besides their similar color, a yellow pulling towards the green with shiny reflections, both times, the outfit consisted of three pieces: the dress, the jacket and the coat, in the same fabric, and was adorned with a large embroidery or a necklace.
So, at first glance, it would seem that the First Lady of the United States follows in the footsteps of the Princess of Asturias and has chosen to put on the same outfits.
But the fabric in which the two sets are cut makes them very different.
If for taking office it was a thick lace, on the other hand, she carried a printed velvet to Oslo.
The accessories are also different: green shoes with medium heel for the first occasion, and a similar model, but golden, this time.
The hairstyle has also changed: the hair is now lifted while she was wearing it loose the previous time.
75% of working mothers have had professional problems due to their maternity
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially for women of the younger generation who want to be mothers.
This is what the study "Women's fertility and professional career in Spain", conducted by the CSIC in collaboration with the Instituto de la Mujer, reveals.
The survey, conducted on 9,737 women aged 15 to 75, leaves no room for doubt: 75 per cent of working mothers saw their professional careers limited due to maternity.
The study indicates that there are many differences regarding the beginning of life as a couple and the number of children, whether the woman is working or not and the type of employment occupied.
Those who do not have an activity outside the home, work part-time or have an unstable job, get married earlier, have their first pregnancy earlier and have more children.
On the other hand, women with stable employment, mainly in the public sector, are pushing back the entry into couple life and early pregnancy, and have fewer children.
Women between the ages of 35 and 49 who have a fixed job have their first child, on average 3.7 years after they have settled in a couple, up from 4.1 in those who work in the public sector. "These data show that women who have a stable job have needed more time in their lives to get it, which has led them to push back the union and the arrival of children.
In addition, the type of employment exercised greatly influences maternity, but less the date of the beginning of common life,” explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that increases the age gap between women and their first child.
According to the survey, the higher the level of education, the more they get married and have their first child late.
The difference also persists among women of the same generation.
For example, in the 35-49-year-old group, those who completed elementary and higher education were mothers for the first time at 25.1 and 32.1 years on average, respectively.
“Another distinction also appears among women, depending on their level of education.
While those who have completed elementary studies get married and have their first child before finding a stable job, those who have done middle or higher education reverse this program and prioritize obtaining a stable job as a prerequisite for marriage and the arrival of a child,” said Delgado.
Diane Kruger is also worth it.
L’Oréal Paris has just added a new name to its jealous list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
Starting next year, the German actress will embody the image of several of the brand's products, singing the universal motto "Because I'm worth it."
The protagonist of Merry Christmas, one of the most elegant actresses on the international scene, joins other celebrities registered at L'Oréal Paris, such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penélope Cruz.
Before her, the last to enter this club if select were actresses Evangeline Lilly (Lost) and Freida Pinto (Slumdog Millionaire).
Among men, the cosmetics brand also has luxury ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey (Dre Grey, anatomy lessons) and Matthew Fox (the companion of Evangeline in Lost).
The prices of British fashion
The British have a lot to say in the fashion world.
His greatest representatives, creators and models, yesterday and today, gathered for the annual awards ceremony, which took place in London, at the Royal Court of Justice.
No one missed the appointment.
Former model Jerry Hall and his daughter, Georgia May Jagger, voted Best Model of the Year.
Ass poker by Manuel Vincent
Manuel Vincent offers us in Poquer de ases (Alfaguara, illustrations by Fernando Vicente) about thirty "radiographies" of writers who have gone through his literary life (and sometimes, his other life).
He doesn’t do it according to the predictable and apprehended genres (biographical summary, life and work), but by looking for something similar to the ignition core of the created character.
The journey is exciting and Vincent spares neither the frights nor the enlightenments.
Delicious pleasure, this book is also a moving invitation to readings and rereadings.
I'll leave you with a few snapshots.
On Albert Camus: “In his pages, I discovered that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but a spiritual, almost physical impulse, the very one that I felt without naming it: pleasure against fatal fate, morality without guilt and innocence without any god.”
On Samuel Beckett: “Nihilist, allegorical Christian, he wrote what he had in his blood, not in his head, between powerlessness and ignorance, with a dazzling poetic humor, devoid of meaning, like the blade of the knife that almost killed him.”
On Graham Greene: “Our man was inspired by this woman of a passion that lasted thirteen years, in whose flesh he combined the emotion of adultery with the pleasure of repentance, a spiritual privilege which consisted in reaching heaven through the path of perdition.”
About James Joyce: “Ulysse was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the eight thousand-metre peaks of universal literature, which must be climbed through the north face, on which the best climbers still let go and still taken.”
William Faulkner: “He was a strange guy.
Of himself, he sometimes said that he was the heir to a landowner of the county and other times that he was the son of a black woman and a crocodile.
These two dreams were great.”
On Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer collected the demented cry pushed from a bridge by this character of Munch to carry his echo to the bottom of the night of the twentieth century, in his literary form, and he did so in the flight of himself and invoking the posterity with a violent speech to the Asticots."
Dorothy Parker once said, “One day she got down on her knees and prayed, ‘Dear God, I beg you to make me stop writing like a woman.’”
On Joseph Conrad: "On his grave were engraved the verses of Spenser: "Sleep after effort, / after the storm the port, / the rest after the war, / after life, tired death delighted."
Virginia Wolf: “In her luggage she also carried her depressions.
Her husband would normally accept that she told him that Edward VII copied her between the azaleas or that the birds sang in Greek.
We have never seen a man so patient and in love with a neurosis whose literary talent exceeded madness.”
On Pío Baroja: "What did Martín-Santos do if not to try to conceal Joyce at Baroja?
What's Benet trying to do if it's not to get Baroja shot by Faulkner?
What did this do except to aspire the glory of this man so that he might serve him as a pedestal?”
A cowardly aggression
Last week, my mother, who is about 70 years old, was walking in our neighborhood of the city of Fuenlabrada, when a group of young people between 15 and 18 years old passed by her and our dog, a blood-melt, saved from the SPA and weighing no more than six kilograms, and without saying a word, they beat him two feet that left him grayishly wounded.
Our outrage is immense because we don't see what's funny about freely assaulting a defenseless little animal that, besides, was on a leash.
To this must be added the indignation of a lady who was walking quietly and who, when she insulted these individuals, came to fear for her physical integrity, since an energumene who attacks an animal is able to do the same to a woman, a child, an old man or, ultimately, any person weaker than him.
The episode took place around 5 p.m., one Tuesday as well as another, in a usually quiet neighborhood.
The dog sighed all day.
We have, of course, filed a complaint with the district police even though we doubt that this serves much and in order not to touch the sensibilities, we just want to clarify that the murderous cowards were Spanish.
The indignation has led us to denounce this fact.
We do not understand what is happening in young people so that they find it fun to abuse a defenseless animal for free that gives us affection, friendship and keeps us company.
We do not know where good education and respect for animals and people has gone.
Michelin and Fesvial, sets for helmet wear
The Michelin tyre manufacturer, in collaboration with the Spanish Foundation for Road Safety (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to encourage the wearing of the helmet, mainly among the youngest motorcyclists, as indicated today by the two structures.
The aim of this initiative is to raise awareness of the importance of wearing a helmet, as it is the only protection element to prevent head injuries, or even death, in the event of a two-wheeled accident.
Michelin said the campaign was part of its commitment to road safety, which "goes beyond the design and manufacture of increasingly safer products" and said it was contributing to this goal through other educational and informational actions.
This new two-wheeled helmet promotion campaign, under the motto “To be or not to be”, will include a first phase during which posters will be distributed in more than 500 motorcycle garages, in order to ensure the widest distribution.
Lastly, Michelin stressed that road safety “is a constant concern” for the company, because as a manufacturer of tyres for two-wheel vehicles, one of its main objectives is to develop increasingly safer products.
The sale of light commercial vehicles is progressing
After nearly two years, the market for light commercial vehicles begins to see some light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9,425 vehicles registered in November in Spain represent an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and, more importantly, they represent the first increase after 22 consecutive months of decline, according to the figures of the employers' union of manufacturers Anfac and Ganvam, that of dealers.
However, the good news should be nuanced, since the reference for comparison in November 2008 was particularly bad, with a 60% decrease compared to the previous year.
As a result, despite last month's rebound, the registrations accumulated during these 11 months are 40% below those of the previous year.
Since January, all vehicles that fall into the category of light commercial vehicles (derived from passenger cars, pick-ups, vans, light vans and light chassis trucks) have been sold 95,853.
However, the large clouds that most affect their demand have not dissipated, since although they are also purchased by individuals, most of the purchases are made by small and medium-sized enterprises, which pay in almost 100% of cases through external financing.
Thus, in addition to the constraints involved by the limitation of bank loans, other factors such as the increase in the unemployment rate or the persistence of the bad economic situation need to be added.
Given this situation and unlike passenger vehicles, the aid for the purchase of the 2000E has served little.
In addition to individuals, independents and SMEs who wish to acquire a light commercial vehicle of less than 3.5 tonnes with a level of CO2 emissions not exceeding 160 grams per kilometre can also benefit from it, but the number of operations speaks for itself.
Yesterday, at Ganvam, it was again recalled the need for the administration to pay special attention to these vehicles and also to industrial vehicles (trucks and buses).
The dealers' association foresees a 2010 year similar to the one that is ending, for which it calculates a 19% drop in sales (of passenger vehicles and 4x4).
Emergency braking assistance is now compulsory
As has happened with the ABS anti-lock braking system and as will happen with the ESP stability control, emergency braking assistance systems will be a mandatory element on European cars.
They are already mandatory on newly registered passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, while for the rest of the vehicles a period of shortage was fixed until the end of February 2011.
The measure, imposed by the European Union, aims to strengthen pedestrian protection, although by its mode of action it can also help to avoid many rear shocks.
The emergency braking assistant acts by increasing the pressure on the brakes in case of an emergency detected by the system thanks to the kick given by the driver.
But the latter does not always maintain the pressure until the end.
According to a study conducted by car components manufacturer Bosch, one-third of drivers involved in an accident had not been able to press the brake before the collision, and half of them had not taken advantage of its full strength.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The intervention of the aid, on the other hand, requires the maximum of the braking system, reducing the distance that the car needs to stop.
According to an EU study, if all cars were equipped with this type of elements, up to 1,100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians could be avoided each year.
This reduction would be even more important with the popularization of so-called intelligent emergency braking systems: it is estimated that one in four accidents with injured people would be avoided.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system that, thanks to a radar or camera, detects obstacles and warns the driver, in addition to acting slightly on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, he helps by increasing the pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
If it does not react, and although the collision is unavoidable, the device exerts maximum force on the brakes in order to minimize damage.
General Motors postpones plan for Opel until January
While workers at the Opel plant in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) were warned by Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva would be launched during the first week of April – probably on the 8th –, according to Javier Ortega, the North American manufacturer has concluded that there will be a need for time.
Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, believes that each point of the plan has been approved in advance by the party concerned.
And this may imply that the final document, which will first be submitted to the workers and then to the governments of the countries where the factories are located, will be postponed until early 2010.
At GM, however, a decision on the sale of Saab is expected to be made in the coming days.
It is therefore not surprising that the Swedish government has tightened pressure on the US manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to being in contact with potential new buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who also aspires to acquire Volvo, but the candidacy of the Dutch sports car manufacturer Skyper, backed by the Russian group Converg, is gaining importance.
In case there would be no agreement with either of them, GM could sell part of Saab to Chinese company Baic.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year if it is not sold is maintained.
At the wheel of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
To design their latest and most valuable jewel, Porsche engineers left the Boxster S and managed to slim it down by just under 80 kilograms, leaving the balance at only 1,275 kilograms.
This led them to avoid, in the first place, the automatic roof that was replaced by a manual curtained roof, allowing to reduce by 21 kilograms, to use aluminum doors such as those of the GT3, 15 kilograms less, to remove the air conditioner, 13 kilograms, to reduce the gasoline tank from 64 to 54 liters, still 12 kilograms to 19 liters, 7 kilograms of gain.
Finally, they gave up the CDR-30 audio system, gaining another six kilograms and replaced the door handles with fabric handles, saving the remaining kilogram.
Although the model also exists with the dual-clutch PDK box, the test was performed on a six-speed manual box model, mainly on highways of the California secondary network, in the mountains, with particularly tortuous turns.
His behavior can only be described as irreproachable.
The decrease in weight does not prevent the car from rolling on the ground with plunge.
On the contrary: it has been a long time since we have tested such a small and lightweight model that, at the same time, guarantees as much safety in corners, including at high speed.
He is a small athlete, capable of warming up his muscles at low speed for the time necessary, until we asked him to sprint, brake, recover and push his engine again...
It's out what we wanted. Thanks to its direction, as communicative as it is precise, the car will do what our hands on the steering wheel will indicate.
And she will do it with surgical precision.
Sound of engine at will
The sound of his V6 boxer, with 320 horsepower (10 more than the Boxster S) is particularly successful and can be enhanced with the "sport" option or thanks to a system that changes the engine's roar, already used on the Panamera.
The acceleration capacity is abrupt, whether at the stop or during recovery.
The suspensions are firm, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The roads we walked with the Boyxster Spyder were pretty damaged, but the car handled the chicken nests well.
The electronic assistants barely made an act of presence throughout the journey, while on some turns we found ice in the morning and gravel, later in the morning.
Ultimately, an ultralight car, one of the most entertaining to drive and which is much more than just a modification of the Boxster S.
The car will be on sale in February 2010, at a price of 70,831 euros.
" Bag Girl "
Intimate friend of Karl Lagerfeld, icon of the Coco Cocoon line and occasional starlet of the home shows, the singer displays her bad girl face with as much content as her Chanel bags.
More than a “bad girl” or a “it girl”, it’s a “bag girl”.
The Baskonia offers a victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral achieved a brilliant triumph at 91-82 during its visit to the difficult terrain of the Maccabi Electra, despite the many absences suffered by the team of Dusko Ivanovic. She is thus at the head of his group, after the great show of Mirza Teletovic who, with eight baskets with three points was the best (29).
The Vitoria team was able to fill the important absences of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with a large dose of commitment and collective work, even though it had to wait until the end to win.
In addition, the great skill from the perimeter, with 16 baskets with three points scored, largely determined the final victory.
The match started quickly for the blues and reds, who took the lead from the start.
The fact that the first four baskets of the Vitoria team were marked from the perimeter suggested that they had jumped into the Israeli field with warm wrists.
English and Teletovic were the main artisans of the 18-20 final of the first quarter.
The second quarter was in the same tone, but Alava's team chose Barak's indoor play and Eliyahu's work, which was received by acclaim and applause back to his former home, to increase their break advantage (34-43).
Teletovic was already starting to be noticed as the best player in his team, with 13 points, although Splitter's "less six" rating already suggested that this night would not be the best of the Brazilian.
But in this game, despite the fact that they were on the right track at the break, nothing was played, far from it, and Avala's team wanted to remind Vitoria that it is not so easy to win on their field, and thanks to "Elias' hand", they managed to enter the game.
Eidson and Pnini contributed decisively to making the yellows take advantage of the bright (50-49).
Other Difficulties
Ivanovic's players, wounded but far from dead, needed some skillful actions to catch the breath, and it was at this point that Mirza Teletovic's machine gun emerged, which, with three baskets at three consecutive points and the help of English and Ribas's three-scorer-released the scorers (67-scoring) to finish the score.
Avala's team went out to play all for all in the final period and English and San Emeterio (60-75) warned that they would not let anyone take away what they had earned during the first thirty minutes.
Nonetheless, Pnini and Eidson, the best of their team, did not resign and tried to support her from the three-point line (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter eliminated for faults, Ivanovic's players did not rush, defended well, and although the Israelis approached at the last minute (80-85), the game was already played and the victory escaped Tel Aviv for the first time of the season.
Injuries prevent the Unicaja from delivering battle
The Unicaja lost loudly in Greece to the Olympics and gave him the head of Group B of the Euroliga, in a match marked by the absence of players of the Unicaja, especially in the indoor game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated the Greek victory.
The team of Malaga was not frightened by the atmosphere of the pavilion of Peace and Friendship or by the size of the rival, perhaps one of the most powerful in Europe and with a large budget.
The game of the first quarter, allowed to make the Andalusians dream: an aggressive defense and three baskets with three consecutive points, two from the leader Omar Cook and one from Guillem Rubio who dazzled the local team 12-18, in the ninth minute.
The Olympiacos were surprised by the intensity of the Unicaja, although the local team's arsenal with the indoor game of Bourousis, Vujcic and Shortsanitis, allowed to overturn the score 22-20, at the thirteenth minute, when one action, two diss fights, between the leaders entered the North American Williams and the Beyonce.
The Greek team began to operate by showing its superiority in both camps, while the injury exit of English midfielder Joel Freeland and the three personal faults of Carlos Jiménez weighed on the Unicaja.
Domestic players and Lithuanian forward Linas Kleizas, with their three-point baskets, drew 44-32 in the nineteenth minute.
An impossible ascent
The third period was particularly offensive for Olympiacos, who, despite the 19 losses, proved superior and even managed to equal the difference from the match played in Malaga 66-48, in the twenty-seventh minute, causing the head of the group to be knocked out.
The Unicaja tried to overcome the absences and the last exit of Scottish pivot Robert Archibald, who was injured during the match.
Despite all these problems, the Unicaja, thanks to its organization, Cook's three-point baskets, and Lewis' support, left some hope with 66-57, at the thirty-first minute.
But the victory was virtually impossible as the Olympics proved relentless when players pressed and showed their superiority in centimeters in the area.
The Croatian Pivot Nikola Vujcic, managed to raise the score to 81-62, in the thirty-seventh minute, and Unicaja submitted, accepting the victory of the Olympics.
How Much Should You Be Paid From Your Facebook Profile?
Facebook users can know the salary they would deserve based on their profile, thanks to a new application from Trovit, the search engine with the largest number of real estate, job and vehicle ads in Spain.
The "How Much Should You Be Paid?" tool calculates user salaries from the more than 140,000 job offers Trovit has in Spain, from a form available on Facebook, where you must register your profession, your years of experience, your age and the city where you want to work.
For the past week, the search engine has detected that, as a rule, the Spanish worker “feels badly paid,” Trovit’s product manager Albert Ribera said in a statement.
According to the data available to Trovità from its search engines in the UK and France, Spaniards are the least well paid.
A British computer programmer receives 45,226 gross euros per year and a French one 31,059, while a Spanish one receives 24,000 euros.
Similarly, a driver receives 34,247 gross annual euros in England, 25,751 in France and 16,420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the least well-paid job in Spain is that of server, with 11,592 euros net annual, followed by that of seller, with 14,725 euros, and that of worker, with 15,667 euros.
The most sought-after jobs on the Internet in the last three months are as a driver, part-time jobs and as a social worker.
Brazil sets date for Zelaya departure
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelaya’s stay in his embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The ousted president must resign from the diplomatic legation no later than January 27, 2010, the date of the official end of his term of office.
Francisco Catunda, head of business at the Brazilian embassy in the capital of Honduras, confirmed to TV Globo that “Mel” knows he must leave the embassy, where he has been a refugee since September 21, before that date.
“He is aware that he must leave on January 27, at the end of his term, he must look for another destination.”
The channel also quoted the former official, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the end of the established deadline: "My position is to leave as soon as possible, logically with the support of the Brazilian government," Zelaya said by phone.
After the November 29 elections (in which Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya assured that he would remain in the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, the same week, he tried to seek refuge in Brazil.
The operation ultimately failed, as Zelaya refused the condition of political exile that the de facto government presided over by Roberto Micheletti intended to impose on him.
Thank you very much.
After rose days since last spring, during which asset inflation has been the dominant rating in the markets, uncertainty is emerging again, which is not surprising since it is their natural state, in an environment where agents make decisions about an uncertain future by nature.
The remedy used by central banks to stabilize markets has been to monetize debt through the direct purchase of assets and indirectly by giving ample liquidity at rates close to zero, so that financial institutions buy assets to mobilize.
Central banks have already confirmed that direct asset purchases have been virtually finalized and, without questioning their non-compliant liquidity policy, are starting to put some sand in the wheels, as the ECB did, with their bid for a year next week.
As a result, investors doubt the ability of the global economy to sustain economic recovery without heterodox measures, and we are witnessing a reversal of risk premium reduction.
Exchange volatility and corporate bond gaps are rising again, although they remain very far from the paranormal levels they reached at the beginning of the year.
States have been forced to socialize private risk and public debt is once again affected.
There is once again a rush to quality and the United States, Japan and Germany have been the refuges chosen by investors, causing an increase in differences between the countries of the euro zone and Germany.
Spain was hardly affected by this episode of instability, but then Standard & Poor'sa threatened with a further revision to the downward qualification of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, a little uncertainty is not a bad thing to silence the defenders of moral risk, who were once again trying to provoke a case of conscience among those responsible for global economic policy who had restrained the destructive effects derived from the limitation of credit on the destruction of employment, while what would be necessary to decree a new day.
However, the situation in Dubai resembles a tribal struggle between emirs to regain its place in power in the emirates, and we have already seen the case of Greece.
A government that conceals a public deficit, elections, and a new government that discovers the pot of roses.
Prodi did it in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It would be perfectly irrational for the ECOFIN to save Hungary from non-compliance with its foreign payments at the beginning of the year and to allow a euro area member country to fail to comply with its commitments.
What makes sense, however, is that the ECOFIN has encouraged the Greek government to be transparent and has made its citizens co-responsible for the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we hope, we are facing an episode of transient risk premium standardization, after some excesses in high positions, this would be predictable.
In the Spanish case, as long as our gaps in public debt increase to the extent of European corporate obligations, we do not have to worry.
If European disparities were to decrease and ours to continue to increase, this would be an idiosyncratic Spanish risk.
The Standard & Poor's case is an anecdote. When our forecast indicators force most of the study services to anticipate their stimulus models and revise their forecasts for 2011, with the OECD and the European Commission, which come back to bear with a Japanese model for the Spanish economy, it has not expected much.
Again, this seems like an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish assets, even if for the moment “cautiousness is the mother of certainty”.
Connected Sectors
Iberdrola’s president, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to speak yesterday before the subcommittee of the Congress of Deputies, where Spain’s energy strategy for the next two decades is being discussed these days.
After his speech, which was followed by that of the president of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Mr. Galán sketched for the press what he had mentioned before the subcommittee, eight-closed.
According to the president of Iberdrola, Spain needs to invest <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>50,000 million until 2020 and an additional <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>60,000 million between that date and 2030, in case the nuclear power plants in operation today would remain open.
If this were not the case, the necessary investments would not amount to $60,000 but to $95,000.
In contrast, Iberdola believes that for the next decade, investments should not be devoted to increasing production capacity, but to distribution networks and international interconnections.
From 2020 onwards, the issue will change, and the power will have to be increased.
Its focus is on both gas and coal plants, with mechanisms for recovering carbon dioxide and, above all, on renewable energies.
In this area, it considers that an additional 18 000 MW are needed, along with other "supporting energies".
Galán, who believes that the government's newly approved Sustainable Economy Bill is in line with what his company is demanding, did not want to attack the royal decree aimed at encouraging national coal consumption, which contradicts policies to combat global warming.
According to him, there is “a clear long-term bet” in this sense, despite the “point-to-point” measures, as the president of Iberdrola has called them.
In any case, Galán believes that investment decisions, although they are long-term, must begin to be made, as they take some time before they reach maturity, and that a stable remuneration framework is needed to address them.
Ferrovial wins Aer Lingus handling market in ten airports
The Swiss company Swissport, a subsidiary of Ferrovial for ground-based airport services, will play the role of a preferred partner of the Irish airline Aer Lingus, for freight services, in ten European airports where it is present.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are among the most important.
The agreement, whose economic terms have not been disclosed, has a duration of five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Junta de Castilla-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed yesterday a collaboration protocol to create the Smart Infrastructure Innovation Center.
The alliance expects an investment of $20 million until 2012, 50% of which will come from Ferrovial.
One of the Centre's tasks will be to conduct energy efficiency research on motorways and airports.
Acciona disputes its first highway in Australia in Hochtief and Bouygues
Acciona is fighting for its first motorway in concession in Australia, a market in which it already works as an energy company and water manager.
The construction site at stake is an estimated $1,700 million Australian tunnel (approximately <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1,047 million).
The French company Bouygues and the German company Hochtief are its rivals.
A 5 km long tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the East Coast, is the option to allow Acciona to establish itself in the country as a public works company and motorway concessionaire.
The City Council wants to be able to have it by the end of 2014.
After choosing the Public/Private Collaboration (PPP for its initials in English) to complete the project, as part of a business plan under the supervision of Erns & Young, the local government already has a list of finalists who will be in charge of the construction and operation of the toll.
Pending the submission of their bids in May, the projected investment amounts to $1,700 million Australian (approximately <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1,047 million) and in the final phase three consortia, with a significant presence of European manufacturers, face off.
The group called Transcity is headed by Acciona, the only Spanish company in line, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of the largest Australian manufacturers, while the second, installed in Italy, is one of the largest European specialists in underground works.
Against the Acciona team, the Northern Direct consortium is being built, with the presence of the British company Laing O'Rourke, the Australian infrastructure manager Transfield and the French construction group Bouygues.
The third and last consortium to pass the test is LBRJV, whose capital is shared between the Australian Leighton (a subsidiary of the German manufacturer Hochtief, which in turn has the participation of ACS), another local company, Baulderstone (owned by the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the Welsh company Raz, which specialises in the works.
The Australian infrastructure market promises large construction sites and privatisations, but entering them is a major challenge, if not through the acquisition of a local construction company.
A strategy followed by the companies Hochtief and Bilfinger, already mentioned, in addition to their Asian references, and which remains an unvalidated step for the Spanish giants in the sector.
ACS has barely won a place in this market with its 30% stake in Hochtief, owner of Leighton.
Millionaire Assets
Acciona focuses on a geographical area of the utmost importance for the sector, on which it already has a large presence through its energy supplier activity and in the desalination sector.
Among other assets, it has the largest wind farm, that of Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria, and heads the grouping of companies responsible for erecting and managing the Adelaide desalination plant, with a budget of 700 million.
It now intends to consolidate these two areas and take advantage of synergies to enter the construction and infrastructure management markets.
The Toll Road, promoted by the Brisbane City Infrastructure Bureau and the Northern Link, is called to connect the Toowong Western Highway to the peripheral road to Kelvin Grove (see map), by 4 kilometers of tunnel.This is the largest existing trafic of the bribrian road to reduce the
The timetable set by the administration indicates that the tender will take place in the summer of 2010 and that the work will begin in December next year.
Despite the fact that this toll road will be open to traffic at the end of 2014, it is not expected that the construction site will be completed before 2016.
The tunnel began to be designed in 2005.
It will include twice two tracks, an electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The Queensland government will contribute 500 million Australian dollars (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>308 million) to its funding.
Brisbane already offers work in Hochtief
Australia continues to make Hochtief widely fruitful, which yesterday mentioned obtaining a contract with the government valued at 154 million.
The company owned by ACS will equip the national fiber optic broadband network infrastructure through its local subsidiary Leighton.
This intervention will allow 400,000 people to have quick access to the Internet and will provide work for the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has ceded the project to build the 27-story King George Tower in the city of Brisbane. Work has not yet begun and Hochtief has completed the sale for 129 million.
In the UK, more specifically in Manchester, she will share with Laing O'Rourke the construction and management of two school groups for 25 years.
The initial investment will be <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>75 million.
FCC awarded a tunnel in Slovenia for $64 million
FCC, through its subsidiary Alpine, is awarded the construction of a 2.1 km long tunnel for a highway in Slovenia, for an amount of 64.5 million euros.
The company obtained this contract a few days after being charged with enlarging the Bosruck Tunnel (Austria), for a sum of 130 million.
Alpine consolidates its experience in the construction of tunnels.
The project is scheduled to start in early 2010 and will take 32 months to complete.
Mrs. Rushmore is awarded the advertising of Renfe
Renfe has entrusted the advertising and marketing services for the next two years to the agency Ms. Rushmore, for a budget of about three million euros per year, the railway operator said.
The contract mentions the possibility of two 12-month extensions each. Ms. Rushmore was selected from 16 agencies that submitted to the call for tenders organized by Renfe, four of which were finalists, including TBWA who was responsible for creativity over the past three years.
From now on, Ms. Rushmore will be in charge of the design and production of the campaigns.
A fine of 63 million to France Télécom to curb competition
The French competition regulator has imposed a fine of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>63 million on France Télécom for its anti-competitive conduct in the Caribbean region belonging to the country.
According to this institution, the operator limited competition on fixed and mobile telephony by signing exclusive agreements, by tariffs and by consumer loyalty programs in the margins of regulation.
With this sanction, the former French monopoly and still state-owned enterprise, has accumulated more than 450 million euros in fines since 1994, due to the obstacles it places to its competitors.
The sanction imposed yesterday was increased because the competition authority considers that France Télécom has committed similar offences in the past and is therefore a repeat offender.
An App Store
On the other hand, the French company's mobile phone subsidiary followed the lead of other operators and opened an Internet application store, with the aim of increasing revenues that do not come from voice transmission.
Initially, Orange’s app store will be active in France and the UK.
It will have to wait until 2010 for it to arrive in other countries such as Spain.
Their participation in the Champions League has brought 476.4 million to Real Madrid and Barça since its creation
The Champions League has become a source of income for clubs since its inception in 1992.
Real Madrid and FC Barcelona have won 467.4 million, placing them in the third and fifth position of the clubs that have pocketed the most money in this competition.
Manchester United are at the top of the list.
Manchester United are at the top of the list.
Winning the UEFA Champions League brings not only fame, but also one of the main sources of income for major clubs.
The competition allocated <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>5,362.5 million to the 105 teams (including 12 Spanish teams) who have participated in the event since the tournament's creation, during the 1992-1993 season, according to UEFA information.
Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona were well served during this distribution.
The white club was the third of the continent to get the most money for its participation, and the only one, with A.C. Milan, to have won the trophy three times.
The Catalan club, currently holding the title and last winner of the former European Cup in 1992, is fifth on the list.
At the top of the list are Manchester United and Bayern Munich, the two teams that, in addition, have billed the most money for their participation in the last Champions League.
And that, even though they lost to Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country in terms of the money reported by the Champions League, although it has won more titles than any other (five, while Italy has won four, England three and Germany two).
Distributed
This apparent paradox is explained by the complex procedure for allocating money applied by UEFA.
For this year, the organization chaired by Michel Platini plans to win 1,090 million thanks to the Champions League.
Of this amount, UEFA will devote 413.1 million to fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that participated in qualifying matches (including Atlético de Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who managed to participate received only 3.8 million to be there, in addition to 550 00 euros for each match disputed.
There is also a bonus in case of victory (800,000 euros) and equality (400,000 for each team). Those who arrive in the eighths of the finals receive three million each, the eight teams that arrive in the quarter-finals receive 3.3 million.
The last four teams will each receive $4 million.
And the champion will win 9 million, compared to the 5.2 received by the other finalist.
Thus, for fixed payments, a club will win at least 7.1 million, and a maximum of 31.2 million.
On the other hand, Barça pocketed $2.5 million for winning the European Super Cup in August.
But in addition, there are variable payments, to which 337.8 million are devoted.
This money is distributed according to the proportional value of each television market.
The Spanish market is one of the most important, and has four seats.
The champion of the previous year pockets 40% of the money allocated, 30% for the second, 20% for the third and 10% for the fourth.
The other part will be paid based on the number of matches played during the current year.
Nueva Rumasa offers 61 million euros for 29.9% of Sos.
The Nueva Rumasa group yesterday listed the details of the offer to buy shares through which it intends to acquire a maximum of 25 to 29.9% of the capital of Sos.
A percentage that does not require it to launch a Public Procurement Offer (PAO) for all securities.
Concretely, Nueva Rumasa offers 1.5025 euros per share, which will be paid out in 10 years and will be paid at a rate of 1% per year for this postponement.
Yesterday, the shares of Sos ended at 1.85 euros, so the offer of Nueva Rumasa evaluates the company 18% below the market.
According to Nueva Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects Sos's actual valuation.
The offer is conditional on the appointment of eight of the 15 advisors.
The Jerez Group gives a 15-day deadline for shareholders to indicate their interest in the sale of the securities.
The CNMV assured that it had not been informed of this offer, although the Ruiz Mateos company claimed that it had contacted the regulator.
If it took place, the disbursement would amount to 611.7 million, while the capital of Sos is 254.27 million.
In the meantime, Sos continues to restructure its management.
In an attempt to stay out of possible offers of purchase and goes and comes judicial from her former directors, the brothers Jesús and Jaime Salazar, she announced the election of María Luis Jordá as Director of Internal Audit.
A decision that makes her the first woman to hold a leadership position in the food business.
This is a newly created position that will depend directly on the group president.
And it is not free of controversy, as the company remains submerged in the legal battle for the alleged hijacking of more than 230 million Sos to Salazar companies.
In fact, the possibility that in the next few months Sos reveals new misappropriations of funds cannot be ruled out.
Regarding the credit to Salazar, former advisers Ildefonso Ortega and <0xC3><0x81>ngel Fernández Noriega (representatives of the CCM and Unicaja) said yesterday before the National Audience that they had been informed of the hijacking of 212 million without knowing the destination.
The CNMV authorizes the OPA of exclusion of Paternina presented by Inversora Mer
The National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) approved yesterday the exclusion OPA presented by Inversora Mer on Federico Paternina on October 9.
The supervisory body explained that it was authorizing this operation because it understood that its terms were in line with current standards and that it considered the content of the explanatory leaflet submitted “sufficient” following the amendments applied on December 2.
The CNMV stated that the offer concerns the acquisition of 550 008 shares of Federico Paternina at a price of EUR 7.65 per share, which represents 8.95 % of the share capital, consisting of 6,142,786 shares admitted to trading on the Madrid and Bilbao stock exchanges.
He further explained that 5 592 778 million shares had been fixed, and that they could in no way be transferred before the finalization of the tender, of which he indicated that the price had been fixed by Federico Paternina, in accordance with the provisions of the standards in force.
New Tools for Cars Expertise
In these days of bad weather and accidents, car garages are not the only winners.
Every day, thousands of cars that have suffered a crash are taken back to a garage, where an expert has to assess the damage suffered and the cost of repair.
Each sinking is different, and calculating the cost of parts and labor time can be a long and complex job.
Calculating manually the cost of a repair between 20,000 and 30,000 euros, including the parts and the workmanship can take two or three hours.
On the other hand, with the assistance of the latest computer tools, it would be a matter of minutes.
This is why almost 100% of experts use this type of system.
Service providers and solutions for accident assessment and maintenance are dedicated to collecting information provided by manufacturers, then processing it and offering it to their customers in the form of a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex, from the North American group Solera, is the leading company; 80% of the estimates are made with its products.
Other companies competing in the field of assessment tools and industry information development are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with data provided by manufacturers is far from simple.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, Commercial Director of Audatex, the company in Spain with 63 manufacturers and importers, and each of them provides them with information in a different format.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed is constantly increasing, so that over the past five years, more versions, variants and motors have been launched than in the previous fifteen years.
When a new car comes on the market, these companies get to work.
This is a very hard job, because you have to catalog each of the thousand parts of the vehicle and register its price.
In addition, a “smart” graphic image of each model is created, on which the different parts of a passenger car can be clicked.
If it is a massively sold model, the work can be ready in a week if the process progresses very quickly.
If it is a low-selling car, it can take three or four months. Currently, Audatex has complete information on 99.2% of cars sold in Spain.
Among the most exclusive models, they have information about, for example, Porsche, but not Ferrari or Lamborghini.
In the case of vehicles in circulation, the figure exceeds 99%.
To carry out the work of documentation and database development, Audatex has eight centers spread around the world (in Spain, France, Germany, the United States, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan), and each of them is specialized in certain brands.
The National Headquarters is located in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than a hundred technicians (usually mechanical experts) work simultaneously on three computer screens.
Audatex invests $90 million each year to develop these databases.
Every month, 2.5 million data is recorded, and customers receive updates every two days.
The development of this huge flow of information allows these companies to give them different uses and to offer different products.
The most common application concerns repair and maintenance, but depending on the country, there are also tools for the management of breakage parts or to calculate the venal or residual value of a car.
The only company that has a guide that informs about the value of used cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not offer it in our country, but it does in the United States.
In view of the products offered by Audatex, it is easy to get an idea of the type of support it can provide to professionals in the sector.
This company offers ten different tools, the flagship product being AudaPlus, the standard solution for accident assessment, intended for experts.
These include cars, motorcycles, light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it takes into account the estimated repair times by the manufacturer or paint scales.
This tool is purchased depending on its use, for each estimate.
The highest cost is 5.75 euros, for customers who use it little, a maximum of ten times a month.
Then, each insurance company, which carries out thousands of tests, negotiates its price with Audatex.
Other products, such as AudaVIN, allow the total identification of a vehicle and the equipment with which it came out of the assembly line, only thanks to its chassis number.
AudaGlass focuses on vehicle lenses, and AudaSubastas is a server open to the professional sector on the Internet that allows bidding on vehicles declared wrecked.
Its statistics service is very useful for identifying trends, performing geo-demographic analyses or knowing the common problems by brand or model.
It is possible to study, for example, how many models of a certain brand went to the garage for a breakdown or how many suffered serious accidents for a given period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of tools.
It markets, among other things, Gt Estimate, which is also intended for experts and provides digital images, as well as access to the official parts, prices and time of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa Group, founded in 1971, as a provider of services and solutions for accident assessment, breakdown or car maintenance.
The GT Evaluation Guide is a historical reference product on the market.
The company works with 24,000 users in garages, 3,100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
Its turnover has increased at a rate of 20% per year over the past three years, and it made a turnover of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>10.8 million in 2008.
At the beginning of last year, she undertook her internationalization process, with the establishment of an office in Paris.
Audatex was born in Germany in 1966 and settled in Spain in 1979.
According to the company's sources, 62% of its turnover is generated in Europe and the rest of the world, and the remaining 38% in North and South America. It works with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 garages, of which 3,000 are located in Spain.
Solera Group’s global turnover (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) will be $557 million, 3.3% more than in 2008.
In our country, the company will receive 19.1 million euros, which is 7.2% more than last year.
In 2005, the Solera Group was listed on a $1 billion stock exchange, today its shares are valued at a total of $2,400 million.
Since 2007, it has been on the New York Stock Exchange and is part of the Standard & Poor's benchmark index.
Internet Auctions for Accidented Cars
Last October, the Solera Group purchased Autoonline, an Internet platform for the sale of cars, motorcycles and specialty vehicles damaged.
The transaction involved a cost of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>59.5 million for 85% of the company's capital, which could expand to the remaining 15% next year.
The objective of the acquisition was to offer more value-added services to its customers, with the possibility of accessing an immense international market.
This estimation and sales service is exclusively aimed at professionals in the sector, such as insurance companies, experts, rental companies, garages, brokers and professional sellers who must be registered before starting operations.
This platform was established in 1996 in Germany and manages more than 650,000 operations across Europe, including 500,000 in Germany.
Among its main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
There are currently more than 1500 sellers and 4000 experts registered on the site.
It manages 3,000 ads per day and in the Spanish market, 100 new ads are published every day.
According to Spanish law, a car whose chassis number has been removed can no longer circulate, but on the other hand, some parts that are not damaged can be used as spare parts.
Collectible cars can be re-registered, although they have been removed, after complex steps.
Garage quotation in four stages
With the Auda-Taller tool, Audatex ensures that the user gets a quote in just four steps: identify the vehicle, search for the spare part, create a quote and generate it.
Ease of use is an essential part of these systems, especially to convince older professionals who, to a greater or lesser extent, are receptive to the use of new management techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, including 666 passenger vehicles, 109 off-road vehicles, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Of course, to use it, a computer and an Internet connection are required.
Once the model to be repaired has been identified by its chassis number, a real graphic image of the model in question appears and the required part is selected.
The user can include variables such as labor price, increases or reductions, then he can print the quote to hand it over to the customer.
AudaTaller is not an estimation tool like AudaPlus, but a reference catalog.
The main difference between these two systems is that the one intended for garages does not include estimated labor times.
The cost of using this tool for the garage is 350 euros per year, which can be subject to a credit.
Currently, the company Audatex is working to ensure that these images are in three dimensions.
This is an innovation that mechanics see with a very good eye, since it will, for example, allow you to select a door and rotate it to see the inner face.
