Members of the Welsh House of Representatives are concerned that they will be seen “as the dolls of the night tent”.
There are concerns among some Members of Parliament about proposing to change their title to the MWP (Wales MEP).
This concern is due to the plans that have been put forward to change the name of the House to Parliament of Wales.
Members of the House of Commons from all political backgrounds are concerned that this will make them laugh.
A member of the Welsh House of Representatives says his group is concerned that "MWP is cooperative with Twp and Pwp".
To inform readers outside of Wales, it should be said: In Wales, Twp means fool and Pwp means stool.
One member of the Plaid party says the group has generally “not satisfied” with the nomination and has suggested other options.
A member of the Conservative Party of Wales says his group is acting on the “intellectual” change of name, but also hints that the MWP is close to the word “Muppet” for “the nightclub doll.”
In this context, the first letter of Wales, w, is pronounced similar to the letter u in English Yorkshire.
The House Commission, which is currently drafting the bill on renaming, says: “Of course, the final decision on any title with which members of the House are named is an important issue for the members themselves.”
The Welsh Government’s 2017 law gives the Welsh Parliament the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consensus on the proposals, which had received widespread support on behalf of the Welsh Parliament.
When it comes to determining the title for members of the House, the Commission is more willing to use the title “Wales Members of Parliament” or WMP, but the MWP option is more supported in public consensus.
Members of the House seem to suggest alternatives, but trying to reach an agreement could be a hassle for Elin Jones, who is expected to make a draft law on the changes within a few weeks.
The amendments will include other changes to the way the House works, the rules on the disqualification of members of the House, and the design of the committee system.
After the parliamentary negotiations, members of the House shall cast their final vote on the title with which they will be named.
The Macedonian people are going to vote at the bottom of the fund for everyone who asks to change the country's name.
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether or not their country will change its name to the “Republic of North Macedonia”.
Voting is a call to resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece’s neighbour, one of its provinces, Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the country’s northern neighbor’s name indicates a claim to its territory and has repeatedly protested Macedonia’s proposal to join the European Union and NATO.
Macedonian President George Ivanov has objected to holding all the polls and has said he will not take note of the vote.
However, supporters of all parties, including Prime Minister Zoran Zayef, believe that the change in the name is a cost that must be paid to join the European Union and NATO.
The noise of St. Martin's Church was silenced like the Harlem Rebellion.
Mr. Adams: “Historically, the old men I talked to about said there was always a drink and a church in every corner.”
“There is no one left today.”
Mr. Adams says it's understandable to lose a load.
He said: “Today, people are living in a different way.
“Sometimes it’s no longer a neighborhood where people go regularly.”
With regard to churches, he is concerned that the money earned from the sale of assets will not last as long as leaders expect, “and will return to the starting point sooner or later.”
He adds that apartment buildings may be substituted for churches where residents do not contribute to the remaining holy space.
“The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white, and so they’ll throw out the day the churches close because it’s unlikely that the majority of those people who move to these apartments will join these churches,” he said.
Both churches were built by the Metropolitan Society in 1870 before Harlem became a black city, and the Martin Church a decade later by the White Church.
The main white community, which had a Methodist religion, left the city in the 1930s.
The black crowd worshiping nearby considered a new title for the building.
St. Martin was taken over by the Black Crowd under the leadership of John Howard Johnson, who led the 125th Street shop ban, Harlem's main shopping street, and resisted the hiring or promotion of black jobs.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but when residents of Johnson's father's neighborhood made plans to rebuild it, they also ordered a set of alarms (carillons).
Priest David Johnson, son of Johnson's father and his successor at St. Martin, proudly called this collection "The Bells of the Poor People".
The expert who examined the bells in July and called it something else: “a cultural treasure” and “an irreplaceable historical tool”.
This expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan also believes that this was the first carillon in the world played by a black musician named Dionisio A. Lind and moved there 18 years ago to play a larger carillon at Riverside Church.
Mr. Merriweather believes St. Martin has not replaced anyone.
What has spread in St. Martin over the past few months has been intricate storytellers from the mouths of architects and contractors, some of whom were created by the Church of St. Martin and others by the Episcopal Church.
In July, the members of the Chamber of Prayer – the ruling faction of the non-clerical church district – wrote a letter to the Episcopal Church, expressing their concerns that “the Episcopal Church is not seeking to transfer its expenses to the Chamber of Prayer, and that the Bishops are not seeking to transfer their expenses to the Chamber of Prayer.”
Some churchgoers complain about the lack of transparency on the part of the bishops.
A 13-year-old boy in California was attacked by a shark during a dive to catch a shrimp.
Officials said a 13-year-old boy was attacked by a shark in California on Saturday and the start of the crab hunting season.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hamel, in an interview with KSWB-TV in San Diego, said he was diving with his friends on Saturday morning when he heard the boy's cry for help after half an hour and immediately swam towards him with a group and helped him get out of the water.
Hamel explains that at first he thought the boy was excited to catch a crab, but then he noticed that they were yelling, “He bit me!
They bit me!”
Hamel said when he came to the boy, “His whole promotion had broken up.”
Hamel continued, “I called for everyone to get out of the water, ‘it’s in shark water.’”
The boy was transferred to the Rady Children’s Hospital in San Diego, where he was placed on a list of people in critical condition.
It is not known what kind of shark the attacker was from.
Larry Giles, captain of the rescue guard, told a news conference that a shark had been discovered in the area a few weeks before, but it was found to be not a part of the shark's dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered injuries and injuries in the upper area.
For safety and security purposes, authorities banned access to the sea for 48 hours from the coast of Pontoon in Casablanca to Swami in Sisythia.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most of them are not dangerous.
Cincinnati Chain Store Designs to Enter the UK Cosmetics Market
Cincinnati has competed with Boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams as a chain store and with the help of specialist cosmetics assistants.
As part of a significant effort to enter the <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion cosmetics market in the UK, which continues to grow (while sales of fashion and home products are declining), the shelves will be picked up by the majority of cosmetics stores in 11 stores across the country.
Investing in supermarket-supplied cosmetics is looking for ways to use the shelf space that was once used for television, microwaves, and household appliances.
Scientists have doubled the supply of cosmetics, bringing it up to 3,000 products, initially from brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing ranges from L'Oreal, Maybelline, and Burt's Bees will also have more space with branded locations similar to those found in stores like Boots.
In this supermarket, cosmetics will be re-established so that most plant-friendly products - a topic increasingly pursued by young buyers.
In addition, Fragrance will also have exclusive testing at two Cincinnati stores, with its first store opening last week in Crayon, South London and its second store in Selly Oak, Birmingham later this year.
Buying online and changing the procedure to buy small amounts of food on a daily basis in locally available stores means that supermarkets have to do more to convince people to go to those stores.
Mike Cope, CEO of Cincinnati, says sales markets are generally growing more like chain stores, and supermarkets are trying to pay for more services and non-food supplies to combat discounts at Aldi and Lidl stores.
Cincinnati has created several Argos stores in hundreds of stores, as well as a few Habitats stores, because two years ago both stores bought a chain, saying it has boosted food sales and made shopping more profitable.
Previous attempts by supermarkets to add the cosmetics and pharmacy sector failed.
In the early 2000s, Cincinnati attempted to create a joint venture with Boots, but after a not-so-serious effort, they struggled about how to split revenues in a chemical store, and the collaboration was cut short.
The new strategy came about three years ago when Scienceboro sold its 281 drug store to Celesio, the owner of the Lewis chain of pharmacies, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million.
It was said that by adding a wide range of luxury brands in the field of skin care, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores, Lloyds will play an important role in the design.
Paul Miles Hicks, Chief Commercial Officer at Sciencebury, said: “In order to improve the environment for our customers, we’ve changed the look and feel of cosmetics shelves.
We have also hired special and trained colleagues who will be there to provide advice.
The range of brands has been tailored to meet the needs and the stimulating environment and comfortable location means that we now have a beautiful and guided location that challenges old shopping practices.”
Peter Jones is furious after Holly Willoughby broke the <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal.
Actor Peter Jones, who starred in the television series Dragons Den, broke the <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with his brand names and decided to sign a new contract with Marks and Spencer and ITV, leaving the meeting angry.
Willoughby has no time for Truely branded household clothes and accessories.
The business of the couple is similar to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop.
The show's "Morning" on Instagram announced that it has left the deal.
Hallie Willoughby angered Peter Jones on the show Dragons Den because he resigned at the last minute from his favorite brand deal - to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones became angry when the golden haired TV girl on Tuesday at the headquarters of her business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, accepted her new deals - worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million - meaning she no longer had enough time to sell the brand to Truly on the ground.
The company had similarities to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop and is said to have doubled Willoughby’s estimated <0xC2><0xA3>11 million fortune.
Thus, 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that he had broken up with Truly and that Jones had left the UK for one of his homes.
One source said: “Truly was really one of Holly’s priorities.
It was supposed to be a long-term future and they would be together in the next few decades.
His decision to stop working was completely confusing.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, there was nothing left to begin with.
There’s a warehouse full of merchandise at Marlo’s headquarters that’s ready to sell.”
Experts believe the launch of the “Tomorrow Morning” program, one of Britain’s most polished stars, could cause millions of losses to the company due to the company’s heavy investment in products including cushions and candles, as well as ordinary and home clothes.
This could be the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband Don Baldwin had a close relationship with Jones and his wife Tara Cap for 10 years.
Willoughby co-founded Truly with Cap in 2016, and Jones, 52, served on the board of directors in March.
The two were together, with 40 percent of Baldwin's shares held by Jones.
Willoughby wanted to become M&S business ambassador, replacing Anthony McCarthy, who ran the ITV show “I’m a Celebrity.”
A source close to Jones said last night: “We will not comment on his economic affairs.”
It was a difficult conversation and then we fell in love.
He paid attention to criticizing the news media for writing comments that some don’t know “in the name of the president” or for being positive about the North Korean leader, and joked about them.
Why is President Trump letting things go so quickly?
Trump, in his ridiculous voice, says:
“I didn’t leave anything.”
He noted that Kim was happy with Trump at the second summit after the initial meeting in Singapore in June, and that this is a major step towards North Korea’s nuclear disarmament.
But the nuclear disarmament talks have been halted.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore, North Korea’s top diplomat told world leaders at a general meeting at the United Nations that North Korea did not see a “corresponding response” from the United States towards advancing disarmament in North Korea.
He noted that instead, the United States continued to impose sanctions with the aim of maintaining pressure.
Trump had a very optimistic outlook for his supporters in his ridicule.
“Our work with North Korea was great,” he said.
“We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people were killed.
But now we have a great relationship.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had positive results - ending missile tests, helping to free hostages and returning the remains of U.S. forces to the country.
And he also defended his unusual approach to talking about relationships with Kim.
Speaking to a crowd directly listening to him, Trump said: “It’s very easy to be president, but instead of the 10,000 people outside trying to get themselves into this crowded space, we have about 200 people standing there.”
Indonesian tsunami and earthquake devastated an island and killed hundreds of people
For example, after the Lombok earthquake, foreign NGOs were told they didn’t need them.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok’s population had become homeless, the national disaster declaration, which is a prerequisite for accelerating international aid, was not made.
“Unfortunately, in many cases, it’s very clear that international aid is not being sought and so it’s getting a little harder.”
While the children's rescue team is gathering a team to travel to Palo City, they are still unsure whether foreign workers can work in those areas.
Sotopo, a spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, said Indonesian authorities were investigating the situation in Palu to see if international organizations could be allowed to help.
Despite the earthquakes that are constantly happening in Indonesia, but it must be said that the country is unfortunately not too prepared against the wrath of nature.
While tsunami shelters have been built in Ache, there is no news of these shelters on the shores anymore.
The lack of a tsunami alarm in Palu or even a typical warning was also one of the reasons for the loss.
At best, moving between many of the Indonesian islands is a challenging task.
Natural disasters make supply more difficult.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat those injured by the quake is on Palu Road, but it takes at least three days to reach the scene.
President Joko Widodo has taken steps to improve Indonesia’s old infrastructure, which was the focus of his campaign slogans, and spent huge sums on roads and railroads.
But the government’s budget shortage is challenging Mr. Joko in next year’s election.
Mr. Joko also faces pressure from sectarian conflicts in Indonesia, where the majority of people who are Muslims have embraced a conservative form of religion.
Christian and Muslim gangs are also killed in the streets using spears, bows and spears and other violent weapons, resulting in more than 1,000 deaths and tens of thousands of homeless people.
Watch: Daniel Storge, a Liverpool player, prevented his team from losing to Chelsea.
Daniel Storge prevented Liverpool player from defeating Chelsea on Saturday at Stamford Bridge with his 89-minute goal.
Sturgeon, while his team was one-zero from Chelsea behind, took a pass from Shrewsbury at a distance of 30 meters from Chelsea's gate.
He took the ball to his left before hitting the farther left.
The long shot was fired from above the penalty area to the right of the gate.
The ball passed through the goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga and eventually led to the goal.
Storge told LiverpoolFC.com: “It was just an attempt to get to the right position to take the ball and a player like Shakir always plays as far as possible. So I tried to create a position for myself as much as I could.”
“I saw Kant coming and he hit the ball, didn’t think much about it and just took the shot.”
Chelsea won the first half of the game one-on-zero after the 25-minute goal scored by Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The blue striker, after spinning near half-field, quickly made his way to half-field Liverpool and passed the ball to Mateo Kovacic with his leg back.
Kovacic threw the ball in the middle of the field and moved himself.
Then with a beautiful deep shot, the ball reached Hazard inside the penalty area.
Hazard left the defense and hit the ball in the opposite direction with a left-footed shot that passed from goalkeeper Allison Becker.
Liverpool will take part in the Champions League group stage at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3:00 p.m. on Thursday in London.
Indonesian tsunami death toll rises to 832
Indonesia's disaster agency said early Sunday that the death toll from the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami had reached 832 people.
Sutopo agency spokesman Purwo Nugroho told a news conference: Many people have been trapped in the ruins of buildings that were destroyed in the 7.5 earthquake. The height of the waves has reached 20 feet (6 meters).
The city of Paolo, which has a population of more than 380 thousand, is covered with debris from collapsed buildings.
Police have arrested a 32-year-old man for the murder of a woman with a knife.
This morning, after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, a criminal investigation began.
At 7:55 a.m., the body of a 44-year-old woman with knife wounds was found in the Grayson Mews neighborhood on John Street and a 32-year-old man was arrested in connection with the murder.
Police have asked people in the area to report to the police if they saw or heard anything.
Detective Detective Brian Ohagan said: “The investigation is in the early stages and I would like those who were near John Street in Birkenhead, and have seen or heard a suspicious case, to contact us.
“I also ask all people, especially taxi drivers, who may have a camera on their dashboard recording events, to contact us because their information may be vital to our research.”
A police spokeswoman confirmed the woman whose body was found living in the Birkenhead neighborhood and was found inside the house.
This afternoon, friends of the woman who knew him were asked to come to the crime scene to ask questions about where he was this morning.
The investigation is underway and police said they are informing one of the victims' relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews tried to return to his apartment but police said no one was allowed to enter or leave the building.
When he found out what had happened, he didn’t say anything.
Residents of the building are told it may take a few hours for them to be allowed to enter and return home.
A police officer heard a man say the entire area is now known as a crime scene.
A woman appeared on the scene while she was crying.
He said, “It’s very scary.”
At 2:00 p.m., two police vans entered the quarantine area while another van had stopped outside the area.
A number of officers stood inside the quarantine area and monitored the building.
Those who have information in this area are requested to contact via DM <0x40>MerPolCC or number 101 or to contact anonymously via the anti-crime communication system at 0800555111 mentioning the incident of September 30, 2017.
The statue of Cromwell in Parliament is the oldest memory to be struck by a "rewriting of history".
Its exile is a poetic justice for the Taliban's destruction of many of Britain's cultural and religious works, carried out by devout adherents of the religion of Peru.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick’s proposal as “stupid” and “an attempt to rewrite history.”
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “It is now inevitable to discuss the removal of the statues of Oliver Cromwell located outside the Westminster Palace.
The breaking of the British Civil Wars was neither an order nor was it done by the Carmelites.
Cromwell may have been the victim of the law's opposition to his forefather Thomas' actions in the last century.
The magnificent performance by Sir William Hammo Tornikov of Cromwell is evidence of nineteenth-century ideas and part of the historiography of a character that many believe is still to be celebrated.
Mr. Goldsmith told the Sydney Telegraph: “Cramol was considered by many people, perhaps more so in the late nineteenth century than today, during the period of the kingdom as a defender of the House against foreign pressure.
Whether or not this is an accurate representation is an ongoing historical debate.
What we are sure of is that the conflict in the middle of the seventeenth century has shaped the next development of our nation, and Cromwell is a well-known character who represents one side of the divide.
His achievements as Lord’s supporter are also worthy of praise and commemoration.”
A pig killer killed a Chinese farmer.
According to local media, a farmer in a market in southwest China was attacked and killed by a pig.
According to the South China Morning newspaper, the man, who was identified only by the surname "Yuan" while his arteries were cut off and blood stained, was found near a pig market in Lipanshui market in Goizhou province.
On May 30, 2005, in Jining, Qinghai Province, China, a pig farmer was preparing to inject the vaccine into pigs.
On Wednesday, he and his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan entered the city to sell 15 pigs in the market.
The next morning, his cousin found out that he was dead and that the neighbor’s pork door was open.
He said there was a big pig in the pigsty with a bloody mouth.
According to the report, the forensic examination confirms that the 250 kg pig attacked the farmer with a pooze and caused his death.
Guoyang newspaper quoted the victim’s nephew as “Wu” as saying, “My nephew’s feet were bleeding and crushed.”
The security camera footage shows Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed this man does not belong to John or his cousin.
One of the market managers told The Eve newspaper that the pig had been shut down to prevent attacks on people while police were gathering evidence from the scene.
Yuan's family and market officials are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Previously, cases of pork attack on humans had been recorded, although this is a rare occurrence.
In 2016, in the state of Massachusetts, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm and severely injured the man.
Ten years ago, a Welsh farmer squeezed a 290-kilogram pig into his tractor until his wife frightened the animal away.
After an organic farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a trigger.
He said, “The pigs are just gamers.
They bite and are very curious ... they’re not out there that can hurt you.
You just have to respect them enough.”
The remains of Hurricane Rosa caused heavy rainfall in the southwestern United States.
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa weakened due to movement on the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days, Rosa will cause flooding in northern Mexico and the southwestern United States.
Hurricane Rosa, a Category 1 hurricane with a wind speed of 137 km/h, occurred at 5 a.m. on Sunday morning in the east of the United States and is located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move northwards on Sunday.
Meanwhile, low-pressure waves will begin to form over the Pacific Ocean and move towards the east and west coast of the United States. With Rosa approaching on Monday as a tropical storm to the peninsula instead of California, the intense tropical humidity will melt towards you.
Rosa will cause up to 250 millimetres of rain to fall in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then the tropical humidity in interaction with low-pressure waves in the coming days will cause heavy rainfall in the southwest.
Locally, 25 to 100 mm of rainfall causes sudden dangerous floods, water flows along with waste, and possibly landslides in the plains.
Extreme tropical humidity will increase rainfall in some parts, especially in the southern parts of Nevada and Arizona, to 50 to 75 millimeters per hour.
It is expected to rain in parts of the southwest, especially in many areas of Arizona, about 50 to 100 millimeters.
Due to the dispersed nature of tropical rains, sudden floods occur and the situation rapidly deteriorates.
Due to the risk of tropical rainfall, it is strongly recommended to avoid walking in the plains.
Heavy rainfall causes deep valleys to turn into raging rivers, and storms will cause windstorms along with dust.
The waves will cause severe local rainfall in parts of the southern coast of California.
Rainfall of more than 12 mm is likely to cause water to flow along with waste and roads to slip.
This will be the first time in the wet season.
The scattered rainfall of tropical rainfall occurs late Sunday and early Monday in Arizona, which will become more widespread late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rainfall will reach Four Corners on Tuesday and will continue until Wednesday.
In October, we’re witnessing extreme temperature changes across the U.S. as the Arctic cools down, but the tropical regions remain quite warm.
Sometimes this condition leads to dramatic changes in temperature at short intervals.
On Sunday, a great sample of the temperature difference will occur across the entire central part of the United States.
The nearly 20-degree temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the next few days, the late summer heat will remain and will rise again.
Many parts of the central and eastern United States are expected to have warm days in early October, and temperatures in the southern plains to the northeast are expected to rise to 27 degrees Celsius.
New York City's temperature on Tuesday may reach 27 degrees Celsius, which will be about 6 degrees Celsius higher than the average.
Weather forecasts for the first half of October suggest that higher-than-average temperatures are likely to be high in the east of the United States.
More than 20 million spectators watched Bert Kavanaugh’s hearing.
More than 20 million people witnessed him on Thursday through six television networks presenting evidence in the country's Supreme Court by Christine Blasi Ford on the alleged rape of Bert Kavanaugh in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, political opposition continued and regular television broadcasts were interrupted until the last minute on Friday: a contract that Arizona Senator Jeff Flake designed with the FBI to investigate the allegations for a week.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was 100 percent sure Cavanaugh was drunk and trying to take off his clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh says he’s 100 percent sure it didn’t happen.
It is likely that on Friday, more than 20.4 million people watched the incident, which was reported by Nilsen.
The company has counted the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News and MSNBC news channels.
Statistics and figures for other networks that showed the event, including PBS, C-SPAN and the Fox trading network, were not immediately available.
Nilsen is usually not able to count the people who watched the show in the offices.
To visualize the subject, it should be said that this audience size is almost the same as the audience of a football game or the awarding of an Oscar.
Nilsson said the Fox News network, whose executives had strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, had an average of 5.69 million viewers ahead of all other networks.
ABC ranked second with 3.26 million viewers.
According to Nelson CBS, NBC, MSNBC and CNN had 3.1 million, 2.94 million, 2.89 million and 2.52 million viewers, respectively.
The audience's attention and interest continued after the hearing.
Flick played the lead role in the show on Friday.
After the Republican Middle Office announced that it was voting in favor of Cavanaugh, CNN and CBS showed him on Friday that he was going to the court elevator amid a mob of opponents.
He stood with depressed eyes for a few minutes while others blamed him and the scene was broadcast live on CNN.
One woman said, “I’m standing right in front of you.”
“Do you think he’s telling the truth to the people of the country?
The man said, “When many women are weak, you are powerful.”
Flick said his office had issued a statement saying he wanted to say more at the committee hearing before the elevator was closed.
Cable and broadcasting networks covered the issue when the Judiciary Committee was voting for Kavanaugh's candidacy in the Senate.
But Flake said he only did so by understanding the FBI's accusations against the nominee for next week were backed by the minority Democrats.
Flick became somewhat convinced after talking to his friend Chris Cowens, who is a Democrat senator.
After conversing with Cowens and several other senators, Floyd made his decision.
Flick’s choice was powerful because it was obvious that Republicans could not vote for Kavanaugh without investigation.
President Trump has asked the FBI to open an investigation into the allegations against Cavanaugh.
UK Prime Minister Accuses Critics of 'Political Game' on Elections
British Prime Minister Theresa May, in an interview with the Sunday Times, said critics of the EU’s exit plan were “playing a political game” with Britain’s future and were hurting national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrived in Birmingham on September 29, 2018 to attend a Conservative Party conference in the United Kingdom.
In an interview with newspapers, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson spoke of his attack on the Chequers programme for Brexit, suggesting that the UK and the EU should collect their “absolutely unreasonable” tariffs.
Weid Sims Shooting: Police Arrest Dayton Simpson, Accused of Murdering LSU Player
Police have arrested a suspect in the deadly shooting of Weid Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
The Baton Rouge Police Department said that 20-year-old Dayton Simpson was arrested and sent to prison on charges of deliberately committing two-degree murder.
Officials released a video of a confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
WAFB-affiliated CBS reports say the police found the glasses at the crime scene and Simpson’s DNA was on it.
After questioning Simpson, the police said he had accepted that he had shot Wade in the foot.
According to the attorney general, his credit has been set at $350,000.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner’s office released a preliminary report on Friday that identifies the cause of death from bullet wounds to the head and neck.
The department had sought help from the Louisiana State Police Task Force, the Police Crime Laboratory, the University of the South Police, and local citizens in the investigation that led to the arrest.
Joe Alowa, LSU’s Sports Affairs Director, thanked for the legal action “along with perseverance and pursuit of justice” in the region.
Sam was 20 years old.
He grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wynn also played for the LSU basketball team.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "shocked" and "shocked" because of Weid's death.
Weed said, “That’s what you’re always worried about.”
Volcano scatters its ashes in Mexico City
The ashes of Mount Popocatepetl reach the southern districts of Mexico’s capital.
The National Center for the Prevention of Incidents on Saturday warned Mexicans not to approach the volcano and recorded 183 gas and ash eruptions within 24 hours.
The center has recorded several noises and vibrations in its systems.
Images on social media show that in some neighborhoods of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco, a thin layer of glass ash is covered in cars.
Since the 7.1-magnitude earthquake that occurred in central Mexico in September 2017, geophysical scientists have noticed an increase in the activity of this volcanic mountain, located 72 kilometers southeast of the capital.
This volcanic mountain, called Don Guayu, has been active since 1994.
Police on the threshold of holding the anniversary of the vote for independence, involved in the separation of the Catalans
On Saturday, during a clash between pro-independence protesters and anti-insurgency police in Barcelona and when thousands of protesters joined the rival group to hold the first anniversary of the Catalonia's secession, six people were arrested.
A group of separatist supporters, held back by his counter-insurgency police, began throwing eggs and spraying powder dyes, causing dark clouds of dust to form in the streets, usually accompanied by crowds of tourists.
When police encircled the protesters using the Batum, the fighting resumed.
For more than a few hours, the pro-independence groups had lined up with the slogan "Forbidden forgetting, Forbidden forgiveness" against the allies who were shouting "Long live Spain."
Local media reported that fourteen people had been treated for minor injuries in the demonstrations.
Tensions in the region are still high a year after the October 1 referendum, which Madrid considers illegal, but this anniversary is being celebrated by separatist Catalans.
Voters decided to separate completely, although the number of voters in the election was low and the opposition to the separation had sanctioned participation in the vote.
According to Catalan officials, last year, after police tried to halt voting in areas across the region, about 1,000 people were wounded in violent clashes.
Pro-independence groups educated on Friday to prevent demonstrations backed by the national police.
The protesters were marching, but had to choose a different path.
The 68-year-old electrician Narcissus Trams and his wife have taken part in ambitious separatist protests, saying he no longer hopes that Catalonia’s expectations of independence will be met.
“Last year we had one of the best moments of our lives.
“I saw my parents cry because they were excited to vote, but now we’re stuck.”
Despite its administration of a vital victory in the wake of the regional elections last December, the Catalan independence parties have not been able to continue their movement this year, many of their famous leaders are in exile or detention and are awaiting trial because of their role in the organization.
Jean Poig, a 42-year-old mechanic who receives a phone call from the police backed by video protests, said the dispute between politicians on both sides has been resolved.
He said, “The tensions are getting bigger and bigger.”
On Saturday, Oriol Janqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who has been in temporary detention since late last year, announced that he would take part in next year's European Parliament elections.
"Acting for a European Parliament election is the best democratic way to condemn the backwardness and repression we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
London: Several Men Arrested While Destroying a House with a Car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after hitting their car in a house in London.
The incident took place on Thursday at around 19:30 British time in Ballingrad Cranston.
Detective Bob Belming said the damage had entered the doors and the building itself.
At some points, he was also shot by a bow in the car.
With his goal, Manga made Livingston 1-0 win over the Rangers.
Manga's first goal for Livingstone ensured the team's victory.
Livingston confused the Rangers, and Steven Gerard suffered his second defeat in 18 games as manager of the Ebrox club.
The Manga Dolly made Livingston coach Gary Halt higher than the Hibernians.
Gerard did not win out-of-home in the top league this season and will play with the eight-pointer Hertz team next Sunday.
Before that, the Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the European League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston, with Holt's coaching, who replaced Miller last month, increases his invincibility to six games.
Livingstone lost his chance against his guest.
Holt's team worked offensively before reaching the goal, and their direct shots caused the Rangers trouble.
Scott Robinson defeated the defenders, but his effort against the goal remained unsuccessful, after which Allen Lithoff was only able to distract his shot to reach Craig Halkett along the goal.
The host team was happy to play against Rangers and knew they could get the other team into trouble in parts of the game.
And so they were able to get that vital flower.
Livingston scored a free kick, the ball reached Manga between Deklon Galacher and Robinson, and he entered the goal from the middle of the penalty field.
Until that point, the Rangers owned the ball, but the defense of the host team was inflexible, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly also worked largely flawlessly.
The process continued in the second half, although Liam Kelly managed to hold the Alfredo Murlos ball.
Scott Pitman was stopped by Allen McGregor, the Rangers' goalkeeper, and Litthoff also kicked out for Livingston.
Strikes from the sides were constantly hit to the penalty area of Livingstone, but they were all repulsed. The Rangers team claimed a penalty twice - once after Hulk's mistake on the player replacing Golden Milton and one for touching the ball by hand.
"The Amazing Work" Livingston - Analysis
Alasdair Lamont, BBC Scotland reporter at Tony Macaroni Stadium
Great performance and results for Livingstone.
In my opinion, they were great, they still looked better than expected in this climbing path.
Their playing style and team have changed very little since they returned to the top, but the main pride is that Holt has made it into a rookie after joining the team.
He had a lot of heroes.
Captain Hulkett was excellent and organized the defense very well, while at the same time Manga was able to defeat Connor Goldson and Joe Veral.
Although the Rangers team was not enthusiastic.
As good as they were at Gerard’s time, they have now moved away from these standards.
They didn’t have the final finishers – they were only able to open the host team once – and this is a warning to the Rangers who are now in the middle of the table.
Double welcome from Erdogan in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29th), the leaders of Turkey and Germany met in the blue sky of Berlin with a smile.
This is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit from Germany, which aims to reform relations with NATO allies.
They discussed issues related to human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey’s membership of the European Union.
Then Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an went to Cologne to open a new and very large mosque.
The city has the largest population of Turkish foreigners.
The police prevented 25,000 people from gathering outside the mosque for security reasons, but a large number of supporters gathered near the mosque to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters - many of them did - began chanting, condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to accept him in the country.
The demonstrations between the two opposing groups reflect the detachment between the two groups of German settlers, some of whom recognize Erdogan as a hero and others as a domineering ruler.
Road accident in Deptford: A bicycle rider in a car accident lost his life
A bike rider died in a collision with a car in London.
The crash in the city’s southeast, the intersection of Beasted Street and Olin Street, which is a busy road in Deptford, occurred around 10:15 p.m.
The driver stopped and emergency services came to the scene, but the man died in the accident.
The accident occurred a few months after another accident on Childers Street injured about a mile from the crash site on Saturday, which resulted in the death of a bicycle rider.
City police said officers were investigating the case to identify the man on the bike and inform his close relatives.
The road has been closed and the bus route has been changed and drivers are advised not to pass through the area.
Long Lartin Prison Officials: Six Officers Injured in Riot
According to the prison office, six of the prison officers were injured due to riots in a high-security men's prison.
The riot at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire at 9:30 a.m. UK time occurred on Sunday and is still ongoing.
Tornado officers have been deployed to deal with the unrest involving eight prisoners in a besieged corner.
Officers were undergoing treatment for minor facial injuries.
A prison service spokesman said: “Trained and special staff have been deployed to deal with potential incidents at HMP Long Lartin.
Six of the injured workers were undergoing treatment.
“We don’t tolerate violence in our prisons, and it’s clear that abusive people are being handed over to the police and may be left behind for longer.”
HMP Long Lartin has more than 500 prisoners, some of them among the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the head of the prison was transferred to the hospital after an inmate was attacked.
And in October last year, anti-insurgency officers were summoned to prison to deal with a serious riot. In that riot, staff were attacked with billiard balls.
The threat of sudden flooding by Hurricane Rosa in Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (dry areas may benefit from rainfall)
Reducing tropical pressure in Arizona is a rare matter, but this is exactly what is likely to happen early next week, i.e. the remaining energy of Hurricane Rosa from the past southwestern desert and the risk of sudden flooding.
The National Meteorological Service has forecast sudden droughts for Monday and Tuesday across western Arizona to south and east Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to bend her way to the Phoenix on Tuesday, causing rainfall there by the end of Monday.
The Phoenix National Meteorological Service said in a topography message, “Since 1950, only ten tropical tornadoes have caused tropical storms or low-pressure states of about 320 kilometers of Phoenix!
Hurricane Katrina (1976) was a hurricane on the Arizona State Border, 65 km away.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict 50 to 100 millimeters of rainfall, which amounts to 150 millimeters in Mogollon Rim, Arizona.
In other areas of the southwestern desert, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Greater Irrigation Basin, it is likely to rain 25 to 50 millimeters, which may total up to 100 millimeters.
For areas that are far from the dangers of sudden flooding, Rosa rain may benefit as these areas suffer from drought.
Although flooding is a very serious concern, it will likely be useful for some areas of the rainfall as the southwest region is currently experiencing drought conditions.
According to the drought monitoring center and weather.com, more than 40 percent of Arizona’s areas are in severe drought conditions, which is second in terms of severity.
Initially, the route of Hurricane Rosa is to the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa is still on the brink of a hurricane and on Sunday morning at a maximum wind speed of 137 km/h, 620 km south of Punta Eugenia Mexico, moving north at 20 miles/h.
The storm continues to face colder waters in the Pacific Ocean and thus diminishes its strength.
Therefore, it is expected that in the afternoon or Monday night in Mexico, the tropical storm will show its strength.
Rainfall in different parts of Mexico can be severe and the risk of flooding is significant.
According to weather.com: “The total rainfall from Baya California to the northwest of Sonora is 75 to 150 mm, which may reach as much as 150 mm.”
Rosa then moved northward from Mexico in the form of a hurricane, early Tuesday morning as a low-pressure area on the Arizona border, and later on Tuesday after crossing from Arizona to southern Utah.
According to the National Hurricane Center, “The main predicted risk of Rosa and its remains includes very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora, and the southwestern desert of the United States.”
These rains are expected to cause sudden and life-threatening floods in the desert and landslides in the mountains.
Midsummer Nights Attack: Four Suspects Arrested for Murder
After a 16-year-old boy was found with knife wounds in Summerset, three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested for ill-intentioned murder.
A teenage boy was found in the Excelsior Terrace area of Medasamer Norton on Saturday at 4:00 a.m. British time while injured.
He was taken to a hospital where he survived in “sustainable” conditions.
According to police, a 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-old boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested at night in the Radosk area.
Police officers have asked people who may have filmed incidents with their phones to visit the police.
Trump says Kavanaugh is upset by Democratic Party’s “race and anger”
Speaking in West Virginia’s Willing, Trump said: “The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote for the oppressive rejection of the Democratic Party’s oppressive tactics.
Trump says Kavanaugh was upset at the time of his nomination process for the Democratic Party’s “post and fury” election.
Kavanaugh said ahead of a congressional session on Thursday that he strongly rejected Ford's claim that Kavanaugh had been sexually assaulted decades ago and during his teenage years.
Ford also testified at the hearing about his claim.
President Trump said on Saturday that “the American people saw the brilliance and quality and courage” of Kavanaugh that day.
He told a large crowd of his supporters in West Virginia: “Voting for approval by Judge Kavanaugh is one of the most famous legal experts of our time, who is a legal expert with a full record in the public service.”
The president, while talking about the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections, pointed out in a televised way the name Kavanaugh.
“Five weeks remain one of the most important elections in our lives.
He said: “I’m not in the election, but I am.”
“That’s why I’m here and I’m fighting for great candidates.”
Trump claimed that the Democrats’ mission was to “create resistance and thwart the crackdown.”
A senior GOP adviser told CNN that the first procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh’s candidacy would be held by Friday.
Hundreds of people have been killed in Indonesia’s earthquake and tsunami, and the number of casualties seems to be rising.
Officials said on Saturday that at least 384 people were killed by the earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, and that very large waves on the shores of the island have brought many people with them.
On Friday, hundreds of people had gathered to attend a festival on the beach of Palo City, which suddenly took a large number of waves as high as six meters (18 feet) in the dusk, drowning them and destroying everything that was in its path.
The tsunami occurred following a 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesian Disaster Reduction (BNPB) said at a press conference in Jakarta: “Yesterday when the tsunami threat occurred, people did not quit their jobs on the beach and did not immediately flee, which is why they became victims.”
"When the tsunami came, it dragged cars, excavators, and houses and destroyed everything on the ground, it also added that the tsunami was moving at a speed of 800 kilometers per hour before reaching the coastline at sea," Nagorno-Karabakh said.
He said some people went up on trees to escape the tsunami and survived.
About 16,700 people were evacuated from their homes and housed at 24 centers in Palo.
Aerial photographs released by the National Disaster Organization show that many buildings and shops have been demolished, bridges have collapsed and a mosque is surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the earthquakes continued in the coastal town.
This series of earthquakes was felt in an area with a population of 2.4 million.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by the massive earthquake on Friday was about 200 times more powerful than the Hiroshima atomic bomb in World War II.
It is said that the geography of the city, which lies at the end of a narrow and long bay, may have enlarged the size of the tsunami.
Nogruho described the damage as "widespread" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels had been destroyed.
He said the bodies of some of the victims were found trapped under the rubble of the destroyed buildings, adding to 540 injured and 29 missing.
Nugroho said the loss and damage along the 300-kilometer-long northern coastline of Palu, an area called Dangala and close to the center of the quake, may be higher.
Nogruho said communications were "completely cut off and there is no information" from Dangala.
The Red Cross said in a statement that more than 300,000 people live there and that its staff and volunteers have been deployed to the areas.
“It’s a disaster, but it could have been a lot worse.”
The agency was severely criticized on Saturday for not knowing the tsunami was approaching Palo, but the agency's officials said the waves had reached the shore at the time of the warning.
In amateur videos shared on social media, the voice of a man on the top floor of a building is heard giving a loud warning of the tsunami approaching the people on the street below the building.
Within a few minutes, a wall drifts from the water to the beach, taking buildings and cars with it.
Reuters did not immediately confirm the film’s veracity.
The earthquake and tsunami caused power and communications to be cut around Palo, and it was difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue operations.
Officials said the military was sending aid from Jakarta and other cities by cargo planes, but homeless people still needed food and other basic necessities.
The city’s airport is open only to aid relief efforts and is closed to others until October.
President Joko Widodo visited the headquarters in Palo on Sunday.
The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia has risen to more than 800.
Things are very bad.
Mr. Doseba said World Vision staff from Dongala declared the situation of Palo safe, with staff installing shelters in their office yard in the city and undergoing devastation scenes.
He said: “They have announced that many houses have been destroyed.”
Things are very bad.
While relief groups have begun their move to reduce disasters with the help of available tools, some have complained that they are preventing the deployment of highly specialized foreign relief forces to Palo.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, resources and human resources from abroad are only possible when a national disaster is declared in the distressed region.
But that announcement hasn’t happened yet.
Olivia Arriani, spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross, said: “This is still a disaster on the provincial level.”
“When the government accepts it, it can be declared a national disaster. In this case, the path to international aid opens, but such a situation does not yet exist.”
Despite the two nights of Friday's earthquake and tsunami in Palo, the friends and family of those who have been missing still hope that a miracle will happen about their loved ones and change the story of this sad natural disaster.
On Saturday, a boy was pulled out of the sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman who had been trapped under rubble for two days beside her mother’s body.
Gandoon Subandonu coach of the Indonesian Paragliders National Team, coach of two paragliders who had been trained for Asian games, has disappeared. The competition ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Other people trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel included Mr. Mandagi and his students.
“As a senior Paraglider coach, I’m under a lot of emotional pressure,” he said.
Mr. Gandon explained that a few hours after the news of the destruction of the Roa Roa Hotel, he was worried about his students and sent messages to the rivals present at the Palo Beach Festival via WhatsApp at the Paraglider Forum.
However, instead of a pair of blue ticks, his messages received only one gray tick.
He said, “I think a gray tick means that the messages were not delivered.”
Thieves stole $26,750 from an ATM in Newport, Levee, when they transferred money to an ATM.
According to news released by the Newport Police Center, thieves stole $26,750 from Brink employees on Friday morning as they transferred money to an ATM in Newport, Levee.
Detective Dennis McCarthy said the driver was unloading an ATM and preparing it to deliver money at an entertainment center.
While he was busy, another man ran “from the back of Brink’s employee” and stole a purse of money that was to be delivered.
According to the news, witnesses have identified several suspects who fled the scene, but police have not determined the number of people involved in the incident.
People who have information about the identity of the thieves should contact the Newport Police Department at number 3680-292-859.
Kenny West: The rapper who changed his name to Ye
The rapper West changed his name to Ye.
He announced the change on Twitter on Saturday, writing, “My official name is Keni West.”
The 41-year-old West was nicknamed Ye and used the nickname for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The name change was announced before his appearance on the live show on Saturday night, where he announced he would soon make his new album called Yandhi.
The producer announced that he was replacing Ariana Grande, the former singer of the show, who had cancelled it to "Emotional Delilah".
Ye is an acronym for the current professional name West, and he said that the word has religious significance for him.
Earlier this year, West said in an interview with his eldest son's radio program about his album: "I think you're the word most used in the Bible that means you.
“I will be you, I will be us and for us.
I change my name to Ye, to be a reflection of our goodness, evil and confusion, and everything.
“This album is more than the reflection we are.”
He is one of the few famous rappers who has changed his name.
For example, Sean Combs is known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced that he would rather call himself Love and Brother Love.
A former West colleague, JAY-Z is also known with or without a dark line and letters and large or small.
AMLO (President of Mexico) has promised not to use the military against civilians.
Andres Manuel López Obrador, president-elect of Mexico, has vowed to never use military force against civilians as the 50th anniversary of the bloody mass murder of students approaches.
López Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Palace that he would “never use the army to oppress the Mexican people.”
During the peaceful demonstrations that took place on October 2, 1968, and as leftist student movements grew throughout Latin America, soldiers opened fire on people and killed 300 people.
López Obrador has been committed to supporting Mexican youth by giving monthly grants to those studying and opening state universities.
According to him, unemployment and lack of educational opportunities make young people drawn to criminal groups.
The U.S. needs to double its artificial intelligence (AI) funding.
Kai Fo Lee, an AI investor and activist working at Google, Microsoft and Apple, says: “Given China has become more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. needs to double the investment for research in this area.
These comments were then announced that different sections of the U.S. government had issued statements on AI, and that the U.S. generally lacked an official strategy on AI.
While China announced its plan last year: their goal is to rank first in AI innovations by 2030.
“Double the AI research funding would be a good start, given that other countries are much further away from the United States and we are looking forward to the next advancement in AI,” Lee said.
In an interview with CNBC this week, Lee said that doubling the investment could double the chances of AI being successful in the U.S. future.
Lee is the author of the book “Artificial Intelligence Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order,” published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. He is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China’s leading AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that defeated Othello in America. Later, he became CEO of Microsoft and head of the Google branch in China.
Lee, who honors technology competitions held in the previous U.S. government, such as the robotic challenge conducted by the Department of Defense's Advanced Research Projects Agency, wants things like this in the future to help recognize future dreams.
Lee says that researchers in the U.S. often work hard to get government aid.
Lee said: “It’s not China that has taken over academic researchers; it’s the companies that do it.”
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired academic talent to work on AI.
Lee said changes in immigration policies could also help the U.S. intensify its AI efforts.
He says in my opinion, people who have a doctorate in the field of AI should be automatically given a green card.
In July 2017, China’s State Council released its next-generation AI development program.
According to Lee, the National Science Foundation of China, which provides financial aid to people in academic institutions, is similar to what the National Science Foundation and other government agencies do for U.S. researchers, but the quality of scientific work in China is lower.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense set up a joint artificial intelligence center with the goal of building collaboration between industry and the university, and the White House also announced the formation of an artificial intelligence selection committee.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in a project called AI Next.
And in the case of NSF, it has already invested more than $100 million in AI research.
But the U.S. law, which sought to establish a national security commission on artificial intelligence, hasn't worked much in recent months.
Macedonians in a poll say whether or not they want to change their country’s name
The Macedonian people took part in an all-out poll on Sunday and voted to change their country’s name to the “North Macedonian Republic”, a move that will lead to a decades-long dispute with Greece because it has prevented the country from joining the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that its northern neighbor’s name indicates some sort of claim to the country’s territory and has vetoed Macedonia’s entry into NATO and the European Union.
The two governments reached an agreement in June on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents believe the change will weaken the ethnic identity of the Macedonian Slavic majority.
President George Ivanov said he would not vote in all polls, and that he would impose sanctions on all polls, raising doubts as to whether the number of voters required to be validated would reach at least 50 percent.
The question on the ballot papers is: “Do you agree with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece and membership of NATO and the European Union?”
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zarman Zaif, believe that the cost must be paid by Macedonia, one of the countries resulting from the collapse of Yugoslavia, in order to be able to join the EU and NATO.
“Olivera Georgievska, 79, who lives in Skopje, said: ‘I came here today to vote for the future of my country, for the young Macedonians so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because our lives will all be safer.’
Members of parliament have declared that they are adhering to the outcome of the election, although this is not legally necessary.
The change of name requires a two-thirds majority in the House of Representatives.
The provincial election commission said no reports of violations of the laws had been made until 1 p.m.
However, the number of respondents in all polls did not exceed 16%, while in the recent parliamentary elections in 2016, about 66% of registered voters took part in the election.
62-year-old Josie Tanowski, one of the voters in the capital, Skopje, says: “I voted for my children, Europe is our place.”
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dashko cast their vote on September 30, 2018, in Strumica, Macedonia, to open the way for the country to join NATO and the European Union.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small stage and placed the chairs in front of tents erected by the sanctioning people.
“We belong to NATO and the European Union, but we want to join them with pride, not through the back door,” Kavarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we also have Sean and his family.
If they don’t want to accept us as Macedonia, we can go back to others like China and Russia and be part of an integrated European and Asian society.”
Prime Minister Zaif says membership in NATO is a huge investment for a country with an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I believe that the majority of people are in favour of this because more than 80 percent of our citizens want the European Union and NATO," he said.
He said, “Yes, it will be a sign of our future.”
A survey published by the Macedonian Policy Research Institute on Monday found that between 30 and 43 percent of eligible candidates will take part in all surveys — a figure below the set-up threshold.
Another survey conducted by the Macedonian television network Telma showed that 57 percent of respondents intend to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
To be successful, all respondents will need a 50 percent plus one vote.
The defeat in all of the polls is the first serious blow to Western pro-government policies that came to power in May last year.
Watch: Sergio Aguero, a Manchester City player, passes through all the defenders and scores the ball.
Sergio Aguero and Rahim Stirling on Monday at the Manchester United Stadium mixed up Brighton's defense to score a Manchester City 2-0 win.
In the 65th minute, Aguero drew the ball into the team's goal.
The Argentine striker received a pass in the middle of the line at the beginning of the re-start.
He passed through the three defenders of Bryton and opened up space for himself.
Then Aguero saw himself among the four green players besieged.
With his moves on the edge of the penalty area, he drew the defense around.
Then he turned to his left and came to Stirling.
This English forward hit Aguero again with a punch inside the ball field. He also hit the ball with his right foot and beat Matthew Ryan to the goalkeeper Bryton and slammed the ball against the wall on the right side of the gate.
Pep Guardiola, the manager of the City team, told reporters, “Aguaro is having some problems with his feet.”
“We talked about him playing for 55 to 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were fortunate to have a flower in that moment.”
But it was Sterling who first scored in the top league for the blues.
The goal was scored in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball in the depths of the ground for you.
He took the ball beautifully from the left side to Lori Sean.
Before Sterling went further towards the bullet, Sin hit the ball several times.
Forward glued the sky blues right at the neck of the ball gate to the tower.
City of the Champions League group play series at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday afternoon at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play as a spoiler against the Rockies
Although the Nationals have been removed from the playoffs, they have little reason to try to get another start.
But the Scherzer team always hopes to win the game against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if it has the concept of a playoff for the Rockies, which has had a game more than the Los Angeles Dodgers in the Western National League.
The Rockies won at least one wild card on Friday night with a 5-2 win over the Nationals, but they still plan to get their first title.
“While we’re playing for nothing, we can at least touch the ball, knowing how Joe is here in Denver with this crowd and the other team, he’ll probably play at the highest level we’ve ever faced.
“Why don’t I participate in that competition?”
The Nationals are set to announce a starter for Sunday’s game, but it has been reported that they are willing to put Scherzer in the post.
Scherzer, who can have his 34-day start, has a kick-off practice session on Thursday and a regular rest on Sunday.
Washington's right-handed stats are 18–7 with 2.53 ERAs and 300 hits in 220–2.3 rounds this season.
Category: Trump speeches in West Virginia
President Trump spoke on the situation surrounding the Supreme Court and Bert Kavanaugh, as well as on the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
“We will gamble all our achievements in November.
Five weeks remains one of the most important elections in our lives.
“This election is one of the biggest and it’s great – I’m not a candidate in this election, but I am, because I’m fighting for candidates here.”
“You see this horrific group, you see this radical, horrific Democrats, you see this is happening right now.
They are determined that by any means necessary to gain power, you will see the postage of these and the impurity of this group.
“They don’t care who gets hurt in the campaign, who puts away to gain power and control, that’s what they want: power and control, but we don’t want to give them those two.”
He said the mission of the Democrats is to “create resistance and a curb.”
He said, “And you see how, over the last four days, Democrats have been called angry, dishonest, impure, and untrue.”
He pointed to the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee and Democratic Senator Dean Finstein as to how the crowd had beaten him.
“Do you remember his answer?
Have you read the papers that you cut out?
Whoa, whoa, what?
No, no, I’m waiting — body language that was really bad — the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
The Labour Party is no longer a large church.
For those who support freedom of speech, this is not tolerable.
I was not surprised when the activists at the local party gave me a critical vote.
However, I was the last in the line of Labour Party representatives who were not welcomed - all for freedom of speech.
Zhuan Ryan, my parliamentary colleague, had seen the same behavior, because he was strongly opposed to anti-Jewishness.
In my case, I was criticized for opposing Jeremy Corbyn.
There are similar issues about the importance of politics in economics, in national security, in Europe, in which crime has differed from previous leaders.
In a notice to the Labour Party meeting in East Nottingham on Friday, it was stated that “we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
In my eight years as a local representative of the Labour Party, Friday night’s GC meetings were exactly that.
Unfortunately, this tone is not seen in many meetings today, and the promise of a “more kind and gentler” policy has long been forgotten if it had begun.
It is very evident that different views in the Labour Party are not tolerated and opinions are judged as to whether or not it is acceptable for the leadership of the Party.
This phenomenon began shortly after Jeremy became the leader, when I had previously imagined that I would share a similar political theory with his colleagues, they thought I wanted to circumvent them and had positions that I would never disagree with about national security or the single market of the European Union.
Whenever I speak in public - and it really doesn't matter what I say - an intense speech on the abuse of social media that demands non-choice, condemns the politics of the center, tells me I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And that didn’t just happen to me.
In fact, I know I’m more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the opinions they give about me are political.
I am exposed to being a professional and committed colleague who faces a flood of sexual abuse or racism every day but is not ashamed at all.
One of the disappointing aspects of this era of politics is that abuse has normalized to a certain level.
Last week, Jeremy Kerry announced that the Labour Party should cultivate a culture of tolerance for other speeches.
The fact is that we are no longer a large church, and with every move from “no confidence” or change in the laws of choice, the party becomes more limited.
I’ve had plenty of recommendations over the past two years that make me feel down, have nothing to say, and just say very well.
But that’s not what I’m into politics to do.
I joined the Workers' Party as a school student 32 years ago, which was due to the encouragement of the Thatcher government. This caused me to lose high school classes officially, I was trying to provide better public service for those who needed it - it didn't matter whether the government was a member of the council or a member of the council.
I never hid my politics, including in the last election.
No one in East Nottingham gets confused about the political stances and controversies I have with the current leadership.
To those who encouraged this move on Friday, I can only say that when a country moves hard toward choices that hurt our households, businesses, and public services, it does not tend to waste time and energy on loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But really, one of my messages that hasn’t come to Nattingham Moentem, and to members of the House, whether they are from the Labour Party or not, is this: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of non-choice or political good will will come to me from doing what I believe is in the best interests of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr Invincible
Trying in the final two stages may change the final result somewhat, but there is no doubt that Ire deserved this amazing and interesting win in the Rugby League.
They are currently at the top of the table and the only team that has not yet lost on one side.
Ultimately, this was their top defense, and with the chance they had to win the host team, Coach Peter Morchi was right to be happy.
"We've been tested during the races and we haven't failed yet, so we should be happy," he said.
Robin Christie of Melrose said, “Well, they used their chance better than we did.”
Grant Anderson's attempt at the 14th minute was completed by Frissier Clemmo and put Ire ahead, but a yellow card was given to Scottish captain Rory Hughes for play by the Warriors, and Jason Baggott did not make an effort without a pass.
Clemio pulled the lead player of Iris with a penalty kick, before, just in the middle of the game, he scored a goal, then with a single pass, he made the result 17 to 5 in favor of Iris.
But Melros started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's effort reduced the difference to five points with the Baggot pass.
Then, due to severe injury to Ruaridh Knott, the game was halted for a long time, after a restart, by the efforts of Stafford McDowell, by Pass Clemeo, Iro again increased the distance.
Then Blair McPherson, Captain Ire, took a yellow card and once again Melrose lost another player to Bruce Collins at the end of an intense push.
However, the host team returned to the game, and when Strahan Hutchinson took a yellow card on the cliff with no ball, McPherson fell behind the striker group IR Touch Down.
Clemio made a quick pass, as he had done at the beginning, after Kyle picked up the shot into David Armstrong's pitch and drove the striker Gregor Henry away from the host's fifth area.
The star of the Still Game series is looking for a new professional in the restaurant industry.
It seems that after it turned out that Ford Kairan is still playing Still Game as the manager of a licensed restaurant introduced to the restaurant industry.
The 56-year-old man played Jack Jarvis in the BBC's popular series, which he also wrote, and has worked with Wolf Humphil for a long time as a comedy couple.
The two have announced that the next series, which is the ninth series, will be the last of the show, and it looks like Kiran is planning for his life after Krigalang.
According to the official registration lists, he will be limited to the manager of Edriftmoren.
The actor is unwilling to explain, though Scottish Sun said Kiran is looking to enter the "prosperous restaurants" business in Glasgow.
“The sea is for us”: Bolivia, which has no way to the sea, hopes to open the way for the country to the Pacific
Sailors protect the naval headquarters in Lapaz.
In public buildings, the blue ocean flag has come to the fore.
At sea bases, from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, the motto is: “The sea is our right.
It’s a duty to bring it back.”
The memory of losing the coastline and delivering it to Chile, which led to a bloody war in the nineteenth century, is still alive throughout Bolivia that has no way to the sea – just like the passion for sailing in the Pacific.
These hopes have reached their highest level in decades, as Bolivia awaits the ruling of the International Court of Justice on October 1.
Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla says: “Bolivia is moving, the spirit of unity and peace has prevailed, and of course it is awaiting positive results.”
Many Bolivians across the country are watching the ICJ's announcement on the big screens, hoping that the Hague court - after decades of negotiations - will vote in favor of Bolivia's claim and oblige Chile on Bolivia's domination and access to the sea.
Uo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic and indigenous president - who faces a tough fight to be re-elected next year - is making a lot of maneuvers about announcing Monday's verdict.
He promised in late August, “We’ll be back to the Pacific very soon.”
But some analysts believe that it seems unlikely that the court will decide in favor of Bolivia - and if it does, it will come with a little change.
The United Nations court, which is headquartered in the Netherlands, has no jurisdiction to grant a portion of Chilean territory and has stated that the court’s vote cannot determine the outcome of the negotiations.
Paz Zarate, an international law expert in Chile, said the ICJ’s verdict was announced just six months after hearing the arguments that it showed the case was “not complicated.”
And away from Bolivia’s extra controversy, the past four years may bring it back.
Zárate said, “The issue of access to the sea has been abused by the current Bolivian government.”
He believes that the adventurous words of Morales have reduced Chile’s goodwill.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to debate on some points, but after that, it will be very difficult to continue the discussion.
The two countries have not had ambassadors to each other since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Voltz, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the notion that the court's decision had an unusual speed.
He said Bolivia would have a “great opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile” on Monday and would be an opportunity to end the 139-year-old dispute over mutual interests.
Calzadilla also pointed out that Morales – who is still one of the most popular presidents of Latin American countries – is using the maritime issue as a political lever in his favor.
“Bolivia will never go beyond its right to access the Pacific Ocean.”
“This is an opportunity to see that we have to overcome the past.”
North Korea says there will be no nuclear disarmament unless it can trust the United States
North Korea’s foreign minister, Ray Yong-hoe, says the country will never destroy its nuclear weapons until it can trust Washington.
Ray spoke at the U.N. General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to deliver on the promises made during the two-state summit in Singapore.
The statements point to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who appears to be resuming talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un on nuclear diplomacy more than three months ago in Singapore.
Ray said that continuing sanctions and U.S. protests to declare an end to the Korean War would bring North Korea to its knees is an “unrealistic dream.”
Washington will act very cautiously for the agreement as long as Pyongyang does not make a serious move towards disarmament.
Kim and U.S. President Trump both called for a second session.
But that Pyongyang is serious about removing nuclear arsenals, which is probably the only way to ensure the country’s security, is widely doubted.
Pompeo plans to travel to Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris Fashion Showcased the Last Line of Very Large Hats on the Way of the Streets Near You
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or completely avoid sunlight, you don’t have to search too much.
Valentino and Tom Brown, who are fashion designers, presented a series of very large hats for the SS19 series that glare the design style at Paris Fashion Week.
The impractical hats filled Instagram in the summer, and the designers showed off their eye-catching creations at the dress show.
The design embroidered by Valentino was a beige hat on the head, adorned with a broad edge that covered the heads of model ladies.
Other items that were too big included decorated pumpkins, a magic hat, and even a pineapple, but they weren’t designed to keep you warm.
Tom Brown also exhibited a set of strange masks that he only wore during Halloween.
Many of these colorful masks covered the lips and were more reminiscent of Hannibal Lecter’s design.
One of the designs was like a scuba hat with a breathing tube and swimming glasses, and the other design was like cage ice cream.
And if you can wear these strange hats and everyone looks at you, then you're lucky.
Lightweight observers predict that these large hats will be able to open their way to street shops near you.
Oversized hats on the heel of "La Bomba", a fencing hat with an edge width of 60 centimeters that can be seen on the heads of people like Rihanna to Emily Rajakovsky.
The label of the school of thought that posted behind the very inappropriate hats that were scattered across social media posted a great creativity of the show's location - a coastal sack of fences that is roughly the size of the Mayo swim model that carries it.
The burnt orange fence bag with the edges of the fence, which has a white leather handle, was the main design in the Jacquemus 'La Riviera SS19 collection at the Paris Fashion Week.
Luke Armitage, a fashion expert for celebrities, told FEMAIL: “These big hats and beach bags are expected to be available next summer in street stores – because the designer has made such a huge impact, so the demand for big accessories cannot be ignored.
John Edwards: Language skills are essential for citizens in the global arena
Scottish independent schools have a high educational level and in 2018 continued to achieve excellent results in exams, which is reinforced only by individual and collective success in sports, arts, music and other social affairs of society.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, represented by the Scottish Independent Schools Council (SCIS), these schools strive to provide the best service to students and their parents.
Independent schools seek to prepare students for postgraduate and higher education, their elective careers, and their position as citizens in the global arena.
As an educational department that can design and execute a customized curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be a favorite and preferred subject in schools.
As Nelson Mandela said, “If you speak to a person in a language that he understands, your words come into his mind.
If you talk to him in his own language, your words will enter his heart.”
This is an important point that, in order to build relationships and trust with the people of other countries, we cannot rely solely on English.
From this year’s exam results, we can see that foreign language lessons are at the top of the league table with the highest acceptance rates in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students studying in foreign languages earned an excellent A-grade.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools shows that 72% of students who study Mandarin Chinese earned an excellent A grade, as well as 72% of those who studied in German, 69% of those who studied in French and 69% of those who studied in German.
The statistics show that independent schools in Scotland consider foreign languages as a vital skill for children and adolescents who will undoubtedly need it in the future.
Currently, foreign languages as a lesson are taken and taught in the same proportion as STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) courses in the curriculum of independent schools and elsewhere.
A survey conducted by the UK Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 found that 17% of employers’ needs for employment were related to a lack of language skills in the set.
Thus, the importance of language skills is becoming more and more important in order to prepare young people for future careers.
Given the future career opportunities they need, it is clear how much these skills are needed globally.
Regardless of the profession a person chooses, if they have learned a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future that a lifetime can use.
The ability to communicate directly with foreigners automatically puts a multilingual person ahead of competitors.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK and in 2013, 75% of people did not have the ability to speak in a foreign language to conduct conversations, and French is the only language with a two-digit percentage, or 15% of people can speak it.
That’s why investing in language education is important for children today.
Knowing different languages, especially the languages of developing countries, increases children’s chances of finding a suitable job.
Within Scotland, different schools teach different languages to each other.
A number of schools focus on modern classical languages, while others teach languages that will be more important to the UK by 2020, such as Mandarin Chinese or Japanese.
It doesn’t matter which language your child is interested in, there are at least a few languages to choose from in schools and educational staff who are specialized in this field are also available.
Scottish independent schools are moving towards providing a learning environment to prepare children and equip them with the skills needed to succeed in the future.
Today, in a global business environment, the vital importance of foreign languages in the future of the country cannot be denied, so it must be incorporated into education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered as “international communication skills.”
In independent schools, children in Scotland continue to have the right to choice, diversity and excellence.
Must be done (in French)
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Independent Schools Council.
LeBron will play for the team for the first time in San Diego on Sunday.
Expectations have been met for fans who want to see Lebourne James for the first time at the Los Angeles Lakers.
Luke Walton, coach of the Lakers, announced that James will play in the opening game on Saturday against Denver Nagts in San Diego.
It is not yet clear whether he will play for a few minutes.
Walton said on the team's official website: "This time will be more than one and less than 48 minutes.
Mike Trudel, a reporter for the Lakers, says James will probably play for a limited time.
After practicing earlier this week, James was asked to pause his schedule for the first six games of the season.
“At this point in my career, I don’t need pre-season games to get ready.
Trump's Election Gathering Time in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Trump is launching a series of election rallyes tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of five Trump meetings scheduled to take place next week, including stops in areas of Tennessee and Mississippi that are politically consistent with Trump.
With Trump’s approval vote on his nominee to fill the vacant Supreme Court seat, he intends to win their support for the upcoming midterm elections because Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress in the November election.
When is Trump’s election rally in West Virginia tonight, and how can it be watched online?
Trump’s election rally in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 7 p.m. ET on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump’s election rally in West Virginia online in the section below via live streaming on YouTube.
Trump is likely to point to this week’s Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh’s hearing, which was strained by the allegations he made about his sexual abuse and was postponed by a Senate vote for a week until the FBI’s investigation.
But the main goal of this series of election gatherings is to help the Republicans and strengthen them in the November election.
According to a Reuters report, President Trump’s campaign spokesman said the five election meetings next week were aimed at “energizing volunteers and supporters because Republicans want to protect the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives.”
A Trump campaign spokesman who refused to reveal his name told Reuters: “Congress control is so important to the president’s agenda that he will travel to as many states as possible because we are entering the busy season of election campaigns.
According to West Virginia Metro News, tonight’s election rally scheduled for Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could gather supporters from “Ohio and Pennsylvania around and be covered by Pittsburgh media.”
On Saturday, it will be the second time last month that Trump will visit West Virginia, the same state he won with more than 40 percent of the vote in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia's Senate Republican nominee, Mr. Patrick Morris, who is lagging behind in polls.
According to a Reuters report, Simon Header, a political expert at the University of West Virginia, said: “This is not a good sign for Morrissey that the president has been forced to come here to help him improve his position in the polls.”
Ryder Cup 2018: The U.S. team demonstrates its determination to fight and keep the hopes of entering Sunday's singles competition alive
After three one-way seasons, Saturday night’s four-person golf games could be what the Ryder Cup needs.
Motion swinging is a completely inventive sport concept, but players really believe in it, and there has never been anything more than that in competitions like this.
So they say, where is the movement now?
While walking all day, Jordan Spieth said: “They had six points of lead and now they’ve got four points, so I think we’re going to do it with a little move.
Of course, Europe has an advantage, four points ahead and twelve more games ahead.
Yet Americans, as Spieth says, feel like they're moving slowly and have a lot to cheer them on, especially on Spieth and Justin Thomas being in shape all day playing with each other and getting three points out of four.
Spieth’s moves from T to Green are excellent and are a model for others.
As his turn of play continued, shouts of joy grew louder, he was able to throw a vital leg into the hole and equalize the race by four points, when he and Thomas were two points behind after two.
His leg, which won the race for them at 15, was accompanied by a similar shout, a kind of shout that told you that he believed the American team would not be eliminated.
Spieth said, “You really have to work hard and worry about your own race.”
That’s all that each of these players have left.
18 holes to do a great job.
The only players who have scored more than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the legends of the Ryder Cup.
A strange but admirable couple in Europe, they scored four points out of four possible points and offered a flawless job.
"Moliwood" were the only couple who didn't shoot Bogie not only on Saturday evening, but on Saturday morning, Friday evening, and even Friday morning in the ninth square.
This round and the way in which their energy is exchanged with this happy and energetic crowd clearly shows that they are the players who can win on Sunday, and when the sun sets at Le Golf National, other than Fleetwood and Molinari, there will be no other famous player to win Europe.
Preferably both at the same time in different holes.
However, it is still too early to talk about the greatness of Europe.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly finished the work of Sergio Garcia, who was next to Alex Noren the champion of the morning quads.
A bogeyman and two doubles in the first nine pitches threw Spaniard and Swede into a hole they could never get out of.
However, there is no one on Sunday to help you get out of your pit.
Watching the four-person and four-ball competitions closely is very exciting because of the interactions that exist between the pair of players, the advice they give and don't give, and the way a strategy can change at once.
So far, Europe has performed better as a team and is entering the final day with considerable superiority, but this season of the four-person games has shown that the U.S. team has also had the courage to fight, something that some people, especially Americans, doubted.
In the final day of the Ryder Cup, Europe has a 10-6 lead.
After appearing very well in the four-team and four-ball competitions on Saturday, Europe was able to move 10-6 ahead of the United States and take a good lead in the final day.
The amazing couple Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari managed to win two times against Tiger Woods, who worked hard to inspire others and to score four points at Le Golf National so far.
Thomas Bjorn of the European team, who wanted to keep the cup they had lost to Hazeltine two years ago, was able to defeat one of the American players who had a bad throw in the four-ball match in the morning and score 3-1.
The U.S. team showed more resistance in the four-man races and won two races, but they were unable to make up for their lag.
Team Jim Furyk needs eight points out of 12 Sunday singles races to keep the Cup.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to score four points in a row, while he and Molinari doubled Molliwood after an exciting weekend and are the second pair in Ryder Cup history to score four points out of their first four races.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the four-ball race, they superbly defeated Woods and the new American Bryson Dechambeau, whose spirit was shattered, with a more decisive 4&5 result.
Woods, who had barely won two races on Saturday, occasionally showed his skill and talent but lost in 19 of his 29 races in four-man, four-ball and seven consecutive races.
Justin Rose rested in the morning in the four-ball competition and returned to his partner Henrik Stenson for the four-ball competition, and they were able to win 1&2 over Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - who are in the first and third world rankings.
However, the Europeans did not make their way on a pleasant day, accompanied by the winds of southwest Paris.
Three-time winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a good example for Americans by scoring two points on Saturday.
They won a hard 1&2 win against Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter of Spain in four balls and later returned to the field and in the four-man race, despite losing the first two holes, they were able to win 3&4 against Poulter and Rory McIlroy.
In Ryder Cup history, it has only happened twice that the team can make up for four points behind and enter singles competitions, although Furyk team only needs equals to keep the cup.
However, after being second in two days, it seems that facing the Sunday counterattack was too difficult for them.
North Korea says there is “no way” to disarm unilaterally without confidence
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions have caused his country to further distrust of the United States and under such circumstances would not be willing to surrender its nuclear weapons unilaterally.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Assembly that North Korea had taken “significant steps to demonstrate its good intentions” last year, including halting nuclear and missile tests, destroying the nuclear test site and committing to non-development of weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we have not received any proportionate response from the United States," he said.
Without trust in the United States, there will be no certainty about our national security, and under such circumstances we will not act in any way initially and unilaterally towards our disarmament.
While Ri reiterates North Korea’s repeated dissatisfaction with Washington’s resistance to the “stage” approach to nuclear disarmament, according to which North Korea will receive a reward by implementing each step, in this statement he does not reiterate or refute his statement that it is significant.
Ri pointed to a joint statement made by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first official meeting held between the current U.S. president and the North Korean leader on June 12 in Singapore, in which Kim noted that he had given up on his attempt to “deploy nuclear weapons and defuse the Korean peninsula.”
North Korea has sought a formal end to the Korean War of 1953-1950, but the United States has said Pyongyang must first renounce its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted demands to reduce tough international sanctions against North Korea.
Ri said the U.S. insists on a “nuclear disarmament first” approach, intending to achieve its goal by coercion and even oppose the “declaration of an end to the war” with increasing sanctions pressure.
Some fools think that sanctions can bring us to our knees, it’s a terrible idea.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions are increasing our distrust.”
Ri did not make any reference to the second meeting between Kim and Trump that U.S. President Donald Trump spoke at the United Nations a few days ago this week.
In exchange for three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae over the past five months, the minister pointed out that “if the other party were South Korea in the matter of nuclear disarmament, instead of the United States, there would be a nuclear disarmament on the Korean Peninsula.”
However, Ri’s tone of speech was completely different from last year’s, he told the UN General Assembly a year ago after Trump called “Mr. Evil President” Kim “a rocket man” who is committing suicide, targeting U.S. soil with your Korean missiles.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who had threatened a year ago to “completely destroy” North Korea, praised him for Kim’s courage to move toward disarmament, but said there was still much work to be done and sanctions should remain until North Korea’s nuclear disarmament.
Trump said on Wednesday he had no timeframe for it and stressed, “If it takes two years, three years, or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia said the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps it has taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that “implementation of the Security Council sanctions must continue with force and without backlash until we make sure that the nuclear disarmament is fully, definitively and approved.”
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously stepped up North Korea’s sanctions in an effort to block funding for Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and then said he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare the ground for the second summit of the two leaders.
Pompeo had travelled to North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying progress had been made, but North Korea accused him of "gangster requests" only after a few hours.
“North Korea pledged to destroy a missile site as well as a nuclear facility if the U.S. takes “proportionate action” with Moon this month.”
He said Kim had told him that he meant "proportionate measures" to the security guarantees Trump has pledged in Singapore and said he intends to move towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students spend a lot of time on a vacation.
This year, a new lesson at Harvard University, in an effort to combat the spread of Machu’s culture in the field of study among “survivors” who consume a lot of caffeine, wants all undergraduate students to sleep more.
One university professor found that most of the world’s best university students are unaware of the basics of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and an active specialist at Brigham and Women Hospital, designed the course, believing it to be the first of its kind in the United States.
After a lecture on the impact of low sleep on learning, he decided to set up this lesson.
He told the Telegraph: “A girl came to me at the end and said, ‘Why is this being told to me now and in my final year?’
She said no one had ever told me anything about the importance of sleep – which surprised me.”
This course, first introduced this year in the curriculum, explains to students how good sleep habits contribute to academic and sporting performance, as well as improve public health.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the University’s health services, said the university decided to add the lesson to the curriculum after it noticed that students were seriously sleepy during the week.
This one-hour lesson includes a series of interactive activities.
In one section, there is an image of a dormitory where students click on coffee cups, curtains, sports shoes, and books, and information about the effects of caffeine, light, and how athletic performance is affected by low sleep, as well as the importance of their sleeping habits.
In another part, participants are told how low sleep can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer in the long run.
Then a map of the university campus with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily habits.
Professor Czeisler added: “We know that this lesson will not change students’ behavior immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know — just as you have the right to know the health effects of smoking.”
He said the culture of pride in “living the night” still exists, and the addition of modern technology and increasing pressure on students indicates that sleep deprivation is an increasing problem.
He said ensuring enough and quality sleep should be a “series weapon” for the student to cope with stress, fatigue, and anxiety—even preventing excess weight, because low sleep puts the brain in a state of hunger that causes the person to constantly feel hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student from California who studies chemistry and physics biology and last year, in his first year at Harvard, attended one of the professor’s classes, helped design the course for Professor Czeisler.
He said the lesson opened his eyes and inspired him to try to deliver it across the campus.
He expressed hope and said that the next step is to ask all graduate students to undertake a similar educational program before joining the competitive institute.
Professor Czeisler advised that students should set a warning to determine their sleep time as well as their waking time and against the damaging effects of “blue light” emitted by electronic device panels and LED lighting systems that can unbalance your daytime rhythm and lead to difficulty sleeping.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal defeated Gerrard's allies
Dolly Menga's blow to the broken-up team yielded Steven Gerrard, causing the Blues to defeat the Rangers in another out-of-home match at Livingston, with a 0-1 loss.
The Ibrox team were looking to record their first win after winning 1-4 at St Johnstone, but the Gary Holt team scored Gerrard's second defeat in the 18 games they played as coaches to keep their team up with eight points of discord in pursuit of the Ladbrokes Premiership driver, the Hearts team.
Menga scored his goal seven minutes before the end of the first half, and the Rangers' little-motivated teammates were never able to deliver a good performance as needed to equalize the game.
While the Rangers have now dropped to sixth place, Livingston has ranked third and is only behind the Hibernian because of the difference in flowers.
One of the Rangers players, Calum Spence, was injured by a throwing object that was apparently thrown from the corner of the end of the stadium and had to undergo surgery to treat his head injury, which could be a problem for them.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that Ayr took past to the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt went to the field with the same 11 previous Livingston players who were able to score a point from the Hearts last week and should have been happy to have his team ready to defeat their opponents every time.
The Rangers may have owned most of the ball, but Livingston made better use of the balls he owned.
They should have scored just two minutes after arriving when Menga sent the ball to Scott Pittman at Allan McGregor's gate with his first deep pass, but this midfielder missed the big opportunity and sent the ball out a long distance.
A free-kick was hit by Keaghan Jacobs and reached Captain Craig Halkett, but his teammate Alan Lithgow was only able to send a long distance behind the gate.
Rangers took control of the game but about their game in a third final, it seemed more than believed, there is hope.
Alfredo Morelos definitely believed that a penalty should be declared in the final fifteen minutes when he hit Steven Lawless, but referee Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian player's requests and pointed out that he should be removed.
The Rangers scored only two shots in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly suffered a bit with Lassana Coulibaly's header and Ovie Ejaria's soft kick.
Although Livingston's 34-minute goal may have been against the game, no one can deny that they deserved it.
The Rangers couldn’t get behind Jacobs’ plans again.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson and he brought the ball to Menga with cold blood, and he too easily knocked the finish line and opened the gate.
Gerrard replaced Coulibaly and Ryan Kent between the two halves, and this change showed an almost immediate impact when the striker intended to bring the ball to Morelos, but Kelly came out of the gate with a beautiful move and prevented it from reaching.
But Livingston continued to offer exactly the same beauty game that viewers loved, with Lithgow and Halkett throwing high balls one after the other.
Holt's team could increase their lead in the final moments, but McGregor stood well against Jacobs before Lithgow hit the ball from the corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton claimed in the final moments that when he hit Jacobs, a penalty had to be announced, but again Thomson did not pay attention to him.
Anniversary: inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page of our "Sunday Morning" annuary: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago on such a day and counting ... the day when the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger created a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the manufacture of a device known as the Geiger counter.
With the performance of Geiger's counter in the 1950 film Coronado Bells, with artist Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, scientists who didn't seem cowboys, Geiger's counter, which was once one of the main foundations of science, also became one of the main foundations of public culture:
Man: "What is it?"
Rogers: “The Geiger counter is used to trace radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you put this phone on the meat, you can really hear the effects of the atoms emitted by the radioactivity in the minerals.”
Evans: “Really, she’s leaving now!”
Hans Geiger died in 1945 just days before he was 63 years old.
But the invention named after him is still alive.
New Cancer Vaccine Could Teach the Immune System to See “Payment” Cells
New Cancer Vaccine Could Teach the Immune System to See and Kill Diseased Cells
The vaccine trains the immune system to identify the patient’s cells as part of treatment.
This involves extracting immune cells from the patient and altering them in the laboratory.
They can then “see” the protein that is common in many cancers and then re-inject it.
The trial vaccine showed promising results in patients who had a variety of cancers.
A woman was treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to identify “sick” cells, and her ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
This involves extracting immune cells from the patient, altering them in the lab so that they can “see” a common protein that is present in many cancers called HER2 and then re-injecting these cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine.”
Professor Berzofsky explained that HER2 is “a sign of the development of several cancers” including breast, ovarian, lung and colon cancers.
A similar approach to removing immune cells from the patient’s body and “training” them to target cancer cells has been successfully performed in the treatment of some type of blood cancer.
Kanye West paid in favor of Trump by wearing a MAGA hat after his presence in the SNL.
Well, it didn't go well.
Kanye West praised U.S. President Donald Trump in his performance on Saturday Night Live and said he would be elected in 2020.
After performing the third song that night called Ghost Town, in which he wore a hat with the slogan Make America Great, he made unrelated speeches against the Democrats and stressed his support for Trump.
“I talk to white people a lot and they say, ‘How do you like Trump, he’s a racist?’
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have gone a long way before America.”
The SNL began the show with a humorous performance by Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star emulated the humor of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee on the allegation of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not aired, the West Speech film was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It’s unclear whether Rock intended to mock West with this.
West also flocked to the audience, who had trouble behind the scenes because of the hat he wore.
According to the Washington Examiner, he said: “They overpowered me behind the scenes.
They said, “Don’t wear that hat.”
They overpowered me!
And then they said to me, “You’re in a suffocating space.”
West continued, “You want to see the suffocating space?” and then he said, “You have to wear my Superman scarf, because that means you can’t tell me what to do. You want to move the world forward?
“Try the love.”
Veriety reported that his talks caused him to be heard at least twice by the audience, and it seemed that the SNL broadcasters had turned their backs on him, and someone there was saying to them, “The whole studio is surrounded by deadly silence.”
West was last seen as a replacement for American singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend Mac Miller, who was a rapper, died a few days ago.
West performed the song "I Love It" and while his dress was like a bottle of Perrier, he surprised many people.
West backed Candace Turner, the head of TPUSA’s conservative group, tweeting, “To one of the bravest people: Thank you for resisting the MOB.”
But the host of the talk show, Karen Hunter, tweeted that West “shows the same thing he really believes in, and it’s definitely amazing.”
“But I prefer not to support someone who I think is accepting and spreading a way of thinking that I think is harmful to my community (by buying music or clothes or supporting ‘his’ art).
He added: He is free.
We too.”
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he is now "the person who was previously known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name and replace Diddy's feet, known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His collaborator Snoop Dogg, a rapper, was previously called Snoop Lion, and of course the legendary poor musician Prince changed his name to a sign and then became an artist previously known as Prince.
He was charged with murder after being stabbed in a restaurant in Belfast.
After a man was stabbed in a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday, a 45-year-old man was charged with murder.
Police said the incident took place in Ballyhackamore.
The defendant is expected to appear in the Belfast trial court on Monday.
The charges will be investigated by the Attorney General.
Kit Harington's Crown and Throne Series Criticized for Poison Masculinity Syndrome
Kit Harington is known for playing the role of Jon Snow, a skilled female swordsman in the brutal, fantasy, and medieval HBO network game of thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor has been criticized for having the cliché of Machu Picchu and is said to showcase such roles, often making young boys feel that they have to be tough to be respected.
In an interview with the Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed there was a "problem" and was asked how to deal with the toxic masculinity problem in the MeToo era.
Kit, who has recently married Rose Leslie, the 31-year-old star of her supporting role in the Crown and Throne series, acknowledged that she “feels empowered” about solving the issue.
He said, “Right now, I personally feel completely empowered – where did we go wrong about masculinity?”
“What have we taught men when they were growing up, in terms of the problem we’re seeing now?”
Kit believes that television, thanks to its very masculine characters, may be partly responsible for increasing toxic masculinity.
He continued: “What is inherent and what is taught?
What is taught on TV and on the streets that makes young boys feel like they need to have this particular aspect of being a man?
I think that’s really one of the big questions in our era – how should we change this?
Because it’s clear that something is wrong with young men.”
In the interview, he also said that when the Crown and Throne series ends next summer, he has no intention of playing in advance or continuing the show, saying “his work on the battlefield and the horses is over.”
In November, Kit plays Sam Shepard in True West, a film that tells the story of a filmmaker and his brother who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that he thought the best outcome of the Crown and Throne series for him was meeting his wife Rose.
“I met my wife in this show, so this show gave me my family and my future life from here on out.”
In the Emmy-winning fantasy series, Rose plays Ygritte, the lover of Kit’s character Jon Snow.
The couple got married in June 2018 on the property of the Leslie family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reported a 14% increase in new cases
China has reported a 14% jump in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
Health officials say more than 820,000 people in the country are infected with the disease.
About 40,000 of the new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
In the vast majority of new cases, the disease is transmitted through sexual intercourse, indicating a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China due to the injection and transmission of infected blood.
Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province, but the number of people infected with HIV has dropped to almost zero.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 every year.
HIV transmission through sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was outlawed in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is very common.
Studies have estimated that because of the country’s conservative values, 90-70% of men who have had sex with men eventually marry women.
Many cases of transmission of the disease occur due to insufficient sexual protection in such relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged to provide universal access to HIV medicines as part of efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters has denied her employee's involvement in revealing GOP senators' information.
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday denied allegations that one of her employees posted the personal information of three U.S. Republican senators on the lawmakers' Wikipedia pages.
The L.A. Democratic representative said the allegations were made by experts and websites of the “extreme right party.”
In a statement on Twitter, Waters said: “Afterwards, rounds and again repetitive lies.”
According to reports, the information released included the home address and phone number of Senators Lindsey Graham from Southern California and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch both from the state of Utah.
Information posted online on Thursday was posted by an anonymous person at Capitol Hill during one of the Senate sessions on allegations of sexual abuse against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The revelation came shortly after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Hill reported that conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the posts was affiliated with the Waters office and released information from one of Waters’ employees.
Waters continued, “This unfounded claim is utterly false and utterly false.”
“My employee – whose identity, personal information and security are at risk as a result of these false and misleading allegations – was in no way responsible for disclosing this information.
This unfounded claim is utterly false and utterly untrue.”
The Waters statement promptly sparked online criticism, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
Fleischer wrote, “This lie was accompanied by anger.”
“This shows that he has no spirit to join the Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn’t do, they shouldn’t be angry.
You shouldn’t be spending hard.
He should not question the motives of the accused.
It has to be calm and calm.”
Fleischer appeared to be comparing Waters' reaction to Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics who appeared very angry at Thursday's meeting.
Omar Navarro, one of the Republican candidates who wanted to replace Waters in the midterm elections, also tweeted.
He tweeted, “If it’s true, it’s a big claim.”
In a statement, Waters said his office had warned “relevant authorities and legal entities” of the false allegations.
“We will ensure that the perpetrators are identified and take legal responsibility for all destructive and dangerous actions they have taken against one or all of my staff,” he said.
Johnny English Strikes Again - Rowan Atkinson's Anti-Spyware and Weak
It has recently become commonplace that in every new film that has a connection to the UK, we see signs of choice, and it seems to be the case with the new version of the Johnny English action-comedy film - which began in 2003 with Johnny English and was revived in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will making a comedy movie about how bad we really are be an opportunity for new exporters?
However, Johnny English’s big-eyed, rubber-faced, obsolete face has been able to get a license and release a new version for the second time – which his name more than anything else identifies as a ridiculous comedy character designed for non-English-speaking cinema areas.
Of course, he’s a silly serial agent who, despite his strange feat of linguistic grease, has mixed up a bit of the character of Detective Clouseau, the effects of Mr Bean and some of the character of that man and with the inside of a fire truck movie at the 2012 London Olympics.
He is also originally based on the traveler and internationally encrypted Atkinson man who once aired on Barclaycard TV commercials that are now forgotten and left the site after the turmoil broke out.
In the latest version of the movie JE, there are only one or two beautiful scenes.
I liked the scene where Johnny English approaches the helicopter wearing medieval armor and its fins briefly collide with his own hat.
Atkinson’s gift for a physical comedy is on stage, but it feels as though its humor is weak and strangely overly, especially given that now branded “serious” movies like 007 and their own impossible mission confidently present the comedy as part of the film’s components.
It feels like the humor of the film is more intended for children than adults, and in my opinion, Johnny English’s humorous events are less innovative and focused than Atkinson’s sweets in his silent films as Bean’s character.
This time, the film’s thematic assumption is that Britain is in serious danger.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated the ultra-series of British spies and revealed the identities of all British spies for fear of the spy serving - a disappointing little role for Kevin Eldon.
This last blow to a prime minister is an important and pressurized figure, and his power has already completely vanished due to political unpopularity: Emma Thompson offers her best performance in the same role as Teresa-May, but there’s nothing more in the script to enjoy.
His intelligence advisers tell him that since all active spies are at risk, he must re-employ one of the retired.
And that’s the same Johnny English who is now working as a teacher at a modern educational institution and is giving secret lessons on how to be a secret agent: There are a few cute cuties here and in the scenes that English is teaching at the spy academy.
English is quickly returned to Whitehall and presents himself in a brief briefing, then joins his former colleague Bough who had a lot of problems together, which the role is played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married and transferred to a submarine commander, playing the high-class woman Vicki Pepperdine, but unable to play well.
So Batman and Robin, who made a terrible mistake at Her Majesty's Secret Service, returned to the scene and joined Olga Kurylenko, who plays a beautiful woman named Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is dangerously under the influence of an active billionaire in the tech industry who has a charismatic character, claiming he can solve Britain’s computer problems: the negative role of Jason Volta played by Jack Lacy.
English and Bough begin their humorous odyssey: they are conspired as a pre-serving lead to the fire of a French restaurant; they lead to the creation of beatings by hiding their smuggling on the luxury boat Volta and leaving the country; and English in an effort to use the headset of virtual reality to capture the direction.
Certainly all efforts have been made for the final scene, but while it’s enjoyable and action-packed, effects from children’s special movies can also be seen throughout the film.
Something quite average.
And like the rest of the Johnny English films, I couldn’t find an answer to my question: Can the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that is truly fit for his talent?
The Labour Party rejected the idea that the British would work four days a week but get paid as much as five days a week.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is planning for an extreme plan that will make the British work four days a week - but get paid as much as five days.
According to reports, the party wants to give the heads of companies one more day off with salaries using the savings created by the Artificial Intelligence (AI) revolution.
The plan will allow employees to enjoy a three-day weekend vacation — and continue to receive the same previous salary.
Sources say the idea is “proportional” to the party’s economic agenda, and the party tries to move the country toward workers’ interests.
The move towards a four-day working week has been endorsed by the Trade Union Congress as a way to benefit workers from a changing economy.
A senior Labour party source told the Sunday Times: “It is expected that the policy review will take place before the end of the year.
“This won’t happen overnight, but the four-day plan for the week is a demand that fits the party’s approach to balancing the economy for the benefit of the workers as well as the party’s overall industrial strategy.
The Labour Party is not the first party to endorse such an idea, but the Green Party pledged four working days in its 2017 election campaign to implement the week’s plan.
However, this demand is currently not generally endorsed by the Labour Party.
A spokesman for the Labour Party said: “The party’s policy is not four working days a week, and the party has no plans for it.”
The shadow prime minister, John McDonnell, used the Labour Party conference last week to explain his view on a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he had decided to take back power in public service companies from “anonymous” and “user” managers.
Also, the prime minister’s shadow plans mean that water companies’ shareholders can’t take all of their shares because the Labour Party government can deduct “exorcism” from them based on the violations they have committed.
He also confirmed that he plans to incorporate workers into the board of directors and create group-owned funds to transfer 10 percent of private-sector companies' capital to employees, which means reaching a maximum annual share profit of <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy tell 60 Minutes if FBI investigation into Kavanaugh has changed their mind
The FBI's investigation into the charges brought against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote for his nomination for the Supreme Court for at least a week, and raises the question of whether the findings of this administration could lead him to depose any of the senators.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday, 60 Minutes reporter Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI’s findings could lead to a change of heart.
Kennedy seemed to be more explicit than his colleague, who was from Southern California.
Kennedy said, "I think, of course."
“As I said, I went to court, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
After this happened and the claim spread, I called her, and I said, "Did you do this?"
He was determined, determined, and confident.”
However, Graham’s vote seemed unchanged.
"I have expressed my opinion on Brett Kavanaugh and such allegations cannot change that," he said.
Graham, referring to Christine Blasey Ford, added: “Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly rejected it.”
“And whoever he calls, he cannot confirm the matter.
He is 36 years old.
I don’t see anything new to change.”
What is the World Citizenship Festival and has it done something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York City will host the World Citizenship Festival, an annual music event with a very famous band of stars performing in it and a very important mission: ending global poverty.
The World Citizens’ Festival, now in its seventh year, has brought tens of thousands of people to Great Lawn Central Park to enjoy not only performances by artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also their awareness of the main goal of the event, which is to end or severely poverty by 2030.
The World Citizenship Festival, which began in 2012, is one of the developed sections of the Global Poverty Project, an international support group that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people active in the fight against poverty.
People who want to participate in the concert, in order to receive free tickets for the event (unless they are willing to pay for VIP tickets), must do a set of tasks or “actions” such as volunteering, sending an e-mail to one of the world’s leaders, raising a target, or any other means of communication.
But global citizenship, while it has 12 years to achieve its goal, how successful has it been so far?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert the right way to encourage them to make a call to ask for action or another type of so-called “cliktivism”? – People who feel like they’ve done a great job by signing a book online or posting a tweet.
Global Citizenship says it has recorded more than 19 million “actions” from its supporters since 2011 that have sought to achieve many different goals.
They say these actions have helped drive global leaders to move forward and set up commitments and policies that cost more than $37 billion to make a positive impact on the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group pointed to 390 commitments and announcements stemming from their actions that at least $10 billion of it had already been paid or raised in the form of donations.
The group estimates that the guaranteed funds have had a direct impact on some 649 million people worldwide so far.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a group of UK-based investors and performers who, after receiving more than 4,700 tweets of global citizenship, have pledged to “help children grow and reach their full potential in the country” and pledged to contribute 35 million dollars.
The Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman told the crowd during a live concert in April 2018: “With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can eradicate malnutrition that is a social injustice and link it to history.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were taken in a request from the UK to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government announced that it would allocate the necessary cost for a project called Feeding Power, which would involve food intervention for 5 million women and children.
Global Citizenship responded to one of the frequently asked questions on its website that asked, “What made you think we could eliminate absolute poverty?”
“It will be a long and difficult journey – sometimes we will fall to the ground and we will not succeed.
But like the civil rights and anti-apartheid movements that took place before us, we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are some of the artists who will perform at this year’s New York event hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use Navy to “block” Russia’s energy exports – U.S. Secretary of State
U.S. Secretary of State Ryan Zinke said Washington could rely on its own naval forces “if necessary” to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets including the Middle East.
Zinke claimed Russia's intervention in Syria - especially as its activity is being conducted at the legitimate invitation of the government - was an excuse to discover new energy markets.
“I believe that the reason they are present in the Middle East is because they want to broker for their energy just like they are doing in Eastern and Southern Europe,” he said.
And according to this office, there are methods and tools to deal with it.
“The United States, using its own naval force, has the ability to ensure that the sea routes are open and, if necessary, block them to make sure that their energy does not go to market,” he said.
Zinke gave a speech to attend the event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group calling itself the “Energy Consumer Voice” in the United States.
He compared Washington’s approaches to confronting Russia and Iran and stated that they are practically the same.
While referring to Russia as a “single-product country” with a fossil-fuel-dependent economy, he said, “The economic option for Iran and Russia, more or less, is to exert influence and replace fuels.”
These statements show that Trump's policy is aimed at increasing exports of liquid natural gas to Europe and replacing it with European gas, which is a cheaper but farther away option for European consumers.
To achieve this goal, Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to encourage Germany to pull out of the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, “takes Berlin away” from Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is designed to double the existing pipeline capacity and bring it to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin says Washington’s strong opposition to the project is only for economic reasons and is an example of unhealthy competition.
Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting in September with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow: “In my opinion, we share the view that energy should not be a tool for exerting pressure, and consumers should be able to supply voters.
The U.S. position prompted a strong reaction from Germany and reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s industry-leading organization, the German Industry Federation (BDI), has recommended that the United States avoid interfering in EU energy policies and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
Dieter Kempf, chairman of the German Industry Federation (BDI), said after a recent meeting between German Prime Minister Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin: “It is inconceivable for me that a third government interferes in our energy supply.”
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren Says She Will "Seriously" Compete in 2020 Presidential Election
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would "seriously" compete for the midterm presidential election.
Warren confirmed at a municipal meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, that he was looking to compete.
According to The Hill, she said: “It’s time for women to go to Washington and fix our flawed government, and this includes putting a woman at the head of the affairs.
“After November 6, I will be seriously looking for a presidential race.”
Warren at a town hall meeting, opposed to Donald Trump, said he was "taking this area in the wrong direction."
“I am very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” he said.
Warren has so far bluntly criticized Trump and his nominee for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
Warren tweeted on Friday, “We definitely need an FBI investigation before the vote.”
However, the results of a poll released on Thursday found that most people in Warren’s constituency are not willing to participate in the 2020 election.
According to a poll conducted by the University of Suffolk/Boston Globe’s Political Research Center, 58 percent of Massachusetts’ “probability” voters said the senator should not participate in the election.
Thirty-two percent of his company supported the election.
The survey found that people were more supportive of former governor Deval Patrick’s company, with 38 percent agreeing with his prospective company and 48 percent opposed it.
Other prominent Democrats who are likely to stand in the 2020 election include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
The Associated Press reported that Biden said he would formally announce his decision by January.
Sarah Palin at Donald Trump’s presidential election rally highlighted her son’s PTSD syndrome Track Palin
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in the military in September.
He was arrested on Monday night on charges of domestic violence.
“What’s going to happen to my son, what’s going to happen to him after his return, I can name other families who have the negative effects of PTSD and some of the harm that our soldiers have felt back with it.
Palin spoke of his son's arrest as "the big problem that everyone ignores" and said of his son and the other veterans, "They come back in a different state, they come back with hard hearts, they come back and ask if it's respect for what their friends and soldiers are doing."
According to Wasilla Police Department spokesman Dan Bennett, he was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, according to reports of domestic violence and drunkenness.
18 states, as well as D.C., support challenging the new refugee policy.
Eighteen states, along with Colombia, support the creation of a legal challenge to the new U.S. policy that prevents refugee victims fleeing criminal groups or domestic violence.
NBC News reported that delegates from 18 states and the Friday section in Washington provided brief advice to the court challenging asylum policy.
The full name of the complaint in the Grace v. Sessions petition, which the U.S. Civil Liberties Union filed in August against federal policy, has not yet been determined.
She said her fiancée had been abused along with “his sons of friends who are a member of the gang of cruel criminals,” but U.S. officials rejected her application for asylum on July 20.
He was detained in Texas.
The government’s attorney who supported Grace explained that El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where large numbers of asylum applications are being sent to the United States, are countries that face widespread problems related to criminal groups and domestic violence.
The new U.S. policy on asylum, which led to the dismissal of the order of the Immigrant Review Board, allowed illegal immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy “ignores dozens of state, federal and international law.”
In a brief advisory brief, he said: “Under federal law, all asylum applications must be examined on the basis of the precise facts and conditions of the application, and such an exception violates this principle.”
Lawyers also argued in the advisory information provided that given the high likelihood that immigrants will be entrepreneurial and “provide the necessary workforce,” and concluded that the policy that prevents immigrants from entering would harm the U.S. economy.
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence.
Sessions said in a June 11 statement about the policy: “Refugee is available to those who have left their country because of torture or fear because of race, religion, nationality or membership in certain social groups or political views.
Asylum has never meant solving all the problems -- even all the serious problems -- that people around the world face on a daily basis.
Despite doubling the number of casualties, hard work is underway to find survivors in Palu.
The conditions for the survivors were increasingly bad.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, said: “I feel very bad as I am shaking my feverish baby boy’s body in an evacuation center in the damaged city of Palu.”
“The ambulance is carrying the bodies every moment.
Clean water is scarce.”
It is observed that the residents return to their destroyed homes, wander among their vessels that have been drowned in water, and try to save everything they can find.
Hundreds of people have been injured and hospitals have been damaged and destroyed by a 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered from shoulder and back fractures, rested outside Palu Military Hospital, where patients were treated for continued strong aftershocks.
When he described his feelings about the strong earthquake that shook the fifth-floor room of the hotel where he, his wife, and his daughter were present, there were tears in his eyes.
Haris told the Associated Press: “We didn’t have time to save ourselves.
I think I was thrown into the ruins of the wall,” he said, adding that his family was attending a wedding in the city.
“I heard my wife crying and asking for help, but then her voice became silent.
I don’t know what happened to him and my son.
I hope they are safe.”
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of “Propaganda Advertisement”
A week after a Chinese official newspaper published a four-page ad in one of the U.S. newspapers about the bilateral benefits of the China-U.S. agreement, the U.S. ambassador to China, Beijing, used the U.S. press to publish propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday, after accusing China of attempting to interfere in the U.S. congressional election on November 6, which China denied, pointed to the monetary attachment of China Daily to the Des Moines Register, Lowa's best-selling state newspaper.
Trump's accusation that Beijing is trying to interfere in the U.S. election showed what U.S. officials told Reuters was the beginning of a new phase of Washington's escalating pressure on China.
While ordering ads to promote trade is commonplace for foreign governments, Beijing and Washington are now engaged in a growing trade war that has prompted them to impose tariffs on each other’s goods.
Chinese and American experts said China’s retaliatory tariffs in the trade war were designed to hit exporters in states like Lowa who had backed Trump’s Republican Party.
U.S. Ambassador to China Terry Branstad, who has long been Governor of Lowa and is one of the major exporters of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing has hit U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
In an article published in the Des Moines Register, Branstad wrote: “China is continuing to crack down on printing propaganda ads in our own free press.”
Branstad wrote, “By publishing monetary advertisements in the Des Moines Register, the Chinese government is benefiting from the popular tradition of free speech and free press in the United States in its distribution of propaganda.”
“Instead, you see that at the newsstand that is here on Beijing Street, there are limited opposing voices and no real reflection of the opposing views that people may have about China’s worrying economic trajectory, because the media is heavily controlled by the Communist Party of China,” he wrote.
He added that “one of China’s most prominent newspapers has refused to accept the offer to publish his paper,” but he did not say which newspaper he meant.
Analysts warn that Republicans are humiliated by Kavanaugh as they are avoiding women voters from midterm elections.
Analysts have warned that as many Republicans face multiple allegations of sexual assault, defending Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and insisting on his election, this will lead to a cross-reaction, especially on the part of women in midterm elections.
There is a lot of emotion around this, and most Republicans have shown, based on records, that they want to move forward with a vote.
Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell College of Syracuse, told The Hill in an article published Saturday: “These things cannot be reversed.”
Reeher said he doubted Senator Jeff Flake’s minute support of the FBI’s investigation would be enough to calm angry voters.
According to the Washington newspaper, D.C. Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokeswoman for MoveOn, said Friday: “Women will not forget what happened yesterday – they will not forget tomorrow and November.”
Mic reported that despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, the Republicans had control of the judicial committee elected to handle Kavanaugh’s candidacy, protesters protested in the Senate hall Friday morning and shouted “November is coming!”
Stu Rothenberg, an unbiased analyst, told the news site: “The aspirations and motivations of Democrats are rising tremendously.”
“People say that this passion has already been high; it’s true.
But it can go higher, especially among women voters who have doubts, as well as 18-29-year-olds who don’t often vote even though they don’t like the president.”
Even before Ms. Ford’s public testimony, in which she detailed her allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts had stated that there would be a reciprocal reaction if Republicans supported her endorsement.
According to NBC News, Michael Steele, former chairman of the National Republican Committee, said earlier last week, “This has become a complicated issue for the GOP.”
Guy Cecil, director of U.S. Priorities, a group that helps Democrats win the election, told the news channel, “It’s not just a committee vote or a final vote or Kavanaugh being tried, it’s the way Republicans have handled the issue and how they treat him.”
By the way, Americans seem to be hesitant about who to believe after testimony by Ford and Kavanaugh, though the latter seems to be a bit more supportive.
A new survey conducted by YouGov found that 41 percent of respondents believe Ford’s testimony, while 35 percent said they believe Kavanaugh’s testimony.
In addition, 38 percent said they think Kavanaugh was definitely or probably lying in his testimony, while only 30 percent believed in Ford.
The Guardian reported that after announcing Flake's support, the FBI is investigating the allegations made by Ford as well as at least one other accused named Deborah Ramirez.
Ford swore an oath to the Senate Judiciary Committee last week, testifying that Kavanaugh had raped him intoxicated at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate, while attending a party together while studying at Yale in the 1980s, showed him his genitals.
The inventor of the World Wide Web is planning to launch a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup that is looking to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this technology legend, Inrupt, is a company based on the erners-Lee open-source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their information is stored and which people are allowed to access it.
In an interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the idea behind Inrupt is “global domination.”
He said about the startup, “We have to do it right now.”
“This is a historic moment.”
The program uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own “personal data storage space” or POD.
This space can include audience lists, to-do lists, calendars, music libraries, and other personal and professional tools.
This is like having Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify all available simultaneously and in one browser.
What makes this online storage of personal information unique is that it is entirely up to the user who can access what kind of information.
The company calls this “personal empowerment through information.”
According to John Bruce, CEO of Inrupt, the idea is that the company can provide the right resources, processes, and skills to help make Solid available to everyone.
The company now consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several developers who have contracted with them to work on the project, and a set of volunteer programmers.
As of this week, technology developers from all over the world can create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking to “Facebook and Google about creating or not creating a complete change that will revert all their business models overnight.
“We don’t get permission from them.”
Berners-Lee wrote in a press release published Saturday that “the Inrupt mission is to provide commercial and ecosystem energy to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid.”
Berners-Lee transformed the Internet in 1994 when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Berners-Lee has been an influential figure in the net neutrality debate in recent months.
Berners-Lee will remain open even with the launch of Inrupt, the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Information Institute.
Berners-Lee added: “I’m super optimistic about the next Web period.
Bernard Vann: Priest to receive the Victorian Cross in World War I
The only church priest in England who was able to receive the Victorian Cross as a warrior in World War I was honoured in his hometown on the occasion of his 100th anniversary.
Priest Colonel Bernard Vann received this award on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed four days later by a sniper and it was never known that he had received the highest military honor in the UK.
On Saturday, a memorial stone was unveiled by his two grandchildren during a parade ceremony in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said that exactly 100 years after his grandfather’s masterpiece, which led to this honor, was unveiled from his memorial stone, it was a “symbolic and intelligent” work.
According to the London Gazette on September 29, 1918, Colonel Vann led his guerrillas in the Canal de Saint-Quentin "during a thick fog and under heavy fire with balls and guns".
He later attacked the line of fire and led the line forward with "full delight" alone and before the ball attack, defeating the three squads.
Second Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918 - just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “something I know I could never have been good at, but it’s been counted small.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also placed a crown of flowers in his memory on the ground after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Royal Youth Group.
Michael Vann said, “He feels very proud to have played a part in the parade,” adding, “The dedication of a real hero is shown with the support of a lot of people.”
MMA fans stayed up all night watching Bellator 206 but instead got Peppa Pig.
Imagine you’ve been up all night watching a Bellator 206 just to avoid watching the main event.
The San Jose bill included 13 fights, including six fights on the main card that were broadcast live overnight from Channel 5 in the UK.
At 6 a.m., when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face each other, the television cover was cut off and the cartoon Peppa Pig aired, astounding and angering viewers in the UK.
Some of them felt bad after waking up to watch the fight until the early hours of the morning.
One Twitter fan called the change to a children’s cartoon “a sickening joke.”
Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president of marketing and communications, said when asked about the change, “This is part of the government’s regulation that at 6 a.m., this content is not appropriate so they have had to change the program to a children’s cartoon.”
Peppa Pig, yes.
Bellator CEO Scott Coker said they plan to work on their own plans to be able to cover UK viewers in the future.
Coker said, “When I think of broadcasting, I think we can think of planning for it.”
“But in that case, it was 6 a.m. on Sunday and we can’t think of a plan for it until Sunday in our time and Monday in their time.
But we are working on it.
Believe me, when this change of schedule took place, a lot of messages were ignored and those messages were not friendly.
We were trying to fix the problem, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn’t, it was a government problem.
I can assure you that this will not happen in the future.
We're going to reduce the number of fights from six to five fights - as we usually do - this time we tried to provide more service to the fans and we just tried it.
This is a deplorable situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels 'exercise' because of sexual desire
Olympic diver Tom Daley says she grew up feeling scorned by everyone because of her sexual desires - but this motivated her to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn’t realize until he went to high school that “they’re not all like me.”
While on the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs program, which was run by director Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke explicitly about gay rights to give “hope” to others.
He also said that becoming a father no longer made it important to win the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the lead author of the old program, has taken a few months off due to illness.
Daley, who participated in the first Laverne program as a dismissed person, said he felt “righteous” about all other people because “socially, loving boys and girls was unacceptable.”
“To this day, this sense of contempt and being different has been the real things that have given me the strength and ability to succeed.”
He said he wanted to prove that he was “an important person” so that when the rest of them became aware of his sexual desires, he wouldn’t let them down.
He, who twice won the Olympic bronze medal, became a prominent LGBT campaigner and used his presence at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia, calling on more countries to legalize homosexuality.
She said she is speaking out for the reason that she feels lucky to have been able to live openly and without negative consequences and wants to give “hope” to others.
He, a three-time world champion, said he fell in love with a man – American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black who met him in 2013 – “surprised me.”
Daley married the 20-year-old Oscar winner a year ago, but said the age gap had never been a problem.
“When you’re progressing so much at such a young age,” she went to the Olympics for the first time at the age of 14 and her father died of cancer three years later, she said it was hard to find someone who had experienced similar ups and downs at the same age.
The couple had children in June with a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "overall view" had changed.
He said, “If you asked me a year before, my whole attention would have been to win the gold medal.”
“You know what, there are bigger things than an Olympic gold medal.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.”
His son is by the name of his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said her father had refused to accept that he was dying and one of the last things she had asked was whether she still had the 2012 Olympic tickets - because she wanted to be in the front row.
He said, "I couldn't tell him you weren't going to be there until you were in the front row, Father."
“When he stopped breathing, I held his hand and when he really stopped breathing and died, I finally realized he wasn’t invincible.”
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
"I knew this was what I had been dreaming of all my life - to dive in front of a population of my own country in the Olympics, there was no feeling better than that," he said.
This was also the inspiration for her first choice of song – Proud by Heather Small – which accompanied her on her way to the Olympics and she is still very interested in it.
Desert Island Discs will air on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Unprepared Mickelson sat on the bench at the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a new record on Sunday in the 47th edition of the Ryder Cup, but will come to form to prevent it from turning into an unpleasant tipping point.
Mickelson, who takes part in the biannual event for 12 consecutive times, was placed on the bench by Captain Jim Furyk for four-ball and four-person games on Saturday.
This great player, who has a history of winning five times on the chart, instead of being at the center of the game as he often goes to the U.S., spends his day acting as a spectator leader and trying to improve his game in the field of winning the ball in the hopes that he can fix his problems.
This 48-year-old player, who has never been one of the best hitters, even at the height of his playing time, is not a good choice for Le Golf National's tough competitions, which are usually off-road shots of long grass around the golf course.
And if these competitions alone aren’t daunting enough, Mickelson will face the exact British Open champion Francesco Molinari in Sunday’s ninth race, who will team up with Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of his races this week.
If Americans who are four points behind despite the start of 12 solo races have a good start, the Mickelson race can be very vital and decisive.
Furyk assured his players, of course he could not say anything else.
Furyk said, “He fully understood the role he had played yesterday, he admired me and put his hand around me and said he would be ready tomorrow.”
“He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He’s earned a lot of honors and in the past and this week, these teams have learned a lot from him.
I didn’t think he would play in two games.
I thought it was more than that, but that’s how it went, and I think we should accept it.
He wants to be in the field like everyone else.”
Mickelson is set to break Nick Faldo’s record for the highest number of Ryder Cup appearances on Sunday.
This could be the end of a career in the Ryder Cup that could never be a good personal record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, however Furyk said his presence is an intangible asset for the team.
He said: “He’s funny, he’s a kid, he likes to touch other people, and he’s a great person to be on the team.
“I think younger players are having fun criticizing him, including this week that was spectacular.
In addition to playing, he brings us a lot of other things.”
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that their decisive superiority could soon be extinguished
Thomas Bjorn, captain of Europe, knows from his experience that getting to the final day of the singles race in the Ryder Cup with considerable superiority can easily turn into an unpleasant ending.
The Danish Open began its work from the 1997 Valderrama Championships, where a team captained Seve Ballesteros five points ahead of the Americans but were able to win in the end with a close result of 1<0xE2><0x81><0x84>214-1<0xE2><0x81><0x84>213.
Bjorn, after watching the 3-5 wins of 2018 on Friday and yesterday, which led to the 6-10 lead at Le Golf National, said by embodying those memories: “Remember, we had a definitive lead at Valderrama, we had a definitive lead at Brookline and we lost and we won at Valderrama.”
So history has shown me and all the people who were on the team that the game is not over.
Tomorrow, you must go to the field with all your strength.
Go there and do the right thing.
Until the scores are recorded on the board, the game is not over.
We have a goal, and our goal is to try to win the cup, and your focus should be on that goal.
I’ve always said I’m focused on the 12 players who are on our team, but we’re fully aware of the team that’s in front of us – the biggest players in the world.”
Bjorn, delighted with the performance of his players in this tough golf competition, added: “I never judge this early.
Tomorrow is a completely different day.
Tomorrow is an individual function that defines everything, and that’s a different thing to do.
When things are going well, it's great to be on the field with a teammate, but when you're on the field alone, your abilities as an open golfer will be fully tested.
This is the message you need to convey to the players, to deliver your best performance tomorrow.
Now, you’re leaving your teammate and he has to go and try to do his best.
Against Bjorn, Captain Jim Furyk will be looking to give his players a better solo performance than a team performance, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who were able to score three out of four points.
Furyk himself experienced both of these big changes on the last day, he was part of the winning team at Brookline, before Europe was able to do a "miracle in Medinah" and make him finish the game as a loser.
Asked how Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 captain, prepared his players to start the final day, he said: “I remember all the damn words of that day.”
“We have 12 big races tomorrow, but you want that quick start that you saw in Brookline to happen, similar to what you saw in Medinah.
When the movement force goes one way, it puts a lot of pressure on those who are in the race.
We define our composition on this basis and defeat their allies the way we love them, you know, tomorrow we're trying to work miracles."
The task of trying to lead the fight is assigned to Thomas and faces Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter and other Europeans in the top half of the mix, in the top race with Rory McIlroy.
Bjorn said of his solo choices: “I put this group of people in this order because I think it covers all sections.
The new German warship was delayed again.
Local media reported the newest German Navy ship would have to be completed in 2014 to be replaced by the old Cold War ships, but due to system failures and high cost, it would not be ready until at least next year.
According to the newspaper Die Zeit, the completion and dispatch of the main Rheinland-Pfalz ship from the new Baden-Württemberg class series has been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to a military spokesman.
The ship was due to join the Navy in 2014, but the troublesome post-delivery problems have made the fate of the ambitious project difficult.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships, which were ordered by the navy in 2007, will replace the old Bremen-class ships.
It is clear that these ships will benefit from a powerful balloon, a set of anti-vehicle and anti-ship missiles, as well as several radar technologies such as radar, infrared and sound reduction.
Other important features include a longer maintenance period - it will probably be possible to deploy new ships for up to two years away from the shores themselves.
Die Zeit wrote: "However, continued delays mean that these modern ships - which are said to allow Germany to increase its power in overseas waters - will be obsolete as long as it enters the navy.
Last year, when the German navy officially withdrew from the unsuccessful F125 and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg, the issue made a lot of noise in the media.
This was the first time the Navy had returned a ship after it was delivered to the shipbuilding factory.
There is little information about the reasons for the return, but German media have cited a number of severe "software and hardware" defects that used the ship when it was used for a war mission.
Software deficiencies are particularly important because Baden-Württemberg-class ships will be operated by a crew of 120 sailors - which is only half the human force of older Bremen-class ships.
It was also found that the ship is significantly heavier than standard, which reduces its performance and limits the ability of the Navy to add future upgrades.
The Rheinland-Pfalz 7,000 ton ship is thought to be twice as heavy as the similar class ships used by Germany in World War II.
Apart from the hardware shortcomings, the total cost of the project – including the training of the crew – is also becoming an understatement.
The cost is said to have reached a staggering 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion) – from the initial cost of 2.2 billion euros.
The problems faced by the new ships are of particular importance given the warnings that the German navy is decreasing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, chairman of the German parliament’s defense committee, admitted that the navy was “actually finishing deployable ships.”
The official said the problem has increased over time as old ships have been deployed but no replacement ships have been provided.
He regretted that none of the ships of the Baden-Württemberg class had been able to join the navy.
The National Trust investigates the secret life of bats.
A new study is underway in part of the Scottish Highlands to determine how bats use the area for food hunting.
Hopefully, the findings will reveal new angles in the behavior of these unique bird mammals and help guide their conservation activities in the future.
The study, conducted by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland, tracks short-lip bats and dwarf bats as well as long-eared bats and bats at Inverewe gardens in Wester Ross.
Special loggers will be placed in key locations around the area to track bat activities throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also use handheld detectors to perform mobile mapping.
A specialized analysis of the sound of all recorded cases, the frequency of the sound of the bats, as well as what each works.
A map and report of their habitat will then be created to provide an in-depth region-scale picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, Nature Conservation Advisor for NTS, expressed hope, and said the results of the study will determine which habitats are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management measures, including the creation of grasslands and how to maintain forests in the best way for bats and other related species.
Over the last century, the population of bats has declined dramatically in Scotland and across the UK.
They are threatened by the construction and development work that affects their nests and causes the loss of their habitat.
Wind and lighting turbines can also be dangerous for them, as well as insecticide papers and some building materials chemical compounds, as well as attacking domestic cats.
Bats aren't actually blind.
However, due to the habit of hunting at night, when it comes to prey hunting, their ears are more useful than their eyes.
They use a complex pejorative technique to pinpoint the exact location of insects and obstacles on their flight path.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes the issue of bats very seriously.
They have ten trained specialists who regularly perform mapping operations, survey nests, and sometimes rescue operations.
The organization has even designated the Threave Lands in Dumfries and Galloway, the habitat of eight of Scotland's ten bat species, as the first and only bat protected area in Scotland.
District Manager David Thompson says the area is an ideal territory for them.
“Here at Threave, we have a very suitable area for bats,” he said.
“We have old buildings, a lot of old trees and all the right habitats.
But there’s a lot about bats that’s still unknown, so what we’re doing here and in other areas will help us figure out what else they need to grow.”
He stressed the importance of examining the presence of bats before performing repair operations in buildings because the unintentional destruction of the nest of a mother bat could result in the death of up to 400 female and young bats, which would likely lead to the destruction of an entire local population.
Mosquitoes are under protection and killing, harassing, and disturbing them and removing their nests is illegal.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish head of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged people to help seriously.
“We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and for many of our species, we still don’t know how their populations continue to live.”
Ronaldo denies allegations of rape, and lawyers take the complaint from German magazine seriously
Cristiano Ronaldo cited the allegations of rape as “fake news” and said people “want to make themselves famous by using his name.
His lawyers are seeking a complaint from the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The attacker of the Portuguese and Juventus teams is accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in the room of a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
Der Spiegel reported on Friday: It is alleged that he then paid the woman $375,000 to keep her silent about the incident.
The 33-year-old, who spoke to 142 million followers on Instagram hours after the allegations were reported, strongly denied the allegations and called them “fake news.”
“No, no, no, no, no.
He, who won the gold ball five times, said to the camera that day, "What they said today was fake news."
“They want to make themselves famous by using my name.
This is normal.
They want to be famous by taking my name, but that’s part of my job.”
The player added with a smile, “I’m a happy person and everything is going well.”
According to Reuters, Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to complain to Der Spiegel about the allegations that it is an “invalid report of unproven privacy information.”
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player sought compensation for “mental injury to a degree proportionate to the attractiveness of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations committed in the field of individual rights in recent years.”
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
According to documents from the Clark District Court, Ronaldo and Mayorga have returned to the player's room after meeting at the nightclub, alleging that Ronaldo violated him from the anus.
Mayorga claimed that after the incident, Ronaldo fell on his knees and told him that he was "99 percent" a "good guy" and "one percent" a bad guy.
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the two men had had sex, but said that the relationship was with consent.
Mayorga also claimed to have gone to the police and taken pictures of his injuries at the hospital, but later agreed outside the court because she felt “fear of retribution” and worried about “public deprivation.”
The 34-year-old woman says she is now seeking to overturn the deal due to continued mental damage from the alleged incident.
At the time of the alleged assault, Ronaldo was on the verge of breaking up with Manchester United and joining Real Madrid, and this summer he joined Italy's Juventus in a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million deal.
The loss of automakers for the UK will result in “perpetual regret”
UK Commerce Minister Greg Clark has said that if the UK loses its position as a world leader in automotive after the election, it will be “their eternal regret.”
It is "worrisome" that the British Toyota unit told the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without a deal, production at the Burnaston plant near Derby would be temporarily suspended.
Mr. Clark said, “We need a deal.”
The Japanese automaker said the impact of border delays in the event of a no-deal election could end at the cost of losing jobs.
The Burnaston plant - which produces Toyota's Auris and Avensis cars - produced around 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to other EU countries.
Marvin Cooke, CEO of Toyota at Burnaston, said: “My view is that if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March without a deal, we will see production stop at our factory.”
Other UK automakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have also expressed concerns about leaving the EU without a deal on how to conduct overseas trade.
For example, BMW says a month after the selection, it will close its Mini production plant in Oxford.
The main concern about what automakers are saying is about the risks of supply chains in the event of a no-deal exit.
Toyota’s production line operates on the “right on time” principle, so that parts arrive at the factory every 37 minutes from UK and EU suppliers to make the cars on order.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be a disruption to the borders, which industries say could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
Toyota said it would be impossible for us to maintain our inventory at the Derbyshire plant for more than a day, and so production would be stopped.
Clark said Mrs. May’s Chequers plan for future relations with the EU was “precisely designed to prevent these problems at the border.”
He told Today Channel 4 BBC radio: “We need to have a deal. We want to have the best deal so that, as I say, it will allow us to succeed not only now but also allow us to take advantage of this opportunity for us.”
“What has been raised not only by Toyota but also by other manufacturers is that we need to be able to fully continue to use this successful supply chain package.”
Toyota could not say how long production would stop, but warned that in the long run, these additional costs could reduce the factory's competitiveness and eventually lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is responsible for the Unite call, said that the concerns of union members are growing: “Based on my experience, once these jobs are gone, they will never be revived again.
A government spokesman said: “We need to come up with an accurate and reliable plan for our future relations with the European Union.”
White House says Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again
The White House said on Sunday, with ongoing controversy over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, Donald Trump’s high-risk meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be delayed “another week.”
Rosenstein oversees the role of special adviser Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russia’s interference in the election and the link between Russia and Trump’s assistance and the possible prevention of the president’s execution of justice.
Whether or not Trump fires the deputy attorney general and thus jeopardizes Mueller's independence has sparked rumours in Washington in recent months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein raised the issue of having a microphone with him to record his conversations with Trump and the possibility of the president’s removal through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein rejected the report.
But last Monday he went to the White House despite reports of resignation.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was at the UN at the time in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he "prefers" not to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed to another time to prevent him from interfering with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearings in which Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Belize Ford, one of the women who had convicted him of sexual misconduct.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to investigate the alleged allegations against Kavanaugh for another week, further delaying the court’s vote.
Sarah Sanders, Trump’s deputy press secretary, appeared on the Fox News program on Sunday.
When asked about Rosenstein’s meeting, he said: “A date has not been set for this issue, it could be this week, given other issues that are going on in the Supreme Court, it may be another week to postpone.
But let’s see what happens and I always like to give the latest news to the press.
Some reporters disagree with his statement: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10.
Chris Wallace, the director of the show, asked why.
Sanders said the lack of information provided about the meetings was not due to a lack of interest in “attracting” television journalists, although he said, “I don’t disagree with the fact that they are looking to attract media attention.”
He then offered to increase Trump’s direct contact with the press.
“The president holds more question-and-answer sessions than the president’s predecessor,” he added, without mentioning any evidence: “We’ve looked at those numbers.”
The briefing is still available, but if the press has the opportunity to speak directly to the president.
“We’re trying to keep these meetings going, and you’ve seen a lot of these meetings over the past few weeks, and when you can talk to the president of the United States, those meetings will take the place of press meetings.”
Trump responds to questions when he leaves the White House or attends free meetings or press conferences with senior officials.
Individual press conferences are a rare occurrence.
This week in New York, the president may have pointed out the reason for this, appearing freely and strangely in front of a crowd of reporters.
The Minister of Health writes a letter to EU staff at the National Health Insurance and Therapy Organization of Scotland about concerns about the choice.
In a letter to the staff of the European Union working at the National Health Insurance and Treatment Organization of Scotland, the Minister of Health expressed his country’s deep appreciation for them and wished them to remain in the post-election phase.
Mr Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, wrote a letter stating that there was less than six months left until Britain left the European Union.
The Scottish government is committed to paying the costs of applying for finalised statuses related to EU citizens working in weakened public service organisations.
Ms Freeman wrote in her letter: “During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on the withdrawal of the EU have been heading towards the foreseeable decisions that will be taken in the fall.
But the UK government is also stepping up its preparedness for a disagreement scenario.
I know this must be a very sad time for you.
That’s why I wanted to emphasize how much I value each member, regardless of their nationality.
Our colleagues across the European Union and even beyond bring with them valuable experiences and skills that strengthen and improve the healthcare sector and benefit the patients and communities I serve.
Scotland is definitely your home, and we want you to stay here.”
Kristin Averroemboi undergoes emergency surgery after being injured in her head
According to a report by Mike Organ of Tennessee, Christine Averroes, the backer of the Tennessee State Tigers team, underwent emergency surgery on Saturday after being injured from the head area in a 31-27 loss.
Coach Rod Reed Tennessee State told reporters that the injury occurred a few minutes before halftime.
Reed said, “He came to the line and then fell to the ground.”
Coaches and medical staff gave him oxygen on the sidelines before putting Averroes on Brancard and transferring him for further examinations.
An official from Tennessee State to Chris Harris of the WSMV network in Nashville, Tennessee, said surgery at the Winderbilt Medical Center is over.
Harris added, “There is still no detail on the type and extent of the injury, and Tennessee State is trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
A second-year athlete, Averroes, is spending his first season with Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
He had five full kicks on Saturday before leaving the game, bringing the number of his season's kicks to 18.
Foreign buyers will incur more tax stamps when buying property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers of property in the UK will incur higher tax stamp costs, and additional costs will be spent to help homeless people under the new schemes.
This move will nullify the success of the carbon scheme to attract young voters.
The increase in the price of the tax stamp will apply to those who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The Treasury Department expects this amount to increase to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million annually to help homeless people.
It has been set up for foreign buyers to pay more tax stamps when buying a property in the UK – and receive surplus amounts to help homeless people, news that Theresa May will announce today.
The move is an attempt to counteract Jeremy Corbyn’s success in attracting young voters by promising cheaper housing and targeting higher-income people.
The increase in tax stamps will apply to individuals and companies who do not pay taxes, and the surplus amount of the plan will help the government move to fight the sleep card problem.
This additional cost – which is surplus on the cost of the tax stamp available and includes higher tax amounts declared two years ago on second homes and homes bought and then rented – will be up to three percent.
The Treasury Department predicts the move will generate up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million in revenue per year.
Approximately 13% of London's newly built homes are bought by residents outside the UK, which raises prices and makes it harder to buy first-time homes.
Many areas of the country – especially in the capital – have become a “ghost city” because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy began exactly a few weeks after Boris Johnson spoke of cutting the tax stamp to help young people become owners.
He accused large construction companies of keeping property prices high through land ownership and deprivation, and urged Ms. Mei to relinquish the shares of cheaper homes in order to equip Britain for the “residential anomaly.”
Mr. Krabin has made a series of interesting proposals for housing reforms, which include controlling the rent of the house and ending the evacuation without making a mistake.
He also wants to give city councils more authority to build new houses.
“Last year, I said that I would prioritize the prime minister to restore Britain’s dream – that life should be better for every new generation.
And that means solving the dysfunctional housing market.
The doors of the UK are always open to those who want to create new jobs and new lives here.
However, it’s not true that buying a home is as easy for people who don’t live here or for foreign companies as the residents of Portlaoise in the UK.
For many people, the dream of owning a house seems very unlikely, and the shame of sleeping cardboard is a very bitter reality.”
Jack Ross: “My ultimate goal is to manage Scotland”
Jack Ross, the head of Sunderland, says his “end of ambition” is to become Scotland’s CEO in the future.
The 42-year-old is enjoying the revival of the North-Eastern club, which is currently ranked third in the league with a three-point difference from the top of the table.
After leading Saint-Marin back to the Premier League last season, he moved to the Lighting Stadium this summer.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
Ross told BBC Sports Radio, “I got grade B, that’s all.”
“But I grew up with my dad when I was a kid watching Scotland in Hammond, and that’s what always attracts me.
However, this is only a chance for me to be successful at managing the club.”
Ross's predecessors as Sanderland's managers include Dick Odocott, David Moyes, Sam Allardis, Martin O'Neill, Roy Kane, Gus Poitiers, and Paolo DiCanio.
Former Alva Atlético club president says he was not afraid of such credible names that have been after the great club, and had previously rejected Barnesley and Ipswich's proposals.
“Right now, the benchmark for success for me is, ‘Can I get this team back to the top league?’
“Because of the structure and facilities of the club, it is undoubtedly part of the Premier League.”
"Take the team to the top league is not easy, but if I can get the team back, I know I'm successful."
After completing a course as Assistant Chief at Dumbarton and a 15-month Hart coaching course, Ross has only been in the management field for three years.
He then prevented Alva's team from falling back to table three, and the next season turned St. Mary's from the team on the brink of falling to the winner of the championship.
And Ross says he’s now feeling more comfortable than when he played at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mary’s and Hamilton Academy.
He recalled assuming responsibility for the Alowa team, saying, “Maybe this was a real turning point.”
“I definitely believed that management was right for me, much more than playing.
It sounds weird because I was good, I made a good life for myself, and I enjoyed a social position above reasonable.
But playing can be difficult.
There are a lot of things to do during the week.
I’m still dealing with stress and pressure, but I feel that management is very good for me.
I’ve always wanted to manage and now I’m doing it, it’s the best feeling I’ve ever felt in my adult life.”

Research suggests it's time for a glass of beer at 5:30 p.m. on Saturday afternoon.
The summer heatwave has boosted sales of Britain’s struggling bars, but it has put a lot of pressure on chain restaurants.
The stats show that the group of bars and bars saw a 2.7 percent increase in sales in July, but the sales of restaurants fell 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, CGA’s business advisor, who is responsible for collecting statistics, said: “The continued sunshine and longer-than-expected UK participation in the World Cup means that July will follow a similar pattern to the month before June, when the bars will expect a 2.8 percent increase in sales.
The decline of 1.8 percent in restaurant sales in June worsened in July.
The bars that serve drinks often had a more powerful performance than their counterparts in most restaurants that saw sales decline.
The bars that serve food also suffered from heat, but not so much the restaurants.
People seem to just go out for a drink.
Among bars and bars, beverage sales increased by 6.6% this month, and food sales decreased by 3%.
Paul Newman, RSM’s welfare and hospitality analyst, said: “These results show a continuation of the trend we’ve seen since the end of April.
When it comes to out-of-home sales, climate and the impact of major sporting and social events are the most important factors.
It’s no surprise that the restaurant group is still struggling, but a 4.8 percent drop in sales every year will be much more painful given the continued increase in cost pressures.
This warm, long summer couldn’t have been any worse for grocery stores than this, and time will determine whether the cool air we experienced in August will provide some of the much-needed timeline for these jobs.”
The increase in total sales of bars and restaurants, plus new establishments, was 2.7% in July, reflecting a decline in the supply of new products to the market by major brands.
The industry surveillance system, which tracks the sales of the UK’s restaurant, bar and restaurant sectors, collects and analyses functional data from 47 operating groups, whose total financial turnover reaches <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion and is a standard that is valid in the industry.
One in five children has hidden social media accounts that their parents don't know about.
Research shows that for every five children a child – some of whom are only 11 years old – has hidden social media accounts that their parents and teachers are unaware of.
A survey of 20,000 student guides indicates the growth of “false Instagram pages.”
This news raises concerns about the release of sexual content in these accounts.
Twenty percent of students said they had a “main” account to show to their parents.
One of the five children – some even up to age 11 – create social media accounts that keep them hidden from adults.
In a survey of 20,000 guided course students, rapid growth in “false Instagram accounts” was revealed – a reference to an Instagram photo-sharing site.
This news raises concerns about the release of sexual content in these accounts.
Twenty percent of students said they had one “main” account clean to show to parents, while they also had other secret accounts.
A mother who accidentally discovered the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter noticed a teenage girl asking to “rape me.”
A study conducted by the UK Digital Awareness and the MHC found that 40 percent of 11- to 18-year-olds had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having hidden bags.
Mike Buchanan, president of HMC, said: “It’s very sad that many teens are tempted to create online spaces that parents and teachers are unable to find.
Elid Dowell will be the voice of the athletes on the Scottish Athletics Board.
Elide Dowell was elected as the non-executive director of the Scottish Sports Board in the current government's annual general meeting.
Doyle is Scotland’s most prominent athlete in the field and Len Bitty, the chairman of the board, saw the move as an opportunity for sports pioneers to benefit from his extensive international experience over the past decade.
“Ellyde has a lot of respect across Scotland, the UK and the global athlete community, and we are sure that bringing her to the athlete board in Scotland will benefit her a lot.”
Doyle said: “I’m eager to play as the voice of the athletes and I hope I can have a share and lead the sport in Scotland.
The American athlete, who won four Olympic gold medals in the 200m and 400m at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics and is now a BBC permanent expert, lost his ability to walk after a temporary ischemia.
He tweeted: “A month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said only time can tell if I can get better and to what extent I will get better.
The work was really tough, but I recovered completely, learned how to walk again, and I’m doing agile exercises today!

Advertisements related to breast pumps compared to mothers with cows have created ambiguity in online reviews.
A breast pumping company has created duplicity in online reviews by promoting comparisons between breastfeeding mothers and cows whose milk is milked.
Consumer tech company Elvie has released a funny video music to inspire ads to showcase the freedom that the new pump gives to breastfeeding mothers to introduce what has been called the “world’s first wearable silent breast pump.”
Four real mothers dance in a warehouse full of cow dung with the lyrics: “Yes, I am milking myself, but you don’t see any cows” and “If you haven’t noticed, these aren’t cow breasts, these are my breasts.”
The reader goes on to say, “Drink, drink..., I’m breastfeeding the kids, drink, drink..., I’m milking the ladies.”
However, the ad, which was posted on the company’s Facebook page, has sparked a dispute in the virtual space.
The video, with 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, received a variety of reactions from viewers, many of whom said that this video “fears” the dairy industry to joke.
“Using cows to promote this product is a very weak decision.
Someone wrote that they, like us, had to get pregnant and have babies so that they could produce milk, except that their babies were stolen after a few days of childbirth.”
Elvie's breast pump is secretly placed inside the nurse/mother's bra (Elvie/Mother).
Another commented: “It’s understandably sad for the mother and the baby.
But why shouldn’t we use them to promote breast pumps for mothers who are caring for their children?”
Another added: “What an incomprehensible advertisement.”
Some supported the ad, such as a woman who claimed the song was “happy.”
“I think that’s a good idea.
If I were to breastfeed my baby again, I would like to have one.
Pumping made me feel like a cowboy.
It was a bit silly, but I accepted it as it was.
Personally, it’s a smart product.”
Another commented: “This is an interesting ad, and its audience is mothers pumping their milk (often at work or in the bathroom) and giving them the feeling of being ‘cows’.
It’s not an ad to praise or judge the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, a group of women show that they were all dancing with hidden pumps on their breasts.
The concept behind this ad is based on insights that most women who pump their breasts say they feel like a cow.
However, the Elvie pump is completely silent, without wires or pipes, and fits secretly inside the chest strap, giving women freedom of movement, keeping babies and even going out while pumping.
Anna Bavarin, a co-founder and child development psychologist at the parent organization, said the Elvie pump is like a revolutionary product that deserves a bold and controversial introduction.
By depicting the resemblance between lactating cows and lactating women, we wanted to put breast pumps and all their challenges under the particle, while also demonstrating in a fun and understandable way the sense of freedom that these pumps will bring.
This isn’t the first time Elvie’s pump has been titled.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the fashion scene while using the product for fashion designer Martha Yakubovsky.
Hundreds of immigrant children were quietly moved to Chadry camp on the Texas border.
While the statistics on illegal border crossings have been relatively steady, the number of migrant children detained has risen sharply, partly because of the Trump administration’s harsh vocabulary and policies, which have made it harder to find a backer for children.
Previously, most of their supporters were migrants without legal papers, so they fear that taking steps to protect their children in the country would put them at risk.
When federal officials announced that potential supporters and adults in their families would have to give their fingerprints, and this information would be shared with immigration officials, the risk of doing so increased.
Last week, Matthew Albans, a senior official of the immigration and customs agency in Congress, testified that the agency had arrested thousands of those who had registered to support children.
The organization later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no previous criminal history.
“Nearly 80 percent of the people who were either sponsored or were from the family of the sponsors are illegally residing in the country, and many of them are foreign criminals.
We are chasing these people.”
In order to speed up the process of dealing with children, officials announced new rules that would require some of the children to appear in court one month after detention, instead of the previous standard that allowed them to appear in court 60 days after detention.
Many, instead of attending in person, come to defend themselves to take legal residence status against an immigration judge through video conferencing.
Those who are not eligible for legal support are quickly dismissed.
According to shelter workers and reports obtained from the system in recent months, the more children remain in detention, the more stressed and anxious they are, which can lead to violence or escape.
Proponents said the concerns were heightened in larger centers such as Trenillo, where signs of a child's difficulty could be ignored due to the large size of the center.
They added that moving children to Chadri towns without providing enough time to prepare them emotionally or saying goodbye to friends can exacerbate the emotional shock that many are currently struggling with.
Syria ordered the “occupying forces” of the United States, France and Turkey to leave immediately.
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Syrian Foreign Minister Valid Muamar said that despite the war in the country being in its eighth year, he has asked refugees to return to their homes.
The teacher, who also holds the post of Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces are illegally fighting terrorism on Syrian soil, and it will be appropriate to deal with them.
He said: “They must leave the country without any conditions as soon as possible.”
The teacher stressed that Syria’s “war on terrorism is almost over,” a war in which more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011 and millions have been displaced from their homes.
“We will continue this holy war until we clear all areas of Syria of terrorist groups and the presence of any illegal foreign force,” he said.
The U.S. has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and advising Syrian Arab forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 ground troops in a country at war.
Regarding the refugees, the teacher said the conditions for their return were appropriate, and he blamed some Western countries for creating unreasonable fears that make refugees stay away from Syria.
“We have asked international communities and humanitarian organizations to provide the facilities for this return,” he said.
They have turned a matter that is purely human-friendly into a political issue.
The United States and the European Union have warned that unless an agreement is reached between Assad and the opposing forces to end the war, there will be no aid to rebuild Syria.
U.N. diplomats on the recent agreement between Syria and Turkey say an area of presence in the main rebel base area in Idlib has created an opportunity for political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a large-scale attack by Syrian-backed forces on the site of three million people.
The teacher, however, stressed that the agreement had a “definite deadline” and hoped that the military operation would target jihadists, including al-Qaeda-dependent al-Nusra front fighters.
U.N. Representative Stephen Demystora hopes to form the first meeting of a new committee composed of government and opposition party members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
The teacher explained the conditions of the Syrian government’s participation in the committee, saying the working group should be restricted “to review constitutional materials” and warned of interference.
Why will Trump win afterwards?
With this logic, Mr. Trump will win the 2020 re-election unless liberal observers hope his resignation and disgrace will end before the end of his presidential term.
This will undoubtedly be “the saddest end to the presidency in American history!”
Currently, there is no sign of the absence of observers.
Since 2014, viewer hours rankings have increased by more than doubled to 1.05 million in CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million in MSNBC.
According to Nielsen Fox News, it has 2.4 million viewers in the busy hours, which was 1.7 million four years ago, and the "Richel Mudo" program from MSNBC with more than 3.5 million viewers on important news nights ranked highest among cable TV shows.
Neil Bayer, the producer of ABC’s “The Remaining Chosen” series, said of a cabinet minister who, after an attack destroyed the Congressional Palace, “is a fire that people are drawn to because there’s nothing we can understand.”
Neil School, the comedian and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And A Few Hard Facts About the Hollywood Boys Club," has another theory.
He recalled before the 2016 election that he had taken a taxi in Boston.
The driver told him he wanted to vote for Mr. Trump.
He asks why?
"Mrs. School said to me, 'He said, 'Because it makes me laugh.'
Chaos has a value for entertainment.
Definitely like nothing else on TV, the stories coming out of Washington are against the future, whether immigrant families can be together again and determine the health of the global economy.
Ignoring is a subject that only viewers with special privileges come up with.
And yet, when you find out for six hours, a group of experts is discussing the use of "Deep Background" for the book "Fear" by Bob Woodward, a $15,000 leopard leather pilot's coat by Paul Manafort ("A kind of dress with a thick cover"), according to Washington Post.
"As a person, I don't look at Super Mario as I used to.
Brent Montgomery, executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and producer of Stars in the Row, talks about the constant change of actors and the daily change of schemes (the fight to start with the American Football League, praised by Kim Jong-un) on Trump's TV show, saying: "It's a part of what he's doing that makes him feel like something real.
You can’t lose a part of it, so you’ll be behind.
When I met Mr. Felice this week, the outside air was 80 degrees Fahrenheit on the north coast of Kawai, but he was watching MSNBC inside the house while recording the CNN program.
He couldn’t be heartbroken, he couldn’t be heartbroken by Bert Kavanaugh, who had to face the House Judiciary Committee, and he couldn’t be heartbroken by the uncertain future of the country’s Supreme Court.
Mr. Felice said to me, “I remember when we did those ridiculous shows in the past, people would say, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization.’
“I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turned out they were right.”

Money sources from abroad became the toughest mid-term domestic election competition.
It’s no surprise that the 17th District of Pennsylvania, thanks to the unification of the congressional-deputy districts, which led to two rivals competing in the same seat, saw money flow.
This has recently led to the regional reconstruction of the Democratic Party in the suburbs of the city of Pittsburgh. Konur Lambi – who won in the special regional elections last spring.
Long is competing with another Republican election rival, Kate Ratfuss, who has recently been nominated for the Old Pennsylvania 12th District, and the area is heavily interfering with the new 17th District.
The plans were later changed when, in January, the Supreme Court declared the Old Areas to have been divided unconstitutionally and unfairly in favor of the Republicans.
The competition in the new 17-area sparked heavy competition between the financial branches of the major parties, namely between the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Long’s name fell to languages after a close competition and victory in a special election that was held in March for the 18th congress area and many people witnessed it.
That seat was run by the Republican Party for a decade, and Donald Trump won the region with 20 points.
The Democrats had a positive outlook on the Democrats.
The U.S. suspended El Salvador’s punishment for supporting China at the time.
Diplomats pointed out that the Dominican Republic and Panama, with a short distance from Washington, have already accepted Beijing.
Mr. Trump had an intimate meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela, President of Panama, in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until the management team partners fired Mr. Trump.
Foreign Ministry spokesman Heder Neuert said in a statement earlier this month that foreign ministry officials had decided to remove senior U.S. officials from the El Salvador diplomatic mission, the Dominican Republic and Panama due to "the recent decision to refrain from protecting".
But the penalty was applied only to El Salvador, which received about $140 million in funding from Americans for drug control, development, and financial support.
The proposed penalties, which included a reduction in financial aid and visa restrictions, had a painful impact on the Central American country, as well as the high unemployment rate and the number of murders committed.
As domestic meetings progressed, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focusing on security and economic prosperity to attend a similar meeting last year that took a step forward in an effort to prevent immigrants from entering the United States.
But by mid-September, high-ranking government officials had made it clear they wanted the conference to continue, effectively ending any investigation into El Salvador’s punishment.
Diplomats said it was planned to mock Vice President Mike Pence at the conference, which is set to take place in mid-October, reflecting the government’s importance to the meeting.
And the three U.S. ambassadors quickly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without warning of any serious warning and punishment from Washington.
Three U.S. officials, two of whom are diplomats and have agreed to remain anonymous while discussing domestic talks, said White House spokesman Bolton declined details of the discussion explained by three U.S. officials.
Their explanation was confirmed by a foreign analyst close to the government to the condition of anonymity.
Study of History
The next inevitable event could be the report by Robert Mueller, Special Adviser, on Trump’s potential obstruction of law enforcement, which has sufficient evidence and fairness in the public mind.
According to the report, Mr. Mueller is investigating whether Mr. Trump’s campaign has tarnished Russia over the attack on our elections.
If Congress changes sides, Mr. Trump will see himself responding to Congress, and perhaps ultimately a panel of his peers, at the right time as he prepares to face the voters.
Of course, and if there is much, and I don’t mean that the fall of Mr. Trump or his counterparts in Europe is inevitable.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we all need to make decisions about how long this will take.
In 1938, German officers were ready to carry out a coup against Hitler, just enough for the West to resist him and support the Czechs in Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to prevent the years of mass murder that followed.
The trajectory of history revolves around such milestones, and the unstoppable parade of democracy either slows or accelerates.
The American people are now facing a number of challenges like this.
What would we do if Mr. Trump, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, fired the man who controlled the fate of Mr. Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since the news was released last year about his proposal to secretly record the president’s conversations and comment on Trump’s inappropriate personality for the presidency.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times report is not accurate.
“What would we do if the new FBI investigation of Bert Kavanaugh wasn’t complete or fair – or even if there were valid allegations of sexual assault and false testimony before the Supreme Court?
And most importantly, do we vote in mid-term elections for Congress that holds Mr. Trump accountable?
If we fail in these trials, democracy will go to sleep for a long time.
But I believe that because of the lessons I learned in Prague, we will not fail.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia who was transferred to Auschwitz Prison by the same Nazi regime that occupied my embassy.
He survived, immigrated to the United States, and 60 years later sent me to light the candles of the Sabbath on a table marked by the broken cross of the Nazis.
These are my legacy, how can I not be optimistic about the future?”

Graham Durance of the Rangers optimistic for the upcoming race with Team Wayne
The Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday and know that a win against the Austrians, after getting an equal result earlier this month against Spain, will solidify their place in the European G-League to climb to the next stage.
Damage to the knee area of Graham Doris, the midfielder of the team prevented his first appearance in the new season to get a 2-2 result equal to Viral, but he believes the Rangers could use this result as a launch pad to achieve greater success.
“The 31-year-old said, ‘This was a good point for us because Virat Kohli is a good team.
“We got into the game with the belief that we could achieve something and came out with a point.
Maybe we could finally get that ball into the goal, but overall, it was a fair outcome.
They were probably better in the first half, but we looked better in the second half.
Thursday will be another big European night.
Fortunately, we can score three points, but the game will be tough because they scored well in their last game, but with the crowd they support, I’m sure we can push and get a positive result.
“Last year was a really tough year, despite what happened to my injuries and the changes that happened at the club itself, it feels good here.
The players are in good condition and the kids are really enjoying; the training is good.
Fortunately, we can move forward, leave the past season behind and be successful.”
Preoccupation with retirement savings has taken the sleep out of women’s eyes.
Despite the participants in the survey having a clear idea of how they tend to be cared for, some of them were talking about it with their families.
About half of the people in the study said they talked to their spouses about long-term care costs.
Only 10 percent said they had talked to their children about it.
Hallie Schneider, deputy head of the National Life Insurance Company, said: “People want one of their family members to take care of them, but they don’t move forward for the conversation.”
This is where we have to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: If you don’t specify your wishes at the right time, you can’t prepare your family for care.
Talk to your legal advisor and family about where and how to get care, as these elections can be a significant factor in determining costs.
Get help from your financial advisor: A financial advisor can help you find a way to pay your expenses.
Your financial choices for long-term care can include regular long-term insurance, or life insurance based on the value of money to cover those costs, or self-sufficiency with your wealth - as long as you have money.
Prove your legal credentials: you will win the field in legal battles.
Provide a health care attorney to appoint a trusted person to oversee your medical care and make sure that the specialists will agree with your requests if you are unable to communicate.
Also, consider the use of the letter of attorney in financial matters.
You choose a confident person to make your financial decisions and make sure that the bills are paid if you are unable to pay.
Don’t forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent needs a medical emergency and is on the way to the hospital.
Will you be able to answer questions about the medications he is using and the allergies he has?
Bring the details section by section on the paper, so that you are ready.
Mr. Martin asked: “It’s not just financial matters that play a role, it’s also important who the doctors are.
What medicines are taken?
Who took care of the dog?
Keep these in mind.”

Category: Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
Officials said at least 384 people were killed in the earthquake and tsunami in Palu, Indonesia, and that the death toll is expected to increase.
Due to the cuts in communication lines, relief officials were unable to obtain information from the Dangalla area, a region in the north of Palu that was closest to the center of the 7.5-reister earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people evacuated.
Some of the key facts of Palo and Dangala on Salawasi Island include:
Palu is the capital of the central Salawasi region, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Salawasi Island, with a population of approximately 379,800 in 2017.
When the earthquake and tsunami occurred, the city was celebrating its fortieth anniversary.
Dangala is an area stretched over 300 kilometers (180 miles) along the northwest coastline of Salawasi Island.
The area is a smaller administrative area than a province, with a population of about 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture is the main economy in the center of Salawasi, especially in the coastal section of Dangal.
Nickel mining is also important in the region, but most of the mines in Murovali are concentrated in the opposite section of Salavusi.
According to the Indonesian Natural Disaster Management Agency, Palu and Dangala have been hit by the tsunami several times over the past 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Dangalla.
Another tsunami in western Dangala in 1996 killed nine people.
Indonesia is located in the ring of fire of the Atlantic Ocean and there are regular earthquakes occurring there.
A number of major earthquakes have occurred in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Akke region in northern Sumatra on December 26 caused a major tsunami that damaged 14 countries and killed 226,000 people on the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of whom lived in Akke.
2005: A number of strong earthquakes struck the west coast of Sumatra in March and April.
Hundreds of people were killed on the island of Nias on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude earthquake shook southern Java, one of Indonesia's most populous islands, causing a tsunami that hit the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-magnitude earthquake occurred near Padang, the capital of western Somatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake on one of the islands of Mantawai, Sumatra, triggered a 10-metre-high tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed nearly 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake in the Pied-de-Jay area of Acca caused terror among people who recalled the deadly tsunami of 2004.
No tsunami occurred this time, but more than 100 people were killed because of falling from buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes occurred on the tourist island of Lambak, killing 500 people, most of whom belonged to the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of homes, and thousands of tourists were temporarily homeless.
Sarah Pealen's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Trak Palin, the eldest son of Sarah Palin, the former governor of Alaska and vice president's nominee, was arrested on charges of sexual assault.
According to a report on Saturday by Alaska State Police, Palin, 29, from Wasillai, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interference in domestic violence reports and resistance to arrest.
According to police reports, when a woman’s acquaintance tries to call the police to report the crime, she picks up her phone.
According to KTUU reports, Palin is in custody in the building before the Met-Su trial and is held with anonymous $500 bonds.
According to the network, he appeared in court on Saturday and declared himself "confidently innocent" when his defenses were called for.
Palin is facing three-degree crimes, meaning he could be jailed for up to a year and fined $250,000.
He has also been charged with a two-degree crime that sentenced him to one day in prison and paid a $2,000 fine.
This is the first time Palin has been charged with a crime.
In December 2017, he was accused of beating his father, Todd Palin.
Her mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack.
The case is currently before a retired Alaskan military court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, interfering in a domestic violence crime report, and carrying a hot-weapon while drunk in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend said that she was punching him in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by retired militia groups for attributing her son’s violent behavior to a post-accident stress disorder for serving in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds killed
At least 384 people were killed in the Indonesian earthquake on the island of Salawasi on Friday.
A 7.5-magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
The power grid and communications are interrupted and the likelihood of increased losses in the coming days is high.
The earthquake occurred in central Salawasi, north of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
Videos published in the social space show the moment of the incident.
When the tsunami struck, hundreds of people had gathered for a beach celebration in the city of Palo.
Federal prosecutors seek rare death penalty for suspected New York terrorist attack
New York’s federal prosecutor is pursuing the death penalty for Saifalo Saipoo, a suspect in a New York terror attack that killed eight people — a rare punishment that has not been enforced since 1953 for federal crimes.
Saipoo, 30, used a rental truck from Home Depot to carry out the murder on the West Side highway in Lower Manhattan, taking down the occupants and riders in October.
According to the Decree of Intention to Enforce the Death Penalty recorded in the Southern District of New York, in order to demonstrate the death sentence, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipoo “intentionally” killed eight victims and “intentionally” inflicted serious bodily injury on them.
According to the court documents, both of them are likely to be sentenced to death.
Weeks after the attack, a Supreme Judicial Board of the federal state of Saipoo demanded 22 sentences, including eight counts of smuggling-assisted murder, a sentence usually used by the federal prosecutor to refer to organized crime and a charge of violence and violence.
Prosecutors said the attack required “a lot of careful planning and design” and described what Saipovo had done as “clear, ruthless, and perverted.”
In the declaration of intent of the crime, Sif Allah Habibullah Evich Saipoo caused injuries, injuries and deaths to members of the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, An Laur Dikat, Darren Derek, Ariel Erleigh, Hernan Frodochhi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Hernandez.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
A decade has passed since the last case of the death penalty in the southern part of New York.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug dealers, but was sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was enforced in a federal case in 1953 was for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who were executed two years before the Cold War after being sentenced to spy for the Soviet Union.
Both were executed by electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court filings, Saipoo, a native of Uzbekistan, did not express regret over the days and months after the attack.
Police said he told investigators that he felt good about what he had done.
According to the report, Saipoo told officials that the motive for the assassination was created after watching videos of ISIS on his mobile phone.
The police also said that they had also requested that the flag of ISIS be passed on to the hospital.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the attorneys-general of the federal public prosecutors who is in charge of the Yaypou attorney's office, said they were "clearly disappointed by the prosecutor's decision."
Patton said: “We think the decision to pass the death penalty instead of agreeing to a criminal request for a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of release will only prolong the mental impact of these events for those involved.
The Saipoo defense team had previously asked the prosecutor not to pursue the death penalty.
Conservative MP says Nigel Fraser should be in charge of the election negotiations
Nigel Farage pledged “to move the People’s Army today in protest at the Conservative Party conference.
Former UKIP leader said politicians should “fight pressure from close opponents between Britain and the European Union” – as one member of parliament, Theresa, suggested she should be responsible for negotiating with the European Union.
Peter Bonn, a member of the legislature, told pilgrims in Birmingham that Britain had so far left the country if Mr. Fraser had been elected secretary.
But the challenge that Ms. May faces in reconciling her split cabinet members has been highlighted by the UK's pro-remaining Conservative parties in the European Union, which have joined a separate protest against the city's election.
The prime minister is trying to pursue a no-deal exit plan amidst attacks by pro-choice, pro-remainers in the union and the European Union.
The allies insisted that despite strong reactions, he would try to make a deal with Brussels – and force opposing forces close to Britain and the European Union and the Labour Party to choose between his proposed package or one of the ‘heroes’.
Bonn said he wanted to "stop the plan of leaving without a deal" in the community, which was held in Solihull.
He suggested that Mr Fraser should consider partners for the responsibilities given to the Brussels negotiations.
He said, “If he was in charge, we would have left by now.”
MEP Willenberg added: “I stand up for an election, but we need to stop the no-deal exit plan.”
While expressing his opposition to the European Union, he said: “We did not fight in world wars to fall asleep.
“We want to enforce our own laws in our own country.”
Mr Boone rejected the issue, which has changed public opinion since 2016. “The idea that the British people have changed their minds and are demanding to remain in the European Union is completely false.”
Benedict Andrew A. Jenkins, a member of the Conservative Party, was also on the march, telling reporters, "I have to say very simply, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
A no-deal exit is not popular in the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, our party and our political activists, who are actually active on the streets and make our election as representatives, are not interested in this plan.
Please leave the plan without a deal and start listening.
He added in an incisive message to Ms. Mee: Prime Ministers keep their seats when they keep their promises.
Caye Farage told pilgrims that if politicians are to override a decision made in the 2016 referendum, they should be forced to “fight the pressure.”
“Now this is about trust between us, the people and the political class,” he said.
They want to betray Britain’s exit from the European Union (Brexit), but we’re here today to tell them, “We’re not letting you into the palace.”
In a message to the eager crowd, he added: “I want you to form our political group to counter pressure from those on the brink of betrayal of Britain’s withdrawal from the EU.
“We are moving the People’s Army of this country, which will lead to our victory in the UK’s withdrawal from the European Union, and we will never rest in order to have an independent, self-governed and proud England.”
Meanwhile, supporters of remaining in the European Union have marched in Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
After the opposition Conservative Party group began its election weekend, a small number of activists took the party’s banners to the polls.
Lord Adonis, a member of the Labour Party, mocked the Conservatives at the same time as the conference began because of the security concerns of a party program.
“These are the people who are telling us they can install IT systems and they can equip all the technology needed for Canada to have a free border, for free trade without borders in Ireland.”
This is a completely ridiculous game.
He said there is no such thing as a good UK exit from the EU.
Warren intends to think "carefully" about his candidacy for president.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says that after the November election, she is “thinking carefully about her candidacy for president.”
The Boston Globe reports, the Massachusetts Democrat spoke at a city meeting on Saturday in West Massachusetts about his future.
Warren, Donald Trump’s longtime critic, is running for re-election in November to compete against Republican Rep. Jeffrey Diehl, who served as President of Massachusetts’s 2016 presidential campaign.
He has been at the center of speculation that he may be Trump's contender in the 2020 election.
The afternoon event in Hollywood was his thirty-sixth meeting with voters, which has taken the form of a public meeting with the public since Trump’s presidency.
One of the people asked him if he was going to run for president.
Warren replied that it was now time for “women to go to Washington to reform and rebuild our unruly government, and this requires a woman to rank high.”
Arrest of a man during a deadly shooting at the University of Louisiana
On Saturday, police in Concrete Rogue, Louisiana, announced that a suspect in Friday's deadly shooting at Louisiana State University basketball player Weid Sims was arrested.
The Concrete Rogue Police Department announced at a news conference at 11 a.m. Eastern Time that Dayton Simpson, a 20-year-old, had been arrested.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday, and asked for help identifying the man who was in the film.
Sims, 20, was shot dead Friday morning near the university's southern campus.
Police Chief J. Pal said on Saturday on the website 247sports that "Wyd Sims was shot in the head and eventually killed."
Weid intervened in defense of his friend and was shot by Simson.
He was interrogated and admitted to having been on the scene with a gun, and admitted to having fired at Wade Seems.
Simpson was arrested without incident and is at the East Rogue Concrete Police Station at the detention center.
Semitz, a young 182-centi who grew up in Concrete Rogue, has played in 32 races and has been a ball thrower 10 times in the past season with an average score of 17.4 minutes, with 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds for each game.
Grand Prix of Russia: After the team won Lewis Hamilton's victory over Sebastian, Lewis took another step closer as a world champion.
On Saturday, it was clear from the moment that Walter Bottas was ahead of Lewis Hamilton that Mercedes would play a big role in the race.
Bottas had a good start from the front line and was nearly separated from Hamilton to defend from his position in the first two torches, allowing Vettel to attack his teammates.
Vettel was the first person to get into the pit stop and let Hamilton get into the traffic of the last cars, which certainly happened.
A lap later, the Mercedes entered the pit stop and appeared from behind the vet, but after a few moves, Hamilton came very close to the front of the car because the fugitive driver was unwillingly separated from the middle of the road and bought the risk of going to third place after a double move.
Max Verstappen started the race in the back row and finished seventh at the end of the first round at his 21st birthday.
Then, for most of the race, he was the first, and he didn’t change his tires because he wanted to get to the finish line quickly and get ahead of Kimmy Ricconne and finish fourth.
He eventually entered the Pit Stop in the forty-fourth lap, but was unable to increase his speed in the remaining eight laps, and Ricconen became the fourth.
It was a tough day because Walter did a wonderful job this weekend, and he was really a young man who let me pass him by.
Hamilton said the team has done an exceptional job of having two winners.
The non-verbal communication was really bad.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Finstein at an election rally on Saturday over his insistence on not disclosing the contents of Ford’s Christine Blasi’s letter on charges of sexually assaulting Bert Kavanaugh, the nominee to the Supreme Court.
The president, who was speaking at an election rally in West Virginia, did not speak directly to Ford’s testimony in the Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead stated that what is going on in the Senate shows how “fast, dirty and lying” people are.
“What might happen in the Senate, and the beautiful thing that has happened in the last few days, is that when you see anger, you see people who are nervous, disgusting, dirty, and lying,” he said.
“They publish and disclose the news and then they respond, ‘Oh, I didn’t do that.’”
“I didn’t do that.”
Do you remember?
Diane Finstein, have you revealed this?
Remember his answer... Have you unveiled the document? “Oh, oh, what do you say?”
"Oh, no.
I didn’t reveal it.”
Well, wait a minute.
He added in a similar tone to the senator’s person, “Have we disclosed the news?... No, we haven’t.
They sent a letter to Finstein, in which Ford made allegations against Cavanaugh in July last year, and the contents of the letter were disclosed in early September - but Finstein denied the disclosure had taken place from his office.
"I have not concealed Dr. Ford's allegations, I have not disclosed his case," Hill said in a statement to the committee.
“He asked me to keep it a secret, and I did the same as he did.”
But his denial was not convincing to the president, and he criticized during a talkshow on Saturday night, saying: “I’m telling you what really happened, the issue of nonverbal communication was really bad.”
“Maybe he didn’t, but it’s the worst nonverbal connection I’ve ever seen.”
The president continued to defend the Supreme Court nominee, whom three women have accused of sexually abusing, saying Democrats were using the allegations to their advantage.
“They are determined to regain power in every possible way.
The media outlet reported the president’s remarks as saying, “You see the posture and the viciousness, they don’t care who they hurt and who they reject to gain power and to have authority over things.”
Top League: Dundee Stars takes 5-3 Blvd.
Patrick Dewer scored two goals for Jaitley in a race against Dunday.
Dundee Stars made up for the defeat in the Premier League on Friday against Belfast City, and won the team 5-3 in the game on Saturday.
With the attacks of Patrick Dewey and Francis Boviller, Giants was able to advance with two goals in the first game.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cooney tied the game, but then Dior scored a top goal for Jaitley.
Franco Bochard tied the game for Dhandy, but again Lucas Landwald Nilsen scored two goals for Dhandy.
This was the third top league defeat this season for the men of Adam Kief, who were able to defeat 2-1 at the Belfast Dundi on Friday night.
This was the fourth match of the season between the two teams, while Giants has won three previous matches with the team.
The first goal of the game was scored by Deir in the fourth minute at 3:35 minutes by Kendall McFaul's goal pass, and four minutes later Boyleir scored the second goal by David Rothford's pass.
He was a half-hearted, and Sullivan returned the host team to the game at 13:10, but Matt Markworth helped Kawani score the same goal at 15:16.
When Dewey scored his second goal that night at the end of the first half, he became sure that Jaydentz had won the first half of the game.
The host team on their ground regained their alliance and Bouchard again tied the game with a powerful goal in 27:37.
Cowney and Charles Corcoran collaborated to help Nilsson score his first goal in the second-half minute and finally secured his fifth goal in the last half.
Giants, who has now lost four of his five games, will play his next match at home with Milton Keynes on Friday.
Air traffic controller sacrificed his life to save hundreds of people on board the plane to escape the earthquake
Indonesians have named him the man responsible for controlling air traffic because of a suicide bomber for the safe flight of a plane carrying hundreds of people.
A major earthquake on Friday on the island of Sulawesi, followed by a tsunami, killed more than 800 people and left countless people missing.
So severe earthquakes have continued to disrupt life in the region, and many people are trapped under the rubble of Palu.
But despite his colleagues fleeing to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonios Ganavan Agag did not leave his post at the control tower, which was severely shaken at Sis al-Jaffrey's Mutiara Airport in Palo.
He stayed there to make sure that flight 6321 Batik, which was on the runway at the time, could be lifted safely.
And then when he sees the tower breaking down, he jumps out.
He later lost his life in the hospital.
According to an Australian BBC News report, Indonesian aviation spokesman Johannes Sirait said the decision saved the lives of hundreds of people.
We have prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Calimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
“Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the plane got to Palo.
He added: “We are heartbroken to hear this news.”
At the same time, officials are concerned that the death toll could reach thousands, and the country’s disaster management agency says access to the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Butong is limited.
The agency’s spokesman, Sutopo Poro Noguru, said: “We think the death toll is going up again because so many bodies are still under debris and access to so many of them is not possible.”
The waves, which reached a height of six meters, have turned Palo into a piece of dirt, and a mass funeral will be held in the city on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft also brought aid and aid items with them.
Risa Kosuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Any minute an ambulance full of corpses arrives here.”
Healthy water is scarce.
“Everywhere they steal things from small shops.”
John Gulfand of the World Red Cross in Indonesia told CNN, “The Indonesian Red Cross is working to help the survivors, but we don’t know what they will face there.
It’s a sad thing, but it could have been a lot worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived at Palo on Sunday and told the country’s military: “I want you all to work day and night to do the evacuation work well.
“Are you ready for that?” the CNN reported.
Earlier this year, an earthquake occurred in Lambak, Indonesia, killing more than 550 people.
Micronesian plane crash: Niugini Airlines now says a man is missing after the plane crashes in a lake.
The airline's plane, which crashed into a lake in the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia after its previous statements about the safe departure of all 47 passengers and crew of the plane, now says a man has been missing.
Newgini Airlines said in a news release on Saturday afternoon that one of the passengers who died on the flight had disappeared.
The airline said it is working with local officials, hospitals, and detectives to locate the man.
The airline did not immediately answer questions about the passenger's exact information, such as his age and nationality.
The plane crashed into the water after attempting an emergency landing from Chokk Airport, and local boats have come to rescue passengers and crew.
On Friday, officials said seven people had been transferred to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers were admitted to the hospital on Saturday, and the condition of all of them was stable.
The cause of the crash and the exact order of events have not yet been determined.
Both the U.S. Air Force and the U.S. Navy said the plane had crashed in the lake because of the band shortening.
Some witnesses believed that the plane had left the band.
Bill Jeans, an American passenger, said the plane’s altitude was too low when it landed.
Jeans said, “That was a very good thing.”
Jeans said he and others were able to walk hard in the sinking plane and into the water that could reach their waist and get themselves to the emergency exits.
He said the guests were scared and screaming, and he himself had been removed from the area with a small head injury.
The U.S. Navy also said sailors who were working on the dock near the plane had rushed to rescue people using an inflatable boat before the plane sank about 30 meters (100 feet) into the water.
Information from the Air Safety Network suggests that in the last two decades, 111 people have died in the crash of Papua New Guinea airliners, but this figure did not include the airline New Guinea.
Analyst presented the timetable of the night when the woman was burned alive.
On Saturday, the trial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014 came to an end.
Paul Roulette, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, testified for hours as an expert on information analysis.
He explained to the jury how he used phone reports to put the 29-year-old defendant, Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, together on the night of the incident.
According to Clarion Leger, Roulette said she had obtained location information from several mobile phones indicating that Télis had been with her on the night of Chambers’ death, which contradicted the previous allegations of the accused.
When information showed that his phone was with his friend Michelle Sanford when he claimed he was with Chambers, the police went to question Sanford.
Sanford stood at the scene on Saturday and testified that he was not in the city that day.
When prosecutors asked him if Telis’ claim was true that he was in the Sanford car that night, he said, “He’s lying because my car was in Nashville that night.”
Another contradiction is that Telis said he had known him for about two weeks at the time of his Chambers’ death.
Cell phone reports showed that only a week had elapsed since they first met.
Roulette said that after Chambers’ death, Telex deleted Chambers’ messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
Hill said, “Tellis removed him from his life.”
The final court hearing is scheduled to take place on Sunday.
The judge stated that the trial was expected to be handed over to the jury on the same day.
<0xE2><0x86><0x90> What Is Awareness of Hip Hop?
A hip hop trio wants to challenge negative attitudes towards this type of music by filling their music with positive messages.
The BRICS groups, from Bristol, claim that hip hop has distanced itself from its principle of expressing political messages and addressing social issues.
They want to bring this style of music back to its originality and make hip hop popular again.
Artists from musical groups such as Fujiz and Comenius have observed that artists such as Akala and Loki have recently revived music in the UK.
Another black man again?
A New York nurse complained to the couple that they had fired her after sending her a “racist” message.
A New York nurse has filed a complaint against a couple who have fired her because of racial issues, after receiving an error message from her family’s mother complaining that the nurse is another black woman.
The couple deny that they are racist, and liken the complaint to blackmail.
When the nurse went to their home for her first day of work in 2016, Lensy Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, found out that the new nurse, Giselle Morris, was black and worried.
Ms. Plasko-Flaxman wrote in a message to her husband, “No, no, no, no, no, no, I don’t want another black man again.”
However, instead of sending this message to his wife, he sent it to Ms. Morris twice.
After noticing her mistake, Plasco fired "adorable" Ms. Morris, saying that the nurse had done a bad job of treating them as African-Americans while awaiting a nurse named Philly, according to a New York Post report.
The cost of a day’s work was paid to Ms. Morris, and then Uber was sent home by online taxi.
Now, Morris has complained to the couple to pay the damages of the firing, and has applied for compensation of $350 per day for six months and was hired without a contract to be permanently in his place of work for a certain period of time.
He told the New York Post on Friday, “I want to show them, so they know, they don’t do things like this, and that I know it’s discriminatory.”
The couple responded with a bad tone to the claims that they were racists, saying that firing him was a wise move because they thought he could no longer be trusted after being insulted.
“My wife has sent him an unsolicited message and she has no intention.
He is not a racist.
Her husband, Joel Plasco, told the New York Post: “We are not racists.”
“But do you give your child to someone you’ve misled him, even if you did it wrong?
Your newborn baby?
Let's go."
Plasco, comparing the “adoptative” complaint, said his wife had two months’ leave to give birth to their child and was “in a difficult situation.”
The head of the investment bank added, “Do you want to be looking for someone like him?
“His choice is not a good thing.”
While the complaint is still ongoing, public opinion has quickly condemned the couple on social media and strongly criticized them for their behavior and logic.
The new letter reveals that the publishers of Paddington were concerned that readers were not communicating with the bear spokesman.
Karen Jankle, the daughter of Bond, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: “Before the book is published, it’s hard to put yourself in the place of someone who’s going to read the book for the first time.
Knowing what we know today about Paddington’s great success is very interesting.”
He says his father had been a BBC filmmaker before he was inspired by a little toy bear to write for children, was optimistic about his book’s refusal to accept, and added that it was the 60th anniversary of the book’s release after his father’s death last year.
He described Paddington as “a very important member of our family” and added that his father was completely proud of his final success.
He said, "My father was a very calm man, and he was not a self-righteous man."
“But because Paddington was so real to him, it’s like you have a kid who’s got something: you’re proud of him, even though you didn’t actually do it.
I think that's how he saw Peyton's success.
Although he created Paddington and was the grandson of his imagination, he always attributed the success to Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
After her daughter’s fall, she was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, but the doctors’ efforts to rescue her were futile.
Mrs. Ednan-Laprouse said, "Nad kept calling to say that my daughter is really bad, and that she doesn't think she'll last."
“Nad called me to say he’s going to leave the world in two minutes and I have to say goodbye to him.
And I did it.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, sweetheart."
I will join you soon.
I will be with you.
The medications that doctors had given him to keep his heart alive were gradually becoming ineffective and getting out of his body.
He had died a few moments before, and all his organs were running out.
I just had to sit there and wait, and all this was happening to me.
Because I was among other families and people, I couldn’t scream, scream or cry.
I really needed to keep my calm.
Eventually, Mrs. Ednan-Laprouse, now grieved for the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with other passengers, forgetting the calamity that had befallen her.
He said, “Nobody knew.”
“I put my head down and I was still crying.”
It’s hard to explain, but it was on the plane that I felt the empathy of my whole body.
That Nad needed my love and I had to understand him.
I knew how much she loved him.
Grieving women install cards on bridge in an attempt to prevent others from committing suicide
Two women who have lost their loved ones to suicide try to prevent others from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have glued cards to her bridge that contain inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for help.
Ms. Davis’ son, Tyler, was 13 years old when he became depressed and killed himself at the age of 18.
“I don’t want families to experience the feeling I have every day.”
Ms. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son had a future chef who had a beautiful smile.
“Everyone knew him with a smile.
They always say that her smile lights up every house.
However, he quit his job before his death, because "his workplace was really dark."
In 2014, Brother Tyler, who was 11 years old at the time, was the first person to find his dead body.
Ms. Davis said, "I'm always worried that this will have a bad effect on her."
Ms. Davis has made the cards, “to tell people there’s someone who can ask for help or talk to him, even if he’s a friend.
“Don’t sit still, you need to talk.”
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been friends with Mrs. Dewey for years, lost Mark, who had been with her for 15 years, shortly after the death of her mother.
“Mark didn’t say he felt sad or depressed or anything like that.”
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
“Christmas Day was so depressing that when the kids opened their gifts, she didn’t look at them or anything.”
She said Mark’s death was a huge blow to them, but they had to put it behind them: “This is going to break up the family in general.
Its sadness kills us.
But we all have to live and fight hard.”

The future of Bert Kavanaugh begins with an FBI investigation.
On Saturday, Mr. Fleck said, “I thought if we could really do what he wanted us to do – i.e. research in a limited time, with a limited scope – maybe we could get a little bit of unity,” and added that he feared that the party, the committee, would “spalt apart.”
Why didn’t Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters ask the FBI to start the investigation?
They are unwilling because of time.
There are only five weeks left until the midterm elections on November 6, if, as expected, the Republicans act badly, their efforts to find the man they want to be elected to the Supreme Court will be severely undermined.
George W. Bush picked up the phone to call the senators and lobby them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked for Mr. Bush at the White House and through him met his wife Ashley, who at the time was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI produces the report?
There are 51 seats in the Senate, and 49 seats in the Republicans and 49 seats in the Democrats.
It is still unclear if Kavanaugh can win at least 50 votes in the Senate before Vice President Mike Pence can cast his vote and declare him the president of the Supreme Court.
North Korea’s number of refugees under Kim’s rule has declined.
A South Korean lawmaker said that since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, the number of North Korean refugees to South Korea has fallen.
Park Byung-siug said that last year we had 1,127 refugee cases, down from 2,706 in 2011, according to the Ministry of the Union of South Korea.
Park said tighter border controls between North Korea and China and higher wages for smuggling were among the most influential factors.
Pyongyang has made no public statement.
Most of the refugees from North Korea are eventually granted South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the war ended in 1953.
Most people are fleeing through the Chinese border, as China has the longest border with North Korea, making it easier to cross than the heavily protected civilian zone between the two Koreas.
China considers refugees to be illegal immigrants, not refugees, and often forcibly returns them to their homeland.
Relations between North and South Korea, which are still so-called at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang and discussed the nuclear disarmament talks that had been halted.
This happened after a historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore following a general agreement by the parties to dismantle the Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea’s Secretary of State Ray Yang-hoe said U.S. sanctions had been a factor in the lack of progress in nuclear talks since then.
Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly in New York, Ray said: “If we can’t trust the United States, we can’t be sure of our national security, and under such circumstances, we’re in no way stepping forward unilaterally, and we’re not disarming ourselves.”
Nancy Pelosi says Bert Kavanaugh is "hysterical" and inappropriate for the presidency of the Supreme Court
Nancy Pelosi, the minority leader of the House of Representatives, the nominee of the Supreme Court, called Bert Kavanaugh a “historian” and said he was not behaving appropriately to serve in the Supreme Court.
On Saturday, Polosi spoke in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas, criticizing the situation.
On Thursday, Polosi told the Senate Judiciary Committee about his reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony: “I couldn’t say it, I think if a woman did so, they would call her a hysteria.”
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations that she had been sexually assaulted when she and Christian Blassey were both teenagers.
Kavanaugh was emotional at first, and when she talked about her family and her high school years, she sometimes almost screamed and shouted at her.
He has also clearly condemned the Democrats on the committee, calling the accusations against him “a ridiculous and coordinated personality terror” that the Liberals have organized because they are nervous about Hillary Clinton’s defeat in the 2016 presidential election.
Polosi said Kavanaugh’s testimony proved that he could not serve in the Supreme Court because it showed he was anti-democrat.
“I think Kavanaugh showed by his speeches that he is not qualified for the job and by the way he talks about Clinton and the Democrats, he shows his incompetence.”
When Polosi was asked if Kavanaugh was elected, and if the Democrats again had a majority in the House, he tried to declare him guilty or not, his answer was no.
“I’m saying this – if he doesn’t tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then neither the presidency of the Supreme Court nor the court he’s currently working on is appropriate.”
Kavanaugh is currently judging the Washington Judiciary Revision Court.
Polosi added that as a Democrat, he is concerned about Kavanaugh's possible opposition to the Affordable Care Act or the VIDE Act, because he is considered a conservative Labour judge.
Kavanaugh declined to answer questions about whether he would return some of the Supreme Court’s decisions at the verification sessions.
“It’s not the time for a hysterical, obsessive person to go to court and expect us to say ‘what an interesting thing.’
Women need to manage their tears.
It's a bitter criticism, filled with anger for months and years, and she can't get rid of it without crying.
45 years later, Mrs. Steinmeier said to me, “When we get nervous, we cry.”
“I don’t think it’s unusual, right?”
“The house where the manager was somewhere helped me a lot, and he told me he also cried when he got nervous, but he created a technique, like when he got nervous and cried, he said to the person who was talking to him, ‘I’m crying because of the annoyance.’
I'm angry."
And then he continued to do it.
And I thought this was a very good technique.”
Tears are partly to shed a sense of anger because shedding tears is essentially misinterpreted.
One of my clearest recollections of my first job in the office where the employees were the most male is that when I cried out of indescribable anger, Mrs. Morey took me by the neck – the anonymous manager I was always a little afraid of – and dragged me down the stairs.
He said to me, “Never let them see you cry.”
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you’re upset and they’re happy because they’ve hurt you.”
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic member of the U.S. Congress from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart during his presidential run.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was seen with a stranger on board a boat named Manny Business and disqualified from the election, Ms. Schroeder, who was deeply disappointed, realized there was no reason not to run for president herself.
Thirty years later, she laughed and said to me, “It wasn’t a decision I thought about.”
“The other seven candidates were in the presidential race and my nomination was the last thing they wanted.
One person called it “Snow White and Seven Dwarfs.”
Because it was too late to set up the campaign, and there was no time to raise funds, he swore he wouldn’t get into the competition until he provided $2 million in funding.
The fight was defeated.
He learned that some of his supporters who gave men $1,000 would give him only $250.
She was surprised and thought to herself, “Do they think I’m getting a discount?”
When he started his speech and announced that he was not starting the official campaign, he was so impressed by the emotions – he appreciated the people who supported him, the system that made it difficult to raise money and did not allow voters to be heard instead of delegates, his voice was depressed and he was discouraged because of gender discrimination.
Ms. Schroeder recalls how the media reacted to her, “Thinking man, we have a nervous disorder.”
“You thought the Clintons were my sponsor.”
I remember thinking about what they wanted to write on my gravestone.
"Did he cry?"
How the U.S.-China Trade War May Benefit Beijing
Experts say the firing of bullets at the start of a trade war between the United States and China has been devastating, and while the fight is still long overdue, a dispute between the two countries could benefit Beijing in the long run.
Earlier this year, U.S. President Donald Trump issued the first warning by closing taxes on Chinese exports such as solar panels, steel and aluminum.
Trade tensions between the two countries peaked this week with new tariffs on $200 billion (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>150 billion) of goods, or half of all imports from China to the United States.
Beijing has reimbursed each time in some way, from the last example of which one can point to a tariff of five to ten percent on US $ 60 billion in goods.
China has sworn to compete step-by-step with the United States and is unlikely to shake the world’s second-largest economy by this time.
Turning Washington back from the decision it has made means surrendering to its demands, but it is too embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Jinping to publicly bow down to the United States.
However, experts say, if Beijing can play with its cards correctly, the pressures of the U.S. trade war could have a positive impact on China in the long run by decreasing dependence between the two countries.
Abigail Grace, a research fellow at the U.S. New Security Center’s Thinking Room on Asian Issues, said, “The fact that a thoughtless political decision by Washington or Beijing could create a situation that would cause an economic collapse in any country is far more dangerous than anything else.”
Syrian Foreign Minister Says Syria 'Ready' to Return Refugees
Syria says it is ready to voluntarily return refugees and calls on other countries to help rebuild it, which has been devastated by more than seven years of war.
When the Syrian Foreign Minister spoke to the U.N. General Assembly, he said that his country was getting better.
“Today, thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism, the situation in Syria has become more stable and safer,” he said.
The government is trying to rebuild areas that have been destroyed by terrorists and bring normal life back to the country.
All conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country, which has been abandoned because of terrorism and because of one-sided economic measures that have affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian aid.
The teacher said, “The Syrian regime welcomes aid to rebuild this devastated country.”
But he stressed that he does not want conditional aid as well as the aid of countries that supported Syria’s unrest.
Europe to win Rider's Cup in Paris
The European team, defeating the American team and scoring the final 16.5 out of 10.5, was able to win the 2018 Rider Cup at the national golf competition outside Paris, in France.
The U.S. has now defeated Europe six times in a row and has been unable to win the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
When Danish captain Thomas Bourne scored 14.5 points needed to defeat the United States, Europe again won the championship.
American star Phil Mickleson, who struggled hard most of the time in the race, threw the 16th hole into the water with his punch, and admitted his defeat against Francesco Molinari.
Molinari, the Italian Open golfer shined through all stages of the game, becoming one of the four players who, since the current form of the race began in 1979, has played 0-0-5.
Lower-ranked European team player Turbon Elson of Denmark eliminated American Open golfer Jordan Spitt 5&4.
Dustin Johnson, the world's top-ranked player, defeated Ian Polter of England by 2 and 1 points, playing in his last cup rider.
Sergio Garcia, the eight-time champion of the Rider's Cup, has always had the most wins in European competitions with 25.5 points in his field.
“I usually don’t cry, but today I couldn’t stop crying.
It was a difficult year.
Thank you very much to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm very happy, I'm very happy that we got the cup back.
After winning Europe, Garcia was excited to say, “It’s the team’s birthday, and I’m happy to have been able to help.”
He spoke to his compatriot John Ram, who defeated Tiger Woods in Sunday's singles game by 2 and 1 points.
The 23-year-old said, "I'm so proud of Tiger Woods' defeat, I grew up watching this man play."
Woods lost in all four of his races in France and now has a 13-21-3 professional record for the Ryder Cup.
This statistic is strange for someone who has always been one of the best players and has won the main title after Jack Nicholas.
The U.S. team spent the whole weekend trying to find short grass spots on the race field where Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finno weren’t because they played with all their talent and abilities throughout the race.
U.S. captain Jim Forrick said after his team’s disappointing performance, “I’m proud of these players, they fought.”
This morning we sometimes put pressure on the European team.
We've ruined it.
I congratulate Thomas.
He is a very good captain.
All 12 players played very well.
“We’re coming together again and I’m working with the American Professional Golf Association and the Rider Cap Committee and we’re moving forward.
I love these 12 players and am proud to be captain.
You have to admire them.
They played better than us.
