In Kherson people again went to the rally, the Russians did not have time to disperse
As the participants of the event told the agency, the Khersonites had time to hold a rally before the military RF with equipment arrived on the site to disperse.
"We had time to hold a rally. Now the RF technology has arrived there," - said one of the participants of the event.
Previously, the townspeople traditionally gathered for protests in Svoboda Square - near the ODA building and the regional council.
This area, like the building, is now controlled by Russian armed forces, which use weapons against rallies and kidnap people.
As reported, on April 3, armed Russian invaders used weapons against peaceful demonstrators in Kakhovka.
According to Ukrinform, residents of Donetsk regularly conduct peaceful protests against the Russian aggressor.
The Russian military uses force and weapons against people, is wounded and detained.
Also, Russian invaders are kidnapping residents of the region.
President Volodymyr Zelensky awarded Kherson the special title "City-hero".
On February 24, President Putin began a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

Zelensky: Mariupol – the heart of the war, will stop fighting – we will have weak positions
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy believes that the battles for the east of Ukraine and, in particular, for Mariupol, will determine the course of the war – and if the Russian Armed Forces are defeated there, the Russians can leave the negotiations and reoccupy the deoccupied territories.
“Mariupol is, you know, the heart of this war for today.
It fights – we fight, we are strong.
If it stops fighting, we will have weaker positions.
They (the defenders of the city – ed.) are people who have drawn on themselves a large number of enemies.
The stronger our position in Mariupol, the stronger our position will be in the east of the state, in the (district) of the OAS, and if they are stronger, then the negotiating table will be closer for us and we will have advantages in dialogue with the Russian Federation.
If we have a weak situation in all these directions, then we may not wait for the meeting.
Because then Russia will take all these steps, which can lead to a return even to the cities that we have now de-occupied.
They can go to that too.
Then our situation in the negotiations will be weaker and, perhaps, not even interesting for the Russian side.
Unfortunately, we are stating.
We believe in our results, in our victory.”
Zelensky also said that going to negotiations after the torture of Ukrainians is difficult, but "we should not lose the opportunity for a diplomatic solution if they will be with us".
“People will accept peace anyway, because people want this war to be over,” he said.
On our terms, the terms of Ukraine’s independence, but... every family has lost something – and I don’t think they will be satisfied with any peace under any conditions.
But if we don’t speak emotionally, the war must end in peace, or it will end with millions of victims.
And even where a million victims, everything comes to an end of the war.
Yes, we must fight, but for the sake of life.
You can't fight for dust when there's nothing, there's no people."

In connection with the change in the aesthesia of Ukrainian literature, new concepts were needed to describe its new quality state.

According to Ukrinform, the Chief Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine reports on Facebook.
“Every American should know their names.
The Ministry of Defense of Ukraine has obtained a list of military personnel of 64 separate motorized rifle brigades, who are directly involved in the commission of war crimes against the people of Ukraine in the city of Bucha,” the statement reads.
In GUR IOU note that for crimes committed against the civilian population of Ukraine, all war criminals will be brought to justice and will be held accountable.
You can view the list at the link.

In liberated cities and villages, mass killings of Russian military civilians have been recorded.
On April 1, the head of the city of Buchai, Anatoly Fedoruk reported that 280 people were buried in the brotherly graves.
Prosecutor General Iryna Venediktova said that on April 3, 410 bodies of killed civilians were taken from the territory of Kyiv region freed from Russian invaders.
On February 24, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced the beginning of a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

Bulob great , I have money for two months of rent, in Olomouc district does not matter, I will be very grateful.
Most of my acquaintances are deeply shocked by the news of the brutal harassment of the civilian population north of Kiev.
The photographs of the shots and shots of people confused the whole civilized world.
Dozens of people question each other, how could this happen in the 21st century?! How?!
But I was not surprised at all. It is exactly what I was waiting for with sadness...
I took the children and elderly parents out of Kyiv on the second day of the war.
Then the girls-colleagues with the children, and only after that returned to the capital to work.
Since 2014, I have been consistently helping the Armed Forces and never doubted that in the case of occupation, the forefront of Kyiv will not spare my family.
For I was and remain absolutely certain that the essence of the rotten communo-KKBist regime has remained unchanged since 1918.
Without terror, it simply cannot exist, it is built on terror.
In 1937, one of my great-grandfathers was shot dead in a prison in the city of Zhytomyr.
A few years ago, the Zhytomyr SBU was given a copy of the grandfather's shooting case: the whole case is more than a hundred pages, but the sentence to death is very simple and even more terrible.
The accused was illiterate, he denied the guilt.
An ethnic Pole, a Catholic, had five children, was of free people, a poor "one-court" nobility, never walked in fortresses.
The fact that they lived in farms and had several cows was enough to sentence the pahar and the nursery of minor children to death.
My parents didn’t even know about the funeral.
Grandma said that almost a hundred people were taken from the village and killed all but two who agreed to give false testimony.
In the criminal case is the name of the beating Shariy.
Our former speaker of the Verkhovna Rada comes from a neighboring village.
I believe in genetics and I would not be surprised if his relative was a KGB informant.
The apple from the apple tree near, as you know, falls...
The three gunmen who executed the peasants were ethnic Russians.
Analyzing the case of the great-grandfather, interested in various information resources.
There are in Russia wonderful (without sarcasm) information resources such as "Immortal Barak", which are qualitatively reminiscent of the events of those years.
Thus, in modern Russia, the descendants of the NKVDists found ways to punish and exterminate almost everyone who seriously investigated the crimes of their ancestors 70-80 years ago.
The people who found the mass graves of the victims of Stalin’s repressions and publicly wrote the names of the murderers were discredited and then destroyed by the system.
It seems that on the computer found files with child pornography, she was put in prison, and there quickly died.
The KGB is still killing those who are trying to find out the truth about the crimes of the last century.
So why are you suddenly surprised by their actions now?!
There are concentrated the most ugly features of human nature.
On top of the millennium Ordinary tradition, slavery and imperial chauvinism of the 16th-19th centuries were imposed.
And then on top of that, they did a wild genetic experiment, cutting out the intelligence during a few waves of red terror.
Watch the semi-French film "Chekist" in 1992, that's what it was.
Did you see my photos in the bathing suit?

I told her about you and how you are helping the Ukrainians.
There were tears in her eyes.
She said if it was possible it could be some old blanket and pillow.
But it's not necessarily. Only if it is. I'm also very grateful to you.
I was so sorry for him.

As reported by "European Truth", Welt writes about it with reference to sources in the government circles of Ukraine.
According to the publication, the corresponding proposal was sent to the Ministry of Economy of Germany on Saturday.
The cost of 100 hawks, including the training kit and spare parts, is <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.7 billion.
Also offered hawks in the version on the BTR Boxer for 1.2 billion euros.
While the tanks in combat have to be selected relatively close to the targets of the enemy, Panzerhaubitze 2000 can fire at a distance of more than 30 kilometers.
As reported by Ukrainian government circles with reference to the proposal of KMW, the supply of self-propelled hawks will take place according to a circular scheme.
The Bundeswehr will provide Kyiv with 100 of its hawks in the shortest possible time, and the gaps that have formed will then be filled by industry in the second stage.
The first new hawks can be delivered 30 months after the signing of the contract, i.e. before the second half of 2024.
The full supply will not be completed until 2027.
Are we in the first half of the day or in the second half of the day together?

Thank you, there’s something wrong with us.
And even we already have a product from nurseries
I'm sorry, I'm confused.
I didn’t understand Czech that well.
I must have come up with something.
True, they go to school as well as three because Hala and Svyatoslav are studying remotely finishing the school of Ukraine and will receive certificates about graduation already in the fall they need to enter the universities
Can you tell me how to get to the city centre?
I'll share my thoughts with you.
For me, marriage is the mystery of two people who do not discuss each other with their relatives or friends.
A man and a woman decide the issues themselves in their family, especially without the participation of relatives.
Can we be together?
It will take some time before we are around.
Why not try it this way?
I rented a car for 9 people, we will come with Mariana and your family.
How much time do you have? What time do you need to go?
I'm glad to hear jazz.
Thank you I am working with this application we talked about it in Czech courses on Wednesday
For the last four years I have not allowed anyone to come to me, I have read a lot of books on philosophy and I have understood myself.
When it hurts, it’s hard to trust.
But you have to try again, everyone goes through something that changes him forever, this is life.
Martin, we're going to bed.
Thank you for such a nice and fun day.
We really liked it.

Thank you very much for helping people. If you can, help us too. Find cheap accommodation.
We are now in Slapa, we have been sheltered by friends for a while.
My family: husband, daughter 6 years old, son 11 years old.
The man has already found a job as a driver.
I am a massage therapist looking for a job.
In order for the children to attend school and I to be able to work, we need housing not far from civilization.
I just had to give it up today!
Nothing. We'll wait until tomorrow. I didn't know that even the big stores would be closed.
Pigeons cook like this: in a pan dilute tomato paste to 0.5 liters of water 3-4 tablespoons of tomato paste -this leads to boiling .

I don't want a misunderstanding with you.
Because I'm worried that everything will be fine!?
Because with these exorcisms, we didn’t even talk about it!
I understand how important this is to you!
And I keep quiet about myself (for me it's just a peak that can't be reached)!
How do you feel today? <0xF0><0x9F><0x98><0x85> After the celebration?
Hi, sorry, I just woke up, bad sleep
Sorry to bother you.
I was saddened that Kolya and I started to translate the test badly yesterday.
I will ask whether Gregory Denysenko or perhaps Yonashek)) to help me with mathematical concepts at least a little.
Can I be useful to them too?
If there's a chance, I want to pick up mathematical terms for the weekend.
Geometry is difficult at all, but we have to work with Kolya so that it is error-free.
Thank you for the test tasks.
We also very much hope for this
And so she is very happy with any gift
Yab wanted to connect the internet to her Czech number
Yesterday, at the 402 bus stop, I met a Ukrainian woman, Victoria.
This girl is a child, but here she is herself... her eyes are full of tears and sadness...
I couldn’t stay away.
Now we have agreed to be friends.
And last night I thank God for this girl, because she is the first person from Ukraine where my heart felt reciprocity.
The branch in Hall No29 is specially designed for filing and processing applications for assistance
It turned out that I ordered a spare card.
Don't worry, I'm just a man.
Don’t be afraid that no one will come.
I didn't go. Yes, I baked myself. I can! The main thing is that you taught me how to turn on the oven.
So, how long do you have to leave the city?
Six months ago, at the Babin Yar Holocaust Memorial Center in Kyiv, we celebrated 80 years of mass shootings by German soldiers of Ukrainian Jews in Babin Yar.
I had the honor of speaking after three heads of state, including the President of Germany.
He spoke of the “common basis of international law and human dignity, the freedom of people to choose their own path and life in a territorial integrity, a peaceful and secure Europe.
We need to protect this foundation – it’s also part of our responsibility for our history.”
If “the evil demons of the past appear today in new clothes,” he said, “then for us Germans, there can be only one answer: never again!
The struggle must continue.”
Today, Russia has attacked a peaceful country, bombing and killing thousands of civilians, starving the inhabitants of its blockaded cities and causing them to die of disease.
Russian troops carry out mass shootings of Ukrainians, even visually resembling shootings in Babin Yar.
More than a month Germans see this in the news in real time.
So, Germany is introducing sanctions, providing humanitarian aid, as well as weapons, that not so long ago was impossible to imagine.
Germany is delaying the delivery of the heavy weapons needed by Ukraine.
But “Never again!” means not only to oppose the swastika.
This means fighting by all means possible against mass murder, genocide, war crimes and atrocities.
There is no easy way without risks and victims to defeat evil and stop the atrocities that are taking place in Ukraine.
There's a song for you at night
We agree, arrange for a tour, and write when to be gathered
All sick only Lydia was not sick in them was omicron a new type of covid

Serhiy Sidorenko: Our membership in NATO has ceased to be a far-reaching prospect
9 years ago, Ukrainian sociology showed that 67% of Ukrainians were against joining NATO and only 18% of respondents were in favor.
After the Revolution of Dignity, the escape of Viktor Yanukovych, the annexation of Crimea and the start of the Donbas war, the number of NATO opponents began to fall, and supporters, on the contrary, to increase.
After the beginning of a full-scale war with Russia, Ukrainian sociologists recorded a record level of support for Ukraine’s accession to NATO among Ukrainian citizens – more than 75%.
Despite the support of Ukraine’s accession to NATO and the assistance that NATO provides in the context of war, there is now a lot of criticism at the expense of the Alliance and its member countries – for the inopportune supply of weapons, the refusal to close the sky, the unwillingness to “irritate” Russia.
In addition, there is a great risk that Ukraine will be forced to renounce its aspiration to join the Alliance due to the position of the Russian Federation, if it can stop the war, and Ukraine will receive reliable security guarantees, including military ones.
In the new episode of the podcast "Cursed Questions" together with the editor of the "European Truth" we talk about how exactly helped Ukraine the Alliance since the Russian invasion, for which NATO should be criticized, and for which the Alliance is criticized in vain, why our perspective is a member of the
What do you think here
I have a volt partner that indicates that my application is under consideration.
I submitted it through this mobile app
There are no visas, we need to go to the convention center and find out how to do it, because it was issued in Poland, where visas were not given, but given pesetas.
We will definitely write to you!
Denis left today in a good mood.
I made an appointment with a boy from Ukraine, whom I met yesterday, to meet near the school, so that he would show him everything.
So I hope he's okay.
Because I don’t like it, I miss it for a long time.
In Ukraine it is reported that the Czech Republic sent to Ukraine T-72 tanks and infantry fighting vehicles
I'm going to leave the kids alone there for 3-4 hours and I'm going home because I can't leave anymore.
Take it with you at 6-7 a.m.
Yes, there was a sick heart.
I had sincere feelings for this man, but he did not do it very decently and I left him.
After a while, he came back and apologized to me.
I refused him.
Then, after a while, he called for an operation on his heart.
I asked him to just talk to me, I was sorry for him.
I have been supporting him psychologically for almost six months.
During that time, we had a lot of conversation.
I started having problems at work at the same time.
His support also helped me at the time.
Such a mutual aid.
And I thought, maybe you really need to look at it differently.
And he offered to marry me, and two days later he died.
God has decided our destiny.
What does it mean to be ready for marriage?
He speaks only in Czech.
I wanted to say that I was able to find a home, and I am very happy about it <0xE2><0x98><0xBA> now I have a place to live and I have a place to be with the baby.

I understand perfectly the price of unskilled work and I understand that such a job as I had at home in Kyiv I will not be able to have here and the money that I earned at home, here now I will not receive either.
But just sit down and do nothing I can not do, because then all the bad thoughts lick in the head so you have to engage in some physical

I don't remember that schedule.)
Russian army threatens to inflict missile strikes on Kyiv: they say "never done this before"
Direct speech of Konashenkov: "We see attempts of diversions and the task of strikes by Ukrainian troops on objects on the territory of the Russian Federation.
If such cases continue, the armed forces of the Russian Federation will strike at the decision-making centers, including in Kiev, from which the Russian army has previously refrained.
The Russians launched missile strikes on Kyiv from the first days of a full-scale invasion of the Russian occupation troops in Ukraine.
On February 25, the remnants of Russian missiles that struck the Ukrainian air defense system fell on the apartment building in the capital Pozniaky.
On February 26, a Russian missile hit a multi-storey building on Valery Lobanovsky Avenue.
On March 1, the Russians hit a television tower in Dorogozhichy near Babinoy Yar, as a result of which 5 passers-by died.
On March 2, Ukrainian air defense systems shot down over the South Railway Station Russian missiles flying in the direction of the building of the Ministry of Defense.
On March 14, the debris of the shot down rocket of the occupants shattered the house and trolleybus on Kurenivka in Kyiv
On March 18, a Russian rocket hit a residential area on the vineyard, one person was killed, and 19 people were injured, including four children.
On March 21, Russian missiles destroyed the modern Retroville shopping mall on the vineyard, as a result of which at least 4 people died.
Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko once again said on April 13 that residents of the capital, who were evacuated from the city, it was too early to return.
The military explained to the local authorities that the Russians can still launch missile strikes on Kiev, and also on the outskirts of the capital very many mines and unexploded ammunition.
The main intelligence department of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine warned on April 12 that the Russians are planning to launch a series of terrorist attacks on the territory of the Russian Federation in order to blame the Ukrainians and justify the Russian army's cruelty towards the civilian population.
On April 1, an oil base exploded near Belgorod in Russia, allegedly due to an air attack by Ukrainian helicopters.
At the beginning of April the local authorities of Belgorod stated that near the city allegedly fell "Ukrainian shell".
Obviously, the elites in both Washington and Berlin are throwing in cold sweat from the very thought that NATO fighters will shoot down Russian bombers in the sky in Ukraine.
Zelensky, however, speaks not so much to them as to their constituents and societies in general.
With his speeches in parliaments and in front of thousands of crowds in the squares of the largest cities in Europe, the Ukrainian leader is doing something that was unavailable to any of his predecessors.
Zelensky does not persuade European politicians to do everything for Ukraine, he convinces the European peoples who choose those politicians.
And these speeches, this exquisite alloy of strength, touch and sometimes despair, are gradually reaching their goal.
While the same Biden is categorically against shutting down the sky, 70% of his fellow citizens already support this idea.
Although Paris or Brussels opposes accelerating Ukraine’s accession, this process is already underway.
I understand you, so I don't want to be considered a fraud.
The money you raise is better to give to people in need.

If you don't need a price list, I won't post it.
Tell yourself how you want it, and I will do it.
You didn’t want to write to me today.
Don't worry, I'm not here to ask for anything.

I have a lot to say today, so I ask you to be patient.
Are you all right with your imagination?
You live your normal life, go to work, plan shopping, vacation.
You have a dream.
You're planning to buy this dress that you saw yesterday in the mall.
Tomorrow night, after work.
Your brain can’t see it.
He's clinging to the old reality.
You call to work, find out - go out to work today or not.
You decide to leave your children at home.
Until something is clear.
There's hope... it won't be long.
Now .... agree... something will happen.
The brain refuses to accept...
Where to go ?? I have no one and nowhere.
I have $50 in my pocket. Everything we spent at home.
Many of our managers have not paid salaries for their jobs.
Where do I go ?? Who needs me ? How do I provide children ? Where do I live ?
You can't take a lot of things.
You didn't take anything out of the house... you got to drive a thousand miles.
You don't know if you'll have anything to feed them tomorrow or not.
Every day, from morning to evening, you drag the children all over Prague.
What's next? I don't know. How much is it? I don't know. Children ask for sweets. And you can't. It's expensive for you.
And from every iron - we don't have that.
We have a choice - to stay there and call the children in danger, or try to escape here

There is a cleanup from the enemy - looking for Russians in the basements and apartments.
The whole city has been replaced, mine clearance work will begin.

These are small entrepreneurs who, in their premises and shops, hosted volunteer headquarters.
These are tractors that actually go out in the field under fire because it's time to sow.
These are the bus drivers who agree today to go in rubber trains to the temporarily occupied territories to bring help there and take people from there.
They are heroic leaders who fearlessly go to the war zone, calm down and help refugees in wagons, and at peace stations help volunteers to load humanitarian aid into wagons.
These are the tankers that stood on the Zhytomyr route in the first days of the war and patiently served frightened and nervous people.
These are utilities that take out garbage under fire, repair water pipes and power lines to provide people with what they need.
These are doctors and nurses who save people 24 hours a day, without complaining about anything, and in the free minute still volunteer, collecting kits on the front.

Please tell me, little children, what age do you mean?
My daughter is 8 years old, is that acceptable?
I am looking for accommodation for me and my daughter for 3-4 days in order to come to the Czech Republic and transfer passports for visa registration to Canada.
In Warsaw, there are a lot of people in the visa center and there is no online queue.
I wanted to come for one day, but it is far, it takes a lot of time by train, the child will be difficult.
So I decided to look for accommodation in Prague or near it.
No, it all suits us.

The foreign electoral district of Ukraine (Ukrainian Electoral Office) is the electoral district of Ukraine, which unites the polling stations located outside the territory of Ukraine, and consists of polling stations in the embassies and consulates of Ukraine and premises on military bases.

Very tasty apples, what is this variety?
Andriy Yermak, the head of the office of the president, said that Russia is starting a “fake operation” on weapons that are handed over to us by the allies.
Yermak’s direct speech: “They understand that they are losing the war, they see their backwardness and they seek to “kill” arms supplies by any means.
For example, one of the last fakes is the destruction of S-300 missiles handed over by Slovakia.
This information has already been refuted by Prime Minister Eduard Heger.
What will happen next? We know the scripts of the Russians. I will name one of them.
They can launch fakes that Ukrainian soldiers are willingly surrendering with weapons from the Allies, and it is massively switching to the armaments of the Russian army.
I want to warn these fakes right away.
Because the weapons in the hands of the soldiers of the Armed Forces exclusively sends the enemy to the world.
Excuse me, forgot to ask how much bule cost a nursery in a month and will it work in the summer?

The international community continues to express shock and outrage after evidence emerged that Russian forces committed atrocities against civilians in Ukraine, and Moscow rejected these reports as a “provocation.”
“Reports of Ukrainian civilians killed, raped and seriously wounded by Russian troops are worthy of condemnation,” New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern told reporters in Wellington on April 4.
“Russia must answer to the world for what they did,” she added, noting that her government will discuss additional measures to support Ukraine in its fight against the Russian invasion.
Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kisida called the incidents a “violation of international law”.
The statements came after reports emerged that hundreds of civilians were shot and thrown into brotherly graves or left on the streets in the suburbs of Kiev, in Bucha, by Russian troops who left the area after the occupation for several weeks.
The photographs, which allegedly depicted the bodies of executed civilians with their hands tied, shocked many and led to calls for stronger sanctions against Russia and criminal prosecution of the culprits.
French President Emmanuel Macron said in a radio interview on April 4, that there are signs that Russian troops committed "war crimes" in Bouches-du-Rhone.
"What happened in Buche requires a new round of sanctions and very clear measures," Macron said, adding that additional sanctions should target Russian exports of coal and oil.
Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said Russian troops could go so far as to commit a “genocide” in Bucha.
“We will do everything we can to ensure that those who committed these war crimes do not go unpunished,” Sanchez said in Madrid.
Speaking on state television late on April 3, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova dismissed the allegations as a “provocation”.
She said without evidence that the United States and NATO “ordered” the image to discredit Russia.
“In this case, it seems to me, the fact that these statements were made in the first minutes after the appearance of these materials, does not cause any doubt as to who “ordered” this story,” – said Zakharova.
Earlier, the Russian Defense Ministry also stated without evidence that Buchi's image is "another depiction of the Kiev regime" and that all Russian troops left the city by March 30.
Moscow asked the UN Security Council to meet on April 4 to discuss what it called a “provocation of Ukrainian radicals” in Bucha.
On April 4, Russia’s Investigative Committee released a statement announcing an “investigation” on charges of spreading “knowingly false information” about the actions of Russian troops in Butch.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy spoke on April 3, accusing Russian troops of committing “genocide” in the city, and told Kremlin leaders that they should come to Bucha to see what their military did.
“I want all the leaders of the Russian Federation to see how their orders are executed,” Zelenskyy said in a video address, moving from Ukrainian to Russian.
And there is a shared responsibility.
For these murders, for these tortures... for the shots in the head,” he said.
He said that Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Russian military should be held accountable for the actions of the troops in Ukraine.
“When we find people with arms tied behind their backs and beheaded, I don’t understand,” he said of scenes of victims scattered on the streets of Bucha, a city about 35 kilometers northwest of Kiev.
The correspondent of the Ukrainian Radio Liberty service on April 2 saw on the streets of a small city bodies of seemingly civilians.
Only in one place the correspondent saw up to 10 bodies on the street.
AP reporters have seen the bodies of at least 21 people in different locations in Buche.
The bodies of one out of nine people, all civilians, were scattered on the ground near the site, which, according to locals, used Russian forces as a base.
The victims appear to have been killed at a close distance.
In general, the Ukrainian authorities said that the bodies of at least 410 civilians were found in the area of Kiev, which until last week was controlled by Russian troops.
Thank you, everything is there, we bought everything on the list.
"They were told: Kyiv is not there". How the occupiers of the underground exported Ukrainians to Russia and Belarus
The Russian invasion of Ukraine is accompanied by terrible things: robberies, rapes, murders, tortures.
In this list there is another item, about which there is currently much less information – the removal of the local population to the territory of the enemy.
Around mid-March, Russian occupiers have been evacuating Ukrainians from temporarily occupied settlements to their territory and the territory of Belarus, which the self-proclaimed President Lukashenko actually handed over to the Russian military camp.
"Ukrainian Truth" searched for exported Ukrainians and their relatives to ask how the same "evacuation" takes place and whether there are ways to return to Ukraine after it.
The heroes of this text agreed to voluntary and forced evacuation outside Ukraine under psychological pressure and from the impasse.
Fortunately, they are alive and keep in touch with relatives.
However, in view of the statements of the Ukrainian authorities, many citizens were exported to Russia and Belarus under strict coercion.
Thus, in Melitopol, the Russians stole the staff of the second maternity home, took out children without parents, including 12-year-old Miroslava, the daughter of the deceased champion of Ukraine for swimming Yosip Zachepinsky.
The family of Alexander, Marina and their 10-year-old daughter Vali moved to Gostomel a few months before the war.
Alexander just got a job at the airport "Antonov", located 2.5 kilometers from the village.
The family settled on the territory of the military camp, although it was a civilian.
Like the real plastons, Dennis and Marina had packed alarming suitcases in advance, but did not have time to evacuate on the morning of February 24.
They didn’t have their own car, and the suburban buses weren’t taking anyone anymore.
At about 12 o'clock on February 24, they saw helicopters with the Latin letter V, followed by the first shells.
One of them hit a neighboring house.
Then the family went down to the basement and stayed there for a long three weeks, until March 17, until the Russian military took them out to Belarus.
In total, about 40 people were hiding in their basement.
Not everyone decided to go.
“At 6 p.m. on February 24, people came to the entrance, who spoke neither Russian nor Ukrainian.
They ask, “Who is there?” – I say, yes. – “Come out!”.
They searched me, asked who was in the basement, if there was a gun.
All the men were asked if they were serving in the army.
The women were told, “We have come to protect you on the orders of Ramzan Kadyrov.”
It was the Chechen OMON, not even the army, young boys aged 25-35.
They said: "From us in the war helped the Ukrainians, Sashko White (commanded the unit of the nationalist movement UNA-UNSO "Viking", which fought on the side of the Chechens in the first Russian-Chechen war - UP), now we have to help you".
On the third day, they asked us what we were missing.
We say that water was a big problem with her.
They broke the store, took the goods from there under the pretext of "all still Russians will take" and brought us 6 bottles.
There is also an online video where the children thank Kadyrov for the food.
So it is after the robbery of the store they brought the sausage and say, "We understand that this is wrong, but we really need a video for Ramzan Akhmatovich."
Nobody really wanted to talk, but they made a beautiful cut.
Our baby there says, “You have 7 days to give away our phones” – they laughed.
They were constantly separating themselves from the Russians.
They said how good it was that they came, because they did not want war, Ukrainians are supported and generally good: "Putin is a bastard, Kadyrov too, but we can do nothing, because our families are there."
And basically they did not fight, but went to rob shops, marooned.
Kurey was brought to himself, one was tied to one leg Georgievsky tape, and to the other – his white scotch and called it "military".
They came to Ukraine unprepared at all.
I don't know how their intelligence worked... When they were beaten at Buche, so they didn't even take the dead, they asked us, "Do you have any artillery?"
What’s more, we had organized units – the Chechens didn’t know each other, in the first days they asked for passwords to find out whether they were their own or someone else’s.
They were with us until March 13, after which the Russian OMON arrived, and after them – the Omsk landing.
They placed 30-40 units of equipment between the houses – ours constantly fell into it from the "Bayraktars".
But they came and told us that there is no more ASU, but there is "Azov", and, according to them, "Azov" about 100 thousand in Ukraine.
The narrative of "Kyiv has already surrendered" has been going on since the beginning of March.
One day, a Russian – either a landing officer or a representative of the FSB – came to us and said that there would be an evacuation.
And we listened to the radio – there was about Buch, Gostomel, we thought, maybe we were given a "green corridor".
From the beginning, we handed over our lists to the Chechens, they promised to contact the Ukrainian command.
But we are told: “You will be deported to Belarus, and then maybe to Rostov.”
We say we don’t want to go there or there.
To which they replied, "Then pity the psyche of your children!"
How it worked: they drove us into the basement and started shooting from under the house – either the Cities or the mortars.
And then it flew back... the neighboring houses just burned down, some of them collapsed.
Our house had a direct impact on the third floor.
Later they agreed to take us only to Belarus, promising to hand over to the border guards and the Red Cross.
The part did not leave, saying that it was for the traitors of the homeland - said, "you will be shot there, the organs will be sold".
We were taken through Chernobyl, on both sides of the road there were hills, broken equipment, although the Belarusians told us that the Russians immediately brought the equipment to them.
A lot of caponiers, buried equipment and soldiers.
At the Belarusian Komar pass point, we passed an improvised check, many were without documents at all, because they were burned.
We were placed in tents of the Red Cross, given tea.
And here we hear shots! A rocket is firing, and you can see - it worked "Iskander" in Kyiv.
Although those from the Belarusian Red Cross said, "No, it's planes flying, turning around at the border."
But we're from the aviation, we have education, we understand that.
Then we were put in a bus and taken to the sanatorium "Chonka" near Gomel.
His manager, Wenger Vasyl Stepanovich, came and said, "Here I am, I am from Chernigov.
But I understand that Putin and Lukashenko will not stop until these thieves of yours are captured.
Poor people are suffering!
And we have Lukashenko so good!
He will say it, and it will be.”
They offered to give an interview to Belarusian journalists, but no one wanted to.
The administration of the sanatorium told us: "You are already traitors!"
And people from the Red Cross and the UN mission (at least they were so called) spread misinformation that men cannot go to Poland.
Many believed in it and were afraid to leave Belarus.
But we decided to leave, although we had a problem with the documents – the daughter did not have a foreign passport.
We were supposed to get it on Monday, and the war started on Thursday.
The Ukrainian consulate did not help us at all, and in Minsk at the station they said that without passports no one would take anyone on the bus.
I would like to say that Belarusian volunteers have helped us a lot.
We were settled in Minsk, and the accompaniment was carried out.
They were not held by force in the sanatorium.
Our second group migration representative said that you can live here for a maximum of a week and a half, because Belarus is not Europe, there are no payments here.
We found an internal carrier who decided to take us to Warsaw.
Passing by Mozyr (about 50 kilometers from the Ukrainian border – UP), we saw launches of ballistic missiles through Ukraine: the missile first flies, glows beautifully, and then goes out.
People who were on the bus in Mozir said that the Russians there constantly shoot from the landing sites.
But I can say that the Belarusians do not want to fight at all.
The generals are released from the army.
One woman told us that she would break something to her son if he were summoned.
However, the northern part of Belarus, there de Minsk, is not believed at all.
They say, “You are a liar, and we are a people of peace.”
They do not realize that their landfills are used for shelling Ukraine.
In Poland, friends were waiting to take us to Estonia.
Now we go through the registration, we decide what we will do next.
In Estonia, the Ukrainian flags are now, of course, as many as the Estonian ones.”
Marina lived on the territory of the military camp in Gostomeli with the family of her brother – his wife and two children, 18 and 22 years old.
On the morning of February 24, she called her nephews and asked them to collect the most necessary things and documents.
In the evening they went to sleep in the basement of the neighboring house.
Marina herself could not return home and in principle will not be able – the house is no longer there.
No one knew anything about the evacuation.
Is it possible to go somewhere in the city on Monday?
Thank you, we have everything.And we are always waiting for you in the guest room!
Thank you for the arrangement, the moths are nice

On April 1, the head of the city of Bucha, Anatoly Fedoruk, announced the joyful news that the Ukrainian military liberated the city from Russian invaders on March 31.
The next day the occupiers were thrown out of the entire Kyiv region.
However, the joy that Ukrainians should feel at this moment was overshadowed by horror and hatred, because at the same time it became known that in a single Buchi, the Russians shot at least 280 civilians.
They were killed just on the street, some were tied up and shot in the head, some of the killed were minors.
Murdered and with traces of torture found the elder of the village Motyzhin Olga Suchenko, her husband Igor and son Alexander, who were kidnapped on March 23.
Olga and Oleksandra’s bodies were in the brother’s grave, and Igor was in the sewers.
Around the road 20 km from Kiev found the bodies of several naked women wrapped in a blanket.
The Russians tried to burn them.
If I go home, there will be no one.

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that certain types of weapons provided by Western partners came too late.
He said about this in an interview with the Associated Press, an excerpt of which was published by the President's Office, writes "European Truth".
"All the equipment, everything they are already sending, for some types of equipment, it's done late.
So what, when we talk, for example, about Mariupol, when you lose thousands of people, and what now?
From the leaders of some countries I see 100 percent support, it really is.
And some European leaders have changed their position, but you see the price of these changes," Zelenskyy said.
Asked if Ukraine had enough weapons to make a difference in the war, the president replied: “Not yet, not yet.”
The president also said that if Ukraine were a member of NATO, this war would not exist, or it would take a different form.
“It would have unfolded differently, we would have had close neighbors, we could fight together.
But I’m sure there would be no war anyway,” he added.
Recall, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom promised Ukraine new military assistance, which includes armored vehicles and anti-ship weapons.

Today a new girl from Ukraine appeared in the garden
I didn't even touch the door, and she's ringing the doorbell.
If I understood Mr. Director correctly, he said that if I work in the garden, I can come to work on some days for as many hours as I get.
If that is the case, then I can, for example, go to work for several days a week for several hours.
For how many hours and on what days I will see how to get out of me, so that I fashion and clean the apartments to go, there for cleaning more paid so do not want to give up that job.
I am a water supply technologist so I feel the taste of water immediately
She said cheap and tasty cakes there
But overall, it's okay.
Is it possible for me to do tests these days?
I may be able to go live for dinner if they let me go home for the night!) You will see me <0xF0><0x9F><0x98><0x87>

Marina but really if you need help with the garden then my husband and I will help.
My friend and I went to hell yesterday, try it if you want.
Everyone was sick and had symptoms, but we didn’t go to the hospital.
I just got a call from a lady from LadyJedlo and she said that they were sending me emails with information about what to do next and I never gave an answer.
She spoke Czech and I understood her that way.
But in the e-mail I do not have a letter from dameidlo

He was a very wealthy man, but I liked him because I had my point of view on life I met him, then left him.
He was a very wealthy man, after a while he called and reported that he had had surgery on his heart.
He asked me to just talk to him and support him, and I felt sorry for him.
He was a very wealthy man and he thought I might be his toy and I might need his money.
And then he made me an offer.
"There was a car in my yard, it looked like a crocodile, and it was running.
And they kept me in the house, then they took me to the basement, and there were a lot of people there, about 400 people, there was nothing to breathe.
And what about the house, that you took the photo

Okay, I just need to print out the coloring pages for the kids, so it'll be fine. When can I come?
But you may need a more detailed knowledge of the Czech language.
I am worried that you will be satisfied with my work.
On this occasion, I know a girl who is Ukrainian, but is studying in the Czech Republic, specializing in tourism.
You really don't want to come for a minute with the kids quietly and with the grandmother.
I want you to be with me, to wake up next to you.
In general, the wind is hard in a foreign country, every day more and more want to go home.
Mrs. Agatha, if you need this photo, I'll take a photo.
Thank you for trying to make the best of our lives here.

“I tell her that the ‘repair of the TV and radio receiver’ has been delayed due to imported parts, and friends and acquaintances are warned not to whistle too much when they call.”
"We have been hiding information about the war from the mother-in-law for a whole month.
So far, it works.
However, the stain (cat – UP) on the lug and the hind legs has fur – it can be from stress, changes in feed and lack of vitamins.
The last two reasons are eliminated, but the stress does not depend on me, unfortunately.
The spot, unlike the mother-in-law, is not deaf, hears both sirens and explosions."
Due to the fact that Olga does not hear well and spends most of her time in her room, her daughter-in-law lived in an apartment with her "incognito".
On April 1, 93-year-old Oksana Polova took up arms for the first time in her life.
"For 33 days, as a guerrilla, I lived with her in an apartment.
The war was hidden from her and the fact that I was there – I formally came as usual for a few hours.
But when her girlfriend spoke, I gave her a receiver – she listened for 4 hours, then sang for 2 hours.”
The radio was always at the bedside.
Most of the time the mother-in-law spends in her room.
It sounds bad – it allowed me to be invisible to her.
When I heard the sound of her "walkers", I hid in my room.
First of all, she hid the receiver and the TV from her.
Then I called everyone who was talking to her. That's six or seven people.
She asked me to talk to her about anything, except the war.
I'll ask my friend, she was there from the beginning and to the end
It is April 17 - I have a cleaning 2 apartments :)
Good evening, I never thought about it :)
If you need our help tomorrow, we will be able to come.
Lunch must be ordered, can I take lunch from home?Do these documents need to be printed, or will they be printed on the spot and I will sign?
I offer haircuts for men, women, children with a trip to you , all trapped please write in a personal message, price:
I understand you and do not complain, but in my situation I will be looking for here for the time being.
I tell you, the embassies are tiles here,
A British man who defended Mariupol in the Armed Forces says he is ready to surrender to the Russians
A British soldier of the Marine Brigade of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, who is involved in the defense of Mariupol, told his friends and family that they would put up arms and surrender to the Russian occupiers.
Source: Twitter page of Aidan Eislin, a British man who has served in the U.S. Air Force since 2018, the Air Force citing members of Eislin's family and friends, Atlas News citing a friend of Eislin's who spoke to him
Aislin tweeted: "We received a message from him: "It has been 48 days, we have tried everything possible to protect Mariupol, but we have no choice but to surrender to the Russian troops.
We have no food or ammunition left.
“Thank you all, I hope the war will end soon.”
Details: Eislin served in the 36th Marine Brigade of the U.S. Army, which is involved in the Mariupol Defense Operation.
Air Force journalists contacted the mother of a soldier, Anne Wood, and she confirmed that on the phone her son reported that they plan to give up in captivity.
A friend of the military, Brennan Phillips, also confirmed to reporters that in the last phone call, Islin said about the plans of their capitulation unit.
According to him, the brigade ran out of ammunition and food.
Journalists from Atlas News contacted his friend, who said that the Eislin unit intends to surrender in captivity to the Russian units, so as not to get without weapons and bullets in the hands of the units of the so-called "cadets".
Also in the social networks distributed audio recording of the phone conversation, in which it is alleged that Eislin talks with his friend American, who plans to go to Ukraine.
In the interview, Eislin said that they tried to get out of the city in civilian clothes, but they failed.
Earlier, the British told that on Instagram, he was threatened by representatives of the private military company "Wagner".
Aislin was a social worker in the city of Newark-on-Trent in Nottinghamshire, but in 2015-2017 went to take part in the battles against the terrorists of the so-called "Islamic State" in Syria.
In 2018, he officially joined the labs of the Armed Forces and took an oath.
Aislin's friends and relatives called him Johnny, and on social media he is better known by the nickname Cossack Gundi.

I wanted to come to you, but I still wanted to do some business. When
I'll ask my husband in the morning if he'll make it tomorrow.
When you come home, write to me, please, I would need to talk to Daniel.
Bolshevik attackers for their losses in battle played full.
They shot the teacher Dmitry Pavlytsky, his unnamed relative, the young man Boris Alexienko.
Their bodies were thrown into a “deep, perishable pit that was filled with earth.”
“There was a dead silence in the city.”
Occasionally, one of the residents ran from house to house with a fever.
In the streets there were always bodies rolled by the Bolsheviks

I’m not afraid of work, as I also lived in the village, so I can and love to work physically.
When you can bring things
You have a very interesting tradition, we go that way for Christmas
Last week, the Verkhovna Rada adopted draft law 7176, which is entitled "On the implementation of monitoring of potential threats to the national security of Ukraine in the sphere of the economy".
It is surprising that, in fact, the only potential threat to the national security of Ukraine in the sphere of the economy was the place where the members of the supervisory board of state companies and state banks hold meetings.
The initiators of the bill believe that the decision-making by the supervisory board of the state company in conditional Kyiv can somehow solve the problems of national security of Ukraine.
We know about a large number of new dangers for state companies, but so far we do not know about any company, which had the need to physically hold a meeting of the supervisory board at the address of the location.
The potential threat from such a law is clear – it is an excellent basis for “carrying” all assets in the difficult reform of state-owned enterprises after the Revolution of Dignity, including independent supervisory boards, and then establishing manual management.
The same as it was before 2015.
Why do state companies have supervisory boards and who should join them?
Moreover, if under patriotic slogans one harmful bill "flys off", then tomorrow others can fly off – for example, it is possible to abolish the system of public procurement through ProZorro or the independence of the NBU.
A lot can be written for war.
By the way, this initiative appeared before the beginning of the war and Bill 7176.
Thus, on February 22, this norm was added to the comparative table of draft law 5397.
And in general, the desire to disperse the supervisory board in one way or another has been circulating among some popular elected officials for a long time.
Not for the sake of criticism as such, but in order to show the possible consequences of the bill, we will understand the arguments that explained the need for its adoption.
And then we will make our proposals on how to solve the issue of the management of state-owned enterprises during the war.
First Deputy Minister of Economy Denis Kudin explained the need for such innovation by the risks of losing the Internet and other means of communication, which will make it impossible for the supervisory boards to work remotely.
In other words, the risk is that the supervisory board will not be able to make the necessary decisions, in connection with which the work of the company can be paralyzed.
Do we agree that there is such a risk, but will it be able to prevent the transfer of supervisory board members to Ukraine?
Imagine a rather cynical situation when independent members of supervisory boards (which make up the majority of the entire composition) put their personal security above the interests of the company and refuse to come to Ukraine.
In this case, according to the bill, they can be released.
And then, most likely, this will lead to the loss of the quorum necessary for the supervisory board to make any decisions.
Instead, it will not be possible to quickly appoint new independent members of the supervisory board, since the law provides for the need to conduct a competitive selection, which on average lasts 3-4 months.
Therefore, the decision proposed by draft law 7176 will probably not be able to prevent the supervisory board from losing the ability to make a decision, but rather will lead to this!
The MP, the author of the bill Dmitry Natalukha provides other arguments in his support.
In particular, he notes: "Many enterprises, in particular the defense-industrial complex (DIP), now need relocation" and therefore "it is difficult to imagine that a person can, for example, from Vienna to Zoom to discuss addresses and other sensitive information".
To begin with, there are hardly any state enterprises of the OPC in Ukraine that have supervisory boards.
The Supervisory Board is except in "Ukroboronprom", which essentially manages almost all state enterprises of the OPC.
But even in Ukroboronprom, according to the legislation, the supervisory board has quite limited powers, and all its members perform their duties on a non-free basis.
The full power in Ukroboronomi belongs to the Director General, who will, by the way, decide on the need to relocate one or another OPC enterprise that is part of the group.
In addition, such an argument does not withstand criticism even because draft law 7176 does not make any changes to the legislation that regulates the activities of state enterprises of the PPP.
Mr. Dmitry on his Facebook page also cites arguments that can be attributed to the category of "emotional".
Such arguments, as a rule, have nothing to do with the improvement of the efficiency of state companies and state banks, but let's try to disassemble some of them: "reverent foreign experts at the first word "war", already in 2021 leave Ukraine, but at the same time remain in the members
First, this is manipulation – most of these supervisory board members have never lived in Ukraine and only come here periodically.
Therefore, to say that they "leave Ukraine", to put it mildly, is unfair.
Secondly, as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, both foreign and Ukrainian members of supervisory boards have long resorted to the practice of holding online meetings.
This tool has long been common in global practice, and in completely different areas: business, education, medicine, etc.
It should also be remembered that membership in the Supervisory Board is not a full-time job.
As a rule, such people have another occupation, and it is the means of electronic communication that help them in this.
Thirdly, all these statements are read as claims exclusively to foreigners.
I wonder why Mr. Dmytro does not make identical claims to members of the supervisory boards who are Ukrainians?
They are also not at the location of their companies.
By the way, this is not the first populist attempt by MPs to remove foreigners from supervisory boards, and war is just a new convenient opportunity.

We usually need the passport of one of the adults.
In Brovarsk, Vyshgorod and Buchan districts of Kyiv region, which were liberated from the occupiers, will introduce a reinforced commanding hour for 2 days.
Direct speech of Pavlyuk: "In the settlements of Brovar, Vyshgorod and Buchan districts, which were under Russian occupation and were liberated by Ukrainian defense forces, the commanding hour has been strengthened!
On the territory of these cities and villages, restrictions will apply from 21:00 April 2 to 06:00 April 5.
Details: According to the head of the region, at this time it is strictly forbidden to be on the streets of settlements and in other public places, to move by transport and on foot.
Residents can go out on the street only during an alarm to go into shelter.
Such restrictions are introduced in order to remove the consequences of Russian aggression – to clear and demine the territories.
Omelyanuk urged people who had left these areas to refrain from returning home.
In the rest of the Kyiv region, the commanding hour will last daily from 21:00 to 6:00.

The Serbian defense budget has grown in geometric progression for several years in a row.
In total, over the past six years, Serbia has invested more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2 billion in modernizing the army, upgrading military equipment and acquiring modern systems, rising to 22 places on the list of the world’s most powerful military powers.
After Russia’s full-scale aggression against Ukraine, Western countries took the prediction of a possible escalation in the Balkans quite seriously.
For Ukraine, this means that the diplomatic solution of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict is becoming complicated and globalized.

The forces of the Lukashenko regime detained three Belarusians 27 and 28 years, involved in the destruction of two relay cabinets of the signalling installation under Osipovichy, which ensures the movement of railway trains.
Source: Radio Freedom, Vyasna Human Rights Center, Chief of the Criminal Militia of the Ministry of Internal Affairs Gennady Kazakevich, quoted by BelTA State Information Agency
The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Belarus reported that on the night of March 30, three residents of Bobruisk were detained, one was injured, for the force support of special forces "SOBR".
According to "Spring", when detained, the men actively resisted and tried to escape.
The security forces used their weapons.
One of the detainees was injured and is in a medical facility.
Others received medical attention on the spot.
The head of the criminal police of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Belarus Gennady Kazakevich said that "acts of terrorism on the railway of the RB will be strictly stopped" by the security forces using weapons.
On April 6, it became known that on March 30, the police detained another employee of the Belarusian railway, an employee of the Baranovichi branch of "BZD" and an administrator of thematic resources "BZD" in "VKontakte" and "Odnoklassniki" Valentin Samasyuk.
Where he is now and in what state is unknown, reports <0x40>belzhd_live.
At the end of March, at least 40 railway workers were detained in Belarus for diversion.
The formation of BYpol, declared extremist by the Lukashenko regime, continues to call on Belarusians to carry out diversions on the facilities of railway transport and infrastructure of Belarus within the framework of the "Peramoga" plan.
The Belarusian “rejkov guerrillas” are thus trying to resist the Russian aggression against Ukraine.
As you know, through Belarus, the Russian Federation transfers to fight, to Ukraine, living force and equipment.
This is to raise self-esteem.
Do you like to read books?
And in the phone mode they don't work on Easter holidays either?
Is it possible to do this on the phone any day or not?
Even a separate law has been passed on this issue.
We have been here for 4 days, it's just a horror and not a road.
We went through the Kyiv region, the city of Irpin, then there was horror, shot, sirens.
I worry about them too.
Sylvia, Mashi hasn't received the funds yet from Kletsana, can I call them?
Yeah, I'll tell them, I think they'll be home.
There are different Muslims. There are fanatics, but there are true believers.
The meaning of jihad is interpreted differently by different Muslims.
But honestly, I'm very uncomfortable doing it for money.
You have done me a lot of good.
I can do it for free.
Temporarily for a period while we are looking for a university, then of course you will need permanent residence
but maybe it will have a dormitory. (look for Prague, Brno, and other places)
We are now a week away from Prague, we have a car, we are ready to pay part of the accommodation.
The city or village does not matter, it is desirable that it be a separate accommodation.
I ran into something in the waterphone and connected two unnecessary actions for which the money was withdrawn and I can not disable them <0xF0><0x9F><0x98><0xAD>
and also removed the money from the card, on which they were not
and I don't understand why the money was withdrawn
The cost of the repair is paid by the owner = Mr. Dedina. He should appear on Tuesday.
On Tuesday, stay at home and wait for the repairmen.
Would you like to order a cigarette?
Can we change the mobile tariff if you have time? Is it too late?
U.S. bans investments in Russia and imposes sanctions against Putin's daughters
The United States, along with the G7 and the EU, are introducing new sanctions against the daughters of Russian President Putin, the largest banks of the Russian Alpha Bank and Sberbank, as well as banning all new investments in Russia.
This is stated in a message on the website of the White House.
Sberbank is the largest government-owned financial institution in Russia, and Alfa-Bank is the largest private bank.
Sanctions will freeze any of their assets pertaining to the U.S. financial system and prohibit U.S. citizens from doing business with them.
In addition, the United States will introduce a complete ban on new investments in the Russian Federation.
To this end, U.S. President Joe Biden will sign a new decree that includes a ban on new investments in Russia by U.S. citizens regardless of their location.
“This move is based on the decision taken by more than 600 transnational companies to leave Russia.
The output of the private sector includes producers, energy companies, large retailers, financial institutions, as well as other service providers such as law firms and consulting firms,” the White House said in a statement.
The third step of the new sanctions from the United States was restrictions against large Russian state-owned enterprises in the critical sphere.
This will prohibit U.S. citizens from conducting operations with these organizations and freeze any of their assets in the jurisdiction of the United States.
A detailed list of the Ministry of Finance will be published on the next day on Thursday.
And the last part of the package is the complete blocking of assets of Putin's adult children, the wife and daughter of Foreign Minister Lavrov, as well as members of the Security Council of Russia, including the former president and Prime Minister of Russia Dmitry Medvedev and Prime Minister Mikhail
Sanctions disconnect them from the U.S. financial system and freeze all assets they have in the United States.
You can only get to this place, then the drive is closed and I will come to you
Faith, can we wash the dishes in the car?
My name is Olga, before the war I worked as a flight attendant at SkyAp, my mother is a seamstress of industrial products, my son Makarchyk went to the nursery.
We lived beautifully, but we did not even think that we would be forced to flee, because there is no longer any strength to hide in the grave.
I was lucky and found a job in Prague, Czech Republic.
Therefore, we hope that at the first time someone will host us) We can even pay for a room or apartment, but if it will be in our pocket.
Cleanliness and order are guaranteed.
We don’t have bad habits.
We will be grateful for such help at such a difficult time for us.
I had one English lesson after lunch, and after that I went to work in the nursery.
I explained to Margarita how to fill out all the documents.
I hope she understands everything and will do it well.
And I also met Mrs. Lena and talked to her about swimming for Ukrainian children.
She brought an announcement from the pool.

Something came from you, I can't see what
I am also very sad.
I'll remind you of the invoice later.
Do you only have a father who speaks and understands Russian?
On what day does a colleague want to do house cleaning and how many houses have windows?
I'm ashamed to distract you from your business.
Good evening, I can't help but share with you. There is a witch from Mariupol for her son - alive and well.
I advise you to read Joe Dispens, he scientifically conducts research on the influence of external factors and the formation of new neurons of connections
Journalist of the TV channel "1+1" Natalia Nagorna published a video on the morning of April 12, which was handed over to her by the military 36th brigade of marines from Mariupol.
In it, the military says that they have no weapons left to take part in the battles, and a mountain of wounded.
They said that "the bill goes for hours."
Prior to this, on April 11, the 36th separate Marine Brigade, which participates in the defense of Mariupol, published an appeal to Ukrainians in Russian.
The statement said that April 11 could be the last battle for the defenders of Mariupol, and the Ukrainian military command did not contact the fighters for two weeks.
In social networks expressed skepticism that the statement was published in Russian.
The Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Valery Zaluzhny assured that the command's relationship with the defense forces in Mariupol is, and the details of the defense operation should not be the subject of public discussion.
The Russians threatened to block Ukrainian fighters at the Azovstal plant in Mariupol and to use chemical weapons against them.
On the evening of April 11, Russian invaders threw a poisonous substance of unknown origin on Mariupol.
As reported by the leader of "Azov" Andriy Biletsky, the Russian army used chemical weapons over the plant "Azovstal", which is held by the fighters of the regiment "Azov".
Thank you, I will adapt to you. It would be very good
The situation is the same as long as we stay here.
2 hours drive ))) walks, mom goes shopping and back)!
That's not important.
She forgot what she was going to do here.
Squadron of Czech drones from today began flights over Ukraine<0xF0><0x9F><0x87><0xBA><0xF0><0x9F><0x87><0xA6>.
Nearly 50 professional copters will be used for detection, and some of them - for the direct destruction of the enemy invader.
Two Transcarpathian and two Czech brothers "birds" sent to Ukraine just before yesterday thanks to the deputy of the Mukachevo city council Vladimir Labutenk.
Today, because their inter-mountain friends headed by the head of the settlement council and the coordinator https://www.facebook.com/examplehere101/ Vasyl Rat delivered drones to their destination: they were received by special units of Ukrainian troops in different cities, where they are currently three.
In order to make the most efficient and safe use of kopters - the locations of their deployment will now be kept a secret.
Four friends who help the Ukrainian army from the Czech Republic on the done do not plan to stop, say: in the coming days to Ukraine will send many more interesting "gifts", which will serve the destruction of the Russian occupant and the preservation of the lives of Ukrainians.
Don't worry, it's okay. I love sweet, but I can do without it
I'm worried we won't have time. A lot of luggage.
I’ll be back soon to work.
Okay. If all goes well, I'll agree
I'll try it myself, but if there's a problem I'll write to you if I can?
The main thing is to understand each other.
We were personally in the old lady in the village of Job,she saw me and that I am pregnant but said that there is no housing
Maybe she will be happy and her mood will rise
I got my phone repaired today.
I think I’m freezing out on the street today.
I drank medicine and tea, I feel worse, but not critical.
I'm also sorry, but I'd better see you when I'm healthy.
When you have time, throw me the music you like.
I wonder what kind of music you have <0xF0><0x9F><0x98><0x8A>
Mom and Dad need to listen.
You'll find it somewhere near your little brother's stroller.
Today it was cooler and rainy. Tomorrow should be warm.
But it is not a pity the destroyed houses, it is a pity the people who are being abused by the occupiers
In Kherson, the occupiers mocked from the memorial "Glory to Ukraine" in Kherson on Perekopskaya street.
Details: It is noted that unknowns tore the flag of the European Union, shattered the panels with photos of the Celestial Hundred and those killed in the Russian-Ukrainian war.
The occupants tore the portraits of the heroes of the Heavenly Hundred and the dead participants of the Russian-Ukrainian war.
They lifted the flag.
Good morning, thank you to the children for Christmas, we do not have such a habit so we did not know, gave the children only chocolate and cookies, maybe something else needed to be given
There’s someone to talk to, if anything.
'Cause I live kind of in a dorm room. There's gonna be people here at twelve, and then they're going to work.
Hello is a little better.
I was in the crib today.
I slept there today.
That is why we have already made great progress.
I’m sure I’ll bring the steaks with me another time!
Today I don’t have the power to do it.
Since I am pushed away from the days and times in which there is work on cleaning apartments after guests, I can say about April month because I already have an approximate schedule for cleaning apartments.
In May a month - I can say about at the end of April or at the beginning of May.
I was just asking if you had anything to say about it.
Hi, sorry that for a long time did not write off cooking dinner and a little slept
If you don't mind, could I come today?)
or we will meet you after your arrival)
He is modest with us, has been learning a lot lately. Realized that it is very necessary for him in life
Hi, everything went very well.
I was a little shocked to be working with people in such a high position.
Today I had a lesson from a lady who is the director of the Department of Highland Economy.
She was very pleased with my work.
I was wrong in the nursery behaving well.
On Monday I have to bring confirmation of employment as well as cash payment for the nursery.
I've been lazy since Friday.
I don’t do much to them and I just sleep <0xF0><0x9F><0x98><0x82> (and I drink a lot of water <0xE2><0x98><0x9D><0xF0><0x9F><0x8F><0xBB>)
If you go to the doctor tomorrow, I will go with you.
I need to get another analysis.
So you don’t have to go again.
Very poorly works the drain tank, badly washes. You need a master. You need to fix.
That's all there is.
Can you send me the correct email address?
I want to send you an invitation to the Czech language course for which you have enrolled.
Do they feed their children or should they be brought with them?
And now for a minute you can come in there is one question
If you still need help, write
If I'm not mistaken, you're celebrating Easter today, right?
We didn’t really want you to raise money from the start so people wouldn’t think we were speculating on it!
But for online filling, I didn’t have two points:
I will go to bed to rest. Gain strength and energy. Thank you for today's gift. Good night
<0xF0><0x9F><0x98><0x84><0xF0><0x9F><0x98><0x8D>What a great idea. Now I will watch the video. It will be good, because the whole family will draw.
Karazin University urges employees and students to carefully check any information, not to trust anonymous sources in messengers and social networks, rumors and gossip.
Focus only on the official information.
so you can count on me, thank you!
My other brother, who stayed in Ukraine, also helps the army
I've collected a few works for the portfolio.
After the holidays, the Internet should be held.
I would like to be your backup designer.
When I get credited for the day I was not at work there is a pass
Headquarters: Russia prepares a provocation in Transnistria to blame Ukraine
The Russian army may resort to provocations in the Transnistrian region of Moldova to accuse Ukraine of “aggression against a neighboring state”.
Literally: "It is not excluded that the armed forces of the Russian Federation carry out provocative actions on the territory of the Transnistrian region of the Republic of Moldova with the aim of accusing Ukraine of aggression against the neighboring state."
Details: The opponent continues to create an offensive grouping of troops for action in the Slobozansky direction.
Probably, in the coming days, the occupiers will try to rebuild the offensive.
In addition, the enemy continues to prepare and send personnel, weapons and equipment to participate in hostilities on the territory of Ukraine.
Preparation of weapons and military equipment is being carried out at the permanent deployment point of the 60th Separate Motor Rifle Brigade (Monastery) of the 5th General Army of the Eastern Military District.
Probably, this weapon will be moved to the temporarily occupied territory of the Donetsk region.
Also for the recovery of losses of personnel units of the battalion tactical group of the 36th separate motorized rifle brigade (Borya, Zabaykalsky Krai) 29 general army of the Eastern military district, a military recruitment is carried out.
A special problem of the enemy is felt when filling the positions of drivers and mechanics-driver.
The departure of the selected personnel from the permanent deployment point is scheduled for the second half of April this year.
It is likely that the enemy, in order to disrupt the supply of cargo to the places of hostilities, will continue strikes on transport infrastructure objects on the territory of Ukraine with the aim of destroying them or rendering them inoperative.
Certain units of the armed forces of the Republic of Belarus continue to perform tasks of strengthening the protection of the Ukrainian-Belarusian border in the Brest and Gomel regions.
In the Slobozhansky direction, separate units of the 6th General Army and coastal forces of the northern fleet continue the partial blockade of the city of Kharkiv, artillery shelling of individual areas of the city continues.
Air reconnaissance of the area in the direction of Izyum is ongoing in order to identify the positions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.
For this purpose, the enemy uses the UAV "Orlan-10".
Forces to two battalion tactical groups of enemies tried to carry out an offensive in the direction of the settlements Dovgenke and Dmitryvka, was unsuccessful and left for previously occupied positions.
In the direction of Donetsk, the enemy's main efforts continue to focus on seizing the settlements of Popasna, Rubizhne, Nizhny and Novobakhmutivka, as well as establishing full control over the city of Mariupol.
The enemy tried to carry out assault actions in the Golden area, was unsuccessful.
In the city of Mariupol, with the help of artillery and aviation, the occupiers continue their assault operations in the areas of the Azovstal plant and the seaport.
Forces of individual units of the enemy carried out artillery shelling of the positions of the Ukrainian troops in the areas of the settlements of Vysokopilya, Trudolyubivka and Marianske.
On the territory of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, the defenders of Ukraine over the past day repelled four attacks of the enemy, destroyed five tanks, eight units of armored vehicles, six units of automotive equipment and eight artillery systems of the enemy.
Didn't understand your thoughts?
We will certainly try to make it, but I doubt it.
You want to sleep, and I'll hold you.
You sure you don't mind me coming?
Maybe you just don't want to see me today, so tell me I'll understand)
Thank you. We did not watch TV at home and even more 1+1. We do not need to customize :)
I turn on the TV here only in order to listen to the Czech language
I have a month-to-month plan today. :)
Can we do this over the phone today?
Buy embroidery fabric, canvas, embroidery thread
I understand, I can prepare the material in this area.
I'll ask her. I'm a little embarrassed to ask, she gives us so many cakes.
We’ll meet my dad later, of course <0xF0><0x9F><0x99><0x8F><0xF0><0x9F><0x8F><0xBB>
I read the ad on Facebook , that Google probably wrote something on its own <0xF0><0x9F><0x8F><0xB5><0xEF><0xB8><0x8F>. , I think the phone numbers are enough
Hello, we have the things that you brought, but there are things that you can bring to us small in 10 minutes?
I thought about the job.
If the Director agrees, I can start going to work from next week because tomorrow by noon I plan to go to the work office to submit documents (if it happens, because the queues are very large) and on Saturday it rains :)
I was looking for a team at the beginning, I liked chemistry very much in school, I study Czech to know perfectly, I dream of working for Tevi
Friends are long and not very, friends with whom I am not familiar personally, friends in spirit and mind.
Now you too have a hard time.
Over the past month, I’ve spoken to many of you.
Your life, which has never been easy, has turned from head to toe, just like the life of every Ukrainian.
Many of you are fleeing Russia.
And many of you have confessed to feeling guilt and shame over your country’s actions towards your neighbors.
That's why they're putting Ukraine on your behalf.
Some of you activists have long been threatened, and you are preparing for a decisive blow.
At the beginning of March I wrote to Alexander Cherkasov, my very old friend from "Memorial".
Let’s talk a little later, as usual, Sasha replied laconically. – Now after the search we walk through the ruins.
Others – culture actors, artists, critics, writers – are impressed by the sudden collapse of your fragile world.
None of you like Putin and his regime of thieves and fascists, most of you hate them.
But let’s be frank: with the exception of very few of you – those who worked in the Memorial, in the Novaya Gazeta, in the Echo of Moscow, in the Medusa, in the Navalny organization and in a number of other places – did many of you at least do something to oppose this regime?
Except for taking part in rallies when they were still taking place.
Read also the column of the Russian journalist "Too late to hide, too late to be silent"
And if so, are you sure that your sense of shame and guilt is not just an abstraction?
Perhaps they are caused by your long-standing indifference to what’s going on around you, your apathy, and your passive complicity, which is probably now a great burden on your soul and heart?
This was not always the case.
In the 1990s there was a short period when you had to some extent freedom and democracy – a mess, even a bloody one, but a real one.
But 1991 was no better than 1917.
Why is it that every time you finally have a revolution, you are finally so terrified of turmoil that you seek salvation behind the back of the king, whether his name is Stalin or Putin?
No matter how many people he kills, you still think he's safer. Why?
In fact, mistakes were made.
Instead of capturing and publishing the KGB archives, as the Germans did from the stasis, you took the soul to the Dzerzhinsky monument – and allowed the KGB to sink to the bottom, renew, reform and seize power over the country.
When you were put before the choice between plundering the country and returning the communists, you did not fight for the possibility of a third option – and humbly accepted the plunder.
In 1998, your economy collapsed, and this marked the end of mass rallies for great social justice or against the war in Chechnya.
The main concern was survival.
Then came Putin. Young, entrepreneurial, aggressive, he promised to deal with terrorists and boost the economy.
Few of you bought it, but you either voted for it anyway, or preferred not to vote at all.
When he again began to level Chechnya with the ground, most of you closed your eyes to it.
I remember those years very well.
I was working in Chechnya at the time, helping those affected by Putin’s “anti-terrorist operation”, and I saw with my own eyes the ruins of Grozny, Qatar-Yurta, Itum-Kali and other cities.
Sometimes on weekends I returned to Moscow and had fun hanging out with you, my friends.
We drank, we danced, and sometimes I tried to tell you about the horrors I witnessed: the torture of civilians, the killing of children, the soldier selling the bodies to their families.
You said to me, "Brede, we're tired of your Chechnya." I remember those words very well.
In response, I was angry: "Friends, this is not my Chechnya, this is your Chechnya.
This is your country, damn it, not mine.
I'm just a stupid foreigner here.
It’s your government bombing one of your cities, killing your fellow citizens.”
But no, it was all too difficult, too painful, and you didn’t want to know anything.
Then came the economic rise of the middle zeros, driven by rising oil prices and Putin’s willingness to look through his fingers at the fact that some of the stolen money will remain in the pockets of the middle class.
Many of you started to make a good living, some got rich, and even the poorest of you bought a new home and found a better job.
Prices have gone up, but is that a problem?
Moscow was festively shining and leafy from chic.
When several opposition leaders – Yuri Schekochikin, Anna Politkovskaya, Oleksandr Litvinenko and others – were killed, many of you were shocked and terrified of what was happening.
However, the matter did not go further.
When, after two terms, Putin transferred the post of President to Medvedev, and he took the place of Prime Minister, you, as I see, barely paid attention to it.
When, after a few months of Medvedev’s rule, Russia invaded Georgia, most of you either ignored it or remained silent.
How many of you have I met in the following years on the hillsides of Gudauri, in the foothills of Kazbegi or in the cafes and in the Turkish baths of Tbilisi, while part of this country was occupied by your army?
I have to admit that we in the West have hardly done much, if anything at all.
A little bit of outrage, a little bit of sanctions; but what does it matter that Russia is blatantly violating international law, when there is such a great temptation of Russian oil, gas and the domestic market?
Living in Russia was good.
And after the difficult 1990s, it was the most important.
However, at the end of 2011, you, my Russian friends, still woke up.
When Putin again swapped seats with Medvedev and took the presidential seat, as before, many of you decided it was too much and you went out to mass protest.
Navalny's name became nicknamed, you didn't walk out of the streets for half a year, and the regime finally felt with horror that it was losing ground under its feet.
After that, he struck back.
Initially, alternative actions were organized, then more repressive laws were passed, and prisons were filled with people.
Thousands were behind bars.
Some have been given huge deadlines.
"What could we have done?"
I’ve heard it so many times and I still hear it.
“The state is so strong and we are so weak.”
Well, look at the Ukrainians.
Look at what they did two years ago.
Angry by the pro-Russian president, who deceived their European hopes, they once seized Maidan – and never left it again.
They completely independently set up a tent town and prepared for a decisive defense.
When the police came and tried to destroy it, they began to defend themselves with the help of sticks, armor and Molotov cocktails.
Eventually, the police opened fire.
But instead of fleeing, the protesters turned to the attack.
Many died, but they were victorious.
Yanukovych became a fugitive, and Ukrainians regained their democracy, the right to independently elect leaders and expel them if they do their job badly.
Maidan did not like Putin very much.
That was a bad example.
Therefore, taking advantage of the general confusion, he captured Crimea.
Some of you have been against it, but there is little benefit to it.
How many of you were delighted!
As far as I know, 91% of Russian citizens supported the annexation.
Somewhere a new myth was suddenly born, and many of you who despised Putin and his gang suddenly returned to 180 degrees and began to worship him.
It’s hard for me to find a reason, because right after that we stopped communicating.
The rest of those who remained my friends were mostly silent.
“We’re not interested in politics,” he said.
And you hid the new in books, movies, IKEA catalogues and parks, just like new ones after the restoration that the mayor of Moscow started in 2012 – with their binge, public wifi and hipster cafes.
In fact, the Donbass is far away, and Moscow is so good – and it is only getting better.
You have barely paid attention to Syria.
There were terrorists, right?
ISIS or whatever... Even the Moscow editor, who published my book on Syria, criticized it in an interview at the time, because I didn’t really understand what was going on in Syria.
Well, at least I went there and I saw myself on the streets of Homs state snipers cold-bloodedly shooting at my children's peers.
Among all the citizens of Russia, there were only your soldiers, who in 2015 began bombing thousands of civilians, gaining experience for the next serious war.
Of course, many of you know the words of Pastor Martin Nimmeller:
“First they came for the socialists, but I kept quiet because I’m not a socialist.
Then they came for the union members, but I kept quiet because I am not a union member.
Then they came for the Jews, but I kept quiet because I was not a Jew.
Then they came for me, but there was no one left to say anything in my defense.”
How many of you have spoken about Chechens, Syrians or Ukrainians?
Some of you have done it.
But the vast majority remained silent.
Some really talk now – like, for example, Dmytro Glukhovsky, Mikhail Shishkin, Mikhail Zigar, Maxim Osipov and others.
Most allow themselves to speak from abroad, some – from the middle of the country, like Marina Ovsyannikova, risking getting into the new GULAG or forming a company Navalny.
As for others, you know best what country you live in.
Therefore, I am sure, you understand: when Putin deals with the Ukrainians – or, which seems very likely, if he fails to do so – he will take over for you.
For all of you, my friends: for those who bravely, but mostly alone, went out to protest and still took place for a short period of time, but will soon get more serious.
For thousands of you who signed petitions, who expressed disagreement on social networks (even if only a black square on Instagram) or expressed in private conversations with colleagues at work.
The times when 10 or even 25 years of imprisonment were given just for a joke weren’t that far in the past – and now they’re most likely waiting for you in the future.
Then who will stand up for you? Who will stand up for you?
The example of Ukrainians – even more than in 2014 – frightens the Putin regime: they prove that it can be fought against.
And that mind, motivation and courage can stop him, no matter how oppressive on paper his preference.
After all, few in Russia realize this, as does the fact that the war is going on in general.
But you, my friends, know very well what is happening now.
You read foreign news on the Internet, you have friends or even relatives in Ukraine with whom you maintain contact.
And Putin knows what you know.
So, be prepared.
You know what's going on.
A good life in exchange for your silence has come to an end.
Your choices are just hokma, your laws, if not the repressive ones, are worth no more than the paper on which they are written, your latest free media is no more, your economy is ruined faster than I write, you no longer have credit cards to even buy a ticket.
Now Putin will not be satisfied with your silence, he will require your consent, your humility.
And if you don’t give him what he wants, you can either try to go somewhere or you’ll be crushed.
I doubt you see any other option.
And yet there is one more.
Which will ultimately bring down this regime.
And, perhaps, under the circumstances that have arisen, you will be required less than you think.
Think about it.
The spark will not flash from you: due to the economic collapse that is imminent in Russia, it is most likely to burn in the province, in small towns.
When prices go up and wages are not paid, those people who voted for Putin all these years because they wanted bread and peace will go out on the streets.
Putin knows this and fears these people much more than he fears the intellectuals and middle class of Moscow and St. Petersburg, that is, you, my friends.
But if each city goes to rallies on its own, as it has already happened periodically, it will not be difficult to suppress them alone.
Organization and coordination will be necessary. The crowd will need to be transformed into a mass.
You have this wonderful magic tool – the Internet, which mode can limit, but which still works and which can be set up in almost any circumstance.
Navalny’s organization was defeated, but you can create others, more informal, more decentralized.
You are many, you are millions.
The Moscow police can cope with 30,000 people on the streets of the city, perhaps a hundred thousand.
If more than 300,000 come out, she will be stunned.
We will have to use the army, but will this army fight for Putin when it comes to the matter?
After all that he forced them to do in Ukraine, all that he forced them to go through?
Of course, the danger will be very great.
Many of you will feel understandable fear; those who have children will be afraid for them.
And it's natural, it's normal.
I’d be scared if I were you.
On the example of Syria, and now Ukraine, Putin wanted to show you what is happening to those who dare to neglect their master, who dare not only to demand freedom, but really is trying to get it.
But even if you do nothing, the lives of many people will still be lost in vain.
Your son will make a joke in a computer game chat – and he will be arrested; your daughter will express outrage online – and he will be arrested; your close friend will make a mistake – and he will die in a ragged cell under police whistleblowers.
This is what has been happening for many years – and will only continue to increase, becoming larger and larger.
So you don't have a choice. If you don't do anything, you know how it will end.
Act cold-blooded, think strategically and make it a reality.
We were in class on Friday, we were told we could come on Monday.
We will be home in the evening.
