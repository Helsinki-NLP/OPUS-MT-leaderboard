Triumph of right-wing populists in Austria, they have 29 percent in total
According to preliminary results, the early parliamentary elections in Austria brought a significant weakening of the two parties forming the current great coalition, as well as a notorious strengthening of populist parties.
The Austrian People's Party (<0xC3><0x96>VP), where the position of current President Wilhelm Molterer is seriously threatened, suffered particularly significant losses.
On the other hand, the electoral leader of the Union for the Future of Austria (BZ<0xC3><0x96>), the governor of Carinthia Jörg Haider, is preparing a triumphant return to the political scene at the national level.
According to preliminary results, the Socialists (SP<0xC3><0x96>) remain, with 29.8 percent of the votes, the country's first political force, however, compared with the 2006 elections, they lost 5.5 percent of the votes.
The <0xC3><0x96>VP, which with 25.6 percent loses nearly nine percent of the votes, ended up even worse.
These are the worst results of the two major postwar parties; especially for the popular party, which triggered the early elections, the result is literally catastrophic.
Back in early July, when the <0xC3><0x96>VP left the coalition, the Popular Party had a considerable lead over the SP<0xC3><0x96>.
Now, voters visibly punished them for letting the government collapse.
From the first reactions to the results, speculation about the possible resignation of the leader of the party and the current deputy chancellor Wilhelm Molterer, was pronounced.
Observers believe that this could happen as early as Monday, during the extraordinary council of the party leadership.
Such a development would a priori facilitate the way to the outcome of the election which remains the most likely, namely the renewal of the great coalition of SP<0xC3><0x96> and <0xC3><0x96>VP.
Nonetheless, given the strengthening of the two right-wing populist parties - the free parties (FP<0xC3><0x96>) would have obtained 18 percent and BZ<0xC3><0x96> eleven percent of the votes - the socialists at the same time expressed the fear of a repeat of 1999, when the popular party agreed with the populists (at the time, the FP<0xC3><0x96> was still part of the unified government, it was in 2005 that the BZ<0xC3><0x96> unified.
Haider, who has already stated that he is ready to collaborate with any party and that he is planning to return to Vienna, on the national political scene, apparently focusing on this development.
The last party to have access to parliament was the Greens, but they lost slightly and fell, among Austrian political parties, from third to fifth place.
Clearly, no other party crossed the 4% threshold and did not enter parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India may cool down
If the problem of Czech researchers accused of illegally collecting cockroaches in India could not be resolved, Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg said, there would be some cooling of Czech-Indian relations.
The minister announced this today in New York, after meeting his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherjee.
"If the problem was not solved, then yes, some cooling would occur," he said after the meeting, which was carried out following a Czech initiative.
Mukherjee said, leaving the talks, that the executive could hardly intervene in judicial cases.
He mentioned, however, that in the case of Petr <0xC5><0xA0>vácha, who was acquitted and fined, the central government could negotiate with the local government, that of the Darjeling, the case being placed under the jurisdiction of the latter.
"His problem could be solved," the minister said.
According to Mukherjee, the best solution for Emil Ku<0xC4><0x8D>era, sentenced to three years in prison, would be to appeal to a higher court.
Hence, he could apply for bail and await trial on bail, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner also spoke in the same direction during the talks.
"He advises to appeal to a higher court, after which he could be pardoned," said the head of the Czech diplomacy.
The only way the Czech side can intervene in this case is to provide the convicts with "competent legal support," the Indian minister said.
He also said that such assistance had already been provided to them also by India.
“Above all, we want to keep the best relations with India, which have a tradition that continues for many years.
The Indians also recognize it," Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as he told <0xC4><0x8C>TK, he pointed out to his partner that the Czech Republic attached great importance to the problem of Czech entomologies.
"We regard the incarceration and indictment of these Czech researchers as a great contempt," he said.
The minister circumvented the question of whether he had received from India a promise to deal with the matter.
"I've already received quite a lot of promises," he said.
A Czech arbitrator fights for the seabed
It approaches a wall electronic map, on which Australia and adjacent marine areas are represented.
Now, he is not interested in the continent, but in a little lost spot in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia, as does the adjacent seabed.
Yet this area is as big as the continent itself," said Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of the team of thirty members of the UN Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea.
Its head, the director of the division, the Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, follows the presentation and completes it from time to time.
Ardor at work and enthusiasm characterize the prevailing atmosphere.
The seabed hides a world so far little known, rich in natural resources.
Oil, minerals and other mineral resources can be found there, but also living organisms currently unknown, which may contain the key to the development of a cancer drug.
A wider background than the solid earth
Today, coastal states have begun to aspire vehemently to new underwater territories.
According to a UN convention, they are indeed exercising their rights, which they agreed on in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
This is mainly the area of the so-called continental shelf, which often extends several hundred kilometers from the coast of the given country.
According to the convention, the latter can claim exclusively all the resources of the continental shelf.
To simplify, the continental shelf is considered the part of the seabed and its subsoil, which constitutes a natural extension of the continent under the sea.
It extends beyond the borders of the coastal sea, often also beyond the two hundred nautical miles that represent the exclusive economic yone," explains Mikulka.
The request that the country in question submits to the Commission for the establishment of the outer borders of the continental shelf must be supported by extensive scientific and technical documentation, based on many costly surveys and metrics.
It is the result of several years of preparatory work.
"One of our roles is to provide the commission with legal and scientific-technical assistance.
To date, the Commission has dealt with five requests, including those from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
At the moment, only the last three countries mentioned have been successful," adds Mikulka.
Australia's success, which is the first to have significantly expanded its underwater possessions, has recently experienced a global impact.
New Zealand, too, has gained territory - the extent of the seabed, which was assigned to it by the commission last week, corresponds to 1.6 million square kilometers, which is the extent of the country multiplied by six.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in prospecting.
The benefits they will derive from the future exploitation of the seabed will, as they project, be invaluable.
Gradually, other countries will, in turn, submit their request.
They can do so within ten years of ratifying the Montego Bay Convention.
There, where the continental shelf ends, begins the area of the ocean floor, proclaimed by convention "common heritage of humanity".
There is no longer any state that enjoys an exclusive position.
The right of extraction in this area is granted by an international institution established by convention.
"However, let us not be mistaken, the seabed is not a Klondike," said Director Mikulka, adding that "its areas are clearly defined and their regime is anchored in a contract."
Czechs in the Pacific
A part of the seabed is now also owned by the Czech Republic.
It shares it with other former Eastern bloc states within the framework of the joint organization "Interoceanmetal".
In 1991, under the Convention, as well as investors from a few other States, it obtained the status of a so-called "pioneer investor".
It has the right of extraction in the ClarionClipperton area in the Pacific Ocean, located between Mexico, the Hawaiian Islands and Kiribati.
The area prospected by the investor slightly exceeds the area of the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom is agitated, it is a kind of underwater replica of the Tatra.
"It is possible to extract on an area with a total area of 75,000 square kilometers.
The area represents a polymetallic concrete deposit rich in nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," says Ind Pakshi Rajan, another lawyer.
Rober Sandev, a Macedonian employee of the division, provides an example of such concreteness.
It resembles a small potato, or, with a little imagination, the mythical shoem, which, according to legend, animated the Golem.
The German Special Forces were on the scene for the release of the hostages.
The Egyptian government had sought help from Germany to resolve the hostage crisis - experts have come.
When the situation became serious, the special units stood ready, but they never took action.
More and more details on the circumstances of the release of eleven European tourists abducted in Egypt are revealed.
According to the instructions of the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Defence, the German special forces also indirectly participated in the rescue operation.
As a result, both federal army specialists and GSG 9 officials, the Federal Police Air Squadron and the Federal Criminal Police Office, as well as logistics experts from the Technische Hilfwerk, were on the scene of the release.
As the ministry spokesman said on Monday evening, German forces were finally not required, with the hostages freeing their prisoners and fleeing when they acknowledged the imminent release by force.
The Egyptian government allegedly accepted Germany's assistance to integrate it on the spot as a support force.
"Fortunately, this has not happened so far," a spokesman for the Federal Ministry of the Interior said.
The attackers had kidnapped a group of tourists in southern Egypt consisting of five Germans, five Italians, one Romanian and their eight Egyptian escorts.
After their abduction in the desert in southern Egypt, the hostages were transferred to the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the hostage takers has so far remained vague, as have the details of the release or possible ransom payments.
Those who have been rescued have in the meantime arrived safe and sound in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the hostages were under the protection of the German embassy.
He didn't say anything about the details of the release.
In Berlin at the moment, no information was given on the date of their return to Germany.
According to Bild magazine, the five vacationers and special forces are expected to take off aboard an Air Force Airbus and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
U.S. House of Representatives Rejects Rescue Plan
The first U.S. House of Representatives recently failed the $700 billion financial market rescue plan.
The Dow Jones crashed into the abyss.
With 227 votes to 206, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected the bailout plan in favor of the government’s financial markets.
Despite all the calls from U.S. President George W. Bush and politicians at the head of both parties, the program that was supposed to wreak havoc on the financial markets did not win the majority.
In a dramatic maneuver, the partisans had desperately tried to convince opponents of the well-founded $700 billion plan.
Barney Frank, one of the Democratic representatives during the debates, had called for a vote in favour, although the plan was unpopular.
"It's hard to have political recognition for avoiding something that hasn't happened yet," he said.
During the vote again, the Dow Jones fell by more than six percent or 600 points.
The reason for this was investor concern that the state bailout plan could captivate.
It came back shortly before the end of the vote, and then, after the announcement of the failure, fell again.
Experts are now projecting serious new turbulence on international financial markets.
In order for the program to come into force, approval and from the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate are required.
Organizers report increasing number of bookings
This should be a good winter for German travel agencies:
In terms of bookings for the coming months, according to a study, turnover has increased significantly compared to the previous year - for the winter season, even by more than 30 percent.
Despite the weak economic outlook, the Germans’ travel thirst remains insatiable, according to this study.
As for bookings for the winter season, travel agencies recorded sales of more than 31 percent compared to the same period the previous year, as entrusted to Berlin on Monday by the German Federation of Travel Agencies (DRV).
According to the survey of the GfK Market Research Institute, increasing numbers of bookings already dominate the autumn months.
Thus, the sales figure would have climbed to about 11 percent more than in 2007, the DRV said.
The sources of these results are figures from the GfK, which analyses booking data from 1,200 travel agencies monthly and makes estimates for the global market.
Travel bookings made since the end of August 2008 would be recorded there.
Due to the low dollar exchange rate, travel to the US would be particularly in demand, the DRV said.
There, the increase in bookings would amount to about one-third.
In addition to this, Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as our country, would be destinations particularly sought after by the Germans.
Particularly organized trips are in high demand, explained DRV President Klaus Laepple.
In view of rising energy and food prices, the costs here would be "easier for the customer to calculate than for an individually organized trip".
Consumers can save money, among other things, with early booking discounts or All Inclusive offers, Laepple explained.
The summer months have also been very successful so that an increase in sales figures will again be recorded compared to last year - although according to another study, the number of Germans who have undertaken a trip has fallen compared to the previous year.
My first time at the Beer Festival
The hits of Ballermann or Apres-Ski continuously, from beer in jars to liters and celebrities in Tyrolean designer costumes.
An event at the beer party.
Suzanne Kronzucker and I don't really have much in common.
She is a blonde, television presenter and wears a tailor-made Tyrolean costume.
I have dark hair, I'm a student and my dress is used.
But one thing connects us: just three minutes to the beer party, and already the photographers throw themselves at us and fill their memory card - very flattering, and this on my first visit to the beer party.
That's how we make friends.
The cheap Tyrolean costume seems to reach its goal.
As a beer party tourist and normally living north of the Weißwurst equator, my sense of well-being in the traditional costume was so far limited.
But once on Place Thérèse, everything is half as bad.
Everyone or almost everyone wears a Tyrolean suit or leather pants; no one looks blushed or embarrassed - this is completely normal.
Only the apron of my Tyrolean suit picks up a few weird eyelashes at the banana-choco stand.
A Bavarian woman tells me that I would have wrongly tied my apron: "to the left means free, to the middle virgin, to the right married, to the back widow."
Discreetly, I tripatoull my loop from the back to the left.
"It's better," she said and laughed.
Others don't get as bad at these subtle flirting techniques and wear simple felts, on which is written "Too drunk to get dressed!" and exposes their nude rear train without being invited.
The young man with the exhibitionist attitude is named Bob, comes from England and comes for the first at the beer party.
He finds it "gorgeous", with a "ooooo" stretched out.
He told me all of this after he had relieved himself of the cup he had drunk before.
Right next to that fire mouth that everyone thinks is a trash can.
So Bob is one of those infamous "wild pissers."
Others are not lucky to be able to get rid of alcohol in this way.
Around eight o'clock in the evening, rescuers rush to the party square and have to take care of the poor drinkers.
The nurses intervene rather in a mob - always by four, they drag their cage covered with tents in tents.
This is how it works for most visitors to the beer party: we go empty, we come back full.
Those who rest in the coffin of the drunken under the tarpaulin are not visible.
“These are the ones who can’t swallow anything anymore,” one of the rescuers shouts in response to my question and then disappears into the mess.
Accident Victim Identified by Police
A 63-year-old pedestrian, who died in hospital after being hit by a vehicle, was identified.
Carole Paulson, from Chelmsford Road to Brentwood, was involved in the Friday afternoon accident in the city on Shenfield Road.
She was taken to Queen's Hospital, Romford, but died there.
After the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of dangerous driving.
He has since been released on bail.
Turkey is expanding its diplomatic horizons.
Long before Turkey thought of joining the European Union, the European powers were eager to penetrate its hinterland.
On the east side of the Bosphorus, 20 steps may be, from Asia, lies one of the finest relics of its fallen imperial ambition.
Hydarpasha railway station was designed in a neo-Renaissance style by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu.
At least that’s what the guides tell us.
The monument is arranged on horseback at the bottom of the platforms, equipped with observation towers at each of its angles, like some German provincial town halls.
The stones are dirty.
The whole building is in ruins.
But once inside the vaulted ticket office, we no longer have any doubts about the size of the company, which represents a passage to the west.
The station was inaugurated in August 1908 by a German association, the Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Lagging behind in the game of imperialism, Germany wanted to realize its medieval ambitions of domination thanks to this railway that reaches Damascus, Baghdad as well as the most famous land known as Saudi Arabia.
But German imperialist ambitions collapsed during the First World War.
Its railways were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his Arab irregulars.
The relative isolation of its surrounding region, engendered by the icy borders of the Cold War, is over.
. The British and Empire forces advanced beyond Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
But there was also bad news for Hyderpasha station.
In 1917, a train loaded with ammunition exploded destroying its subtle roof.
According to Turkish sources, this was sabotage.
Since then, it has slowly fallen into ruin, engulfed in the meanders of history.
But today, the railway crossing to Anatolia and all the eastern points serves, at least symbolically, to underline Turkey's widening diplomatic horizons.
The ruling Justice and Development party, the AKP, has created a new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of its surrounding region, caused by the icy borders of the Cold War
Now is the time for a new policy of commitments.
The Turkish government has remarkable relations with Israel and Syria, the Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah, Iran and Iraq, and of course with the European Union and the United States.
To judge the parameters of this new foreign policy, I boarded a bedding wagon towards the Turkish capital, Ankara, to visit Turkish AKP MP Suat Kiniklioglu, one of the foreign policy experts.
The next morning, after a 10-and-a-half-hour journey, shaking on noisy rails whose cadence reminded the old world of the famous documentary The Night Mail, I finally arrived in the Turkish capital – presented as a new city of a new secular state, turning my back on its German past.
But the AKP with its well-known Islamist roots is an example of changing the Turkish consensus.
He suspected the West, and especially Washington.
A taxi accompanied me to the AKP headquarters, an ultra-modern structure, expressly built of stones and steel, in a developing district, surrounded by half-built shopping centers and many pastry shops in which the middle managers in suit-tie-men and women- meet for business in the morning.
Suat Kiniklioglu could have been a centre-right politician from any other party in Europe.
Costume, tie and he even has a Black Berry.
"The purpose of this foreign policy is now to reintegrate Turkey into its immediate neighbourhood.
The Cold War was an anomaly,” he said.
Turkey has been cut off from its back country.
Now she must look east and west at the same time.
This was not the case for both of them.
She had to do both.
“But at some point, I asked if ‘Turkey shouldn’t choose’.
"Turkey," he said, "doesn't want to have to choose between the two."
He then pointed out an aspect that almost everyone I was able to talk to has recited to me from the heart: the Turkish railway not only goes to the Middle East, but also to the Caucasus, and around the Black Sea, so it is as much an advantage for Europe and the United States as for Turkey itself.
With the integration of Turkey, the message seems to draw a Europe traveling metaphorically on the rails towards Asia and the Middle East.
Back at Hydarpasha station, after another night without sleep, I thought back to those two Germans, Herr Ritter and Herr Conu, who followed the construction of this building 100 years ago.
They would have been surprised to see that the European ambitions of the Middle East could, in large part, be in the hands of Turkey.
As I waited at the terminal, the ferry to cross the Bosphorus, I remembered the period when Turkey was called "the sick man of Europe".
At least, there is no longer any doubt on the continent that could claim this fascinating country.
Memoirs of Vernon Handley and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown writes: Music director at Guildford since 1962, Vermon "Tod" Handley (died September 11) was responsible for the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir.
Already part of his musical project for the city, he founded the next year, the fantastic youth choir, Proteus.
The choir was supposed to include those under the age of 21, but before Proteus could sing his last song in 1979, many of us who were over 20 refused to quit the choir.
The name "Proteus" (which changed shape according to mythology) represented the will and ability of the choir to handle any type of music presented to him, whether it was madrigal or messianic.
The musical versatility produced by such a young choir was often impressive, always exciting, thanks to the inspiration of a single man, and his enthusiasm for music, which remained constant over the years.
Remember how much Tod told us to "let the music speak for itself."
He would have said, "The composer knows what he wants."
Everything is there, in the music.
So sing!"
His stick technique was absolutely clear, precise, even if never dictatorial or appearing.
Whatever the musical standard, it raised it much higher.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If a driver was to be knighted, it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well during the decade from 1962 to 1982, when he was driving the Guildford Philharmonic.
Over the past 40 years, I’ve seen more than a hundred of his concerts, and I can honestly say that none of them ever disappointed me—and sometimes they even inspired me.
Tod Handley possessed such a rare combination of greatness and personal modesty.
He hated drivers who, according to him, “focus only on certain people.”
Many of us will miss him.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
Your obituary of William Woodruff (died 25 September) states that "in 1946 he resumed his studies in economic history at Oxford, and in 1950 became a member of Houblon-Norma research, while doing a BSc, an MA and a PhD."
That's what comes from Woodruff's letter in Beyond Nab End, but that's not correct.
From 1946 to 1953 he was Professor of Economic History at the University of Nottingham, and at the same time completed a PhD thesis on the British plastics industry, under the supervision of Professor J.D. Chambers; it was then published in 1958 under the title The British Rubber Industry.
In the 1950s and 51s in the United States, he studied at the Norman Houblon, and in the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard, and New York.
In 1953, he left Nottingham for Illinois.
The reason why Woodruff chose to conceal this part of his past remains unknown.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Philosophy
"I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resino " Flamenco and Life " because his photographs in black and white, a documentary style, are fantastic.
They have attracted my attention because of their simplicity and the strength they transmit and because they always treat the protagonists with great respect.
An exhibition that conveys a lot of feelings.
Resino knows how to capture magical moments.”
Second Assault for Honda Super Sales
In November, Honda will begin the commercialization of the second generation of the Jazz model.
If its predecessor already had a good habitability, this new minivan has an even wider interior space.
In addition to this, there are some refined mechanics, which increase driving comfort and save more gasoline.
An evolution in the face of a revolution.
This is the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although aesthetically the new Honda Jazz has a line very similar to the previous model, the changes introduced in this minivan are numerous.
Among them, there is an innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new engines.
However, before examining the new model, it should be noted that this new Honda Jazz comes six years after the first generation was launched.
First of all, it is noted that Honda renewed this model in a shorter time than that of other manufacturers.
Although in Europe, the Honda Jazz is less known, this model is a phenomenon of sales in other markets.
This is the case in Japan, where the Honda Jazz was the most marketed car in 2002 and also in 2008.
In Japan, almost one million Honda Jazz has been sold since its launch.
The Old Continent, with more or less one million cars sold in six years, ranks second.
However, Honda claims that this new Jazz will allow it to increase its sales in Europe.
Thus, while in 2007 the Japanese brand sold 83,000 Honda Jazz, in 2009 it plans to sell 100,000, which would represent a 17% growth in sales on the European market.
In the Spanish market, Honda has sold 8,000 Jazz since 2002, which represents 6.7% of Honda’s sales in Spain.
Officials of the Spanish subsidiary hope to sell 2,000 Jazz in a year.
It is precisely the release of the new Jazz that will allow Honda to largely offset the decline in sales in Spain.
In fact, brand leaders hope to end the year with sales of 22,000 cars, which is 4,000 cars less than in 2007, a 16% drop in sales.
Thanks to this increase in sales, Honda increased its market share in Spain, reaching a market share of 1.8%, compared to 1.6% last year.
The Japanese brand also hopes to gain a 2% market share in 2010.
Honda hopes to get that market share when the new model comes out.
This is the Insight, a compact, five-door hybrid - 4.37 meters long - on which the Japanese company hopes to market nearly 200,000 cars per year worldwide.
Depending on the markets and according to the Japanese manufacturer's estimates, 50% of Insight's sales will be in the United States, while the remaining half will be distributed between the Old Container and Japan.
The commercial launch of the Insight is scheduled for the first three months of next year, following its public presentation in January in Valencia.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz increases its dimensions.
Its length reaches 3.90 meters (five centimeters more), its width 1.69 meters (two centimeters more) and the distance between its axes is 2.50 meters which represents an increase of five centimeters.
On the other hand, the height does not change or 1.52 meters.
The dimensions are increasing and the interior space as well.
This gain is due, on the one hand, to the introduction of a new platform and, on the other hand, to the introduction of a gas reserve in a central position, a solution also adopted for Honda Jazz.
In the same way, the capacity of the trunk - which has a double bottom system - can hold up to 399 litres, 19 litres more capacity compared to the first generation trunk.
It should be noted that these dimensions are those of the version with a 1.4L engine, since the capacity of the case of the Honda Jazz 1.2L is 379 liters.
The other innovation - in addition to exterior elements such as the rear lights or the panoramic roof - is improved access to the rear seats.
The doors that give access to the rear seats have an opening angle of 80 degrees, compared to the rear doors of the first Jazz that opened with an angle of 67 degrees.
The engines are also new to this second generation of Jazz.
At the start of its commercialization, this small model will be equipped with two 1.2 and 1.4-litre petrol engines.
Both engines feature i-VTEC technology that reduces fuel consumption and CO2 emissions, which makes the engine more powerful and increases engine speed.
The first 1.2-litre engine develops a power of 90 horsepower at 6,000 rpm and 114 Nm of torque at 4,900 rpm.
This engine - which on the previous Jazz reached 78 horsepower - has a fuel consumption of 5.3 liters per 100 km and emissions of 125 grams of CO2.
Compared to the previous engine, which on the previous generation reached 83 horsepower, now reaches 100 horsepower.
This Honda Jazz 1.4L of 100 horsepower has a combined consumption of 5.4 litres per 100 km and emissions of 128 grams of CO2.
The ‘bee car’ that avoids collisions
To advance the development of accident prevention technologies, Nissan has taken inspiration, this time from nature, especially bees.
The Japanese company has created a robot that, by imitating the theft of bees, avoids accidents.
It is called Bio-Mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C and represents the first steps towards collision prevention technologies.
Engineers at Nissan Motor Co.’s Advanced Technical Center have made this little robot in collaboration with the Center for Advanced Science and Technology Research at the prestigious University of Tokyo, Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, Managing Director of Public Relations for Technology and Brand Management Research and Development, the BR23C represents the rise of the Nissan Safety Shield.
This robot will allow the brand’s vehicles to prevent collisions.
During the flight, each bee creates its own personal space in an oval shape that resembles the Nissan safety shield.
But the most important are the bee's composed eyes, able to see at an angle of more than 300 degrees and in all directions, allowing it to fly without interruption inside its own personal space.
To recreate this visual function, the engineers developed what is called a laser range finder.
It detects obstacles that are located over a distance of two meters and within a radius of 180 degrees, calculates the distance to this object and sends a signal to the microprocessor, immediately, to avoid the obstacle.
“As soon as it detects an obstacle, the little robot will mimic the movements of a bee and immediately change direction by bifurcating its wheels 90 degrees or more to avoid collision.
The biggest difference from any other existing system is that the escape maneuver is totally instinctive.
If this were the case, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," says Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Laboratory of Displacement and chief engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot be diverted up or down, nor diagonally; it can move only in two dimensions and depending on what its wheels allow it and not in infinite directions like bees.
For this reason, Nissan used a rotation function, but also acceleration and deceleration, so that the small robot can avoid obstacles.
"Every second this device should only process information and act on that data.
It does not need to retain the information or intuitive logic of pre-manoeuvres, which is why it can run continuously with only a few dozen KB of memory.
This may come as a surprise, but we’re not talking about gigabytes of memory, or even megabytes.”
This represents the first car to develop new technologies for instant collision prevention, a technology that will be introduced into standard cars in a decade after Nissan.
The robot works with lithium-polymer batteries, which are lighter and last longer than lithium-ion batteries.
The other possible application of this technology in the future could be the adaptation of this device to a GPS satellite navigation system to guide the driver to his destination avoiding obstacles on the road.
They are afraid of being mortgaged.
It must be recognized that the Treasury of the United States, in addition to having a lot of liquid to make plans, is not devoid of genius.
Faced with the crisis, and to prevent Americans from embarking on mortgages from credit banks, they created a game to learn not to go bankrupt: 'Bad Credit Hotel'.
That is, 'the hotel of bad credits'... or stories.
The gloomy aspect of this accommodation and especially the Master of Hotel leads us to think several times if it is the right time to apply for a loan.
And, above all, where to do it.
It is certain that this game provides useful but little detailed information.
It’s more of a game for teenagers.
What to do if the game is over?
Since a dream room appears inside the hotel.
It is better than nothing, since it is unthinkable to buy a house
Morgan Stanley opens its capital at MUFG
Morgan Stanley has announced the entry of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), Japan’s first bank, which will disburse $9 billion to take 21% of its capital, a new one welcomed by a sharp fall in its stock market price.
A week after unveiling an interim deal, the two banks explained that MUFG would buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley’s ordinary shares at a unit price of $25.25, a total of $3 billion.
The retained price is 19% lower than the book value of the securities as at 31 August.
MUFG will invest an additional $6 billion in the acquisition of convertible securities with a return of 10% and a conversion price of $31.25.
Morgan Stanley said the overall transaction would be based on an average unit price of $29, 28% above its current price.
The Morgan Stanley share, however, lost 6.79% at $23.07 around 5pm GMT.
“This strategic alliance is an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley’s transition to bank holding status,” said John Mack, the group’s CEO.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new status last week, which should allow him to diversify his activities but pass it under the authority of the Federal Reserve.
His alliance with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis is forcing Wall Street’s biggest names to adopt a much more cautious attitude than before.
The terms presented on Monday also show that the deal has been modified over the past few days: on Monday, Morgan had simply announced that he would sell up to 20% of his shares to the Japanese for about $8.5 billion.
"A week ago, Toshihide Mizuno, the executive director of MUFG, told Tokyo, we thought that participation would be entirely composed of ordinary shares.
But given the current situation of the economy and the market, we wanted to minimize the risks and cover ourselves."
Based on the weighted average price, MUFG will pay its Morgan Stanley securities 7% below their book value.
And the transaction will result in a dilution of about 20% of the profit per share.
The agreement provides that MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferential securities into ordinary shares in a year if the latter trade more than 50% above the conversion price, or about $47, for a given period.
Morgan Stanley says MUFG’s capital will enable it to seize investment opportunities, strengthen its balance sheet and increase its liquidity.
However, a spokeswoman for the group declined to provide details on the strategic projects of the two new allies.
Following MUFG’s investment, Morgan Stanley is expected to display a Tier One solvency ratio of around 15%, one of the best in the sector.
Morgan said he had "cleanly" eased his balance sheet since the end of August.
The last few weeks have been challenging for the group, which saw its stock market price melt by half as the cost of insurance against a risk of default on its debt flew up.
The cost declined on Monday but remained at a high level, around 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only other "survivor" of Wall Street's major investment banks after the bankruptcies of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the acquisition of Merrill Lynch, announced it had raised $15 billion, in part from Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett's group.
Rafael Correa in Quito this Monday.
Refounding the republic around 21st century socialism.
This is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
This Sunday, like his colleagues and friends, he was the third to put forward a draft of a new Constitution.
Mission accomplished since 64% of voters voted "yes" to the referendum, according to official results with 80% of the votes.
According to these results, the "no" scored 28%, 7% of the votes were null and 0.7% were white votes.
In order for the draft Constitution to be adopted, it had to get half the vote plus one.
On Sunday, two polls carried out at the polling stations and a count of a non-governmental organization had announced a broad victory of the "yes", standing between 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa had claimed the victory of his draft constitution on Sunday night.
The "Constitution triumphed overwhelmingly," he said, congratulating Ecuadorians at the Guayaquil Governorate headquarters, 280 kilometers southwest of Quito.
As of course, Rafael Correa was congratulated by Chávez and Morales but also his Chilean counterpart Michelle Bachelet.
The vote, which took place quietly according to the observation mission of the Organization of American States (OAS), was about a text in 444 points consolidating the "new socialism" defended by the president.
The draft Constitution consecrates the power of the state over the economy, reserving to it the "development planning" of a country that lives mainly from the extraction of oil by foreign companies and the currencies sent by its emigrants.
Led by Correa, elected in 2006, the project also gives the head of state enhanced powers, which will be able to serve up to two consecutive four-year terms and will have the opportunity to dissolve the Assembly.
Correa has already announced that he will use this power and contest a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution further consolidates the principle of free health and education services that the President has begun to establish in this country of 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
It finally provides for a ban on the presence of foreign troops, which will end the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of an Ecuadorian base as a starting point for U.S. anti-drug operations.
The 19 hostages were released in Chad.
An Egyptian commando launched an assault on the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight escorts captured ten days ago.
They are in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian escorts held captive for ten days in the desert were returned safely to the Egyptian capital on Monday afternoon.
In the morning, they had been released by an Egyptian commando in Chad.
Apparently in good shape, the hostages arrived around 3:30 p.m. aboard a special plane at al-Maza military base, which is docked at Cairo International Airport.
They were immediately transferred, unable to speak to the press, on helicopters to the hospital in Maadi, a residential suburb of Cairo, for examinations.
They are "in good health" and "no ransom has been paid" to the kidnappers, Egyptian Tourism Minister Zoheir Garanna said on the tarmac.
Captured on 19 September during a 4x4 safari at the foot of Mount Ouanat, on the borders of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, this group of hostages had been swept from one hide-and-seek by 35 unknown kidnappers.
It includes 11 tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - as well as eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the Egyptian agency, organizer of the safari.
An Egyptian security official said 30 members of the special forces, dispatched on board two helicopters, had launched the assault on the night just before dawn.
"An exchange of shots took place, and half of the kidnappers were killed, the others fleeing," said the official, who requested anonymity.
He said that 150 members of the Egyptian special forces of the "lightning" unit had been sent to Sudan in total, where they received support from German and Italian commandos.
The head of the Italian diplomacy Franco Frattini mentioned from Belgrade, where he is located, the role played by secret agents and elements of the Italian special forces.
"We must recognize that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and efficiency of our intelligence and special forces men," he said.
He also denied the payment of a ransom.
The day before, the Sudanese army claimed to have intercepted a 4x4 vehicle on board a patrol, killing six, including the Chadian leader, and arresting two.
The army had claimed they were linked to a rebel group in Darfur, the Sudan Unity Liberation Movement (SLA-U), which the movement had immediately denied.
Letters - The Silent Majority of Culture
A debate on the financing of culture makes headlines and occupies the current election campaign.
It's so much better.
But one aspect of our cultural life is still forgotten.
Who will stand up to denounce the sums of misery granted to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or national historical sites that are starving?
What politician would dare to remind the federal government that it neglects its monuments and heritage buildings?
That in Quebec, as in Canada, we don't have real laws that actually preserve our heritage?
Did you know that the French government is devoting three and a half million euros to the restoration of the only Château de Chinon in the Loire Valley?
In our American neighbors, it is written in the Constitution of their country that the protection of heritage is part of the culture of Americans and that this heritage must be protected by all citizens, all elected and all government departments, and this, in concert.
In Quebec, at the Fédération des Sociétés d'Histoire du Québec, at least 40,000 volunteers grouped in 211 societies of history, heritage, archives and genealogy are concerned about digging history, preserving with three under private archives and preserving archaeological collections.
They are often the watchdogs of our heritage, who protest with the energy of despair when promoters and decision makers launch their bulldozers against our old stones and forgotten cemeteries.
When, a tribune for history and heritage?
Benelux governments nationalize part of Fortis Bank
As the first European banking institution in distress as a result of the snowball effect of the credit market crisis in the United States, the Benelux states partially nationalize the bank, which is also supported by a sum of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>11.2 billion in insurance, this financial institution is also able to provide financial assistance.
This weekend, the Belgian, Luxembourg and Dutch governments agreed, at the highest level, on this matter, also appealing to the European Central Bank and the European Commission’s competition officer.
In the euro area, the first major crisis in the context of the international financial crisis, which has been escalating for more than a year, is for Fortis Bank, and from a certain point of view, the decisions that will be taken in the case of this bank will serve as a precedent.
According to the decision made on Sunday night, the three states will buy back nearly half (49%) of the bank’s capital located in each of the countries.
The bank is undoubtedly going to sell some of its shares, among which, first of all, the activities, mainly insurance, which it acquired last year from the Dutch organization ABN Amro.
Last week, Fortis shares began a dizzying fall. In the second half of the week, serious signs of crisis have already been revealed at the bank.
Analysts agree that with its 85,000 employees, the bank is too big to go bankrupt.
Only on Friday, the company’s shares fell 12 percent, to reach their lowest level 14 years ago.
Since January, stocks have fallen by more than two-thirds of their value.
Taking into account the current value of the shares, the total value of the group's capital revolves around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>14 billion, which, according to the company's executives, is not realistic.
The company's management accuses the uncertainty of the overseas, in connection with the adoption of the US bailout plan of $700 billion, to be the cause of the fall of Fortis shares.
On Monday, the papers already benefited from a slight increase.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed head of the bank, as the new CEO.
The financial institution was also looking for private buyers, but has not yet received a proposal on the merits.
Previously, the Belgian government announced that investors should not worry, they would not lose their money.
No panic was felt in the bank’s clientele circle and no agency was assaulted.
In Hungary, Fortis owns independent agencies and has also acquired leasing companies.
A fox in the chicken coop
In America, life and health insurance companies frequently refuse to sign an insurance contract with a candidate, based on information about his/her drug purchases.
Information protection experts fear that the data market will become uncontrollable.
"There are data protection programs that bind the use of information regarding the prescription of medicines, in any case, to the consent of the data subject.
This kind of program must be in independent hands, otherwise it is about entrusting its henhouse to a fox," Richard Dicket, the creator of the program used to manage prescription drugs, told the Washington Post.
Insurance companies make the premium and capital insured in the event of damage depend on the health status of the client, and if they feel that the risk is too high, they do not even insure it.
In the past, they sent candidates for a medical examination, and they only signed an insurance contract with them after they learned of the results.
For the past ten years, Dick has found a procedure much cheaper: from an identification number, it is easily provided from pharmacies, data on the purchases of drugs of the person within the past eighteen months. From this, the program determines itself, what disease the person suffers from and what is his health condition.
For example, if this person regularly buys high doses of cholesterol lowering, this refers to an extremely high level of fat in the blood, which puts him immediately in a higher risk category.
Several versions of this program are in circulation. Some at the same time determine a risk factor, so there is not much more to do for the insurer other than paperwork. However, tiny problems can still appear.
Among the disadvantages of this program is the fact that a drug can be used for different purposes, for example, some mixtures can be used against migraine or hot flashes, but can also be effective against depression.
The latter is considered by insurers as an aggravating risk factor, while the others are not.
Companies have developed in the research and analysis of data. They must ask for the patient's permission before collecting the necessary information from the pharmacy.
From now on, they are being forced by the authorities, even if they have not been punished for their past failures.
Recently, some companies have also been processing laboratory analysis results and linking them to drug consumption data, enabling them to provide an even more accurate picture of patients' health status.
More and more companies have access to data, and usage control is becoming increasingly difficult at the same time.
There is a separate law on the protection of medical data, but its scope extends only to practitioners and insurers.
A bill on expanding the authority's control of companies specializing in the provision of data is currently before Congress.
Dick Richard acknowledges that this is not sufficient and that is why he has further developed his program, which would condition the transmission of data to the exclusive consent of the person concerned.
It is another question of whether the person concerned is really free to give his consent or not, since if he or she refuses, insurance does not sign an insurance contract with him or her.
Thus and in the end, the chickens depend on the benevolence of the fox.
The global menu of Marseille
The European Union and India are doubling their trade.
Since the European Union and India are very important trading partners for each other, this theme also dominated the agenda of this ninth summit alongside other largely global problems.
Today, there will also be a France-India summit where cooperation in the field of nuclear energy will be discussed.
The European Union recognizes that India is a large emerging democratic power that should be given a broader voice in international affairs, but the member countries have not yet been able to agree on their support in New Delhi for its candidacy as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
They were not too late on this issue yesterday at this 9th summit held in Marseille.
The French President, Nicolas Sarkozy, as the current President of the Union, as well as the President of the Commission José Manuel Barroso and the head of diplomacy, Javier Solana, welcomed the Prime Minister of India, Manmohan Singh, with whom they agreed that in five years, they would double the trade of centavos, which means one billion.
Bearing in mind that between 2000 and 2007, the trade in goods rose from 25 billion to 55 billion, this does not seem to be an overly ambitious goal.
In this sense, they have legally harmonized the 26 bilateral conventions with India on civil flights, so that air traffic can also take off in the future.
India would like to sign a free trade agreement with the Union by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy has promised to speed up the negotiations.
The aim is to balance the situation with, on the one hand, India, which is the EU's first trading partner, and on the other, New Delhi, which is only in ninth place among the EU's partners.
The summit focused its attention on global affairs.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan has been strongly condemned, as well as all forms of terrorism, and the urgency of holding a UN conference on this issue has been mentioned.
The completion of the Doha trade cycle has also been requested, although both have a large part in the current failure.
The EU has confirmed that it remains faithful to the energy and climate programme, notably that it would like to reduce its releases of toxic substances by at least 20 percent by 2020.
India also agreed on this point, as well as with the fact that a comprehensive market would need to be passed at the climate conference scheduled next year, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by fifty percent by 2050.
They would also like to prevent food prices from rising, and supported the convening of an international working meeting to discuss the financial crisis.
The head of state of India is visiting the French capital, where he is preparing to sign an agreement on the peaceful use of nuclear energy at a bilateral meeting.
In Paris, it is hoped that French companies will receive orders worth twenty billion euros for the construction of Indian nuclear reactors.
According to the press agency, the agreement would be for 15 years.
In Frankfurt, more than three hundred Italian publishers
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the Frankfurt International Book Fair.
More than three hundred Italian publishers present at the 60th edition of the Buchmesse, the most important international event in the exchange of rights.
The Frankfurt International Book Fair awaits this edition, with more than 7 miles of exhibitors from 101 different countries occupying the 171,790 square meters of the Fair with more than 403 thousand titles on display, and Turkey as an honorary guest.
Francesco Maria Giro, Deputy Secretary of the Ministry of Cultural Property and Activities, will represent the Italian Government at the opening ceremony of the Italian Butterfly: in fact, Italy will be institutionally present, with an Italy Point - 264 square meters of exhibition space.
It will be followed by a meeting with the press at the Room Struktur, at the Buchmesse Butterfly 5.0: an opportunity to present the figures, trends and prospects on the position of the edition in Italy.
According to the data, the importance of foreign author books is gradually decreasing compared to the total Italian production, and in particular, compared to that for adults and children.
Found Steve Fossett's plane, the billionaire missing a year ago.
The wreckage of Steve Fosset's plane, the billionaire who disappeared on September 3, 2007 while flying over the Nevada desert, has been found.
The debris was found on a 3,000-metre high plateau in the Sierra Nevada area of Mammonth Lakes, on the border between California and Nevada.
Inside the plane, however, no human remains.
Madera County Sheriff John Anderson said: “The plane was located, we sent a team, and now we have confirmation that it is indeed the one Steve Fosset was traveling on the day he disappeared,” he said at a press conference.
The sheriff said no human remains were found either on the plane or in the vicinity.
In February, the 63-year-old billionaire was considered dead.
The U.S. Bureau of Transportation Safety (NTSB) said a few hours after the wreckage was spotted, a team of investigators sent to the site identified the device: it was the Bellanca 8kcab, missing on September 3, 2007, when Fosset took off from Yerington in Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, still in California, not far from the Nevada border, some personal belongings from Fosset were found by a couple around their Mammoth Lakes home.
These are two documents bearing the name Fosset, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, cash and a sweater.
Fossett's research was interrupted a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire had earned a place in history thanks to a long series of records.
At the sixth attempt, he had become in 2002, the first man to complete the world tour on an aerostatic balloon: two weeks of solo flight.
Three years later, he had travelled around the world by plane and without a stopover.
Among all these records, also that of having flown at 15,445 meters high, over the Andes, but with a co-pilot.
Glk, the advertising you don't expect.
An unusual 4x4 with an original and well-defined design, marked lines, wide surfaces and clear angles.
Here, in synthesis, Glk, the last born of the off-road "compacts" of the star house, with which Mercedes-Benz has tried to give a wind of novelty in this sector.
It is precisely because of its unusual, unexpected and unconventional content that communication will accompany the launch of the 4x4 Glk, available in the Mercedes-Benz showrooms, from October 17th.
Thus, the advertising batting that will accompany the start of the new car will give rise to an unprecedented modality of communication, through a futuristic campaign of 3D displays, used for the first time in Italy by an automotive brand.
A project of maxi displays, articulated in three different phases, that will dominate the heart of Milan’s shopping, Corso Como, until November 15.
The first phase of this new type of communication provides for the presentation of the car in stereoscopic vision, and thanks to special glasses distributed around Corso Como, it will be possible to see the new 4x4 in almost real dimensions and in three-dimensional format.
In fact, we will have the impression that by looking at the image, the car comes out of the poster.
Then, through the use of the innovative Elimina8 technology, the new Glk will be illuminated according to the spots, in all its details, and then recomposed into a single image.
It is obvious that with this advertising, Mercedes is trying to introduce something new in the stereotypical field of automotive communication.
Will it succeed with this formula in arousing the interest of future buyers? We will see.
Here are the Italian hooligans.
From Triveneto, they risk the Daspo.
But who are these 150-200 young boys and girls whose Italy is now ashamed of? They are part of the group "Ultras Italia" which has been following the Italian national team for years, and which, until now, had never created major problems.
He had never met the opposing fans.
The extraction of the group is from the right.
The promoters are from Triveneto.
From Verona, Padua, Trieste, and Udine.
In Sofia, small groups (not really) from Campania and Puglia joined.
They had tricoloured flags on which appeared their hometown: on Saturday night, they were all taken away so as not to be identified.
They're inspired by the English fanbase.
In Bulgaria, they found a group of true Nazis, the Levski.
The Figc had made available to the Italian fans, 144 tickets for the game: all nominative, and therefore easily controllable.
And the Viminal had them all controlled: among those who left for Sofia, none had a Daspo in progress, none had been banned from attending a stadium.
Four Italian fans who had a history of stadium crime, were not entitled to the ticket, and could not make the move.
Now the Viminal is waiting to read the acts that will arrive from the Bulgarian police, and will then take action: in this case, it could be that the fans arrested or identified in the disorders will give a Daspo for at least five years.
An international Daspo that prohibits attending Italian, but also European stadiums.
In short, our hooligans will no longer put foot in the stadium.
Fortunately.
But now it is time for fear-emulation: that is, others are at risk of joining the first one hundred and fifty.
“We must extinguish this fire immediately, and not legitimize what is done in this way,” the Viminal said.
So, "keep your eyes open especially in view of Wednesday's national team match in Lecce"
In Apulia there is indeed a small nucleus of supporters of the Ultras Italy.
Tomorrow, the Observatory meets, on Tuesday the Casms which can even count on a section of the Aise, that is, secret services, which take care of the stadium problems.
"The Duce-Duce choirs, and the stretched arm during Mameli's hymn? In Bulgaria, it's not a crime"
Here is the opinion (expressed in a really unpleasant way) of Domenico Mazzilli, recently, director of the Viminal Observatory (he took the position of Francesco Tagliente and then Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli was previously prefect of Trieste, where he resides a core of supporters of the Ultras Italia group, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria, renting Mussolini is not a crime, but it is certain that the behavior of these 150-200 fans has been shameful.
"I am not a sociologist - adds the No. 1 of the Observatory - the crimes must be attributed in the country in which the fact occurs.
Until now, this group had remained in the rules, now we will see well what happened, and we will evaluate for the future.
But let’s also talk about the whistles to the anthem of Mameli: these too are not crimes, but if you will allow me, they are not polite...”
