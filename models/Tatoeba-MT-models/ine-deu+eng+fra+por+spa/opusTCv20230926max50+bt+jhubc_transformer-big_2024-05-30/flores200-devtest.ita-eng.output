USA Gymnastics supports the U.S. Olympic Committee letter and recognizes the absolute need for the Olympic community to work to create a safe environment for all its athletes.
We agree with what the USOC says, namely that the interests of our athletes and our clubs, and their sport, can be better served by bringing about a significant change within our organization, and not with de-certification.

This not only confirms that some dinosaurs had feathers, an already widespread theory, but provides greater details than fossils, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
According to scientists, the plumage of this animal was brownish brown at the top, with a pale coloration or carotenoid at the bottom.
The discovery also provides detailed information on the evolution of bird feathers.
Since the dinosaur feather is not equipped with the basic structure, the so-called spine, but instead has other characteristics typical of feathers, beards and beards, the researchers concluded that the spine is probably the result of an evolutionary development subsequent to these characteristics.
The plumage structure suggests that it was not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or courtship. The researchers hypothesize that, although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the finding shows an adult plumage and not the chick duvet.
According to the researchers’ hypotheses, although the tail belongs to a young dinosaur, the sample reveals an adult feathering rather than that of a chick.

Brightness is used together with rotation to define the Rossby number of a star, which is linked to the plasma flow.
The lower the number of Rossbys, the lower the activity of the star compared to magnetic inversions.

The activity was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate the surveys of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect sought by the team was to be provoked by the tidal forces between the dark matter of this galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon exerts a force of attraction on the Earth that generates tides, so does the Milky Way exert a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have been able to deduce that the effects of dark matter on other dark matter are the same effects that "normal" matter has.
This theory holds that much of the dark matter around a galaxy is collected in a kind of halo, formed by a multitude of small particles.

Edgar Veguilla has reported injuries to the arm and jaw, while Kristoffer Schneider will have to undergo facial reconstruction surgery.
Uka's weapon did not explode when it was pointed at the head of a fifth man. Schneider has constant pain, is blinded by an eye, he lacks a section of skull and his face has been reconstructed in titanium.
Schneider testified via videoconferencing from a USAF base in his country.
In addition to the event on Wednesday, Carpanedo participated in two single races of the Championships.
The first in slalom, where on the first descent he recorded a DNT. Another 36 competitors out of 116 in the same race did not finish the test.
The other race she participated in, the giant slalom, saw her rank tenth in the women's group in the "sitting" category, with a combined run time of 4:41.30, slower of 2:11.60 minutes than the first ranked, the Austrian Claudia Loesch, and slower of 1:09.02 minutes compared to the ninth place of the Danish Gygyeresön.
Four women’s group skiers failed to finish their descents, and 45 of the 117 participants in the Giant Slalom did not qualify in the race.
Madhya Pradesh police recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General DK Arya announced: "Five people have been arrested for the rape of the Swiss woman. We also found her mobile phone and laptop."
The names of the defendants are: Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
According to police superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the defendants appeared in court with their faces covered.
None of the three people who were in the house at the time of the car crash were injured.
Despite this, the driver was severely injured in the head.
The road in which the accident occurred was temporarily closed, while the rescue services freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was later transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been in the Edinburgh Sheriff's Court on charges of killing her own son.
She is detained pending referral to trial, but any testimony given by an eyewitness could be contaminated, as her image has been widely published.
This is a common practice in other parts of the UK, but the Scottish judiciary has other parameters, as Scottish courts have found the publication of photos potentially harmful.
According to Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee, “journalists who publish photos or other suspicious subjects walk on minefields.”
The Crown Office, which has general responsibility for court proceedings, has told reporters that no new comments will be issued until at least the formal indictment.
According to the leaked document, the subject of the document will be the border dispute, which Palestine wants to be based on existing borders before the 1967 Middle East War.
According to what is said, the other issues addressed include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the question of the Jordan Valley.
Once the agreement is signed, Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley, while the Palestinian Authority agrees to abandon that presence for only five years.
The shooters within the experimental program for the control of harmful animals had to be closely monitored by the rangers, since the experiment was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
As part of the hunting program of the Sporting Shooters Association, the NPWS, in collaboration with the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., has recruited qualified volunteers.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of the NPWS Park Conservation and Heritage, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received comprehensive training and safety instructions.
Martelly was sworn in in a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) consisting of nine members.
This is Martelly’s fifth interim electoral council in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission proposed a package of measures aimed at pushing the country towards new elections, including the resignation of the previous CEP.
The committee was Martelly’s response to the widespread protests, which began in October, that challenged the regime.
Occasionally violent protests have been triggered by the lack of elections, some of which have been scheduled since 2011.
About 60 cases of malfunctioning iPod overheating have been reported, causing a total of six fires and causing minor burns to four people.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 device-related accidents.
Last week, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) announced that it had been informed by Apple of 34 other incidents related to overheating, which the company described as "non-serious".
In its response, the ministry called “absolutely derogatory” Apple’s postponement of the report.
The Marianne earthquake was reported at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT on Friday).
According to the emergency management office of the Northern Mariana Islands no damage has been reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there were no signs of a tsunami.
In Manila, the capital of the Philippines, a former Filipino policeman took Hong Kong tourists hostage after hijacking their bus.
With his M16 rifle Rolando Mendoza fired on tourists.
Many of the hostages have been rescued, at least six have died.
Six hostages, including children and elderly people, were immediately released along with Filipino photographers.
The photographers then replaced an elderly lady who needed to use the bathroom. Mendoza was shot to death.
Liggins traced his father's footsteps and embarked on his medical career.
After graduating in obstetrics, she joined the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While serving at the hospital, in his spare time Liggins began to study cases of premature labor.
His research showed that the administration of a hormone would accelerate the maturation of the lungs in the fetus.
Xinhua reported that government investigators on Wednesday recovered two "black boxes" with flight records.
His wrestling buddies also wanted to pay tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first Queen of the Extreme. My first manager. She died on the night of the two moons. Unique, just like you. A strong woman."
“Moon was weird like me... maybe even more... I love her and I’ll miss her... We hope she’s in a better place,” said Dustin “Goldust” Runnels.
According to the survey of 1,400 people conducted before the 2010 federal election, people opposed to Australia’s transition to a republic increased by 8% compared to 2008.
During the 2010 federal election campaign, acting prime minister Julia Gillard said she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Elizabeth II's reign.
This opinion is shared by 34% of respondents to the survey, according to which Queen Elizabeth II should be the last monarch of Australia.
Contrary to the survey, 29% of respondents argue that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% are of the opinion that it should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medal was supposed to compete in the 100 and 200 metres freestyle and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but it has accused several disorders that have led to doubts about his fitness.
He could not take the necessary medications to overcome the pain because they are banned from the Games.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest number ever known to date.
The discovery was verified by several people through the use of various hardware and software in early February, and was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been one of the sources that brought water and organic matter to Earth, that is, matter capable of forming proteins and supporting life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form and in particular how the Earth formed, having collided with comets a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, has been in office since the beginning of this year as governor; last month he signed a law that makes same-sex marriage legal.
According to him, the speculations are nothing more than “political chatter and nonsense.”
A candidate for the presidency is expected in 2016.
According to the FAA, the NextGen system would allow aircraft to cover shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel per year, thus reducing carbon dioxide emissions.
The system uses satellite technology rather than obsolete ground-based radar to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more accurately and provide more accurate information to pilots.
Additional transport is not being set up and surface trains will not stop in Wembley, while no car or interchange parking is available on site.
Fears related to the lack of means of transport have led to the possibility of having the match necessarily played in closed doors, without the support of the team's fans.
According to a study published Thursday in the journal Science, a new species of bird would be born on the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
According to researchers from the University of Princeton, United States, and the University of Uppsala, Sweden, the new species evolved in just two generations, although the time required for this process was thought to be much longer; this was due to the coupling between an endemic Darwinian fringe, Geospiza fortes, and the Getustrioros cac fringe.
Gold can be worked in any kind of shape. It can be rolled to create minuscule shapes.
It can be pulled up to form a thin wire, suitable for twisting and braiding. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and attached to other metals. Sometimes it has been used to decorate hand-painted images in books called "miniated codes" due to the possibility of being made so thin.
This is the so-called pH of the substance. Using the juice of red cabbage it is possible to build a pH indicator.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical element is.
The pH level of the analyzed chemical is given by the amount of hydrogen ions present (the letter H of pH).
Hydrogen ions are protons that have been torn off by electrons (since hydrogen atoms are formed by a proton and an electron).
Mix together the two dried powders and then, with clean and wet hands, pour them into a ball.
Between the moisture present on your hands and the outer layers will trigger a reaction that will cause a strange feeling and form a kind of shell.
Almost all houses in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a bath with running water with a connection to an advanced sewer system.
In Greece, in the homes of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, remains of sewers have been discovered.
Cabinets in ancient times also existed in Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization they were sometimes placed in public toilets, attended by a mixed audience of men and women.
To call someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the signal and then sends it back almost instantly.
The launch of the satellite into space was carried out with a rocket. Scientists resort to space telescopes because the Earth's atmosphere partially distorts light and vision.
To carry a satellite or telescope into space, a rocket that is more than 100 feet high is required.
The wheel has changed the world enormously. Among the various advantages it has offered us, the most important one is to have provided us with easier and faster transportation.
Thanks to his invention, the train, the car and several other means of transport made their appearance.
Below them are other medium-sized felines that feed on medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small felines (including free-range domestic cats) that feed on small, significantly larger prey such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The niche concept is the secret to their success, a particular goal that every cat has and that allows them not to compete with others.
Lions are the most social cats and live in numerous groups called branches.
The branches are composed of adult males, usually 2 or 3 related to each other, and by a number of females and puppies that can reach 30.
Usually the females are closely related to each other, being a large family of daughters and sisters.
The pack of lions acts in a very similar way to the pack of wolves or dogs, whose behavior is in fact surprisingly similar to that of lions (but not to that of other large felines), also with regard to deadly attacks on their prey.
A complete athlete: the tiger is able to climb (though not too well), swim, make very long jumps and exert a traction force five times higher than that of a strong man.
The tiger belongs to the same family (the genus Panthera) as the lion, leopard and jaguar. These four felines are the only ones to rust.
The roar of the tiger is not as powerful as that of the lion, but rather resembles a phrase of screaming and angry words.
Ocelots love to feed on small animals. If possible, they hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds and almost all the prey they catch are much smaller than them.
Scientists believe that ocelots follow and find animals to eat (prede) thanks to the smell, whistling to the ground where they have been.
Thanks to night vision, they are able to see very well in the dark, as well as being able to move furtively. To hunt their prey, ocelots mimic themselves with the surrounding environment and then plum them on.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) separates from the main population to which they belong (for example, if they move across a mountain range or a river, or move to a new island, making it difficult for them to return), they will likely find themselves in a different environment from where they were before.
This new environment is characterized by different resources and competitors, so, in order to stand as a strong competitor, the new population will need different characteristics or transformations than those previously needed.
The original population has not changed at all; it still needs the same adaptations as before.
As time passes and as the new population adapts to its new environment, it becomes less and less like the other population.
At some point, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will appear so different from each other that they can no longer be defined as belonging to the same species.
This process, which consists in the formation of new species, is called speciation. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and is a fundamental element of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that is breathed by humans and absorb the carbon dioxide expelled from them (through exhalation).
Plants process their nutrition with the sun through photosynthesis. They also make shade.
We build our homes from plants and produce clothes with plants. Much of the food we eat is made of plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
The Mosaic was the superpredator of his era and for this reason he feared nothing but the other Mosaics.
From his long cheeks came out more than 70 sharp teeth like razors, plus an additional row located on the palate, so there was no escape for anyone who crossed his path.
We don't know for sure, but it's possible that he had a bifurcated tongue. His diet included turtles, big fish, other mosaics and it's also possible that he was a cannibal.
He also attacked anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like the T-Rex could not compete with him.
Although much of their food would seem familiar to us, the Roman banquets also provided for several strange or unusual flows, such as the wild boar, the peacock, the snails, and a species of rodent called giro.
Another difference was that while the poor and women were eating sitting in chairs, the rich men loved to eat together while lying on one side while consuming their meals.
Of course, the meals of the ancient Romans did not include various foods, coming to Europe from America or Asia centuries later.
For example, they did not have corn, tomatoes, potatoes or cocoa, and none of the ancient Romans had ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built for each deity a main temple, which was considered the home of the god.
People brought sacrifices to the gods and priests sought to provide for the needs of the gods through ceremonies and feasts.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary accessible only to priests.
Sometimes, special pyramid-shaped towers were built, called ziggurats, which became part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a sanctuary dedicated to the god.
Due to the mild climate that characterizes the Middle East, the house was not of fundamental importance.
Most of the Jewish family’s life was outdoors.
Women cooked in the yard, while shops were simple outdoor counters that overlooked the street. The stone was used to build houses.
In the land of Canaan there were no large forests, so the wood was particularly expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated, and it is said in the Nordic sagas that it was Erik the Red who gave it its name, having met Greenland on his journey after being exiled from Iceland for murder.
But, regardless of his discovery, at that time the Eskimo tribes already lived there.
Although all "Scandinavian" countries, the peoples, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland had very different characteristics.
If you have seen the movie "The Mystery of the Templars", you might think that on the back of the Declaration of Independence is drawn a map of the treasure.
Anyway, this is false. Even if there's something written on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence is the inscription "Original Declaration of Independence of 4 July 1776". The text appears reversed at the bottom of the document.
Although it is not known for sure who wrote it, it is known that at the beginning of its existence the large parchment document (measurement 29.75 inches by 24.5 inches) was rolled up to be stored.
Probably, therefore, the annotation was intended only as a label.
D-Day landings and subsequent clashes had led to the liberation of northern France, but the south was still occupied.
It was ruled by the Vichy regime, that is, by those French who in 1940 had made peace with the Germans and had allied themselves with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France: this offensive action took the name of "Operation Dragon".
The American and Free French forces had liberated southern France in just two weeks and were heading for Germany.
Civilization means a specific culture, shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work collaboratively, forming a society.
The word civilization derives from the Latin "civilis", which means civil; the term is in turn connected with "civis", i.e. citizen, and "civitas", i.e. city or city-state, and in a certain way therefore also defines the size of society.
Cities-states are the first realities to anticipate the idea of a nation. Culture of civilization means transmitting knowledge through multiple generations, leaving an indelible cultural footprint through fair diffusion.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving significant historical traces, thus not being recognized as true civilizations.
During the War of Independence, the thirteen states formed for the first time a weak central government, and Congress was the only component, according to the Statute of the Confederacy.
Congress had no power to impose taxes and, given the absence of executive or judicial power at the national level, relied on state authorities, often uncooperative, for the enforcement of its acts.
He did not even have the authority to bypass tax laws and duties between states.
In order to amend the articles, unanimous consent of all the states was necessary. These, on their part, had so little regard for the central government that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, is the second most successful football team in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Among the most popular sports are: football, basketball, volleyball, water-ball, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, track hockey and Formula 1 racing.
Winter sports are more prevalent in the northern regions and see Italians engaged in competing in international competitions and Olympic events.
They are part of the Japanese almost 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), and this makes Japan the seventh largest archipelago in the world!
From a geographical point of view, Japan is referred to as an "archipelago", considered the presence of groups of islands that make it up.
Taiwan was born in the 15th century, when European sailors who transited from there gradually recorded the name of the island with the name of Ilha Formosa, or Wonderful Island.
The Dutch East India Company in 1624 established a base in the southwestern part of Taiwan, initiating a transformation that concerned Aboriginal grain production systems and hiring Chinese harvesters to work in its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan ended up under the control of the Qing Dynasty forces (1644–1912); in 1885, Taiwan was declared a province of the Qing Empire.
After being defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Shimonoseki Treaty in 1895, thereby ceding Taiwan's sovereignty to Japan; the island remained under Japanese rule until 1945.
Machu Picchu comprises three primary structures, namely the Intihuatana, The Temple of the Sun and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the peripheral buildings have been rebuilt to give tourists a more accurate idea of their original appearance.
In 1976, 30% of the Machu Picchu site had been recovered, but restoration work is still underway.
The most common format in the world for fixed image photography, for example, is 35 mm, the same as the film most used at the end of the era of analog photography.
It is still produced today and, most importantly, its aspect ratio is inherited from the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
Strangely, the height of the 35 mm format is 24 mm and its width is 36 mm.
The proportions of this format (dividing by twelve to obtain the simplest ratio of integers) are therefore considered 3:2.
The proportions of many of the common formats (e.g. the family of APS formats) are equal to or very close to this value.
The much-exploited and often ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining a measure of order within an image.
According to this rule, the most effective point where to position the main subject corresponds to the intersection of the lines that divide the image into thirds, both vertically and horizontally (as in the example).
In this phase of European history, the Catholic Church, having become rich and powerful, proved to be under scrutiny.
The Christian religion had acted as a bond between European states for over a thousand years, despite linguistic and costume differences.
His omnipresent power has influenced anyone, from kings to ordinary citizens.
One of the foundations of Christianity is that wealth must serve to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the monetary reserves of the church exist for this very reason.
The central authority of the church has remained in Rome for over a thousand years and this convergence of power and money has prompted many to question whether this principle has been respected.
Shortly after the start of hostilities, Britain decided to implement a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy proved effective: it envisaged the interruption of any essential military and civilian supplies, even though this blockade violated international law usually accepted and codified by multiple international treaties over the past two centuries.
Britain undermined international waters to prevent any vessels from accessing entire sections of the ocean, also endangering neutral ships.
Since this tactic had aroused a limited response, Germany expected a reaction similar to its indiscriminate underwater warfare campaign.
In the 1920s, the predominant attitudes of most citizens and nations were pacifism and isolation.
After witnessing the horrors and rages of World War I, nations wished to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla accepted a job offer at the Edison Company in New York City and this led him to move to the United States of America.
He arrived in the United States with four cents in his pocket, a book of poems and a letter of recommendation written by Charles Batchelor (his manager in the previous work) and addressed to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China the different periods of time were indicated in a very singular way: each period of China or each family in power constituted a specific dynasty.
The intervals between the individual dynasties were also characterized by periods of instability and division between the provinces. The best known was the so-called Three Kingdoms period, between the Han dynasty and the Jin dynasty, which lasted for 60 years.
During these periods, fierce wars broke out among many nobles fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the most violent eras in the history of ancient China. Thousands of people died fighting to win a place of honor in the imposing Xi'an Palace.
The social and political effects are numerous, including the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republic, nationalism and the belief that the nation belongs to the people and is not owned by a single sovereign.
In addition, after the Revolution, the professions were open to all male candidates, allowing the most ambitious and fortunate to succeed.
The same applies to the military, since the army rankings, instead of being based on the class, are now based on the caliber.
The French Revolution was also an inspiration for many other oppressed workers from various countries to begin their own revolution.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters that go beyond earthly life. He used to go to a cave known as "Hira" on the mountain of the "noor" (light) to meditate.
The cave, which has survived the passage of time, offers itself a very clear picture of the spirituality of Muhammad.
The cave rests on the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, completely detached from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not at all easy to find, even if its existence was known. Once inside the cave, the isolation is total.
You can see nothing but a wonderful clear sky and a lot of mountains around. From the inside of the cave you can see or hear very little of the surrounding world.
Among the seven wonders of the world, the Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one that has arrived to this day not in a state of ruin.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of the great pyramidal structures built in honor of the dead pharaoh.
The plain of Giza, or "Necropolis of Giza", in the Valley of the Kings in Egypt, houses numerous pyramids (the largest of which is the Pyramid of Cheops), several smaller tombs, various temples and the great Sphinx.
The important pyramid was created in honor of Pharaoh Cheops, and many of the pyramids, tombs and minor temples were built to honor Pharaoh's wives and relatives.
The indication "arcaded up" resembles a V and the indication "arcaded down" resembles a graffiti or a square without the lower side.
Up means that you should start from the tip and push the bow, and down means that you should start from the bow (which is where the hand supports the bow) and pull the bow towards itself.
An ascending arc usually generates a softer sound, while a descending arc produces a louder and more resolute sound.
You can choose to add your personalized pencil directions, but keep in mind that the archery marks you find printed have a musical value, so they should be respected in general.
On 6 October 1789, a mob of market women forced King Louis XVI, in terror, to leave Versailles to return to Paris, along with Queen Mary Antonieta, their two young children (Maria Teresa, 11 years old, and Louis Charles, 4 years old) and Elizabeth, the king's sister.
With a carriage they returned to Paris, surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and shouting threats against the sovereigns.
The crowd forced the king and queen to keep the windows of their carriage wide open.
At one point, someone in the crowd showed the terrified queen the head of a royal guard who had been killed in Versailles.
The war expenses of U.S. imperialism incurred to conquer the Philippines were paid by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime to cover much of the expenses, and interest on bonds fluctuated on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking institutions.
Clearly, the enormous gains resulting from the continued exploitation of the Filipino people formed the basis of U.S. imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must know the context that led to the creation of this order.
The period in which the events took place is commonly called the High Middle Ages, the period of European history covering the eleventh, twelfth and thirteenth centuries (from the year 1000 to 1300 AD).
The Full Middle Ages were preceded by the High Middle Ages and followed by the Low Middle Ages, which ends by convention in about 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that includes in practice a wide range of ideas, from technological innovation or technological imperative to the narrow sense that man's destiny is driven by an underlying logic, associated with scientific laws and their realization in technology.
Much of the interpretations of technological determinism have two general ideas in common: one is that the development of technology itself follows a path that goes far beyond political and cultural influence, and the other is that technology in turn has "effects" on societies that are intrinsic rather than socially conditioned.
For example, we can say that the car necessarily involves a development of the road network.
However, a national road network only for a few cars is not economically sustainable, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the costs of owning a car.
The mass possession of cars also leads to a higher percentage of road accidents, and consequently the invention of new rescue techniques for caring for injured people.
Romanticism was characterized by a substantial component of cultural determinism, addressed by authors such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
Within the framework of romanticism, geography has conditioned individuals, and over time have emerged customs, customs and culture related to such geography that, being in harmony with the context of society, have proved more effective than laws imposed arbitrarily.
Similarly to Paris, known today as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a neuralgic centre of luxury began around 400 AD and continued until about 1100 AD.
During the twelfth century its prestige declined, mainly due to the fact that the Crusaders returned bringing gifts such as silk and spices, which were valued more than the Byzantine markets offered.
It was at this point that the title of fashion capital passed from Constantinople to Paris.
The highest point of the Gothic style was touched in the period between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
Initially, clothing was strongly influenced by Eastern Byzantine culture.
But the slowness of communication pathways means that the spread of styles in the West can be delayed by 25-30 years.
towards the end of the Middle Ages Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most significant developments of the era, as a result of the crusades, was the introduction of buttons to tie clothes.
Agriculture is defined as subsistence when it is practiced solely for the purpose of producing enough to meet the food needs of the farmer/farmer and his/her family.
Subsistence farming is a simple system, usually organic, that uses preserved seeds from the ecological region in association with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques aimed at getting the most out of crops.
Historically, much of the farmers practiced subsistence agriculture, and in many developing countries it is still so.
Subcultures bring together individuals with the same opinions, who do not feel represented by the standards of society, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures are distinguished by the age, ethnicity, social class, position and/or sex of its members.
The characteristics that define a subculture as distinctive can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical or a set of factors.
Members of a subculture often indicate their belonging through a peculiar and symbolic use of style, which includes fashions, manners and argot.
One of the most commonly used methods to explain the importance of socialization is to analyze some unhappy cases of children who, due to negligence, misfortune, or the effect of intentional abuse, have grown up without proper socialization with adults.
These children are called "feral" or savage. Some of them have been segregated by people (often their own parents): in some cases, abandonment is motivated by the rejection of a serious intellectual or physical impairment by the parents.
Wild children may have undergone severe violence or trauma before abandonment or flight.
Other children may have been raised by animals; others still seem to have lived alone in the wild.
When the feral child is fully reared by non-human animals, it exhibits behaviors (within the physical limits) almost entirely similar to those of the particular animal that took care of him, such as fear or indifference towards man.
Project-based learning should make learning itself easier and more interesting, while the scaffolding goes a little further.
Scaffolding is not a mode of learning, but rather a help for those who undertake a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is an example of "scaffolding", but so is Microsoft Office's small graffiti assistant.
Virtual scaffolds are integrated into the software and are designed to interrogate, solicit, and explain procedures that the student may have had difficulty managing on their own.
Children are given into custody for various reasons ranging from abandonment to abuse, if not even extortion.
A child should never grow up in an environment that does not provide them with nutrition, care and training, but to them it happens.
We believe that the trust represents a safe area for these children.
Our hiring system should provide safe homes, loving dependent parents, stable education and reliable health care.
The trustee is supposed to meet all unmet needs in the house from which they were taken.
The Internet brings together some elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The characteristic elements of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of the theory of uses and gratifications.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are suggested as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
Eighmey and McCord’s (1998) study of audience reactions to websites identified two new aspects of motivation, namely “personal engagement” and “continuous relationships.”
The use of video recording has led to significant discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, which are facial movements lasting a few milliseconds.
Specifically, it is argued that it is possible to find out if a person is lying by interpreting microexpressions correctly.
In his essay “The Speech of the President,” Oliver Sacks illustrated how people unable to understand the language spoken due to brain damage are however able to accurately assess sincerity.
He even argues that such skills in interpreting human behavior can be shared with animals, such as domestic dogs.
In the twentieth century, research demonstrated the existence of two pools of genetic variability, namely hidden variability and expressed variability.
With the mutation a new genetic variability is added, with the selection it is eliminated from the pool of expressed variability.
Generation by generation, segregation and recombination redistribute the back and forth variability between the two pools.
For a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans, it is difficult to meet its needs for amino acids with the plant resources available in the savanna.
In addition, the failure to carry out such activities has serious consequences: slowing growth, malnutrition and, in the end, even death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would have been the proteins found in leaves and legumes, but for primates like us they are difficult to digest unless they are cooked.
Animal foods (such as ants, termites, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but provide a high amount of protein, containing all essential amino acids.
In light of all this, it should come as no surprise that our own ancestors have solved their “protein problem” in a certain way, as savannah chimpanzees do today.
Sleep disruption is the intentional awakening process that occurs during the normal sleep period, followed by a restart of sleep (10–60 minutes later).
This process can be easily put into practice using a relatively silent wake-up call to bring you to a state of consciousness, without waking you up completely.
If you decide to reset the clock in your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, so you will be forced to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-focused options include consuming many fluids before bedtime (especially water or tea, known for its diuretic properties), which force you to get up from bed to urinate.
A person enjoys an inner peace proportionally opposite to the tension existing in his body and spirit.
The less tension, the more positive is the existing life force. Each of us has the potential ability to find absolute peace and fulfillment.
Everyone can reach enlightenment. This goal is only hampered by our tension and our negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but has been enriched by the love path of the Mahayana rite and various techniques of Indian yoga.
In general, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It is based on Kundalini Yoga, meditation and an all-encompassing love path.
Kundalini Yoga activates the Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) through the use of yoga positions, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
Deity Yoga is the core of Tibetan meditation. Through the representation of various deities, energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated and enlightenment consciousness is developed.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, leading to cooperation between the USSR and the United States. With the end of the war, systemic, procedural and cultural conflicts caused the breakup between the two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies had become enemies; thus began the Cold War.
It would last for the next 40 years and would be fought for truly, by mercenary armies, in the battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, in Cuba and in many other countries.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already been broken; the only option was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
These plans proved obsolete, however, at a time when more than 800,000 Soviet Red Army soldiers advanced and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts, after invading the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other international, multilateral and bilateral treaties.
Exploiting ships to transport goods is certainly the most efficient way to move large volumes of people and goods across the oceans.
The task of the navies has always been to guarantee the country the safeguarding of its ability to move people and goods, while at the same time countering the same ability of enemies to move their people and their goods.
One of the recent examples supporting this theory and most noteworthy is the Battle of the Atlantic during World War II. During the battle, the Americans sought to move men and goods across the Atlantic Ocean to support Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, using mainly submarines, tried to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had not succeeded, Germany would probably have had the chance to conquer Britain, as it had done in the rest of Europe.
It appears that the goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago on the Zagros Mountains in Iran.
They began to be bred by cultures and tribes of antiquity to have milk, fleece, meat and skin readily available.
Domestic goats were usually raised in herds left free to move on the hills or in other grazing areas, often cared for by goats (similar to shepherds) who were often children or adolescents. These methods of grazing are still used today.
Wagonways were built in England in the 16th century.
Despite being formed simply by parallel wooden axes, the wagonways, when compared to the slightly more rough roads of the period, allowed the horses that traveled them to reach higher speeds and move heavier loads.
The rails were introduced relatively early to keep the rails in place, but gradually it was understood that the rails would have been more efficient if they had an iron bar at the top.
It became a common practice, although iron caused greater wear on the wooden wheels of wagons.
Finally, the wooden wheels gave way to the iron ones, and in 1767 the first rails were made entirely of iron.
The first means of transport that man has known were legs. Humans began to walk in an erect position two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (meaning "erect man").
His predecessor, the Australopithecus, did not normally walk erect.
Signs of specialization for bipedal walking are present in Australopithecus fossils dating back 4.2-3.9 million years, although it is possible that the Sahelanthropus walked on two legs already seven million years ago.
To try to mitigate to some extent future suffering we can start adopting more environmentally friendly lifestyles, we can join the environmental movement and also make activism.
In many cases, this only works as a symptomatic treatment. If instead we do not want only a temporary solution, we should find the ultimate cause of the problems and deactivate it.
It is quite obvious that the world has changed a lot due to the scientific and technological advances of humanity, while problems have increased due to overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of human beings.
After Congress adopted it on July 4, a draft manuscript signed by Congressional President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent to John Dunlap's printing house a few blocks away.
In the night between 150 and 200 copies were produced, now known as "The Dunlap Manifestos".
The document was read publicly for the first time on July 8 in the Independence Hall yard and the commission was entrusted to John Nixon.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, which made it read to his room troops in New York on July 9, while a copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 edges of Dunlap still known are the oldest existing copies of the document. The original manuscript was lost.
According to many paleontologists today a category of dinosaurs has survived and is still alive. They are what we call birds.
Many tend not to consider them dinosaurs because of their feathers and their ability to fly.
And yet birds have many characteristics that they share with dinosaurs.
Like the T-Rex, they are equipped with feet with scales and claws, laying eggs and walking on both hind legs.
Ultimately, the manipulation of encoded information in the form of binary numbers is the basis of all computers currently used.
A binary number can have only one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and in computer technical language these numbers are called binary digits or bits.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Its symptoms, including vomiting, are very generic, so much so that it is impossible to make an immediate diagnosis.
The main indication of internal poisoning could be the presence in the house of an open container of drugs or harmful chemicals.
Check if there are first aid instructions for that specific poison on the label.
The term mite is formally used by entomologists for this group of insects.
The term comes from the familiarity in ancient times with bed bugs, insects that have strongly adapted to become man's parasites.
Both killer bed bugs and bed bugs are nests, i.e. adapted to live in the nest or in the home of their host.
In the United States, multiple sclerosis (MS) accounts for about 400,000 known cases, ranking first among neurological diseases that affect young people and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, of which the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve are part.
Research has shown that the odds of developing MS among females are double that of males.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their best interest, or in their child’s best interest.
These couples have the option of choosing an adoption plan for their child.
In an adoption, natural parents renounce their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The primary goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. This method actually guides most of the scientific investigation.
But it is not just about experimentation, since an experiment is a test that is used to exclude one or more of the possible hypotheses; even asking questions and making observations allows to orient scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, particularly the Latin version of the Bible.
Aristotle's views on various subjects of knowledge, including psychology, were accepted.
With the progressive decline of the Greek language, the West has been isolated from its philosophical and scientific Greek roots.
Many have observed that physiological rhythms and behavior depend decisively on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not just reactions to external periodic signals, have been documented for most living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are independent oscillators, whose free cycle continues for a period of time even in the absence of external stimuli.
One of the first experiments to suggest that DNA was a genetic material was that conducted by Hershey and Chase.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They performed two experiments highlighting the DNA of the bacteriophage with radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the bacteriophage with radioactive sulphur.
Mutations can have a number of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the relevance of the piece of genetic material involved and whether the cells concerned belong to the germline.
The mutations that can be transmitted to children are only those at the germ cell level; mutations that occur elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Natural tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas in order to enjoy the landscape, including flora and wildlife.
Examples of activities to do on site include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, visits to parks and the study of information about the ecosystem.
For example, visiting, photographing and learning about the Borneo orangutans.
Every morning, people leave the small countryside to go to work by car, crossing other people whose workplace is the place they just left.
In this dynamic come and go, everyone is somehow connected to a transport system based on private cars, which at the same time support.
Today, science reveals that this massive carbon-based economy has forced the biosphere out of one of its stability conditions that has allowed human evolution over the past two million years.
Every person participates in social life and uses transport systems, of which almost everyone complains.
In developed countries, it is rare to hear similar levels of complaints about water quality or bridges falling into ruin.
Why do transport systems attract so many complaints, why are they rejected every day? Are engineers designing them that are incompetent, or are there deeper motivations?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles from one point to another and the interactions they generate with each other.
Unfortunately, the study of traffic flow is complex because driver behaviour cannot be predicted with absolute certainty.
Fortunately, driver behavior tends to fall within a reasonably constant range, so, in turn, traffic flows tend to show reasonable consistency and can be mathematically represented generically.
To obtain a more accurate representation of the traffic flow, the three main variables were correlated: (1) flow rate, (2) density and (3) speed.
These reports are useful for planning, designing and managing road structures.
Insects were the first animals to stand out from the flight. The ability to fly allowed them to escape enemies more easily and find food and companions more efficiently.
Most insects benefit from the ability to fold their wings along the body.
This allows them to exploit a greater variety of small breaches to hide from predators.
Among all the insects that exist today, the only ones that are unable to fold wings are the libellules and ephemerals.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the solar system was moving around the sun.
For some he was right, but many others believed the opposite, namely that the solar system, including the Sun itself (and also the other stars), moved around the Earth.
Which seems reasonable, because we don't have the feeling that the Earth is moving, do we?
The Amazon River is the largest and second longest river on Earth, carrying an amount of water 8 times that of the second largest river.
The Amazon River is also the widest river on Earth, with a width that at some points reaches six miles.
20% of the total water that flows from the planet’s rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon River.
The main river, the Rio delle Amazoni, is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long and contains the waters of thousands of smaller tributaries.
Stone pyramids continued to be built until the end of the Old Kingdom, but despite this the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in terms of size and technical excellence of their realization.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom remained enchanted by admiring the monuments of their ancestors, which at that time were much more than a thousand years old.
The population of the Vatican City is about 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the one with the smallest population.
The language of the Vatican City for official legislation and communications is Italian.
Italian is also the everyday language spoken by most people working within the state, while Latin is often used in religious functions.
In the Vatican City, all citizens are Roman Catholics.
Man began to know the basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper already in antiquity: these elements can be discovered in nature in native form and it is possible to extract them quite simply with the help of primitive tools.
According to the philosopher Aristotle, everything consists of a combination of one or more of the following four elements: earth, water, air and fire.
These are in fact more like the four states of matter, i.e. (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma. However, he also theorized that they transformed into new substances, forming what we see.
Alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Keep in mind that the periodic table contains numerous elements.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
There may also be alloys made up of minimal amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
In the universe, everything is made of matter and all matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
The atoms are incredibly tiny, so much so that trillions of them could get to the point at the end of this sentence.
After his invention, the pencil proved to be a good friend for many.
Unfortunately, with the introduction of new writing methods, the pencil has been relegated to a lower status and to less and less widespread use.
Today everyone writes messages on computer screens and they never have to approach a temperamatitis.
We can only wonder what fate the keyboard will have when something new arrives.
The principle that energy is needed to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons is the basis of the fission bomb's operation.
In practice, it's like rolling a heavy trolley on a hill, so by further dividing the core, a portion of that energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means that they tend to break in the presence of little or no thrust.
The surface of the Moon is made up of rocks and dust and its outer layer is called crust.
The crust has a thickness of about 70 km on the nearest side and 100 km on the farthest side.
It is thinner under the seas and thicker under the mountainous areas.
The marys could be more numerous on the nearby side because the crust is thinner. This made it easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on searching for what satisfies or attracts individuals.
According to these theories, people present certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they become adults.
These theories analyze what some people have in common and what drives them to want to do what they do, and what are the factors in the context in which they live that drive them to do or not do certain things.
Among the most widespread content theories are Maslow's Needs Hierarchy Theory and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
In general, when managers begin to direct their former colleagues, two behaviors may emerge. On the one hand, there are those who try to remain "one of the boys" (or girls).
The manager of this type finds it difficult to make unpopular decisions, implement disciplinary actions, evaluate performance, define and assign responsibility.
On the opposite extreme, the manager becomes a completely different person, who feels that he has to change the entire work of the team and do it his own way.
In the end, the leader is the person who is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This attitude often generates disagreements between the leaders and the rest of the team.
The standard of excellence of virtual teams is similar to that of conventional teams, but with some small differences.
Virtual team members often have the contact point function for their next physical group.
They often have more autonomy than members of conventional teams, as meetings may take place depending on the various time zones, which may not be understood by local management.
The existence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a fundamental element of a virtual team.
"Invisible team" is defined as the management team to which each member refers and is the one that sets the standards for each member.
Why should an organization have the will to face the long process that leads to the construction of a learning organization? A good reason to implement organizational learning concepts can be innovation.
When you manage to use all the resources available effectively in all the functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
As a result, the path of collaboration within an organization to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to meet the needs of the customer.
For an organization to define itself as innovative, leaders need to create a culture of innovation, as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) illustrates the continuum theory as a method used to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
The neurobiological results have demonstrated the physical existence of a theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition. The research area becomes narrower and therefore much more precise.
The link between brain pathology and behavior is the basis of scientists’ research.
It has long been known that certain types of brain damage, trauma, injuries and tumors can affect behavior and alter certain mental functions.
The introduction of new technologies allows us to see and investigate structures and brain processes never seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material to create simulation models that help us understand our mental processes.
Despite having a strong science fiction connotation, AI represents a very important branch of computer science that deals with the behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation of machines.
AI research includes the creation of machines to automate operations that require intelligent behavior.
Some examples of application are control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, as well as the recognition of writing, voice and facial.
These things have become distinct disciplines, focusing on providing solutions to real problems.
The AI system is nowadays often used in the economic, medical, engineering and military fields, as well as being integrated into various software applications for home computers and video games.
Excursions are a fundamental part of teaching. Often teachers would like to take their students to places that cannot be reached by bus.
The solution is offered by technology with virtual tours. Students can see museum artifacts, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful works of art sitting in class.
Sharing a virtual school trip is also a great pretext for sharing travel experiences and reflections with future classes.
For example, every year students at Bennet School, North Carolina, design a website on their trip to the capital; the website is redesigned every year, but previous versions are kept online and become an album.
Blogs can also help improve the writing of students. In fact, often their first experiences with blogs are characterized by poor grammar and spelling, but usually the presence of an audience changes things.
Since students are usually the most critical audience, in order to avoid negative reviews the author of the blog is committed to improving writing.
Blogs also "force students to become more aware of the moment that surrounds them." The need to feed the interest of the public motivates students to be ingenious and interesting (Toto, 2004).
The blog is a tool that aims to encourage collaboration and develop student learning well beyond the normal school day.
Proper use of blogs "can help students become more critical and analytical. By actively responding to Internet materials, students can define their position within the writings of others, as well as outline their perspectives on specific issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada’s evocative and bilingual capital, full of art galleries and museums that tell the country’s past and present.
Further south are the Niagara Falls and to the north you can admire the natural and pristine beauty of the Muskoka region and much more.
All this and more makes Ontario typically Canadian according to the opinions of foreigners.
The large areas further north are sparsely populated, some of which are almost uninhabited wildlands.
If you compare the population, the result can be surprising for many: in the United States the number of African-American citizens is higher than that of Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean, off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and its natural heritage makes it a continent of its own.
Almost all the smaller islands, known as luxury seaside resorts, are mostly independent nations or associated with France.
In the lands the Arabs also brought Islam, which undertook a long journey to the Comoros and Mayotte.
In the 15th century, the discovery of the Cape route from Europe to India by the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama paved the way for European influence and colonialism.
To the north, the region is bounded by the Sahel, while to the south and west it borders the Atlantic Ocean.
For female travellers: all are recommended to declare that they are married, irrespective of their actual marital status.
It is also useful to wear a ring (but not one that looks too expensive).
It is appropriate for women to realize that cultural differences can lead to what they themselves regard as harassment, and that it is not unusual to be followed, grasped by the arm, etc.
Have the firmness to refuse men, and do not be afraid to oppose them (cultural differences or not, there is no justification!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC; with the name of Anfa, it was a port of strategic importance used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merenids.
The Portuguese destroyed it to rebuild it under the name of the White House, which they abandoned in 1755 following an earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city called Daru l-Badya, then named Casablanca by Spanish merchants who chose these places for their commercial bases.
Across Morocco, Casablanca is one of the least interesting cities for shopping.
In the vicinity of the old Medina it is easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan products, such as tajin, ceramics, leather goods, narguilés and a lot of hardware, but all this is reserved only for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town located in the easternmost part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, not far from Rwanda.
In 2002, the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed Goma, burying most of the city's streets, especially those in the center.
While Goma is reasonably safe, it is advisable to document yourself well before making any visits outside Goma, so as to assess well the state of the clashes that still persist in the province of North Kivu.
The city is also the starting point for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano, as well as being one of the least expensive opportunities to see African mountain gorillas.
You can use a wedding-wedding (taxi-motorcycle) to move to Goma. The normal price (in local currency) is about 500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
Even as a result of its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuctu" ended up becoming a metaphor for exotic and distant land.
Today, Timbuktu is a decayed city, but for its reputation it remains a tourist attraction, also equipped with an airport.
In 1990 it was included in the list of UNESCO heritage sites that are in danger, due to the threat posed by desert sands.
In the Henry Louis Gates special of PBS "Wonders of the African World" was one of the main stages.
With its more Arabic than African touch, the city stands out clearly from the rest of the country.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa and winds east along the border with Mozambique, north border with Zimbabwe, and its southern border is represented by the Crocodile River.
With an area of 19,500 km2, the park comprises 14 different ecozones, each of which provides livelihood to a different wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the most important of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As for all national parks in South Africa, daily contributions are provided for conservation and entrance to the park.
Buying a Wild Card could also be useful, as it allows access to a selection of parks in South Africa or all South African national parks.
The island of Hong Kong, which gives its name to the entire territory, is the main destination for many tourists.
The series of buildings forming the Hong Kong skyline has been compared to a glittering bar chart, even more evident because framed by the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To enjoy the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and visit the waterfront of Kowloon in front.
Most of Hong Kong’s urban development has focused on the densely populated land on the north coast.
This is the place the English colonists chose for themselves, so if you’re looking for evidence of this land’s colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the largest coastal band of mangroves in the world. It extends for 80 km (50 mi) from the coast to the inland of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans have been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. The part of the forest included in the Indian territory takes the name Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are not only made up of mangrove swamps: there is also what remains of the imposing jungles that once covered the Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km2, of which about a third consists of swampy areas.
Since 1966 the Sundarbans have become a sanctuary for wildlife; the area is estimated to have 400 royal tigers of Bengal and about 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses leave from the inter-district bus station (on the other side of the river) throughout the day, although many (especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang) leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since service buses between different districts are often full, it will be good to buy the ticket a few days in advance.
Most of the neighborhoods are reached by comfortable and sturdy small Japanese buses.
Shared taxis are a convenient and fast way to get to nearby resorts, including Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The bridge over the Oyapock River is a broken bridge that connects the city of Oiapoque, in Brazil, to Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, in French Guyana.
Its two tracks have a height of 83 meters, is 378 meters long and has two lanes wide 3.50 meters.
Under the bridge the free vertical space is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but the opening to traffic took place only in March 2017.
In September 2017, when Brazil’s customs checkpoints are likely to be completed, the bridge should be fully operational.
The Guaranís were the most important indigenous group living in what is now eastern Paraguay. They were semi-nomadic hunters and also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was inhabited by other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycuru and the Payaguá, who lived on hunting, harvesting and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly called "The Great Province of the Indies", was born in the 16th century from the encounter between Spanish conquerors and indigenous groups.
The Spaniards began a period that lasted three centuries, the period of colonization.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has been able to retain much of its identity and native peculiarities.
Everyone knows that Argentina has one of the best teams and the best polo players in the world.
In December, in the polo fields of Las Cañitas, the most important tournament of the year takes place.
Here you can watch minor tournaments and matches at other times of the year.
For information about tournaments and the purchase of tickets for polo matches, please contact Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The Falklands have their own official currency, the Falklands pound (FKP), whose value equals that of the British pound (GBP).
The only bank on the islands, located in Stanley in front of the FIC West store, offers currency exchange service.
British pounds are generally accepted everywhere on the islands. At Stanley you can often also pay with credit cards and US dollars.
Credit cards are likely not accepted on the peripheral islands, although UK and US currencies may be accepted. Check in advance with the owners to decide an acceptable payment method.
It is almost impossible to exchange the currency of the Falklands outside the islands, so change the money before you leave.
Since Montevideo is south of the Equator, it is summer when in the northern hemisphere it is winter and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical region; during the summer months temperatures above 30°C are quite normal.
Winter can be deceptively cold: rarely temperatures get below zero, but the combination of wind and humidity gives the feeling of a temperature lower than that marked by the thermometer.
There are no defined "dry" and "rainy" seasons: the amount of rain remains almost constant throughout the year.
Although many of the park's animals are accustomed to human sight, the wildlife is still wild and must not be fed or disturbed.
The park authorities recommend keeping a distance of at least 100 yards/meter from bears and wolves and a distance of 25 yards/meter from all other wild animals.
No matter how docile they may look: bisons, elks, deer, bears, virtually all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured for not keeping an adequate distance. It is necessary to leave these animals an adequate space because they are large, wild and potentially dangerous animals.
Also keep in mind that smells can attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid bringing with you or cooking food with very strong smells, and try to keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of the Samoa Islands. It is located on the island of Upolu and its population is just under 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded between 1850 and 1860 and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
In this port there was the unfortunate naval stalemate of 1889, in which seven ships from Germany, the United States and Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships were sunk, with the exception of a British cruiser, and nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
In the course of the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city led to the killing of Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III, the supreme leader.
There are many beaches, since Auckland is located between two ports. The most popular are divided into three areas.
The beaches overlooking the North Shore Pacific Ocean (in the North Harbour district) stretch from Long Bay to the north to Devonport to the south.
These are mainly sandy beaches, safe for swimming, and most of them enjoy the shade of the trees of pohutukawa.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive in Auckland Central, in the elegant suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers, overlook the port of Waitemata.
These are beaches suitable for families sometimes a little crowded, surrounded by a wide choice of shops. You can swim safely.
The most famous local beer is a non-complex, pleasant and refreshing beer called "Number One". The other local beer is called "Manta".
You can have a lot of French wines, but the Australian and New Zealand wines could better cope with the trip.
The water from the local tap is totally safe to drink, but if you are afraid, bottled water is easy to find.
According to Australians, 'flat white' coffee is born from a foreign idea. 'espresso' is black short coffee, the cappuccino is covered with cream (not foam) and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is at the same level as the Belgian one. The fruit juices are expensive, but very good.
Many coral reef excursions take place throughout the year and injuries for one of these causes on the coral reef are rare.
Always ask for advice from the authorities, follow the directions and pay particular attention to safety warnings.
The cubomedus appear from October to April near the beaches and estuaries of the rivers north of Seventeen Seventy. Outside this period they can be found only occasionally.
Sharks are present, but rarely attack man. Most sharks fear him and tend to stay away.
The habitat of saltwater crocodiles consists mainly of the estuaries of the rivers north of Rockhampton, not living them actively in the ocean.
By booking in advance, the traveler has the serenity to find a place to sleep once he arrives at his destination.
Travel agencies often enter into agreements with certain hotels, but it is still possible to book other forms of accommodation, such as camping, through the same agencies.
Travel agencies generally offer packages including breakfast, airport transfers or even combined flight + hotel packages.
They may also keep the reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or to obtain additional documents necessary for your destination (e.g. visa).
However, any changes or requests must be submitted first to the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
On the occasion of some music festivals, most participants decide to camp on the spot, considering this aspect a crucial element of the experience.
To be close to the center of the action you need to arrive early and earn a space close to the music.
Remember that once the music is finished on the main stages, there may be sections of the festival where the music lasts until late at night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you cross the North Baltic Sea in winter, check the location of the cabin, since the crossing of the ice causes quite annoying noises for those who are most exposed to it.
Cruises in St. Petersburg include time to explore the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from the visa requirement (check the conditions).
Generally, casinos do everything to increase the time and money spent by their guests as much as possible. Typically, there are neither windows nor clocks, and the exits can be difficult to find.
They usually offer exclusive food, drinks, and entertainment to keep guests in a high mood to make sure they stay.
In some venues alcoholic beverages are offered by the house. However, the state of drunkenness alters the ability to judge and every good gambler knows how important it is to stay sober.
Anyone who decides to drive at high altitudes or on mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice or temperatures close to zero.
On icy and snowy lanes, the friction is reduced and you can’t drive like when you’re on clean asphalt.
During a snowstorm, so much snow can fall in a very short time that you stay stuck.
Precipitation and snowstorms, or the formation of ice or condensation on the vehicle windows, can also reduce visibility.
However, ice and snow are normal conditions in many countries, and traffic continues to flow almost continuously throughout the year.
Safaris are probably Africa’s biggest tourist attraction and the holiday hub of many visitors.
In its popular use, the term safari refers to trips made by land, especially in the savanna, to see the beautiful African wildlife.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get closer to cars, so normal equipment is enough to get good vision.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes fearful and for this reason it is possible to observe them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called "bush walk", "hiking safari", or "walking safari") is an excursion that can last a few hours or more days.
The Paralympics will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2012, and some of the events will take place in other locations across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics. The first Olympics were held in 1964.
If your booking for flights and accommodation for 2020 was made before the postponement was announced, you may find yourself in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary from one to the other, but most cancellation policies related to the coronavirus, at the end of March 2020, do not arrive until July 2020, when the Olympics are scheduled.
The cost of most tickets for events is expected to be between <0xC2><0xA5>2,500 and <0xC2><0xA5>130,000, while regular tickets will cost around <0xC2><0xA5>7,000.
Ironing wet clothes can make it easier to dry. Many hotels offer the use of iron and ironing board, even if they are not present in the room.
If you do not have an iron, or if you do not like to wear tight socks, you can try a hair dryer, if you have one available.
Be careful not to expose the fabrics to too high temperatures, to avoid shrinkage or, in the worst case, burns.
There are several ways to sanitize water and some of these are found to be more effective against specific risks.
In some areas it is enough to boil the water for a minute, in others it takes many minutes.
The effectiveness of the filters is variable, so in case of doubt, it is advisable to consider the purchase of packaged water inside sealed bottles from a reliable company.
Travelers may come into contact with animal parasites that are not prevalent in their regions of origin.
Parasites can spoil food, cause irritation or, at worst, cause allergic reactions, as well as transmitting poison or infections.
The same infectious diseases and dangerous animals that can injure or kill people by force are not usually qualified as harmful animals.
Duty Free purchases are an opportunity to purchase duty and excise-free products in certain locations.
Travelers heading to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a lot, especially on products such as alcohol and tobacco.
The stretch of the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway between Point Marion and Fairmont is the one that has the most difficult driving conditions, as it often crosses isolated areas between the vegetation.
If you do not have the habit of driving on country roads, it is advisable to keep your eyes open, as steep slopes, narrow streets and narrow curves predominate.
The speed limits exposed are significantly lower than those applied in the previous and subsequent sections (usually 35-40 mph / 56-64 km/h). Their strict observance is extremely important.
Strangely, however, in this area the level of coverage of the mobile service is much higher than that present in other sections of the route, for example in the Pennsylvania Wilds.
The German desserts are quite good and in Bavaria they are quite tasty and varied, similar to those of nearby Austria further south.
Fruit desserts are a classic timeless, from those with apples available all year round to those with cherries and plums, which make their appearance during the summer.
Several German bakery desserts also contain almonds, hazelnuts and other shelled fruits. The most popular cakes often go very well with a strong cup of coffee.
If you want to taste small but tasty desserts, you can orient yourself to those that, depending on the region, are called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
Curry is a dish prepared with herbs and spices combined with meat or vegetables.
The curry can appear both "dry" and "wet", depending on the amount of liquid contained.
In northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is normally used for curry in inland regions; in southern India and some other coastal region of the subcontinent, coconut milk is more commonly used.
Given the presence of 17,000 islands to choose from, the term Indonesian cuisine is a generic term covering a wide variety of regional cuisines that meet in the country.
However, when used without further specification, the term generally refers to foods originating from the central and eastern part of the main island, Java.
The Javanese cuisine, now widely spread throughout the archipelago, offers a number of dishes of simple preparation; its predominant flavors are given by the use of peanuts, peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The brackets are supports for the knight's feet and are hung on both sides of the saddle.
They provide greater stability to the knight but may present safety problems for the possibility that the knight's feet remain stuck there.
If a boy is pushed by a horse but has a foot stuck in the bracket, he could be dragged by the running horse. To minimize this risk, there are some safety measures that can be taken.
First of all, most knights wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth and rather thin sole.
Later, some saddles, especially English ones, have inserted safety bars, which cause a leather bracket to detach from the saddle when, in case of a fall, the knight pulls it back.
Cochamó Valley: the most important climbing destination in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, where a large number of huge walls and granite cliffs are built.
The peaks of the peaks include breathtaking views. Climbers from all over the world continually trace new paths on its walls, potentially endless.
Free-skiing sports, such as skiing and snowboarding, are very common and provide for slipping on the snow thanks to the use of skis or snowboards attached to the feet.
Skiing is one of the main tourist activities and boasts many enthusiasts, sometimes also referred to as "ski bums" (skiers for skiing), who devote entire holiday periods to the skiing activity in a particular area.
The principle behind skiing is very ancient: the first rock paintings depicting humans skiing date back to 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport originated at least in the 17th century; in 1861 the first recreational ski club in Australia was opened by the Norwegians.
Hiking on skis: the activity is also called off-piste skiing, mountaineering or trekking on skis.
It is connected, although it usually does not include them, to ski touring or skiing, which are practiced on steep terrain and require much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of the ski slope as a hiking trail.
If the conditions are good, you will be able to cover distances somewhat larger than those trails by walking, but only very rarely will you reach the speeds of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on beaten tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent but made up of many independent countries. Normally, to travel through more countries you would need to apply for a visa and passport control several times.
However, in this respect, the Schengen area functions rather as a single country.
If you stay within this area, you can normally go from border to border without having to go through passport controls again.
Similarly, if you are in possession of a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for visas for individual member countries, thus saving time, money and bureaucracy.
There is no universal definition of what makes an artifact an antique. Some tax agencies consider such an object to be at least 100 years old.
The definition has geographical differences with respect to the age limit which may be lower, as in the case of North America compared to Europe.
Craft items could be defined as antiques, although more recent than similar items produced in series.
Reindeer breeding is an important source of livelihood for the Sámi and the culture on which this trade rests is also the basis of many other professions.
Even over time, not all Sámi were involved in large-scale reindeer breeding; some lived fishing, hunting and similar activities, using reindeer primarily as work animals.
Today many Sámi practise modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the territory of the Sámi.
Although widely used, especially among non-Roma people, the word "gym" is often considered offensive because it is associated with negative stereotypes and a misperception of Roma people.
If a traveler’s warning is issued for the destination you will visit, there may be consequences on your travel health insurance or your travel cancellation insurance.
You may also be interested in the opinions of governments other than yours, but keep in mind that such opinions are aimed at the citizens of those governments.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East might face different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
The warnings are simply a brief summary of a country’s political situation.
The views expressed are often superficial, generic and simplistic compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
‘Adverse weather conditions’ means any hazardous weather phenomenon that can cause damage, serious social distress or the loss of human life.
Extreme weather conditions can occur anywhere in the world, and there are different types, depending on geography, topography and weather conditions.
Strong wind gusts, hail, rainfall above the norm and uncontrolled fires are manifestations and consequences of adverse weather conditions, similar to storms, tornadoes, sea trumpets and cyclones.
Among the meteorological phenomena of strong regional and seasonal intensity are storms, snowstorms, ice storms and sandstorms.
Travellers are advised to inquire about adverse weather conditions affecting their area, as they may affect travel planning.
Anyone who plans to visit a country potentially significant as a war zone must support vocational training.
Searching on the Internet 'Course on hostile environments' is likely to find the address of a local company.
A course will normally deal with all the issues discussed here in much more detail, usually using practical experience.
A course normally lasts 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing as well as many first aid and sometimes weapons training activities.
Books and magazines dealing with survival in nature are widespread, while few publications deal with war zones.
Travelers who are planning surgery to change their sex abroad must ensure that they have the documents valid for the return trip with them.
The intention of governments to issue passports with no sex information (X) or updated documents to match a desired name and gender is variable.
Equally variable is the availability of foreign governments to accept such documents.
Security inspections have also become much more scrupulous in the post-September 11 2001 era.
Transgender people in the pre-operative phase should not expect to pass the checks without their privacy and dignity being compromised.
Resac currents are formed by the return flow of waves that break on the beach, often near a coral reef or similar formations.
Given the underwater topology, the return flow is concentrated in some deeper sections where a strong current can form towards the open sea.
Most of the deaths occur due to fatigue in attempting to swim countercurrent, which may be impossible.
As soon as you get out of the current, returning to swimming will not be more difficult than normal.
Try to locate an area where you are not at risk of being trapped again, or consider whether to wait for rescue, based on your skills and whether you have been spotted.
The return shock manifests itself in a shorter time than the cultural shock (there is a shorter "honeymoon" phase), lasts longer and can be more serious.
Travelers who have found it easy to adapt to the new culture, sometimes have difficulty adjusting to the culture of their home country.
Upon returning home after living abroad, you will adapt to the new culture and have lost some of the uses of your home culture.
In the first experience abroad, you are likely to have met patient and understanding people, aware that travelers in a new country need to adapt.
Many people did not imagine that patience and awareness were necessary even for those who return home.
The spectacle of sounds and lights of the pyramid is what is most interesting in the area for children.
Before the start of the show, you will be able to admire the pyramids immersed in darkness and silence.
Normally you always hear the noise caused by tourists and sellers. The show of sounds and lights is just like a book of stories.
The Sphinx becomes the backdrop and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are projected onto the pyramids and each pyramid is illuminated.
Claimed by various countries, the South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, have the largest number of bases, of which sixteen are active in 2020.
The archipelago is 120 km north of the peninsula. King George Island is the largest and is home to the town of Villa Las Estrellas.
Among the other islands are Livingston Island and Deception; in the latter, the caldera of a still active volcano filled with water from the source to a magnificent natural harbor.
The land of Ellsworth is the region located south of the peninsula and overlooks the sea of Bellingshausen.
Here the mountains of the peninsula merge into the plateau, then re-emerge and form the mountains of Ellsworth, a 360 km chain cut in two by the Minnesota glacier.
The northern part, known as the Sentinel Chain, boasts the highest mountains of Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, which reaches 4892 m with Mount Vinson.
In remote areas, without cell phone coverage, a satellite phone may be the only possible alternative.
A satellite phone is not usually a substitute for a cell phone, because to make a call you have to be outdoors with the visual clearance up to the satellite.
The service is often used by recreational boats, including recreational ones, as well as missions that need data and voice remotely.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide you with more information about connecting to this service.
One of the most popular options among those planning to take a sabbatical year is to travel and learn.
It is particularly prevalent among neo-diplomats, since they can take a year before starting university without compromising their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a course abroad in the sabbatical year can actually increase your chances to resume higher education upon returning to your country of origin.
Typically, enrolling in these educational programs requires paying a fee.
Finland is the ideal destination for those who love to sail. In the "Land of a Thousand Lakes" there are also thousands of islands, within the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
You don’t necessarily need a yacht for archipelagos and lakes.
Although the coastal archipelagos and larger lakes are certainly vast enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Nautical is the national pastime of Finland, where one boat is counted every seven or eight people.
This is also the case in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but in general it is rather unusual (e.g. in the Netherlands the ratio is one to forty).
Most of the different Baltic cruises include a multi-day stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic town for two whole days, returning to the ship in the evening to sleep.
For landing you will not need a separate visa (from 2009) using on-board excursions.
Some brochures also offer cruises in Berlin, Germany. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not close to the sea, also the visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Flying can scare people of all ages and conditions, especially if they have never flown before or had some traumatic experience.
There is nothing to be ashamed of: it is not dissimilar to the personal fears and aversions that many people manifest towards other things.
For some people, understanding how planes work and what happens during a flight can be useful to overcome a fear based on what is unknown, or on not having control.
Couriers are well paid to deliver products quickly. Often the timing is very important in the case of company documents, goods or spare parts for urgent repair.
For some routes, larger companies use their own planes, but for other routes and in the case of smaller companies, problems emerged.
On some routes, air shipments would take days for discharge and customs.
The only way to make it arrive faster would be to ship it as a hold baggage. And this is where you come into play, since the regulations of the airlines do not allow to ship baggage without a passenger.
To fly in first class or business class the most obvious way is to pay off a nice amount for the privilege (or, even better, to convince your company to do so).
However, the price to pay is high: indicatively, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economic fare for business trips and up to eleven times the fare for those in first class!
In general, on direct flights from A to B, it is not worth looking for discounts on first class or business class seats.
Airlines know well that there is a category of travelers willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of arriving quickly and comfortably at their destination, and consequently apply certain rates.
The capital of Moldova is Chi<0xC5><0x9F>in<0xC4><0x83>u and the local language is Romanian. However, Russian is also very common.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that in the past has been the scene of an ethnic conflict.
In 1994, the conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in the eastern part of Moldova, with its own government and currency, but not recognized by any UN member state.
Despite the failure of political negotiations, economic relations between these two areas of Moldova have been restored.
The predominant religion in Moldova is the Christian-Orthodox religion.
Izmir is Turkey's third largest city, with a population of about 3.7 million; it is the second largest port after Istanbul and an important transport junction.
The ancient city of Izmir lies on a huge bay, is surrounded by mountains and is currently a modern, evolved and active shopping center.
Although the city exudes an atmosphere more like that of Mediterranean Europe than that of traditional Turkey, the wide avenues, buildings with glass facades and modern shopping centers are dotted with characteristic red roofs, the 18th century market and ancient mosques and churches.
In the village of Haldarsvik you can enjoy beautiful views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and you can visit a unique octagonal church.
In the church hall, on some of the tombs, there are interesting marble sculptures of doves.
Half an hour is enough to walk around the enchanting village.
To the north is the romantic and charming city of Sintra, easily reachable. It has become famous in the eyes of foreigners thanks to the brilliant story of its splendors written by Lord Byron.
The Scotturb 403 bus regularly connects with Sintra, and stops in Cabo da Roca.
Also to the north, visit the great sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima (place of worship), place of famous Marian apparitions all over the world.
Remember that the site you are visiting is basically a common ditch, and it has almost incalculable meaning for a significant part of the world’s population.
There are still many surviving men and women in these places, and many others who have seen their loved ones murdered or made to work to the death, both Jews and non-Jews.
Treat the place with all the dignity, seriousness and respect it deserves. Avoid jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Avoid slandering these places by clapping structures with marks or graffiti.
In the city of Barcelona, the official languages are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the population prefers to speak Catalan, the vast majority are able to understand it; Spanish is known by practically everyone.
However, most of the signs are written exclusively in Catalan, which is by law the first official language.
Spanish, however, is also widely used for public transport and other services.
In subway, regular ads are only in Catalan. Any unscheduled service interruptions are communicated in a wide variety of languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese, thanks to an automatic system.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, rude and presumptuous.
Even though it is often just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to get well in Paris continues to be to behave at its best, relating as a "bien élevé" person. This will definitely facilitate your movements.
The rough outward appearance of the Parisians will quickly fade away if you show some basic good manners.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is rich in forests, predominantly beech, peach and fir, and is characterized by a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
Thanks to a multiplicity of microclimates, soils and different altitude levels it presents a wide variety of plant communities.
The area also hosts a huge variety of animal and bird species.
In these places live rare species such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wild cat and cedar rooster, alongside several other more widespread animal species.
When visiting monasteries, women are required to wear skirts that cover their knees and cover their shoulders.
Most monasteries provide stolen items for women who arrive unprepared, but if you already have one, especially if you have bright colors, you will earn a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men are required to wear long trousers up to the knees.
These can also be borrowed from the warehouse at the entrance; however, clothes are not washed after each user, so wearing these skirts may not feel comfortable. For men, a unique size for everyone!
Majorcan cuisine, like that of similar areas of the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) and uses olive oil everywhere.
The Pa amb Oli is a simple popular dinner, typical of the summer season: bread with olive oil, tomato and all the seasonings available, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, in addition to the pronoun "You" used for the form of courtesy that stands for "You", always start with the uppercase, even if they appear in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important mechanism for distinguishing certain verbs and complements.
This aspect probably also facilitates reading, although the need to understand whether a verb or adjective is used in a substantiated form makes writing rather complex.
The Italian pronunciation is relatively simple since most words are pronounced as they are written.
The main letters to pay attention to are the c and the g, since their pronunciation changes according to the vowel that follows.
Also make sure to pronounce "r" and "rr" differently: dear means beloved, while carro means carriage.
Persian has a relatively simple grammar and most of the time is regular.
Therefore, reading this basic grammar manual could help you a lot with Persian grammar and in the understanding of sentences.
It goes without saying that if you already know a Romance language, learning Portuguese will be easier.
However, people with minimal knowledge of the Spanish language can come to the hasty conclusion that Portuguese is quite similar and therefore should not be studied separately.
Today, pre-modern observatories are usually obsolete and serve as museums or educational places.
Since light pollution in their golden age was not a problem as it is today, they are usually located in cities or campuses, more easily reachable than those built in modern times.
Most modern telescopes destined for research are huge structures in waste areas where weather conditions are favorable.
The admiring of cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept was originally from China, where plum blossoming was preferred.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom festivals were organized by the emperor only for himself and other members of the aristocracy close to the imperial court.
Plants give their best when they are in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to take even "only" one specimen.
If you visit an Italian garden, even collecting some specimens of plants will cost you to get away from this place, without discussion.
In general, Singapore is a very safe and easy city to go around; you can buy virtually anything once you arrive.
But being in the "high tropics", only a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to deal with the hot (always) and strong sun (more rarely, when the sky is serene).
Some buses also head north to Hebron, the traditional place where the Bible patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their wives were buried.
Make sure that the bus you want to take reaches the interior of Hebron and does not stop at the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland water courses can be a great theme around which to organize a holiday.
For example, you can visit the castles in the Loire Valley and the Rhine Valley, you can take a cruise to visit the interesting cities of the Danube or you can sail on the Erie Canal.
In addition, they define the routes of well-known hiking trails and cycling trails.
Christmas is one of the most important festivals of Christianity and celebrates the birth of Jesus.
Much of the traditions associated with this holiday have also been adopted by non-Christian people in Christian countries and by non-Christians around the world.
A tradition is to spend Easter night staying awake in an open-air place to admire the dawn.
There are, of course, Christian theological explanations behind this tradition, but it could very well be a pre-Christian ritual linked to spring and fertility.
In the more traditional Churches, an Easter Vigil is often celebrated on the Saturday night of the Easter weekend, with congregations often starting the ceremony at midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands arrived by swimming, flying or floating.
Since the distance from the mainland was considerable, the mammals could not cope with the journey, which made the giant turtle the main pasture animal in the Galapagos.
Numerous mammals such as goats, horses, cows, rats, dogs and cats were introduced to the Galapagos after the arrival of man.
If you visit the territories of the Arctic or Antarctic during the winter, it will be possible to experience the polar night, when the sun remains below the horizon.
This phenomenon offers the possibility to watch the northern aurora, because the sky remains dark almost all day long.
Since the territories are sparsely populated, light pollution is often not a problem and you can also enjoy the stars.
In Japan, the working culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners tend to be used to.
Office clothing normally consists of a jacket and tie or a tailleur and is addressed to colleagues with a surname or a professional title.
The harmony of the workplace is of crucial importance, as it gives importance to the group's commitment rather than praising individual achievements.
Workers often have to receive the approval of their superiors about every decision, and they are expected to follow the instructions without asking questions.
