Twenty-eight-year-old chef found dead in San Francisco shop
The twenty-eight-year-old chef, who recently moved to San Francisco, was in the staircase of a local shop this week.
But the victim’s brother says he doesn’t know who would want to hurt him and adds, “He’s finally starting to make it.”
The body found at Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning was identified as an eighteen-year-old resident of San Francisco Frank Galicia, the coroner's office said.
The San Francisco Police Department said it was a violent death and an investigation is underway.
Victim's brother Louis Galicia told ABC's KGO station in San Francisco that Frank, who was a former Boston serial cook, got his dream job as a chef at the Sons & Daughters restaurant six months ago.
A spokesman for Sons & Daughters said he was "shocked and devastated" by his death.
“We have a small team that works as a close-knit family. We will miss it very much,” the spokesman said.
In this difficult time, our thoughts and sorrows belong to Frank’s family and friends.
Louis Galicia stated that Frank had first slept in the hostels, but that he had recently “been finally starting to prosper.”
"He found an apartment, he was walking with a girl," Louis Galicia told KGO.
Louis Galicia said he had no idea who would want to hurt his younger brother.
He had a kind soul and a great heart.
When he wanted to connect with his family, he always cooked for us, made dinner for us," said Louis Galicia.
He never wanted to take part in a fight.
He was a brother who took things as they were.
“Even if everything else in the world was wrong, he was the rough diamond that shined every day,” he said.

Czech Railways has invested more than 31 billion in the modernization of vehicles.
They have air conditioning and new toilets.
Over the past six years, state-owned carriers have invested over 31 billion kronor in vehicle modernization.
A third of the cars are currently air-conditioned, and about half of the trains have a new closed toilet system.
However, the amounts for modernisation in individual years with the exception of 2012 are gradually decreasing.
Over the past six years, Czech railways have invested over 31 billion kronor in modernising vehicles.
A third of the cars are currently air-conditioned, and about half of the trains have a new closed toilet system.
The money spent resulted in a reduction of the average age by two years for locomotives and separate units and by six years for classic wagons.
The largest share of the investments was given to the carrier in regional transport, where about 60 percent of the money was directed, and 40 percent of the company invested in the renovation of vehicles for long-distance transport.
The average age of locomotives and units is currently 19 years.
However, modernised older vehicles are counted as completely new in this indicator.
If vehicle upgrades were not counted, the average age of the drive vehicles in the Czech Republic would increase by ten years.
On average, passenger cars are slightly older, with an average age of 23 years when counting upgrades.
If only the age from the date of manufacture were taken into account, the average age of these vehicles would be 33.4 years.
Classic kits made up of wagons and pulled by a locomotive, however, are gradually disappearing from the Czech and global railways in recent years and are being replaced by motor or electric units.
Between 2011 and 2015, the number of locomotives fell from 280 to 223, and the number of classic wagons fell from 2716 in 2011 to 2132 in the middle of this year.
In particular, the carrier was rid of old vehicles equipped with leather seats and doors without the possibility of locking the openings during the drive.
From January to July, the carrier had 110 of these cars crashed.
From the investments that <0xC4><0x8C>D plans to make in the fleet in the near future, it is possible to mention, for example, the purchase of 50 wagons for speeds up to 200 kilometers per hour, which the carrier plans to deploy on the international line Prague - Bratislava - Budapest, or a framework contract for the purchase of electric units for domestic roads.
The contract includes the collection of up to 30 engine and 20 electrical units.
The authorities know about illegal advertising for a quarter of a year, they can't get rid of it.
We're totally helpless, they admit.
For a quarter of a year, the editorial board of the online newspaper Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz has been following the story of a billboard in southern Bohemia, which now attracts motorists to visit Lipna, where there is not only a touristically interesting walk in the crowns of trees, but also an Olympic park.
Highway managers know it's black, but they say they can't do anything about it.
There are hundreds, maybe thousands, of such ads across the country.
According to officials, there is a cathartic law, because of which it is not possible to remove illegal mobile billboards immediately.
First, a complicated bureaucratic wheel is needed.
In the meantime, however, the company will change its name and the office is short on it.
Or just move the ad by a few meters and the official process has to start again.
A quarter of a year ago, the Directorate of Roads and Highways admitted that a black billboard is on our land near the state road at the main road from <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice to Lipno.
But even three months were not enough for officials to get rid of unauthorized portable construction with a huge advertising poster.
As if no one would mind standing right next to the highway, in a 50-metre protective zone, where nothing can stand for safety.
Road managers say they can’t easily cope with the billboard because of the perforated law.
Maybe load it up and take it away.
"We can't afford that," said Nina Ledvinová, a spokeswoman for the Directorate of Highways and Roads, referring to the complex bureaucratic wheel that must prevent the removal of the billboard by law.
The case of this particular billboard, the fate of which the online newspaper Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz began to follow in detail in the spring, is not unique and points to a general problem that the state and the authorities cannot solve efficiently and quickly.
In southern Bohemia alone, the editorial board counted dozens of similar mobile ads placed against the rules just next to or near the highway.
There are other regions in the same way.
"We have difficulties in forcing the company to remove the pilgrims," confirms Ji<0xC5><0x99>í Klása, head of the transport department of the <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xBD> Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice Regional Office, whose colleagues deal with similar stories.
According to the class, there is a hole-in-the-wall law that binds officials.
First, he must intricately address the billboard owner to put the ad away.
However, the heads of companies are often out of reach or know the phony, which was already described by Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz in the past, when the issue began to be interested in more detail: it is enough to move the mobile stand with advertising by a few meters and the officials can throw the previous call to remove the black ad.
That’s because the office has to determine exactly where the illegal billboard stands.
"If someone moves it and the coordinates suddenly disagree, it is seen as a new device and we have to contact the owner again," explains Ji<0xC5><0x99>í Klása.
The new law will not help.
The change could be brought by a new law that will ban billboards on highways from September next year and limit them on first-class roads.
Critics point out that the rules for combating illegal and easily transferable ads will remain the same as before.
And the authorities won't let that happen.
Firms can earn tens to hundreds of millions of crowns a year on renting illegal land, and no one can.
For example, a billboard attracting Lipno belongs to Commerz Billboard.
Officials know her well: the <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xBD> Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice Magistrate is currently running three administrative proceedings for black billboards.
The company faces a fine of three thousand dollars in each case.
These are several advertisements that were placed without permission in the class I road safety zone.
The process is not yet over, says Jaroslav Mráz, head of the transport department of the Czech Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice Magistrate.
Advertising, which is of interest to Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz, although it does not yet appear among these cases, but will most likely be added to them soon.
According to a spokeswoman for the RSD, Nina Ledvinova, the company did not respond to repeated written requests for removal, and the case will then reach the table of regional and then probably magistrate officials.
Commerz Billboard is one of those suspicious companies that cannot be contacted.
It does not take over the post office and the official headquarters in <0xC5><0xBD>i<0xC5><0xBE>kov was cancelled more than six years ago.
It's not even clear who's behind it.
In the past, the company’s mail went to South Bohemian entrepreneur Anton Fischer, who had a sharp dispute with the head of the Czech representative office of the brand Hyundai.
Fischer, whose company Euro Billboard leases and offers the spaces from Comerz Billboard to advertisers, has rejected any connection in the past.
At the same time, this spring, when <0xC5><0x98>SD began to take an interest in advertising for Lipno, Fischer had officials send a letter for the mysterious company Commerz Billboard to his boarding house, where the new company is supposedly based.
However, no one has been contacted from this address to this day.
A futile fight.
Similar silence or opaque changes in seats are not uncommon.
A few years ago, we gradually fined one company two million crowns.
But she changed the name and the ICO and there was nothing to deal with.
The executor returned the case, the ads continued, perhaps elsewhere.
We are quite helpless against such companies and their business practices.
It's like fighting windmills, admits one of the officials, on condition of anonymity.
No one has yet decided on the new law in this regard.
I have spoken to a number of people who have raised the issue.
However, they have not developed any activity so far.
On the contrary, there were MPs who wanted to extend the deadline for the preservation of billboards at the main Czech communications.
The government has rejected it.
Billboards are not only a sensitive and somewhat schizophrenic topic for national, but also for regional and municipal politics.
On the one hand, they know about the social demand for their limitations, on the other hand, they themselves need them for advertising in election campaigns.
I do not support the relatively well-established impression that when something does not work, it is necessary to change the laws.
Farmers are harvesting less crops this year, but more rapeseed and poppy, statistics estimate.
According to estimates of the Czech Statistical Office, the harvest of cereals this year will be 6.7 percent lower than last year.
Yet this year’s crops are higher than the average for the last five to ten years.
In contrast, the harvest of rapeseed (by 3.9 percent) and mackerel (2.5 percent) will be higher.
Grain harvest will be 6.7 percent lower this year than last year.
Farmers are harvesting 7.2 million tons of grain.
This is the result of an estimate published by the Czech Statistical Office as of July 15.
The initial estimate a month ago was more pessimistic and predicted a decimal decline compared to last year.
Last year’s harvest was above average.
This year’s crops are higher than the average for the last five or ten years.
On the contrary, this year the harvest of rapeseed and poppy will be higher.
Growers are harvesting 3.9 percent more than they were a year ago when they had 1.256 million tons under their roof.
This year’s poppy yield could be 2.5 percent higher than last year’s.
The projected decline in cereal production is due to both a decrease in hectare yield of 3.7 per cent to 5.71 tons per hectare and a decrease in seed area.
This year, farmers have planted three percent fewer fields.
Winter wheat, which is the most important cereal for the Czech Republic, is estimated to be harvested by 3.3 percent less this year.
Farmers planted it in more fields.
However, a lower yield per hectare will be signed, which will fall to 6.04 tons.
Approximately one-fifth of the decline is predicted for spring barley, which is most often used to brew beer.
The reduction in crop yields is worth a 15.2 percent reduction in seed areas, but also a lower yield per hectare.
Winter barley, on the other hand, will be born 6.3 percent more.
The wheat harvest will also grow.
Grapefruit yields are estimated at 1.305 million tonnes, up from last year.
The seed area has expanded by 7.3 percent.
But the yield per hectare will be 3.2 percent lower than last year.
This year’s rape crop will exceed the 10-year average by 13.3 percent, with sowing an area one-third larger than ten years ago.
In the last four years, there has also been an increase in poppy fields.
This year, farmers planted it on 35,543 hectares.
Compared to 2008, when the poppy was grown on a record 70,000 hectares in the Czech Republic, it is half a field.
Thanks to the expansion of the seed areas, this year's harvest of poppy will be richer.
It rises from last year by 2.5 percent to 27,423 tons.
The yield per hectare will be 6.1 percent lower.
Olomouc police accused two men of assault with a knife and machete, the court sent them to custody.
Police have charged two attackers who attacked a 35-year-old man with a knife and machete in central Olomouc on Tuesday.
"Although the attacker tried to escape, he suffered urine and cut injuries that required treatment in the hospital and further treatment," police spokeswoman Marie Strbáková said.
The two suspects were arrested by police immediately after the attack.
The plaintiff filed a court motion to detain them and the court acquitted him on Friday.
Both men face three to ten years in prison.
Police have charged two detainees with assaulting a 35-year-old man in the center of Olomouc with a knife and machete.
The attackers caused him urine and cut wounds, the man ended up in the hospital.
The attack was preceded by an incident between two groups of people that took place on Tuesday at noon in the Freedom class, police said.
The perpetrators ended up in detention, reported Olomouc police spokeswoman Marie <0xC5><0xA0>trbáková.
A mass clash between two families took place in the garden area in front of the Tratoria bar in the immediate vicinity of the center of Olomouc.
After an aggressive verbal dispute, two attackers attacked the 35-year-old with a knife and machete.
Although the man tried to flee, he sustained urine and cut injuries that required treatment in the hospital and further treatment, a police spokesman said.
The clash, which attracted a lot of attention in the city centre and caused several police patrols and officers to intervene on the spot, was a family dispute.
The criminalists of a 34-year-old man from Slovakia and a 37-year-old man from Olomouc have accused him of attempting serious harm to health and rioting.
The plaintiff filed a court motion to detain them and the court acquitted him on Friday, a spokeswoman added.
The machete was also used in the center of Olomouc during the mass battle by the attackers five years ago, it happened only a few tens of meters away, in front of the disco Varna in Riegrov Street.
Police said at the time that a group of about ten foreigners with guns attacked the company's guests standing in front of the entrance.
According to the police, they had knives, sticks and machetes in their hands.
The court then punished the two attacking foreigners with a conditional sentence.
Abandoned and empty houses in the center of Prague.
You will be surprised, maybe you walk around them every day.
One of the most egregious examples of an unused and empty house is the large building of the former IPB headquarters in the middle of Senová<0xC5><0xBE>ná Square.
It should have been a hotel for a long time.
But still nothing.
Is it necessary to build new and new apartments and offices in the metropolis?
And what to use existing, often architecturally valuable and protected?
Right in the center of Prague, in the immediate vicinity of Wenceslas Square, there are several office buildings that, despite their location, size and often even monumental protection, are deserted and empty.
We have selected the properties in the center with the help of the project Prázdnédomy.cz, which maps long-term empty properties in the Czech Republic.
Houses are usually the victims of financial problems of their owners, opaque relationships between companies, or belonging to a state that cannot or does not want to get rid of them.
There are more empty houses in the Czech Republic than homeless people.
Whether the owners pay a special tax for them, the initiative wants

Clinton's husbands made $10.6 million last year.
Trump refuses to publish his tax returns.
Hillary Clinton and her husband, President Bill Clinton, made $10.6 million last year.
More than a million dollars were donated to Clinton’s charity.
Most of Clinton’s income – more than $6 million – is for their speeches.
Trump refuses to publish his tax returns.
U.S. Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton released her tax returns on Friday, raising pressure on her Republican rival Donald Trump to do the same.
Hillary Clinton and her husband, former president Bill Clinton, made $10.6 million last year, the AP reported.
Most of Clinton’s revenue – over $6 million – is behind their speeches, mostly from the period before April 2015, when Clinton launched her pre-election campaign.
The tax report showed that Clinton’s spouses levied a federal income tax of 34.2 percent last year, followed by a state and local income tax of nine percent.
In total, they paid 43.2% of their income on taxes.
But Trump has a problem with a similar step, he has not yet decided to publish a tax return.
There is a certain possibility that Donald Trump does not pay any taxes at all, Clinton wrote on Twitter a few minutes after her confession was published.
Clinton has repeatedly returned to secrecy about Trump’s revenues, among other things to raise doubts about whether her rival is actually as rich as she claims.
Trump’s assets are estimated to be billions of dollars.
Lower earnings would damage the reputation of a Republican candidate as a successful entrepreneur.

The polio outbreak in Nigeria has resurfaced.
Islamists from Boko Haram opposed a consistent vaccination and killed doctors.
In Nigeria, cases of childhood polio have reappeared.
In the northeast of the country, the government has declared an emergency vaccination, as two children infected with the disease have become paralyzed.
Vaccines were transported by helicopters.
The affected area was occupied by Islamist terrorists from Boko Haram, who prevented vaccination and even killed doctors.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the virus circulated unobserved there.
In the northeast of Nigeria, the emergency vaccination of children against polio will begin, as two children infected with the disease have become paralyzed there.
In Africa, polio was last diagnosed two years ago in Somalia.
The Nigerian government has announced that one million children will be vaccinated in the state of Borno and another four million in the surrounding states.
Nigerian military helicopters on Friday, according to the AP, quickly transported vaccines against childhood polio to the affected northeastern part of the country, where Islamist terrorists from Boko Haram are operating.
The World Health Organization (WHO) said the virus had been circulating unobserved in the area for many years.
Extremists from Boko Haram have defended vaccinations in the past and even killed doctors.
Their attacks on Thursday also made it impossible for doctors to get to the areas where children with polio were detected.
Both affected toddlers came with refugees from a part of Nigeria newly liberated from Boko Haram.
The director of the WHO section responsible for eradicating polio, Michel Zaffran, told the BBC that vaccinations in Nigeria will begin as early as next week.
In Borno state, the Islamic radical group Boko Haram has been active for a long time.
The area was only made available to international organizations and the government earlier this year, when Boko Haram was able to weaken it in a fundamental way.
Nigerian Health Minister Isaac Adewole has admitted that new cases of polio are a big disappointment for the country, as Nigeria wanted to announce next year that polio had been eradicated.
The WHO noted that it is possible that although the disease did not appear for two years, it still spread among children.
Children under the age of five will now be vaccinated.
In 2012, Nigeria accounted for half of all cases of polio in the world.
While polio was still present in 125 countries in 1988, it now persists in only three regions - Afghanistan and Pakistan and northern Nigeria.
The pope met with former prostitutes in Rome.
He listened to the stories of fallen women.
Pope Francis met with 20 former prostitutes who escaped from a gang of scoundrels thanks to police.
The Pope listened to their difficult life stories and urged them to look to the future with confidence.
With this meeting, Francis wanted to draw attention to trafficking in human beings and to call for an intensification of the fight against it.
In Rome, Pope Francis met with twenty former prostitutes who had been freed by police from the power of a gang of scoundrels.
The head of the Catholic Church listened for more than an hour to the moving stories of the fallen women and then urged them to look to the future with confidence, a Vatican spokesman said.
Among the former prostitutes visited by Francis were six women from Romania, four from Albania, seven from Nigeria and one from Tunisia, Italy and Ukraine.
Their average age is around 30.
All of them were subjected to cruel physical violence during forced prostitution, according to the Vatican.
With his visit, Francis wanted to draw attention to trafficking in human beings and call for an intensification of the fight against it, the Pope’s spokesman said.
Francis often draws attention to the fate of people on the fringes of society.
On Thursday, for example, he had lunch with Syrian refugees who arrived in the Vatican this year in April and in June thanks to his personal invitation.
France is going to attack the jihadist factories.
Without the help of Muslims, this will not happen.
In the fight against radical Islamism, the Muslims themselves have to help.
In addition, the government of Prime Minister Manuel Valls is planning a major change in the functioning of mosques and the education of clergy.
Since last December, we have closed 20 mosques and prayed.
And others will follow, the interior minister announced.
There are more than 100 jihadists in the country.
"If Muslims do not help the state to fight those who violate public freedom, it will be increasingly difficult for France to guarantee that freedom," said Prime Minister Manuel Valls.
In particular, it intends to ensure that only imams who were educated in France preach in mosques and prayer houses.
At the same time, he wants to stop funding mosques from abroad.
Currently, around 20 percent of the money for the construction of new mosques comes from abroad, mostly from Morocco, Algeria and the Gulf countries.
It is also because of this that preachers enter the mosques, which can sow radicalism in France.
"Our country must show that Islam is compatible with democracy," he added.
The key to ensuring that he meets these goals will be the new French Islamic Foundation.
It should serve as a bridge between the secular state and the Muslim minority.
No more money from abroad.
The French Foundation for Islam was founded in 2005 by then Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin.
Already at that time, the foundation should have contributed to the transparency of financial flows between mosques and the countries that finance their construction.
But the institutions were soon hit by internal contradictions and rivalry.
"It's a total failure," Valls said recently.
On the French political scene, after the attack on Charlie Hebdo magazine in January 2015, the debate about a new institution to replace the dysfunctional foundation began.
All of this was accelerated by another terrorist attack in France, carried out by radicalized Islamists on behalf of the Islamic State.
French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve recently announced that a new foundation would be set up in October.
It will have two main tasks - to ensure the financing of mosques from domestic sources and also to supervise imams.
It is not yet clear where he will take the money not only for the construction of new mosques, but also for various educational centers.
Several proposals are being considered.
One of them is a special fee or tax on halal food.
Here, in practice, halal food vendors would pay for providing certification.
Some of that money would then go to the foundation’s cash register.
A contribution of ten to twenty euros (270 to 540 kronor) could then be paid by French pilgrims who go to Mecca.
Every year, about 30,000 people go there on a traditional pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia.
And not just that.
According to the prime minister, in the future, only ministers who have undergone special educational programs at French universities should work in mosques.
This should ensure that the preaching is in line with democracy.
We close the radical mosques.
At the same time, the French government is campaigning against radicals.
And others will follow, the interior minister recently announced.
There is no place in France for those who declare hatred in mosques and do not respect some of the principles of our country, such as equality between women and men.
There are an estimated 2,500 mosques and prayer houses in the country.
It is estimated that about 120 of them are under the influence of radical Islamism.
Since 2012, authorities have expelled about 80 imams and are considering doing so for several dozen others.
But not everyone thinks that the actions of the government can significantly counter radicalism.
Those who want to radicalize will do the same.
This is not happening in mosques, young people are radicalizing on the Internet, said Severine Labat, an expert at the National Center for Scientific Research.
Kelemen lost in the first round of the sprint with the star Baugé.
To progress to the eighth final, the Czech track cyclist must compete in repair rides.
Track cyclist Pavel Kelemen at the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro after progressing from sprint qualification among the top eighteen lost in the 1st round to the French giant Grégory Baugé, a silver defender from previous games in London.
He has to fight for progress to the eighth final in repair rides.
At the start of the royal discipline on the track stood 27 riders and the best Czech racer of the moment has assigned himself the fourteenth best time.
He reached the 200 with a flying start in 9,969 seconds.
In the main elimination phase, he was expected to qualify by the fifth Baugé, who already has a bronze from Ria in the team sprint.
Kelemen, in the end, intrigued the experienced Frenchman, but he watched the process.
Jason Kenny's gold advocacy team has done a great job.
Twenty-eight-year-old Briton scored the third fastest 200 in history and won the qualification in the Olympic record of 9,551.
As expected, he also easily dealt with the last forward, which was the German Maximilian Levy.
The British quartet was also successful in the setup with Bradley Wiggins, who set a new world record of 3:50,570 in the 4 km race and moved on to the final.
The record high of 3:51,659, which the British had held for four years since the London Olympics, improved by more than a second.
Young doctors push: They want fresh wind in the field
Representatives of young doctors met to approve new steps in their dispute over the new contract.
The Young Physicians Council (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) must apply to the entire council for support for further professional events starting in early September.
The JDC says the ministers have failed to resolve the issues regarding the contract.
Young doctors and medical students voted in July to reject the contract agreed with the BMA.
58% of its members who took part in the election were rejected.
In a letter to members posted on Thursday night on Twitter, JDC chairman Ellen McCourt said the government had "continued to remain silent" on the issues, prompting it to reject the contract.
She said: “In this light, the executive branch of the JDC decided by a vote to reject the proposed new treaty altogether and to request new formal negotiations on all issues.”
In response to the government's silence, the JDC Executive Board today formally requested a special meeting of the BMA Board to approve the ongoing program of the threatened sectoral events from early September.
The dispute led young doctors to six strikes this year, including the first general strikes in the history of the NHS.
The leader of young doctors at BMA, Dr. Johann Malawana, resigned after the decision to reject the agreed terms of the contract recommended by BMA.
He told BMA members at pre-voting meetings before 54,000 young doctors and medical students that the deal was good and should be accepted.
After the vote, the Minister of Health said that the contract would be a burden for doctors in England.
Russia and Turkey: The Alliance of the “Incompatible”?
It was a gesture that ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and announce a formal end to the eight-month-long verbal war and economic sanctions.
But while Vladimir Putin welcomed the Turkish counterpart in the luxury hall of the palace in St. Petersburg, I had the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation more.
It was hand-in-hand, yes.
But Putin did not smile and hardly emitted warmth from him, even according to his measured standards.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, has repeatedly spoken of his "dear friend" Mr Putin - five times, as one of the reports states.
I didn't count it.
He also promised that relations with Russia will not only return to their pre-crisis levels, but will be even better.
Another day, one of the local newspapers wrote that Erdogan acted as if nothing bad ever happened.
I think his enthusiasm revealed the exact opposite.
But the persistent cold, which radiated from Putin, showed that the Russian leader had not forgotten anything.
The real cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening speech: the shooting down of a Russian warplane by Turkey on the Syrian border.
Moscow’s reaction was furious.
Putin gave the wounds around him and accused Ankara of stabbering Moscow in the back.
It was even worse when it came from an alleged friend.
Rebuilding real trust will be difficult, perhaps even impossible.
Russian public opinion has also changed since December.
For months, state-controlled media has been conducting a massive all-out campaign against Ankara.
Suddenly it looked like the Turks could do anything.
More serious was the accusation from top government officials that Erdogan’s own family benefited from the illegal oil trade in parts of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He vehemently denied this.
But in St. Petersburg, there was an official message that it was time to move on.
After all, this meeting only happened because Putin received an apology he had asked of President Erdogan.
Russia could have declared some kind of victory.
For Ankara, the benefits of the ceasefire are clear.
First of all, Erdogan was nearly stripped of power last month during a failed coup and therefore needs all of his friends.
The repeated terrorist attacks in Turkey also seem to have shaken him.
There is also an economic motive.
Russia's sanctions have had a severe impact - in particular, the cancellation of charter flights that transport several million Russian tourists to the coast of Turkey each year.
This number has fallen by almost 90%.
As far as Russia is concerned, tour operators and charter companies will certainly relax here if there is a renewal of flights.
They make money on Mediterranean tourism at the end of the season.
Even this week, state television promised cheaper fruits and vegetables when the re-importation of agricultural commodities from Turkey is allowed.
"Tomatoes back here, tourists back there," the newspaper Science reported.
The visit, however, had additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry at the West for what it considers a poor response to an attempted coup.
In addition, the long-standing hostility of the lengthy talks on joining the EU and Putin’s entry – who longs to take advantage of the cooling and break Turkey’s ties with the West.
The Russian leader certainly earned bonus points when Ankara asked him for help from the elected authorities after the coup attempt.
You must understand that for Moscow, which has a deep-rooted fear of regime change, this is a given.
So the summit in this pompous, seaside palace of Russia and Turkey enabled me to show what one of the analysts described to me as “an alliance of incompatible”: how the forces of the two countries, which feel rejected and exploited by the West, are united.
However, despite publicly showing reconciliation, there are fundamental differences between the two countries.
The first is Syria, where Moscow recently stepped into the role of a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey are on opposite sides.
It could be said that after nearly three hours of introductory talks, the two presidents said at a press conference that they had not even mentioned this issue.
The Turkish president deliberately avoided answering the question about the differences between them, while Putin decided to highlight those differences.
There is no clear agreement on the basis of which the two countries could find a common voice on the issue of Syria.
But after months of open hostility – and given the risk of a total disaster when a NATO member Turkey shot down a Russian fighter jet – it is certainly better that the two leaders at least talk again.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear for customers outside of Scotland
According to the executive director of the bank, the RBS brand is to be pushed into the role of back office.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be lost to customers outside of Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand has been linked to the bank’s global ambitions.
She was relieved when she nearly disappeared eight years ago and had to be redeemed from debt.
At the time, strategic brands used “RBS” to protect other brands of consumer finance.
It cost millions of pounds to sponsor international sports, from the Six Nations Rugby Championship to Winbledome champion Andy Marray.
But now it has been decided that it is better to give more prominence to national brands.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be used by Scottish customers, but will not launch new stores.
All references to RBS in England and Wales, with the exception of headquarters and stock exchange coding, will be changed to NatWest.
For customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, the Ulster Bank brand is already in use.
There are other, smaller private banking brands that get more to the fore – Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt’s Military Bank.
During our journeys to customers and employees in Inverness-shire, McEwan answered questions from Ross McEwan.
He told BBC Scotland: “The RBS brand will cease to be our investor brand and the brand our employees work for, because we are becoming a much more brand bank now.”
As the bank itself has become a global brand, it has also become a global brand for RBS.
Now I say that we no longer have global aspirations, we have efforts focused on the domestic scene.
Each of these brands will mean something completely different in their own communities and our employees will work under these brands.
RBS has already said that it will not continue its sponsorship of the Six Nations Championship, and has prepared a profile of individual sports sponsorship brands.
“The right time has come for us to move to a brand bank, because the basic question (which we ask ourselves) is how to focus on becoming a better bank for customers?” said the CEO.
Three years ago, it would have been very cynical to say that we would become a great customer bank and introduce those brands.
But along with how we focused on customer needs, not our own, I think there are a lot of changes going on.
We can remember these marks again, I think the right time has come.
Frankie Dettori in Newmarket on horse Predilection led to the 3000th winner
Dettori squirts champagne after double win at Newmarket brought him 3,000 wins
Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3000th victory in the UK at Newmarket on Friday.
He reached this milestone with his second win of the evening on his local track - on the horse Predilection, which is trained by John Gosden.
Forty-five-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to achieve such a result in the flat tracks.
His predecessors are Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
The three-time champion, Dettori, who had previously won on Ghayyar's horse, said, "It's weird."
I am very impressed because my family is here too.
I am very happy that this happened in Newmarket, because this is where I was anchored 30 years ago.
It's not a huge event, it's not Royal Ascot - it's a Friday night on Earth with 20,000 people.
I was relieved and very grateful.
Dettori collects congratulations when he brings Predilection after winning
Two jockeys of this milestone have achieved in obstacle courses - the champion jockey Richard Johnson and the 20-time retired champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who during his career has led to the record-breaking goal of more than 4,300 winners.
Lester Piggott, nine-time Derby winner, 4,493 career winners
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of modern times and it is no surprise that he has reached a milestone that only a few riders have reached before him.
He’s stylish and strong, but it’s his tactical fistron that sets him apart from the other riders in the sedan.
He is a fantastic racing ambassador, his enthusiasm and charisma have attracted fans to this sport for many years.
A few weeks ago, I told Frankie in Epsom that if he hadn’t driven just on weekends and big races, he would have already had 6,000 winners!
However, the truth is that Frankie has been a winner in the UK for most of his 30-year career, and that’s really something.
It has a lively nature, which is good for British racing, but more importantly, it is an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori Celebrated His Success With His Famous Flight Jump
From flying finishers to flying downhills, Frankie Dettori has been the ambassador of British straights for two decades.
It was like a ride on a mountain track.
He also survived a plane crash and was banned from the race because of drugs, and many of the major race winners, including his famous "Great Seven" in Ascot.
Three years ago, he stagnated for the first time when he returned after a six-month ban, but he showed incredible inner strength and he returned in the best shape in spite of all the doubters.
And maybe it won't be the last time - Dettori has already stated that he would like to continue racing for at least 50 years.
Russian President Putin fired the head of the presidential office of Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly dismissed Sergei Ivanov as head of the presidential office on Friday.
Ivanov has been one of Putin’s closest associates for many years.
Thirty-three-year-old Ivanov was appointed Special Representative for Ecology and Transport.
A Kremlin statement said Putin had "released Ivanov from his duties as head of the Russian presidential office," but did not give a reason.
He will be replaced by Anton Vajno, who has been Ivanov’s representative since 2012.
Forty-four-year-old Vajno used to be a diplomat.
Born in the Estonian capital Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious State Institute of International Relations in Moscow (MGIMO) and worked at the embassy in Tokyo.
The website (in Russian) states that he later served as the head of the presidential protocol and the presidential office.
When Putin was appointed, he said, “Thank you for your trust.”
I believe that the most important role of the administration is to support your activities of the Head of State in terms of drafting laws and monitoring the extent to which your instructions are followed.
On Friday, Putin told the Russian TV station that Ivanov had asked him to be released from his post and recommended that he be replaced by Vajno.
Will they convince smiles?
This move completely mystified Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov was one of Vladimir Putin’s closest associates for a long time and, like Putin, worked for the KGB.
As head of the presidential office, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcast on state television, the two men said they were leaving the post of head of the presidential office at their own request.
But the smiles in the cameras convinced only a few people - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
Is this the result of a struggle for power?
No one knows yet.
But the official claim that the man, once thought of as a possible president, is suddenly eager to lead Russia’s environmental policy, has met with great mistrust.
On the Kremlin’s website, the Kremlin quotes comments directed to Putin, in which Ivanov states: “It is true that in 2012 in an interview I asked you to entrust this very demanding post, even if it could be called a problematic post, to me for four years.
Apparently, I was the head of the presidential office for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
He previously served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and previously, like Putin, worked for the State Security Committee (KGB).
In the late 1990s, when Putin commanded the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his representative.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov one of his five closest associates.
In his time, it was even speculated that Ivanov could become the successor to Putin at the head of state after his second term, because the third term would be unconstitutional for Putin.
But this post was taken over by another close associate of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became prime minister just three and a half years before returning to the presidential office.
Thomas Gibson, the star of The Thoughts of the Criminal, was released after hitting the director.
Gibson was involved in a physical exchange of views on the scene last month in Los Angeles.
ABC and CBS, which produce the series, announced its release in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played special agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized on Thursday before announcing his dismissal.
There were creative differences on the stage and disagreements.
I am sorry it happened," he said in a statement.
According to ABC and CBS, the details of how Gibson’s character disappears from the show, which follows the stories of an FBI team, are a little later.
The 45-year-old actor, who starred in the sitcom Dharma and Greg, has starred in the series since the first series in 2005.
“I love the thoughts of criminals, and over the past twelve years I have put my heart and soul into them,” Gibson said in a statement.
I was hoping to be in it until the end, but that won't be possible now.
I would like to express my gratitude to the authors, producers, actors, our amazing team and especially the great fans that this show could ever hope for.
The series will return to its 12th season on September 28.
In the town of Banff mysteriously landed fish in the garden
A man from the town of Banff asked for help identifying the fish that appeared in his garden.
Kevin Bain believes that 75 pieces of fish could be sand anchovies left there by a water crumb.
Bain, who lives about 500 meters from the sea, posted a short film of his finding on the Periscope Channel, believing that someone could help him explain how the about 5cm fish got to his garden.
Queensferry Crossing: The bridge now connects with Fife
<0xC2><0xA3>1.35 billion project to be completed by May 2017
The engineers connected the northern platform and the Queensferry Crossing and viaduct – thus the bridge now connects with Fife.
This is the first of four shutdowns between the “platforms” that are now almost completed around each of the three pylons of the bridge.
The part of the bridge from Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It contains 10,000 tons of iron and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 hanging ropes.
The <0xC2><0xA3>1.35 billion project is expected to be completed by May 2017.
Economic Secretary Keith Brown visited the building today and was among the first to come from the mainland to the bridge.
He said: “This is a historic moment and a symbolic moment of building the Queensferry Crossing.
In this project, we all witnessed how construction engineers used more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel to construct this part of the bridge on an impressive scale.
Despite the massive dimensions and weight of the bridge, completing the closure between the viaduct and the bridge platform was a delicate operation that required extraordinary precision.
In place is now a total of more than 79% of the total area of the bridge, concrete for the last part of the platform is now cast in Rosyth, so the entire platform is ready to be lifted to the bridge.
Michael Martin, Project Manager at Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, said: “The first closure of each bridge is always an important milestone.
On this amazing project, this closure represents the top of the earthworks.
After installing the last part of the road platform and connecting it to the North Tower expansion platform, we had to close the last gap on the north side - towards the mainland.
We did this by extending the northern approach viaduct 700 millimeters south.
This was a massive and at the same time very delicate operation.
Massive because the viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled with a climb of about 3%.
Delicate because the tolerances with which the team worked were very small - only a few millimeters in each direction.
Fortunately, everything went very well.
Rescue in Moelfre Bay: Three men are “happy to be alive”
Three men are "happy to be alive" after being washed away by water from their fishing boat near Anglesey.
The Moelfre rescue boat station RNLI sounded an alert Friday at 13:20 British summer time after the crew saw the incident in Moelfre Bay.
All three men tried to swim to safety, while their boat continued uncontrollably.
“We saw their boat circling near them, and we had the worst idea,” said Moelfre rescue boat pilot Vince Jones.
Fortunately, a strong wind drove him away from them before we left," he added.
Two men were rescued by a local fishing boat, the third man, aged 60, was found without a life jacket exhausted as he held on to the fights.
They were all taken on board the coastal lifeboat and taken back to the lifeboat station.
Jones said: “Three men thrown into the water are happy to be alive and completely uninjured.
The ship's engine had an emergency shutdown rope, but somehow it was disconnected from the person who was driving the boat when there was a reversal.
Someone at the top of those boys was holding a protective hand.
The judge refuses to settle the case because of Tlucho<0xC5><0x99>'s wife.
Petr Tlucho<0xC5><0x99> is one of three MPs who were accused of receiving political traffic from Prime Minister Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as and his then head of cabinet Jana Nagyová, a lucrative post for a political concession.
In 2012, it was the approval of the tax package.
Schnajdr, Fuksa and Tlucho<0xC5><0x99> enabled him with their resignations.
Then they appeared in influential positions in state-owned companies.
They also faced suspicion of bribery and ended up in custody for a month.
According to the court, but unjustly, and thus received compensation in total almost 2 million crowns.
The detainee now stands as a witness in the case, after the intervention of the Supreme Court.
His wife works in a court building on the Fruit Market and deals with civil disputes.
Nevertheless, Judge Helena Králová wants to be cautious (resolves criminal matters) and avoid possible objections.
The case is likely to be handled by another Prague court district.
The King has already acquitted Jana Ne<0xC4><0x8D>asova, formerly Nagya, twice.
It was an alleged abuse of military intelligence to track the first wife of Prime Minister Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as Radka.
In this case, Tlucho<0xC5><0x99> did not appear.
According to lawyer Jaroslav Ortman, this is an unnecessarily exaggerated reaction.
I think that impartiality cannot be interpreted in such a way as to exclude a court if witnesses have a wife or relatives in court.
"I'm afraid nothing can be judged at all," he told the newspaper.
"I think it's slippery," he added.
In the case of political traffic, Roman Bo<0xC4><0x8D>ek, a former official, is also charged.
But according to his lawyer, Peter Toman, any objection would have a chance of success.
On 13 June, the District Court for Prague 1 heard the indictment of the former head of the cabinet of Prime Minister Petr Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as Jana Nagyová (now Ne<0xC4><0x8D>asové) and other accused in the case of abuse of the Military Intelligence.
In the picture, Timeless comes to court with her husband.
Tlucho<0xC5><0x99>ová was supposed to deal with Peroutko's statements.
For example, the wife of the exhibitor was to judge the statements of President Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Zeman about the democratic pre-war journalist Ferdinand Peroutko.
Zeman said he sympathized with Adolf Hitler.
One of the schoolgirls is already dead!
The girl apparently died in an Allied airstrike.
She flew to Syria with her two equally old girlfriends last February from London’s Gatwick Airport.
The British Interior Ministry has not commented on her death.
According to police, young Londoners who fled their homes were secretly transported to Syria across the Turkish border.
Shamima Begum, Amira Abase and Kadiza Sultana headed for their other former classmate from London’s Bethnal Green Academy.
The case last year drew a huge wave of attention and also tensions in relations between Britain and Turkey.
British security officials estimate that some 600 British Muslims have travelled to Syria so far, including some 50 young women and girls.
Many of them have joined the radicals of ISIS and other groups.
Those who return home pose a terrorist threat to Britain.
A dream job for a hundred thousand wages.
A well-paid job that you don't even need a college for.
At first glance, that’s what the work of Ajax looks like.
And often on the other.
The advantage is not only an extremely high salary for Czech conditions (in Prague you can earn up to CZK 180,000 by working in IT), but also extreme benefits.
The reason is a huge shortage of IT specialists.
Thousands of specialists are missing.
According to estimates, almost 20,000 IT specialists are missing in the Czech Republic.
According to the Grafton Human Resources Agency, the most searched are programmers, developers, network engineers and application specialists.
Candidates can choose from several job offers.
Therefore, candidates will not compete for the job, but for the job, comments Jitka Sou<0xC4><0x8D>ková, marketing manager at Grafton Recruitment.
College is not a necessity.
Higher education is not a necessity for atheists.
Higher education means a good foundation and is an overall indicator of a candidate’s intelligence and educational ability, but it often has little to do with developmental knowledge.
Developers have to constantly learn new things, which once graduated college will not replace, says Petr Kuba<0xC4><0x8D>ka, director of Monster Career CZ.
They make the most money in Prague.
The wages of the Ayatollahs are everywhere high above the republican average.
The most money will come in Prague and Brno, in the regions it is no longer such a hit parade.
"The wage conditions in Brno are comparable to those in Prague," Kuba<0xC4><0x8D>ka confirms.
The highest earnings will be achieved by the technical directors.
In Prague and Brno they can come at 120,000 - 180,000 CZK.
In other regions, the salary is lower, but it does not fall below 80,000 CZK.
IT project managers are also in demand.
At the start they can earn 60,000 - 100,000 CZK.
It's also about graduates.
While in some professions graduates often have to go directly to the employment office, this does not apply to Ajax.
After all, if companies drag and overpay an expert from another company, they like to reach out to the graduate.
They can raise it on their own.
They can't do without their tongue.
Knowledge of a foreign language is suitable in every profession, but a decent English is necessary for Ajax people.
Knowledge of at least one foreign language is a necessity in some IT positions.
On the other hand, we encounter a lot of cases where companies are mainly looking for a professionally trained and experienced person and are satisfied only with average knowledge of English.
However, if, for example, a support worker speaks more foreign languages, he is interesting for his employer because he can serve more customers from different countries, Kuba<0xC4><0x8D>ka adds.
There's a paradise in Google.
Only quietly can the Czech workers envy the employees of Google.
Of course, flexible working hours, the possibility of working from home or various short-term jobs are for them, not only for mothers.
“The company provides newly baked dads with an extra four weeks of leave after the baby is born,” said Martina Jonek, a Google spokeswoman.
Softening also includes health care for employees and family, meals, transport, training, wellness or massages directly at the workplace.
Anyone who wants to learn has a green and it doesn’t matter what they want to learn.
But the advantages do not end there.
Such a full free refrigerator is definitely not to be thrown away.
Healthy lunch (in some locations including breakfast and dinner) is available on site every day.
In addition, there are so-called micro-kitchens in all offices, where people always find a healthy snack, the spokesperson says.
And so that nothing is thrown away, so that what is not eaten, put in boxes that employees can take home at night.
And the reason for these incredible advantages to Czech proportions?
Create a creative and motivating environment!
“It’s not important for Google to have employees sitting in the office eight hours a day, but the results of initiatives or projects, shifts or developments, ideas and innovative solutions.”
The United Nations has strongly criticized Bulgaria for criminalizing refugees.
Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein, the UN's human rights commissioner, accused Bulgaria on Thursday of systematically violating human rights by criminalizing refugees.
The official strategy of the Bulgarian government "raises serious concern that Bulgaria is not complying with international law," Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein warned in a statement.
"It is particularly worrying to witness the importance and influential public figures publicly expressing support for the criminal armed fighters who are holding the refugee hunts on the border between Bulgaria and Turkey," he said.
"One of the most serious problems is that almost all people who cross into Bulgarian territory irregularly are automatically arrested," Zeid said.
Worse still, they are often prosecuted and imprisoned – for a year or more – if they try to leave the country.
Their attempts to leave the country are criminalized despite the fact that under international law everyone has the right to leave any country, including their own.
Bulgaria detained 14,000 migrants this year, 21,000 last year for the same period.
Pokémon Go - a hunt for health and happiness that pays off
It’s fascinating to watch the world change.
Over the past decade, many people have lamented that teenagers and children no longer play outside and prefer to spend their free time in front of screens.
Pokémon Go lifts people out of beds and leads them to activity.
The time spent in front of the screens was originally squandered on TV, later on on video games and most recently on smartphones.
It’s great to see that technology and outdoor activities don’t exclude each other.
Of course, I’m talking about the fashion that is Pokémon Go, a character-based app that first appeared in video games in the late 1990s (later a cartoon series, playing cards, and more).
As with many cultural phenomena, there was a drop in interest before the launch of this new game at the beginning of July in the US, Australia and New Zealand.
Listing in other countries was then postponed due to huge interest that led to server overload.
In just a few days, Pokémon Go has gained more users than Tinder and almost as many users as Twitter.
How does it work?
In short, players on a smartphone go out to look for Pokémon that they track using GPS, and when they find them, they can "take a picture" (through the screenshot on the phone) or "catch".
Mania captures the generation who played the game at a younger age, lifts it from the seats and takes it out to look for Pokémon.
In the US, thanks to this game, there has been a significant increase in the number of steps an “average” person takes every day.
Apple’s smartwatch app Cardiogram, which tracks 35,000 users, recently reported to the Washington Post that within two days of the game’s launch, the number of people tracked who exercised every day for 30 minutes jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.
The company does not have information about who is playing Pokémon Go - it only sees rough data on exercise levels.
Many public campaigns striving to “find 30,” “get off the couch” and “be active every day” have fallen on inhospitable ground because most public health messages are boring and targeted at people who don’t look good.
However, the importance of exercise should not be underestimated.
Those who exercise regularly reduce the risk of cancer or depression.
Physical activity is involved in controlling weight, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that we can’t list in full here.
But the beauty of Pokémon Go is that people go out and do something they enjoy.
You cover the three pillars of health - movement, fresh air and sunshine. And fun.
Some people even make new friends while hunting for pokemon.
Of course, there will also be boring patrons who are looking for any excuse to complain.
And yes, someone can walk in the door.
And what, like?
It's a breakthrough.
At one time, smartphone apps like Fitbit were able to track our activity, but they didn’t give us a reason to do something like this with this game.
The news turns and interest in it begins to decline at some point.
However, thanks to the success of the Pokémon, there will be more games that will combine applications and virtual reality with real-world activity and help a number of people in the pursuit of activity, health and better form.

Simone Biles wins gold in multi-fight women's gymnastics
Forget the pressure.
Forget the excitement.
Simone Biles is immune to all of this.
Dynamic on the jump.
No effort on the hammer.
In the plain, they were all numb.
Excellent in everything.
And now, finally, the Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast went straight for the multi-fight title on Thursday and outperformed the others on the full line under the Olympic spotlight.
The total score of 62,198 clearly confirmed her lead over silver medalist and member of the team of the "final five" Ala Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafin.
Simone Biles (USA) on Thursday during a performance on the hammer in the final of the individual multi-fight in sports gymnastics at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Biles became the fourth American in a row to win multiple fights, and fifth overall, confirming her reputation as the best gymnast of her generation and perhaps the best ever.
When her overall final score was on the board and her long journey to this point was over, tears appeared on her face.
This success ranks her in the same league of single athletes of her time as Michael Phelps, who have added a new dimension to their sport:
Biles has dominated her sport for the past three years, winning 15 medals at the World Championships - including 10 golds. Her impressive sets are a mix of ambition and precision, and 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called her "the best gymnast she's ever seen."
The last test awaited her in Brazil, not so much between Biles and the rest of the racers, but between herself and the burden of too great expectations.
Anything other than returning home to his family in Spring, Texas with a hand full of gold medals would be perceived as a disappointment.
Simone Biles (USA), left, and Aly Raisman hug after winning a gold and silver medal in the women's singles final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on Thursday.
The first Biles won on Tuesday, when she was a cheerleader in the celebration of departing national team coordinator Martha Karolyi.
Biles insists that during her long journey to the summit she never looked forward, which is not so completely true.
Part of her composition in plains - the one that contains the typical triple double turn salto for her - is planted in Latin music that would just fit home, in the streets outside the Olympic arena in Rio.
That's not a coincidence.
The girl was adopted by her grandparents as a toddler and her talent was discovered by the mother of coach Aimee Boorman on the way to the gym, where Boorman trained and gained strength.
The multi-fight competition has not lost since the summer of 2013 - this is a succession of victories that can continue as long as Biles will want.
Although Mustafina took the lead for a short time thanks to two turns, it was only an illusion.
Hammer and plain - where Biles defends the World Championship - are waiting.
She came back to the front with 15,433 points for the cladding – and finished with 15,933 points in the free.
Raisman gently embraced her as they waited for the final score - a mere formality - and around the glittering red, white, and blue shadows, tears appeared to Biles when a wish was fulfilled that she had once written in her diary as a child.
Raisman's performance was a bit of a revenge for the Olympics four years ago, when she shared the third place with Mustafin, but then bronze for her because of the sum of the three best sets.
This time, the twenty-two-year-old captain of the team, whom the Americans call “the grandmother,” was far ahead.
After her simple days, she sent a crowd of air kisses, overwhelmed by a return that sometimes seemed uncertain.
For Biles, the post that this nineteen-year-old athlete posted on Twitter this week, where it became an absolute hit, has a whole new meaning:
Police: Three victims in serial killer case shot while listening to music in car
According to a police report released Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl died during the most serious attack in a decade, in the case of the first serial killer in Phoenix. They were shot while sitting in a car, talking and listening to music.
Authorities said Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis’ daughter Maleah were shot dead on June 12 in a car parked on the driveway.
According to the report, the armed man was standing on the side of the passenger and fired eight wounds from a handgun, then fled in another vehicle.
According to police, the robbery is not worth the triple murder, because the attacker did not take the wallet, nor the amount of $2,900 that one of the adult victims had with him.
A Phoenix police spokesman, Sergeant Jonathan Howard, said investigators were investigating whether the shooting had any connection to any of the previous four attacks.
In two predominantly Hispanic neighborhoods, a total of nine attacks took place over the course of four months, killing seven people and injuring two others.
“It’s happening in the villa district in front of the houses,” Howard told CBS’s KPHO branch earlier this month.
Police believe the suspect used several cars, including a brown Nissan from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s, and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Investigators refused to disclose what evidence led them to conclude that the attacks were related and were carried out by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was taken to a hospital where she later succumbed to her injuries.
Liner, 31, and Ellis Maleah’s daughter died on the spot.
A witness told police it was not unusual for women to sit in a parked car and listen to music.
Authorities also released a police report on the shooting, which was targeted by an empty van just half an hour before the triple murder, which the police believe was caused by this serial killer.
Investigators found the cartridges and assembled a bullet from the remains of the bullets in the seat and from under the hood of the engine.
Mother of a six-year-old child with microcephaly: "His condition is improving"
Edmund Picciuto, like most children of his age, loves singing, toys and, of course, also his mother.
But unlike his peers, he suffers from microcephaly, which is the result of a genetic disorder that his mother, Elizabeth Picciut, did not know about during pregnancy.
The first time he came home, I thought I couldn't handle this.
I can't handle this.
I'm not ready for this.
That's not true, of course you're ready for it," she said.
She and her husband Vincent learned that Edmund might never know them and that he might not even survive.
Some doctors even suggested that he be placed in an institution.
“My first reaction was that I thought people weren’t doing this anymore,” Picciut explains.
Edmund walks with the help of a walker.
He couldn't sit or crawl until he was three, and he still couldn't talk.
However, some of the milestones are slowly being fulfilled.
He walks with help and rides a bike.
He also loves to play with his two brothers and loves to sing.
Elizabeth gives a sign speech, with which Edmund says, "Please sing to me."
“We’re teaching him sign language,” Picciut told CBS News.
But it's not a common sign language - it says that Edmund invented some of the signs himself.
Microcephaly can arise from a number of different conditions: genetic, as in the case of Edmund, and after pregnancy infections caused by viruses such as measles or Zika.
Symptoms and prognosis may vary significantly.
It is too early to say what impact the Zika virus will have on the lives of those infected.
Picciutto reminds us of an emotional tax chosen by an uncertain future.
I keep asking, "What's next?"
What's next?
And she's still not sure.
In fact, I never asked what the overall prognosis was, because I don’t expect anyone to be able to tell me at all.
However, Picciutto has an encouraging message for mothers of all children who suffer from congenital defects caused by the Zika virus.
The situation is improving.
You know it'll be better.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Heavy rains and floods demanded rescue work in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rains and widespread flooding in Louisiana prompted the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday, with further rains expected on Saturday.
The National Weather Service (NWS) reported that after extreme flooding, a number of rivers in southeast Louisiana and southern Mississippi are pouring out of their shores and are at risk of widespread flooding.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and aid is already on its way to the affected areas.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the Governor’s Office for National Security and Emergency Preparedness, said they were receiving requests for vehicles for driving in water, boats and sandbags.
Steele said only Tangipahoa County had asked for 10,000 bags of sand.
Flood patrols will remain in most of southern Louisiana to work until Saturday.
The meteorological service said in a statement that it could rain another 8 to 13 centimeters over the sea.
In southern Alabama, flood patrols were on standby on Friday as rain continued in the Mobile area.
The Comite Rivers near Baton Rouge and Amite Rivers near Denham Springs are predicted to peak over the weekend.
Meteorologist Alek Krautmann said both said they could flood a number of homes in the Baton Rouge suburbs.
He added that the dangers are floods in the Ascension district, where these drained streams will pour into Lake Maurepas only slowly.
The Tickfaw River, just south of the Mississippi border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached its highest recorded level at 9 a.m. on Friday.
Rescuers are still collecting people from the floodwaters in Amite and Wilkinson County in southwest Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and son-in-law were among the rescued at Gloucester on Friday.
Hansford (62) said the water from Beaver Creek, which is normally more than 120 meters from his home, rose rapidly overnight.
He said he was alerted by his next step-son, who lives nearby.
"We woke up and the water was coming," Hansford said.
I had it up to my waist.
According to his wife, it is the highest level she has ever experienced on the river in the last 48 years.
Hansford said he and all members of his family are disabled and he is the only one who can swim.
Hansford said the crisis workers rescued all three huge military-style trucks and took them to a fire station in Gloucester, where they remained undercover on Friday.
Krautmann said that with the continued heavy rains, the floods are “spreading rapidly” and authorities are considering evacuation.
According to Krautmann, an observer near Livinston reported that 35 centimeters of rain fell between midnight and Friday morning.
Krautmann said the soil has been heavily soaked since Wednesday.
Authorities said heavy rain and paid trips had demanded the rescue of residents from their homes in Tangipahoa district and the cancellation of classes in five school districts.
The WWL branch of CBS reported that according to an elder from Tangipahoo, 200 homes have been flooded.
The residents were evacuated to two churches, both of which are now flooded.
The mayor of Robby Miller said the authorities rescued 72 people and seven pets who had been imprisoned by the high waters.
In the village of Amite and in the town of Hammond shelters were set up for those who had been evacuated.
"They'll be able to go home when the water starts to fall," he said.
More than 20 streets were closed in the Tangipahoa district of Hammond due to flooding, and locals were provided with bags of sand that they could pick up and try to protect their homes and businesses from water.
"The last major floods were here in March," city administrator Lacy Landrum said.
Looks like these floods will be similar.
Rupert Lacy, crisis manager in Harrison County, Mississippi, said persistent rains continued on the coast of the Persian Gulf.
He said a few homes were reported flooding Thursday, but none of them appeared in the report on Friday.
Keith Townson, Head of Shopper Value Foods at Amite, has been living in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in a few places where I've never seen it before," Townson said, "and it's still there."
Mahaj Brown (6) - "Shot as a Boy", Survived a Shooting in Philadelphia
According to police, a six-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, and this week is the second shooting at a six-year-old child in the city.
The grandparents of the child identified him as Mahaje Brown for CBS Philadelphia.
Grandparents say the boy suffered several gunshot wounds, including weakness, leg, arm and abdomen, but while transported to the hospital he was conscious.
"He took a lot of it, his little body was shot as he tried," his grandmother, Delores Melendez, told the station.
I can't believe it.
The boy is in critical condition in the hospital and has undergone several surgeries.
The family told the station that the boy should be healed.
He was supposed to be in the first grade of elementary school.
Mahaj Brown is among the four people who were shot in the Germantown area.
Three more men were shot: two at the age of 29 and one at the age of 32.
One of the men at the age of 29 is in critical condition, according to CBS Philadelphia, two more victims are in stabilized condition.
According to the station report, the child was found shot in the front seat of the vehicle along with a 29-year-old man in critical condition.
Two other victims were not in the car and police are investigating whether any of the injured men could have been the shooter.
Investigators at CBS Philadelphia said there was likely a gunfight between several armed men.
Gun shells of the attacking type, belonging to various attacking weapons, were found at the site.
Apparently, it was a continuing battle.
There were cartridges on both sides of the pavement.
So it seems that there were a few armed combatants who were actively involved here," Philadelphia Police Captain Anthony Ginaldi told the station.
Several houses and vehicles in the area were also affected.
No one has been detained and the police are reportedly investigating video footage from the cameras.
Another six-year-old, this time a girl, was shot in the arm by a stray bullet on Tuesday outside a house in the neighborhood of West Oak Lane.
The girl is recovering and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
This is how I imagine the women's gymnastics team for this year's Olympics, for several reasons.
First, I’ve been at every Summer Olympics since 1984 and the U.S. has never been so dominant.
And secondly, there are three gymnasts in this team, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who inspired so many young colored girls.
Everyone is proud of the composition of this team, complemented by Aly Raisman, who is of Jewish descent, and Catholic Madison Kocian.
We finally have a team that looks like America.
He also confirmed the presence of blacks and Latinos at the top of the sport.
The number one gymnast in the past four years has been an African American.
Simone and Gabby were on the first and second line last year.
That means something.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Dougals surprisingly became the champion of the Olympics and America was cheering.
Now the world could witness the incredible performance of three-time world champions Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, who performed unexpected but masterful gymnastic figures.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American to win gold in a women's singles multiplayer.
And team member Aly Raisman won the silver.
We are witnessing a sporting peak, but in the gymnastics class in the country it does not look like that.
Simone, Gabby, and Laurie made the same trip to the Olympic team as Aly and Madison.
They are the "final five" because the gymnast team for the next Olympics will be made up of only four athletes, and this is the last year that Marta Karolyi is training.
The fact is, however, that gymnastics is a financially demanding sport and gymnasts are trained mainly in private gymnastics clubs, which are maintained by parents who pay for training costs, equipment, travel, jerseys, competition fees, hotel accommodation (for coaches and their envoys and families).
Most of these sports clubs are located in rich suburban areas that can support activities.
In these clubs, gymnasts have all trainings and for families of gymnasts and gymnasts it is an expensive and long-term commitment.
Aimee Boorman, coached by Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coached by Laurie Hernandez, both trained athletes when they started gymnastics.
It is our duty to bring gymnastics training that is more accessible and accessible to the communities of countless young girls who have inspired Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
I founded the Gymnastics Foundation 20 years ago.
In my organizations, where we offer free or low-cost gymnastics in Harlem for more than 15,000 young people within the city (mainly of black and Hispanic origin) and we have trained national and international champions.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown), where we will provide quality gymnastics to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination of the body and hard work, discipline and determination of the mind.
This combination means lifelong benefits for good health, success at school and at work.
It is the inspiration of this team that will send thousands of young girls to us who will want to do gymnastics. And that's great.
Participation in this sport is very important, especially for girls.
It's a very exciting time.
Thank you, Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison, for showing “girl power” and winning the Olympic team gold. And thank you for motivating so many young girls of all backgrounds to embark on a journey to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
After rejecting Jeremy Hunt's proposal, young doctors are ready to enter further strikes
The ministers hoped that a revised contract with the representatives of the British Medical Association (BMA) would end disagreements about the changes, but 58 percent of the 37,000 young doctors who took part in the election rejected the contract.
Hunt unveiled plans to enforce the contract in July, saying the NHS was in “nobody’s land” and further delays would have a detrimental impact on employees and patients.
The first young doctors have already signed a new contract that includes changes in night and weekend work practices to improve care in non-social hours.
Dr Ellen McCourt, chair of the BMA Commission for Young Physicians, said in a statement last night: “Young doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, especially in the sense that there will be an increase in the current labor crisis and hence a fair treatment of all.”
Just eight weeks before the first group of doctors goes under a new contract, it is necessary to make progress and time is running out.
BMA’s efforts to resolve disputes through negotiation have met with reluctance to engage the doctor and often with deafening silence on the part of the government.
And this despite Jeremy Hunt's promise last month that this option is still open.
“Jeremy Hunt must now act, push for coercion, and address the concerns of young doctors.”
If this does not happen, then young doctors are ready to take further steps.
During the last strike at the end of April, nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 visits were postponed as nurses and specialists were called to represent doctors who were among the protesters.
The ministers hoped that after the conclusion of a revised contract with representatives of the British Medical Association (BMA) there would be disagreements regarding the changes.
BMA wants higher pay for weekend work for 54,000 young doctors who would be the subject of the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, the head of NHS employers, urged young doctors not to go on strike.
Mortimer said: “A field event will achieve little or nothing, but pressure will be exerted on already overburdened teams and services, and worries, exhaustion, and disruption will increase for patients, caregivers, and their families.”
Over the past two months, we have worked with a panel of young doctors and, together with the Ministry of Health and others, we have responded positively to their concerns about the role of supervisor and informer.
Employers hoped that the continuing positive involvement of the Ministry of Education in other important issues - such as the burden, flexibility in training, further training for those who return after a career break, the cost of training, mutual recognition of subjects, study leave, and the pay gap between genders - was evidence of this.
A cure of sixty crowns a day can reduce the risk of a heart attack
Thousands of patients at risk of heart attack will be able to take the drug, which costs about sixty crowns (two pounds). The authorities recommend giving it to more patients for a longer period of time.
Ticagrelor is an anti-coagulant medicine that reduces the risk of recurrence of a heart attack in people with heart disease.
The drug is now given for 12 months after a heart attack to reduce the risk of a stroke or other seizure.
NHS watchdog NICE recommends that the drug be given to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
Now, however, NHS watchdog NICE recommends that it be given to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
In England, about 140,000 people suffer a heart attack each year, and a quarter of them will suffer another heart attack or heart attack.
Infarction and stroke are caused by accumulation of fat, which forms a continuous layer on the walls of the arteries.
If this layer is torn off, a blood clot may occur, blocking the access of blood to the heart, and a heart attack may occur.
If the clot loosens, it can continue through the bloodstream, blocking the blood supply to the brain and causing a stroke.
People who have already had a heart attack are at a higher risk of another attack.
Ticagrelor, manufactured by British company AstraZeneca and sold under the trade name Brilique, reduces the risk of clots occurring less likely.
The proposed NICE directive, which was published today, recommends that patients receive 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months and then 60 mg together with aspirin, twice a day for the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Health Technology Assessment Center, said: “Despite the availability of effective secondary preventive treatment, there are a quarter of patients who have had a heart attack and who suffer another heart attack or stroke – often with devastating consequences.”
The fear of recurrence can have a significant negative impact on the quality of life of the patient.
Ticagrelor in combination with aspirin has been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already suffered a heart attack.
We are pleased that with the preliminary recommendation of Ticagrelor, we can expand the treatment options available to many thousands of people who will be able to benefit from it.
Because information on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor - especially on the risk of bleeding - is limited over three years, treatment beyond this time is not recommended in the proposal.
With the computer culture began to flourish fraud in Muslim areas
Mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was dismissed last year for corruption, which was linked to a government report.
A culture of political correctness has led to a disregard for widespread fraud in Muslim communities, the government report said today.
Former Secretary of State Sir Eric Pickles has sharply criticized the police, election inspectors, and city hall for ignoring the abuse of voters because of their “sensitivity to ethnicity and religion.”
The former community secretary, now the ruler of anti-corruption interventions, said intimidation of voters based on their religion is so bad that the police should make cordons in front of the polling stations and protect the guarded voters.
He recommended that voters take their identity card with them and be able to prove who they are in the elections.
Nowadays, voters just need to provide their name and address.
The report also suggests that people’s fingers should be inked when voting to prevent someone from voting twice.
Whistleblowers should have more protection, Pickles says.
It requests that the press be given greater access to meeting documents and decisions taken by informal committees or working groups.
“It’s not just about protecting against election fraud, it’s also about protecting the local government from the wider corruption environment and financial fraud that goes hand in hand with it,” he said.
Downing Street has requested the report as a result of an election scandal in the Tower Hamlets in West London.
Last year, a special election court ruled that the incumbent mayor of Lutfur Rahman should be dismissed from his post following charges of corruption and illegal practices.
The court found that Rahman had "cynically affected" the religious sentiment of his Muslim community and silenced his critics with accusations of racism and Islamophobia.
According to Rahman, “he campaigned to make it a religious duty for devout Muslims to vote for him.”
Up to 300 votes have been contested or as a result of identity theft, when a person votes and is casting a vote for someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud across the country.
He expressed particular concern about the fraud in the correspondence vote – which senior members of the Muslim community are said to have been exerting pressure on people to vote for the candidate they elected.
Sir Eric, in the picture, gave several recommendations on how to clean up the electoral system, including the presentation of an identity document
“Evidence has been presented that vulnerable members of certain ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, have been pressured to vote at the will of the elderly, especially in communities originating in Pakistan and Bangladesh,” the report said.
“There have been concerns that ... state institutions have closed their eyes to such behavior because of ‘politically correct’ hypersensitivity to ethnic origin and religion.”
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations on how to clean up the system, including banning political activists from manipulating correspondence votes to prevent “voice mining.”
The report, which is now being evaluated by Theresa May, also calls for closer checks on registrations to avoid the use of electoral lists for immigration fraud and benefit fraud.
Consider the possibility of asking voters to submit an identity document before voting.
Use indelible ink on people’s fingers when voting to prevent someone from voting twice.
Perform systematic nationality checks to ensure that they can vote.
Requests for automatic correspondence voting shall be limited to a period of three years.
Prohibit political agitators and activists from manipulating surrendered correspondence voices and electoral envelopes.
Give the police permission to create cordons around the polling stations.
Change the laws to make it easier to prosecute those who develop illegal coercion under the 1983 Reform Act.
Prohibit taking photos in polling stations.
Require that only Englishmen (except for Wales) work in the polling stations.
Strengthen training and ensure that workers abide by the rule that voters go to the polling booths individually.
Sir Eric criticizes London police and says it is "surprising" that no criminal charges have been brought after the Tower Hamlets case.
"The election court ruled out Lutfur Rahman and his agent for the casting of corruption and illegal practices," he said.
For a number of reasons, he was found guilty beyond reasonable doubt - in the strength of the evidence of the crime.
He also criticizes the resultless "checking of checkboxes" in the departments for voter registration at the city hall.
Sir Eric said: “Last year’s court ruling in the Tower Hamlets case was a wake-up call.
Our nation has a proud legacy of the cradle of parliamentary democracy, but the worrying and covert spread of electoral fraud and the state of rejection by some institutions threaten this reputation.
Cycling Duchess Kate and other doubles celebrities at the Olympics in Rio
Fans of the 2016 Olympics in Rio have gone mad at French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevoto, who is remarkably similar to the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympic champion is by no means the only athlete striving for gold this year who can boast of her own double of celebrities - at least not according to social networks.
To celebrate the Olympic Games in Rio and all the celebrities that are currently appearing on our screens, the Women’s FEMAIL column has compiled a list of Olympians that are more than remotely similar to Hollywood celebrities.
As a hunted animal: American archer team member Brady Ellison (left) has been compared to Leonard DiCaprio since childhood
Next to Kate’s twin on the bike track, a number of people online quickly pointed out that a certain archer could be a twin of star Leonardo DiCaprio.
American archer Brady Ellison caused a storm on Twitter after his pictures showed him strikingly resembled a Wall Street wolf.
Brady himself noticed the media madness and admitted that he had heard of his resemblance to Lee from a young age.
“He doesn’t see much of a similarity, except maybe his beard,” Brady told the Huffington Post.
"He's a guy and he looks good, so I think it's a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons from London 2012 will undoubtedly be emphasized even more this year: the striking image between the British distance jumper Greg Rutherford and the favorite actor Neil Patrick Harris.
The Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafin, with her big, pronounced eyes, was said to be a copy of Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And when you look at the swimming pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to the star of the Gell Matthew Morrison series for several years.
And for the change: The user thinks that Nathan is the "athletic version" of the actor from the movie Inception
Another longstanding comparison is a comparison between tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who have similarly dense eyebrows and lips.
Russian silver swimmer Yulia Efimov is not only proud of the same brown skin and blond hair as Annalynne McCord. And about Nathan Adrian from the U.S. team fans say she looks like “an athletic version of Joseph Gordon Levitt.”
Adequate women: football star Hope Solo (left) and actress Dexter Jennifer Carpenter (right) have similar face and eye shapes
Not only one: The Twitter user was very pleased that others noticed the similarity
On the Waves of Theory: According to this user, there may be a reason for the similar appearance of couples
A Twitter user recently commented on the site that “the rest of the internet thinks Hope Sol and Jennifer Carpenter are actually identical.”
Soccer star Hope Solo and Dexter Jennifer Carpenter have a really incredibly similar face and eye shape.
Among other popular comparisons is Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to the smile of actress Laura Linney, or the gold medalist for gymnastics Gabby Douglas, proud of her wonderfully wide smile, who copied the film of a girl, like a Gabriel smile!
CBC Olympics commentator apologises for saying Chinese swimmer "exploded"
Viewers of Wednesday's live broadcast from the Olympics on CBC Station upset performance analysis of fourteen-year-old Ai Yanhan by commentator Byron MacDonald. The swimmer finished in fourth place in the women's race on the 4x200 m relay in free style
Canada’s CBC was forced to apologize after one of its commentators said that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer “dragged like a stench” and “exploded” during the race.
Commentator Byron MacDonald believed his microphone was turned off when, at the end of the women's relay final, he began to squeeze his own opinions in a freestyle 4x200m style.
MacDonald, who was supposed to bring “revival” to the CBC commentary team, said, among other things: “That little 14-year-old from China gave up, you fool.”
Excessive excitement, stretching like a stench, exploded.
Oh, thank you.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam the race's second relay at 1:57.79, 1.61 seconds slower than Canadian Taylor Ruck, allowing the Canadians to reach China.
Spectators in Canada began to respond quickly online and were horrified by the tone and language used by the commentator
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted: “Did the CBC spokesman say that a 14-year-old swimmer from China ‘exploded’???
The idiot didn't notice that he was still on the air."
Ai Yanhan of China in the final of the women's relay race in the 4x200m freestyle was described as: "That little 14-year-old from China gave up, you fool."
Criticism of Byron MacDonald on Twitter came from all sides and many asked for his recall
When Twitter users found out how insensitive Byron MacDonald is, they didn’t hold back.
Another user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: 'Wow #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada, and it sounds like we're a bunch of racists.
Shortly afterwards, Scott Russell, who hosted the CBC broadcast, apologized for MacDonald's live comment, saying, "We apologize for commenting on the performance of the swimmer who escaped the broadcast."
It was an unfortunate choice of words, we're sorry it happened."
CBC has apologized more than 90 times to people who tweeted in response to a comment.
Scott Russell Apologises on behalf of MacDonald
CBC then copied and inserted their apology in response to more than 90 Twitter users complaining about commenter MacDonald’s comments.
The station also quickly apologized and issued a statement.
She sincerely regrets that the words were spoken, she should not have gotten into the aether.
We quickly apologized to our viewers on the air and to those who are watching us on social media.
To be clear, Byron’s comments were about the swimmer’s performance, not the swimmer’s own.
In other words, it was an inappropriate and unfortunate choice of words. Byron deeply apologises for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, Byron MacDonald apologized on live broadcast and tried to explain his remark by claiming that he did not want it to sound like a personal attack.
"I would now like to apologise for the comment I made last night after the women's staff," he said on CBC.
“I meant the performance of a swimmer and not the person of a swimmer as such.”
“There’s no need to say that I didn’t intend any disrespect, and I’m very sorry.”
Customers in Primark upset by a woman who shamelessly tried her underwear in the middle of the store
When the woman dressed up to try her panties on the sales floor in the middle of Primark, the shoppers weren’t sure which direction to look.
To make it even worse, she tried to fit her size, took off her panties and put them back on the shelf.
She continued to browse and eventually tried four pairs of pants in a shop at Bouverie Place in Flokestone.
Primark store in Bouverie Place shopping mall in Folkestone, where a woman tried her panties before putting them back on the shelf
Jenny Davidson’s mother, who was at the store at the time, said that the mysterious woman, after trying on her underwear, “did dress up again and left the store without buying anything.”
She said, "People couldn't believe their own eyes."
She stood in the middle of the store, took her panties off the shelf, took off her own panties and panties and put them on.
“She didn’t even try to find a discreet place—she just stood there, bold as a monkey.”
"Everyone was just staring at her pants again, and obviously she didn't like them because she put them back on the shelf."
She did the same with three others before finally deciding that she didn't like anything, dressed up again and left.
“She didn’t seem to care who was watching — nor did she think of the man who might be buying the pants she had tried.”
Ms. Davidson, 33, who lives in Kent, said, "The idea of someone taking home panties that someone else was wearing and no one was cleaning them. That's disgusting."
The incident took place on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms. Davidson added: “When she left, I was picking up the things she was obviously trying to pull out of the sale – which is also the only thing right.”
"I'd be terrified to bring my new pants home and find that another woman was wearing them, had them undressed and hadn't been washed."
A spokesman for Primark said: “Primark is aware of the incident that occurred in our store in Folkestone on Tuesday, August 9.
All the products concerned were withdrawn from sales.
How to Defend Yourself Against Gun Attack Using Krav Maga
The outside world is dangerous, but thanks to this video from Dailymail.com it could be a little safer for you.
We spoke with Rhone Mizrachi, the grandmaster of the Krav Maga federation based in New York, to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close range.
This video will show you how to suddenly gain the upper hand over the abuser, whether he approaches you in front or behind.
If they approach you from behind, Mizrachi says, then the first thing you have to do is turn around to see your attacker and “have a free course of the missile.”
You will then grasp the weapon between your forearm and shoulder just before you hit it in the face with a free elbow.
Then the knee follows into the buttocks, and while the attacker is in pain, you twist the gun out of his hand, hit his head in the face, and begin to retreat, while holding the gun against him.
If an armed man approaches you from the front, it is a similar technique - get your body off the line of fire, grab a gun and twist it so that the villain can not shoot.
At the same time, put strength into the weapon and hit the attacker in the chest, then twist the weapon out of its grip and begin to retreat, while still aiming at him.
Does that sound complicated?
Take a look at the video where you can see exactly how Mizrachi does it.
But don't forget that the safest way to get out of the robbery - unless you're the Krav Maga grandfather - is to spend all your cash.
Traveler Ian Wright licks Europe's dirtiest places into travel guide
The British traveler decided to undergo a hard test of his immune system and damp reflex - licking the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.
Suffolk-based travel writer and moderator Ian Wright, 51, licked a euro banknote, a rail at Piccadilly Circus, a washbasin button on a toilet on a train and a Russian public telephone to prove the strength of his immune system.
He used a luminometer to show himself and all of us what he was getting himself into before he drew each object.
The experiment, based on which the film Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength was filmed, however, brought interesting results.
The idea of licking the rinser button on a train used by thousands of other people may seem completely repulsive, however, perhaps in the kitchen sink there are actually much more harmful bacteria.
Throughout his journey across Europe, Ian Wright spoke to doctors and health professionals about strengthening intestinal flora bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, nothing he licked left in his mouth worse than the smell.
Ian Wright is famous for testing the strength of his intestines on trips around the world and eating strange and amazing things.
During this mission, he safely tested his immune system - from public railings at train stations to a dishwasher.
In the film, he says: "I have not cared much about my health since childhood, and I put everything in my mouth, from clay to eating worms and muddy water."
In the film, he confirmed his reputation.
The only thing he refused were dirty public toilets in Russia.
After a simple wipe, the luminometer showed a value of more than 4,000 units.
For comparison, freshly washed hands should be less than 60.
One public toilet in Russia but refused to lick after its luminometer showed more than 4,000 units, while freshly washed hands have less than 60
Ian Wright and Finnish dairy producer Valio have filmed a traveler’s film called The Lickhiker’s Guide to Inner Strength, which shows the numbers of bacteria in different places, such as in the bathroom.
In the movie, he said, “This is almost the most disgusting thing I’ve ever felt in the bathroom.”
There's nothing dirtier than this!
I'm not going to scrub anything because it's disgusting here.
Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength was filmed in collaboration with Finnish dairy producer Valio.
The company provided Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria and vitamins C and D, which help to strengthen the gut bacteria and the immune system in humans.
Niko Vuorenmaa, Valio’s senior vice president for snacks, juices and new categories, said: “We wanted to offer consumers something really new.
Something that would follow the passion and at the same time allow us to explain the benefits of probiotics.
We came up with a lot of crazy ideas that ended up with the idea of "call Ian."
It is said that interest in bowel health is becoming a worldwide phenomenon.
Instead of just talking about products, we wanted to put them into broader contexts – good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system.
The growing interest in healthy guts is a worldwide phenomenon and through this document we have brought more detailed information to consumers in an interesting way.
I also think there is a great sense of humor in the film!
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, adds: “Let’s just say, Ian would lose my respect if he licks something I wanted him to — like the disgusting Russian toilet that appears in the film.”
Some things were naturally easier for Ian to lick, while others were quite difficult.
I'm glad we've filmed the licking of some of those dirty things."
Valio conducted a 2015 survey in which 84 percent of respondents linked lactic acid bacteria primarily to stomach and intestine health, and 58 percent of respondents said they used products containing added lactic acid bacteria at least occasionally.
A family in need before being deported destroyed a town hall in Saltash, Cornwall.
A family of socially needy people left <0xC2><0xA3>50,000 worth of damage to their town hall after being accused of terrorizing their neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were evicted from their home in Saltash, Cornwall, after a long series of complaints against them.
After their violent eviction from the house, housing cooperative officials were shocked to learn that the property was in a state of emergency.
There were holes in the walls, the floor covering was torn, garbage was rolling on the floor and the walls were blurred.
The family has already moved and is considered to be living in a private accommodation
Donna McEvoy, the director of housing at Cornwall Housing, said she was worried that the house would be rescued.
She said, “It was a nightmare for people here, and I don’t think people should live like this.
You need to consider a number of circumstances, because this property will probably fit into the awareness as a "not so nice part" of Cornwall.
The family is unfamiliar and their names are unfamiliar.
The couple have three sons who occasionally resided in the house, and police said the horror rule that the family operated included street battles using baseball bats, intimidation of nearby residents, drug use, drug distribution, and loud screams, quarrels, and insults.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was mentioned on the lease, was sentenced in June for anti-social behavior.
In several rooms in the house, which may be demolished, smelling garbage has been found.
In the house where drugs were distributed in the past, the floor covering was torn out
Neighbors say they saw them on the street floating around, and people regularly called the police here
Cornwall Housing forced her and her partner out of the house this week after they were given an additional 11 weeks to move out voluntarily.
Neighbors who were relieved welcomed the exodus with the fact that their lives were a living hell.
One of them said, "They didn't care for anyone at all."
We've lived next to them for 20 years and it's always been like this.
How many times we've seen the police here can't be counted at all.
"We couldn't sleep this morning."
We got up because there was an incredible silence - we are not used to it!
It'll be nice here when they're finally gone.
Adam Fitzpatrick, a supervisory manager at Cornwall Housing, said the family was unable to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, the house was regularly called to the police
Garbage and old toys rolled in the engrossed part of the town house
She adds: “It is a disgrace that the tenant has not been able to accept responsibility for her own behavior and the behavior of her family. Removal is always the last step that Cornwall Housing considers.
It was a very complex case because their behavior was extreme and their actions, according to the witness, had to frighten her neighbors.
I appreciate all the work done by my team, the police from Devon and Cornwall and members of the local community who have courageously informed us.
I hope that this move will bring some comfort to our neighbors and at the same time carry the message that we will not tolerate antisocial behavior.
Fitzpatrick said all three tenant sons who lived in the house at different times were about 20 years old.

Workers will now have to remove the piles of garbage that have been dumped around the house
In 2014, she raided the house and found over 70 grams of cannabis, weights, equipment and <0xC2><0xA3>1,700 in cash.
Skeldon was fined when she was found guilty of holding Class B drugs she wanted to sell.
She claimed that the money was spent on the foundations of the house for her son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
It is believed that Tanya and her partner now live in private accommodation in Plymouth.
The walls in many rooms of the house were painted graffiti.
Police say they will seek to evict tenants who violate the rules of their lease agreements
Denova and Cornwall police’s Angela Crow said the removal was a clear message to other tenants who will continue to break the rules.
“This is a message to all those who think they can behave with impunity, and to those who would like to follow such behavior,” she said.
The police in Denov and Cornwall will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behaviour and will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal frightened by low overflight of military jet over beach
Tourists who enjoyed the sunshine in the Portuguese Aveir were terrified to death
Portuguese Air Force P-3C Orion aircraft flew incredibly low
The Air Force said it was an exercise flight and insisted that there was no threat to security.
As the low-flying jet hovered over the crowded beach, the frightened tourists panicked.
Dramatic footage shows a military plane getting almost to the touch of the sun on a sandy beach near the city of Aveiro in northern Portugal.
Tourists began to get up after they were disturbed by the noise of the jet engines without seeing what was coming out of the clouds.
The incident took place yesterday afternoon on the Costa Nova near the city of Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of several recreationalists who posted video footage of the dramatic flight on social media, said: “The plane flew twice really low and at one point it seemed to crash.”
Nuno Arroja adds: “I was surfing and I really thought the plane would fall on my head.”
Tourists on the beach in Aveiro were horrified when a plane flew low from the dark
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion was on a training flight in order to identify the fishing vessels off the coast and had to bear low because that was the only way to inspect the ship.
The plane reportedly flew slightly below normal, due to poor visibility caused by smoke from nearby forest fires. However, the aviation insists that the safety of people was not compromised.
This summer, forest fires destroyed part of mainland Portugal and claimed four lives on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot had to fly low because of the dense fog and smoke from the fires that prevented him from sight.
The aircraft was on a training flight and the pilot was asked to identify a fishing vessel as part of the training.
Half of funeral homes fail to comply with regulations.
Half of funeral service providers do not comply with the law.
The Czech Trade Inspectorate (<0xC4><0x8C>OI) found this during checks in the second quarter.
Funeral services do not usually inform the survivors of their prices or issue a written confirmation of the acceptance of the order.
The company imposed 41 fines for this, totalling 73,000 crowns.
Her spokesman, Ji<0xC5><0x99>í Fröhlich, said today.
The inspectors found the error in 47 of the 95 checks.
In addition to not informing about prices and missing confirmations, some funeral services also sold products or provided services at prices other than those agreed upon.
In five cases, the products sold were not properly labelled, and once the seller used an officially uncertified gauge.
The inspection therefore banned the sale of 23 products for a total of 7077 crowns.
It concerned urn wrappings, candle covers and vases which were not properly marked with mandatory information.
"Given the fact that there are still violations of the law in this specific area of services, the control action will continue in the next quarter of this year," Fröhlich added.
London Schoolgirl Who Joined ISIS Has Been Killed in Syria
It was reported that Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join ISIS, had died in Syria.
Lawyer Tasnime Akunjee said the family learned of her death in the Syrian Raksa a few weeks ago.
ITV News reported on Thursday that she was likely killed during a Russian airstrike in Rakca, the country's bastion of the group.
Sultana was 17 years old and, according to her family, she died just as she was preparing to flee the war-torn country and return to Britain.
“One wants to believe that the only good thing about this whole thing — as a message and a warning to others that these are the real dangers associated with the journey to the war zone — is to discourage people from ever making a decision,” Akunjee said.
Sultana and two other schoolgirls from eastern London boarded a plane to Turkey in February 2015 and then a bus to the border with Syria.
Sultana’s family learned that she married an ISIS fighter in Syria – and within a few months became a widower.
Reid says if Clinton is elected, he will leave Garland as the Supreme Court candidate.
Democratic Senate leader Harry Reid says he is convinced that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will nominate Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if he is elected.
Republicans in the Senate blocked Garland’s appointment, though President Barack Obama nominated him as early as March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnel says the person who replaces the late Supreme Court judge will be elected by the future president.
During a conference call on Thursday, Reid said he believed Clinton would select Garland “with a certain degree of credibility.”
Reid’s spokesperson later said he had not spoken directly to Clinton about whether he would nominate Garland, and that he was only speculating.
He praised Garland and said that Clinton’s team would not want to “roote the ship” by choosing someone else.
Garland is the president of the federal appeals court in Washington.
Reid said Republicans who block Garland’s appointment are “servants” and “jumpers” of Republican Donald Trump’s presidential nominee.
He said Trump is not fit for office.
According to Treats magazine, naked calendars are for "women and men"
Treats is working closely with photographer David Bellemer to release a 2017 calendar inspired by the 1970s Pirelli calendar.
But instead of revealing celebrities, he tries to find the next generation of top models for his 2017 NU Muses calendar.
Treats President Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his nude magazine differs from the old-school Playboy because “Playboy is for men.”
I do it for women.
I think the calendar is as well.
“We have to go back to depicting timeless and classic nudity, where both women and men feel comfortable and are inspired by photographs of women’s bodies,” Shaw said in a statement.
Women want to be part of this project because it is a wonderful piece of art.
Models can submit their pictures online or in person during open auditions in Los Angeles and New York.
Where Does Vinyl Go: Who Really Buys Records?
Vinyl is loved by lonely middle-aged men.
Before you decide to populate the comment section with chewy notes under the pseudonym NotAllAloneMenIn the Middle Ages, we point out that this statement is based on actual data.
According to YouGov, the much-discussed revival of record labels is associated not with the boom of millennials who want to love the originality of owning a physical object, but with the nostalgia of the middle ages.
Those who recently bought a vinyl album are most likely people between the ages of 45 and 54.
Young people aged 18-24 are the least likely.
It’s not really about an accumulation of enthusiastic fans – it’s all about the emotional dimension: older people who buy record labels are more likely to want to keep their feelings (56% vs. 53%) and are happy with themselves (69% vs. 66%).
But are the results of YouGov true?
If this blog were to be broadcast as a television report, a camera would be watching me go out into a busy street in Soho, dressed in a decent gray suit and gesturing broadly. Then I would stop, put my hands out and say something authoritative, like, "Let's go look at it."
Well, let's take a look.
While the heart of the Soho is slowly losing its charm and charm – buildings once occupied by independent vendors, hotels, restaurants and dining halls, apparel and office supplies are now filled – several fantastic specialized record stores are still left.
I'd probably ask the camera to stop shooting for a while. I'll stand up close to different men in these stores and try to observe what their age and emotional mood is.
Stuart (55), a native of Glasgow, whom I follow from Sister Ray (numbers: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (numbers: eight middle-aged men, one woman around 20) has an afternoon meeting in London and is looking at stores to fill a few hours of time.
I asked him if he was a collector.
"I think so," he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
All these recordings line the walls of his living room - in the picture above (he sent me a photo by email, I didn't follow him home).
He also has this huge amount of albums and singles because he can afford it: he can now buy record labels he couldn’t afford when they were originally released, and he buys again what he sold in his youth and didn’t even have a wind.
“A lot of what I buy is from the late 60s and early 70s. These are things that would have been published when I was 11 or 12. I was too small then and couldn’t get them,” he says.
He agrees that those who buy recordings are probably introverts, who like the company of themselves, and adds: “I don’t smoke or drink much.
This is my sin.
Wez (25) works at Sister Ray and also thinks that the number of customers he meets fits into the YouGov profile.
He also noticed a new influx of people affected by the media wave. People who had heard about the comeback and felt compelled to buy back their old record labels.
According to my interviews, people lost their collections most often between 1998 and 1999.
“Customers who once sold their record labels and bought CDs are now selling their CDs to buy back their record labels,” he says.
This could explain the boom of record lovers of a certain age.
But what about the supposed emotional importance of record labels?
It doesn’t take you more than a few seconds to discover in a store like Phonica that in music stores you will find a pleasant community of people with similar thoughts.
According to Wez, some older customers are particularly upset by the system of contactless payments.
Some fans of record labels may feel overwhelmed in the digital world and have opted for the familiar environment of record label packaging, things that evoke memories of peaceful adolescence.
“I think filling a gap or possessing something material can bring some comfort,” says Wez.
I'm a collector myself, and I think so with a lot of people, too.
It’s an easy way to fill the space in your head.
"We are all like their social workers!" exclaims the co-worker from a bunch of record labels.
A survey by ICM in April revealed that nearly 50% of people who bought a vinyl album a month earlier had not yet listened to it.
According to the survey, 41% of respondents have a record label that they never use, while 7% of those who buy record labels do not have a record label.
At this point in the report, he probably looked seriously worried while browsing a pile of compilations of bossa nova.
The aspect of "trophy" and revival of interest is something that Jonny, 42, who works in Sounds of the Universe (number: three middle-aged men), noticed.
“Someone recently came in and said, ‘I don’t have a record player yet, but I want to buy it on Radiohead so we can put it on the shelf.’”
The percentage of such is not large, but it happens.
It’s more about the product page than the music.
People come to us and say, “I don’t have a phonograph.”
It's the younger people, not the older, grown-up teenagers who get into it.
Fopp, where almost an entire floor is currently reserved for record labels, has much more diverse visitors on my arrival.
There are couples of 70-year-olds, tourists taking pictures, teenagers and middle-aged women.
While the atmosphere isn’t as relaxed as in stores before – from the speakers to the catchy jazz, Wild Beasts’ latest pop full of synths and sex is echoing, it’s good to see a variety of customers.
None of them seem particularly lonely, but a frictional mental trauma is hard to estimate when you stand next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora (27) walks through Fopp for a few minutes and watches various disc discs at a discount.
She's one of those people who prefers to look at the bills rather than spend a lot of money on fever.
According to her words, she doesn't make much money, so she doesn't seem to consider collecting record records.
It costs a lot of money.
It's easy to listen to music on a computer or something, but the record labels have their charm," he sighed.
I can't explain it - it's unique.
My last stop is the store that supposedly inspired a new generation of record lovers: Urban Outfitters.
I look like I'm very interested in the girls' calf in tight jeans and I'm following a group of teenage girls who are just gathering around Polaroid cameras. Then father and daughter decide to buy a Crosley gramophone.
To the left is the staircase, covered by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac's record labels: a mixture of contemporary and classical music, the basis of any average record collection.
No one is looking at them - perhaps because they are only for decoration and some are so high on the wall that they cannot be reached.
It’s a “vinyl trick.”
But since any attraction to it could mean more money for the industry and send a few customers to the depths of the Soho for others, there’s not much to complain about.
It’s no surprise that the demographic area where there’s more time and money than in other areas is also where the most is spent on the most luxurious goods that vinyl is certainly.
But while, according to my findings, the results of YouGov seem to be accurate – at least in record stores, they don’t take into account the large number of collectors and vinyl lovers that actually exist in record stores and online forums.
These people probably work hard in schools or offices.
He certainly doesn’t spend Thursday morning strolling around record stores on Berwick Street, browsing through recordings, and avoiding the sight of a strange, thirty-year-old fake TV host hiding behind the backs of unsuspecting middle-aged men.
Greenland shark is the longest living vertebrate - videoreportage
According to scientists, Greenland sharks have the longest average life expectancy of all vertebrates on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who studies sharks, says the recording shows a female whose age is estimated to be between 272 and 512 years old and measures five meters.
A court in France refused to tear down the shops in the refugee camp Jungle
A court in France has rejected an order from Calais authorities to demolish dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle camp, where thousands of refugees live.
During a court hearing this week, Calais authorities argued that the state should be able to cancel a total of 72 interim stores where people inside the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer haircuts, in interim restaurants sell several teas for 50 cents or basics.
The prefect’s office in Calais argued that the sites need to be demolished because they represent a parallel economy that does not pay taxes, and because they pose a risk of fire and health risks.
Humanitarian organizations told the court that shops and restaurants are vital and that free meals offered by state-sponsored associations and other groups do not provide food supplements for the growing numbers of refugees in the camp.
Disputed convenience stores and restaurants often provide shelter and free food for people in need.
A court in Lille ruled that there was no legal basis to prevent people from running 72 interim stores, but said Calais' objections were "completely understandable".
Judge Jean-François Molla said that grocery stores, cafes and restaurants play a far greater role than simply serving food to people who “live in extremely desperate conditions.”
He said the premises provide quiet places to meet refugees and volunteers.
One of the places threatened by demolition was the camp cafe, Jungle Book Kids, which is run by a non-profit organization and offers 200 meals a day, English and French lessons, and asylum advice for hundreds of endangered unaccompanied minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people signed petitions to protect the “children’s” cafe.
The Guardian received a letter saying the closure of the cafe “would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are only 8 years old.”
Help Refugeess and L'Auberge des Migrants on Friday estimated that the number of refugees in the camp after a steep increase in arrivals over the summer has risen to more than 9,000 - the highest so far.
You thought he was dead.
Ul<0xC4><0x8D> also crosses himself and Volleyball Mouth.
"Since March, I have been able to train normally," he said at the start of the summer preparations in full force.
What's wrong with you?
I had bilateral pulmonary embolism, then heart problems because of it.
'Cause when I was at the university in Korea, I didn't know I had any blood problems.
So the trouble caused a long flight to Asia?
I had a clot in my calf for two years and I didn't know it.
It hurt, nobody found anything for me.
Then the clot got up.
There is a damaged vein in the calf, it will always hurt, especially when the weather changes.
But nothing that would limit me, rather an aesthetic thing.
Were you worried about your life?
He did.
Last year at the summer tournament in Drevenice I did not know that I had embolism, and I could not move there at all.
I vomited blood last night.
The doctors told me that it was something completely different, I had been completely done for five days.
I really thought I was dead in Woodlands, and my girlfriend and family.
I've seen you somewhere else.
How did you deal with that?
I guess I had to go through it, now it's just going up.
I know I have some problems with blood, that I have to be more careful when I fly somewhere.
But anything can be done about it.
Only when I wanted to go back to the preparation of the P<0xC5><0x99>íbrami last year, there were still problems with the heart.
It's all right now.
Since March, I have been preparing myself at home to be able to play again.
I'm physically better than I was before.
What do you expect from your mouth?
I'm looking forward to it. The gang looks good. I know most of the guys.
I'm curious about two other strangers coming.
Hopefully we'll sit down humanely so that it fits us together.
You pick up the mouth?
He had a good reputation, but every season is different.
Brno was eighth two years ago, now the second one is over.
There’s a new team, there are only a few players left.
It was the last in extralysis, so there's a lot of room for improvement.
The way we use it, it's up to us.
We'll see after the first round who's going to be the slobber, we don't.
Is Coach Brom a guarantee of success?
He is already experienced and experienced a lot, he will think of better than the last place.
But my arrival had nothing to do with him, I agreed earlier.
There were other coaches in the game, I am a great friend with one and it was agreed that he would work here.
I won't say a name.
Finally Mr. Brom came, and I'm glad.
He has a great name, has been in good clubs, has coached for many decades, is a former good player.
He'll move us upstairs.
What will you bring?
This team will fight, which is my position.
I like to fight, I like to joke and I like to get an opportunity in a not so top team.
I have been in P<0xC5><0x99>íbrami for two years, but <0xC3><0x9A>stí is a bigger challenge than being right in the sixth team, because it starts from below.
You mentioned the stranger, the Australian Boehm is already training in <0xC3><0x9A>stí.
What does it look like?
I know him by chance, we played against each other in a group at the university.
And a couple of times we had fun there, sometimes we sat together in the evening after the games, so we already know each other.
We defeated them 3:1, I immediately put it on him at the start of the summer preparation in <0xC3><0x9A>stí.
He has a Slovak girlfriend, he's a nice guy.
American Nadazdin and Brazilian Ze are coming.
Do you know anything about them?
I wrote to an American, he looks like a nice guy, a Brazilian who knows how to speak English.
Did you contact the American?
I thought it was a good idea.
I'm a recorder, so I'm the composer, so I should be communicating with everyone.
Immediately I found out what kind of player it is, I found it on the internet, how it plays, I saw some videos.
He seemed pretty cool, the boy jumps, he's tall.
We wrote a few messages on Facebook, it seemed like a joke, it would fit in with us.
How do you look forward to being the recorder number one?
I didn't want to take anything else.
I'm only twenty-four years old, and I don't have the guts to go back and forth.
I'd rather be at the center of things, I'd rather lead the team than be led by someone else.
I don't think I'd want to play anymore if I were to be like a second recorder and do it full-time.
How many times have you been single?
Half a year in P<0xC5><0x99>íbram, when it was not possible for Kust as captain, he was injured, then there were problems with the money and he left.
Since then, we've been upstairs and I've been playing all the time.
In Brno, of which I am a nurse, I alternated one and two.
It was a great year in the Old Town, after which I had a lot of offers and chose P<0xC5><0x99>íbram.
Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice wanted me from there, I stayed, but I did not finish the season because of the embolism.
Now it's a new beginning.
It's gold number 22.
The short location remains the Phelps domain.
"Being back on the winning ranks and hearing the anthem is as sweet as ever," Phelps laughed, his eyes again filled with tears.
His fiancée and mother were once again rejoicing in the auditorium, and Boomer’s son slept quietly with the headphones on his ears.
I'm going through an incredible week at the end of my career.
It's crazy - 20 years ago I started racing swimming and in a few hours it will be over, he said in awe.
In the final behind Phelps, the silver Japanese Kosuke Hagino, who won the long haul, was nearly two seconds behind.
Bronze won by Chinese Wang Shun, a bronze medalist in this discipline from last year’s World Championship.
After Al Oerter (disc) and Carlo Lewis (distance), Michael Phelps is the third athlete to have mastered the same discipline in four games in a row.
After most of the race, Phelps was led by another American Ryan Lochte and home run Thiago Perreira.
While the gold defenders in the final kraularska fifties set to the crushing finish, they fell out of the medal position.
The American superhero will still have at least one chance to expand his unique medal collection in Rio.
Shortly after the official announcement of the position, he moved to the final of the race for 100 meters of butterflies.
The legend could not be overshadowed by compatriot Ryan Murphy, who won the emblematic double - after a hundred he also won the double track in Rio.
In the final, he left behind by 37 cents of Australian swimmer Mitchell Larkina, the third ended Russian Yevgeny Rylov.
While last year’s World Cup was only the fifth place in the 200, Murphy became the emblematic king of Rio.
From the imaginary throne he removed Larkina, who had the same double success at last year’s world championship.
He won a medal at the Olympics only now.
Penny Oleksiak, a Canadian, and Simone Manuel, an American, shared the gold.
For 16-year-old Oleksiak, it was the fourth medal at these games, for Manuela the second after the silver from the relay.
She won gold at the Olympics as the first African-American in history.
I believe I can be an inspiration to others.
“This medal is for everyone who comes after me, the sport becomes love for them and they get where I am,” Manuel said.
The third was the Swede Sarah Sjöström, who won the 100-meter butterfly race in Rio in the world record and still has the silver from the crater doubles.
Cate Campbell, the Australian world record holder, finished sixth.
Japan’s Rie Kanet won the 200th breaststroke, for which it is the first Olympic medal at the age of twenty-seven.
It has no precious metals from the World Championships, its maximum was the fourth place in this discipline in 2013.
The second silver medal in Rio was won by Russia's Yulia Jefimov, who, despite her doping past, is facing hostility from both spectators and opponents.
I made a big mistake once.
But I won in court and I don't know why I should keep answering these questions.
“I’m tired of it,” said the Russian swimmer.
The right to start in Rio was claimed by a special panel of CAS sports arbitration just before the start of the games.
They dealt with my appeal and I won.
Whether someone likes it or not, or if they have a different opinion, let them turn to the arbitral tribunal, she added.
Hermann: Disappointment, we could have won.
And start at midnight?
I don't remember that.
The Czechs had a special day.
Only less than an hour before the game, they found out who they were going to play against.
They must have mastered tactical preparation.
And then, in an unconventional time, they started the match on the small court number one.
The first set didn't start well, then the rivals took the lead, but at 19:19 they couldn't manage the finish.
In the second they were clearly better and straighter, but the decisive tie-break did not work for them.
First and foremost, a series of failed services meant a 10:15 loss and a farewell to the Olympic tournament.
"We could have beaten the Russians," Hermann said.
How would you rate the match?
Hermann: After an unfortunate start before I played, we got into the game beautifully.
In the end, the last balloon flew away from me, the reception I had become accustomed to before.
We lost a hundred, which was key.
In the next set we started on them with an overview of the field, another defense and we pushed on the service.
In the tie-break there were terribly spoiled feeds, there we went on this page.
It was a disappointment because we could have beaten the Russians.
Sluková: Too bad we started the first set, that’s where we got it.
We were able to download it, but the dots were missing.
The second set was great and the third was decided by the service.
We made a lot of mistakes.
We gave them five points and that was about five, we hesitated a lot.
It's a shame, because the Russians were playable.
How did you play in the small yard number one?
Sluková: Similar to in China on the side courtyards.
The environment and the atmosphere were different.
There was an hour in the night, complete silence, no music playing, nowhere.
That was the difference from the center.
We would not choose such conditions, but we cannot choose.
What was the preparation for the match when you found out the names of the opponents an hour before the match?
Hermann: She was strange.
We started training for the game without knowing our opponents, so we couldn’t do tactical preparation like the other teams.
But Simon (coach Nausch) has prepared tactics for almost all the possibilities that were there.
He had a lot of papers prepared with tactics, so on this page we were pretty well prepared.
Do you remember when you started the game at midnight?
Hermann: Probably not.
We played in the eleventh, but not in the twelfth.

Was it unpleasant?
Sluková: By playing the last two games in a group of ten, we had the mode shifted before.
This was two more hours.
It’s strange, I can’t imagine that another sport has athletes who have to give their best performance in twelve hours.
But I think we've prepared ourselves the best we could.
We knew it would be, but it’s not quite typical and it probably won’t be my favorite time to play.
How do you assess the Olympic experience?
Hermann: Since progress from the group was our goal, on the one hand, it’s okay, good.
We did what we said.
But now I'm sad after the game.
Sluková: I will sleep out of it and from tomorrow I will remember the Olympic tournament only positively.
Big brother's here, the first scanning SIM is coming.
You won't get away with it.
The new rules are intended to apply to all persons without a Thai passport who choose to obtain a SIM from one of the local operators during their stay in Thailand.
That is, not only for tourists, but also for people with long-term visas who, for example, work in Thailand or have married there.
The Secretary General of the National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission, Takorn Tantasith, said there would be no exceptions.
The plan to sell SIMs exclusively to foreigners was introduced by the national telecommunications regulator in early August.
The authorities intend to introduce new measures to monitor their location within six months.
According to Tantasit, it is a means of preserving national security, which allows to solve the crime committed by foreigners.
The so-called tourist SIM also helps to detect people who exceed the permitted length of stay.
In addition to a SIM dedicated exclusively to Thais, a special SIM for foreigners should appear for sellers within six months.
The difference will be precisely the monitoring function, which will be permanently turned on for cards intended for people without a Thai passport.
It won't be possible to turn it off.
"This feature on the SIM for Thais is not because we can always easily track them," Tantasith added.
It should be added that in Thailand, prepayments are not anonymous as in the Czech Republic.
The seller requires proof of identity.
On the other hand, for several years, one of the operators gave free take-off SIMs to tourists at airports.
They were completely anonymous.
Ten telecommunications regulators from other Asian countries, including Malaysia and Singapore, are also considering implementing the same measure as Thailand.
They also currently have a mandatory SIM registration, however, the legal use of the tracking system is not possible.
However, the proposed measure does not mean that foreigners are obliged to acquire a local operator’s SIM when entering the country.
Of course, they can use roaming services with their own home SIM, in which case the Thai authorities will be short on them.
The operators of the country in question know only the relevant network information after crossing the border, i.e. after logging in to their SIM network.
They know the phone number, but not the owner’s information.
However, the difference in roaming prices compared to the rates of local operators is so glaring that even most tourists start to look for local SIMs during their stay in Thailand.
The authorities’ efforts to monitor the movement of foreigners have received immediate criticism from foreigners living in Thailand.
Tantasith soothes the situation and compares the system prepared in relation to privacy with the obligation to provide a residence address in immigration documents.
In addition, if necessary, the police will need a court order to monitor a particular person.
Any abuse of the system will be subject to a near-indefinite penalty.
"If the service provider tracks the location of the SIM without a court order, he will be charged with a crime," Tantasith added.
The system should also maximise the use of prepaid cards.
While a specific number is currently being recycled only after the 90-day period after which the SIM was not logged into the network, a new number could be recycled after 15 days in the case of leaving Thailand.
Luxury newly built apartment in Vinohrady has a swimming pool and a hot tub on the terrace.
Why did you choose an apartment in a new building?
We were looking for a carefree apartment, where most of the care for the property is provided by the administrator.
The condition was enough parking spaces and an elevator in the house, which essentially disqualified the older building.
Not to mention problematic acoustics in old houses, problems with floor swings, high energy demands and the like.
The condition were also large terraces, which the old building is not able to offer.
Other interesting visits can be found in the magazine Modern apartment.
The whole interior was designed for you by architect Lenka Langerová and her colleague Kamila Poláková from Artiga’s studio.
Why did you just contact them?
Would you recommend working with an expert?
We would recommend working with an architect to anyone if he designs an apartment from the beginning, because it is a very complex technical process.
The second level is the interior design itself: designers have a much better idea of the range of possible materials, and based on the wishes of the client, they are able to properly align the interior.
With architect Lenka Langer we already worked on our mountain apartment, based on the personal recommendation of another client, and since everything worked well, it was a clear choice for us when renovating our new apartment in Vinohrady.
What were your practical and aesthetic requirements?
We wanted a generous social-living space with a suitable backdrop for a family of four, conceived as a modern, but not cool interior.
The priority was to achieve the interconnection of the apartment with the terraces and to realize the intelligent control of the household.
And, of course, the quality of execution had to be taken care of.
Did you leave everything to the experts, or did you interfere with the final form of the interior yourself?
We approved all designs, including technical drawings and samples of materials, but the design always came from architects.
At the beginning, we set out what we expect from the design, and showed some elements of the interior that we would like to incorporate into the design, such as carpets or paintings.
I think it was our collection of mostly Czech authors including works by Karl Malich, Karl Vysu<0xC5><0xA1>il, Václav <0xC5><0xA0>pála or Otto Gutfreund architect that helped us to orient ourselves in our taste.
Also the combination of black, white and walnut wood was the idea of the architect as well as individual pieces of furniture, walls, floor, lighting, carpets, textiles, art, etc. We then checked together with the help of visualizations.
Were there any complications during the realization that made you have to give up your original ideas or, on the contrary, adopt new ones?
Perhaps only in the initial phase of the project, when we came to the building at the moment when it was first possible to climb to the height of our floors, and found that the views that we had planned actually overshadowed the surrounding buildings.
Then we literally changed the mood overnight from basics.
Granite was used on the kitchen line as well as on the cladding of the fireplace wall.
In the interior, wooden surfaces complemented by leather predominate, for example, on the upholstery of Norma dining and bar chairs from Arper.
How would you characterize the interior?
Are you going to make any changes or is there something you would like to have differently today?
I think it is a modern airy interior, which above all fulfills its purpose.
We do not intend to make any changes, most of the adjustments after moving took place in the level of shielding and enclosing the terraces.
Perhaps the only hint is to the floor, when the walnut wood turns out to be too sensitive to the household with the dog.
Word of architects, Ing. arch. Lenka Langerová and MgA. Kamila Hornychová, author of the realization.
The apartment is on the last floor of a new building, so it was possible to make a completely new layout solution and several other modifications within the building.
For the interior is an important element of placing the fibers in the ceiling of the hallway and the main toilet.
This gave us daylight into the darker spaces of the apartment.
Also, the direct entrance from the main bathroom to the roof terrace to the pool from USSPA is one of the building modifications, which was very beneficial for the function of the whole apartment.
There is also a swimming pool and a hot tub.
Compared to the French, you are not negative, says a Muslim living in Prague.
You come from France.
Where did you live before you moved to Prague?
My parents are from Algeria.
I was born in the south of France, near the Spanish border.
I've moved quite a bit.
I lived in Toulouse, Lyon and Marseille.
I studied journalism in France, and then I got a job in a magazine.
So why did you decide to move out of the country?
I began to feel like I was suffocating in France.
I just didn't want to live there anymore.
Especially because of the atmosphere between people.
I think every Frenchman is very negative.
People in France are in a negative mood in general, but recently it has gotten worse.
Interestingly, you mention negativity.
This is how some people feel about the Czech nature.
Believe me, you're not negative compared to the French.
Some people may not see it when they come to France because they don’t see it as much as tourists.
But it was too much for me.
The big issue is money.
People feel that they have little money, while the minimum wage in France is fifteen hundred euros, which I think is enough.
Now there is a problem with people’s behavior towards Muslims.
That's completely incomprehensible to me.
For example, in the street where I lived, my non-Muslim neighbor began to look at me with his fingers just because I was a Muslim.
It's like I'm some kind of evil.
That's why I didn't feel good in France.
But my family stayed there.
So you decided to go to another country.
Why did you choose the Czech Republic?
I was looking for a job basically anywhere else and I came across a vacancy at Air France here in Prague.
I must admit that I did not know Prague at all from the beginning.
I knew something about the Czech Republic, my father even told me about what was happening in Czechoslovakia, but I did not know what to expect from Prague.
I've been here for three years now and I can't imagine not living here.
Was it a big difference when you moved from France to Prague?
Especially because of a completely different atmosphere.
Maybe it’s because I don’t speak Czech, so I can’t catch any negative reactions or insults, but I feel like people are freer here.
That I can do anything, dress in any way, and no one will judge me.
In France, someone is still looking at you unpleasantly, for example when you have special clothes and so on.
I started to feel really free in Prague.
I don't think roasts care about things like that.
Where do you work now?
After working at Air France, I worked for a travel website for a while.
Then another friend and I set up a website where people offer and search for shared housing.
We only operate in Prague so far, but we would like to extend it to the whole of Central Europe.
Do you have any Czech friends in Prague?
I have two very close friends here, who are half Czechs, and two other Czech friends.
I have to say that the other specificity of the Czechs is that at first they are more distant.
He's not letting anyone get to his body right away.
That's quite the difference from where I grew up.
In the south, everyone hugs and kisses their faces.
It’s different here, but I understand that it’s a cultural issue, so I’m trying to adapt.
You mentioned that you don't speak Czech.
Is language barrier a problem for you?
On the contrary, it is quite simple in Prague, because perhaps everyone here speaks English.
Even in the evenings or in the food.
I would like to learn Czech, but I don’t have that much time.
And by the fact that everyone can communicate at least a little in English, I do not have such a need to learn the language quickly.
And every time I have a problem, I find someone to help me.
Have you experienced any negative reactions as well?
Maybe it's because you're a Muslim?
No, not really.
Perhaps it is also because I work in an international environment that is more tolerant.
One experience comes to mind.
My manager, the Czech Republic, once told me about the French football team and said something meaningful: They are not French, they are Africans.
That touched me quite a bit.
But that someone has a problem with me being a Muslim hasn’t happened to me yet.
And even though my colleague once warned me about some anti-Muslim demonstrations.
He said I shouldn't go to the center, they'd be taunting me there.
Anti-Muslim demonstrations are partly related to terrorist attacks.
How does the current situation affect you?
Are you afraid that something like this could happen in Paris, Nice or Brussels?
I feel safe in Prague.
But the problem is that nowadays anything can happen anywhere.
Until recently, I could not have imagined that something like this would happen in France.
And it’s not just about Muslims.
Moreover, Islam does not recognize violence at all.
For me, people who kill are not Muslims.
The Qur’an says that man has no right to kill because he is not God.
How do you feel when terrorists are defending your faith?
It's very hard.
I feel sadness and guilt, even though I shouldn't feel that way at all.
I try not to watch the reports of violence a lot, but every time I read something, I feel the need to apologize for something that is not really my fault.
I'm a completely different person, so why should I apologize for terrorists?
We met in the square of George of Pod<0xC4><0x9B>brady.
On Wednesday, Czech Muslims and Christians protested against the violence.
Did you register it?
I didn't know that.
But I understand that these people feel the need to prove that they don't agree with violence.
I don't think they'd have to do anything like that.
Why should they feel guilty for something they didn't cause?
Do you meet other Muslims in Prague?
My colleagues, for example, are from Egypt and other Muslim countries.
They are a little more religious than I am, so sometimes we have quite wild discussions about Islam because we all perceive it a little differently.
I come from France, so I went through a different education, maybe they studied Islam at school.
We have different approaches, but we respect each other.
People sometimes associate Islam with the subordinate status of women.
How do you feel about that?
I don't feel subordinate at all.
Rather the opposite.
I am a woman, I have strength.
It is also related to the fact that you do not wear a head covering.
Hijab, for example?
And it's mostly about the way I was raised.
My mother, for example, is a Muslim.
He prays five times a day, but he doesn't wear a scarf.
She always taught me that faith is a purely personal thing.
It depends on how everyone interprets it.
When a person reads the Qur’an, he should make his own opinion on these things.
So when I read a passage in the Qur’an that says that God told the Prophet to hide his wives from the eyes of others, I said to myself: I am not the Prophet’s wife, so why should I hide?
On the other hand, I respect that, and when I come to Iran or Saudi Arabia, where scarves are required, I will take it.
Are you planning to stay in Prague?
So far, yes.
I didn't feel so good anywhere else.
I’ve been thinking about Poland for a while, but I feel great in Prague.
I can even imagine raising my own children here, too.
Prague is an ideal city for this.
Czech Muslims and Christians protested against the violence.
The wind from Kozelská Fenclová in Rio swept the yacht to the procedural barriers.
On Friday, Czech yachter Veronice Kozelské Fenclové sailed on the Brazilian Riu de Janiero.
In the Laser Radial class, she moved to tenth place before the final two races.
This would ensure the Czech Republic's participation in the final race.
You collect packages like Pokémon.
They want to compete with carriers.
The idea of using the already planned routes for the transport of parcels is the television director Mat<0xC4><0x9B>j Li<0xC5><0xA1>ka and the manager of the Prague music club Marek Greger.
With the idea, three applications with different geographic reaches came to life.
We launched the National Transfer application in May.
At the moment, there are a thousand cities recorded in it and we will expand the network.
In the Czech Republic, we want to learn this first, rather than focus more on abroad, says a forty-year-old manager in an interview with iDNES.cz.
How does the Transfer app work and who can benefit from it?
You can download it and register for free.
Then you can specify the route and the data, how much you can transfer and how much you want for it.
Somebody's asking for a ride that day.
When the route and delivery time are convenient, it pairs up and the two receive mutual notifications.
At that moment, a chat will open, where the couple will arrange a transfer.
How many people do you think would have to register in order for each package to always find its own courier?
I don’t know the ideal state, I can’t estimate how many registered and how many trips are needed to make coverage completely optimal and each offer paired with demand.
On the main roads it already works and it is logically easier than perhaps on the road between the villages.
The more people, the greater the potential for speed and accuracy.
So far, people are building trust and finding out that no one is running away with the package.
Haven't you had to deal with a case like this yet?
How many users does the service have two months after launch?
We currently have about 5,000 to 6,000 people creating roads.
We see this as a success and we believe that more will be packed.
Is it possible that the sender will wait too long?
We hope that we will be a competition for large conglomerates only because we are able to deliver the thing on the same day and at a fraction of the price.
With a large company, you will pay several thousand for delivery within two hours.
You’ll pay a hundred or less here, because that’s the way someone’s already doing business.
Should traditional carriers worry about a possible loss of customers in the future?
We hope that's the case.
The market has huge potential, feeding huge transnational carriers, as well as retail chains, where everyone started shopping and gradually found out that quality does not correspond to what it pays for.
No one wants to find a note in the inbox that says they have to pick up the parcel at the branch, first that day after 7 p.m.
At that time, I needed the package for six hours and I waited at home because it was important.
We want a better, faster and more functional service that doesn’t bother anyone and sends a signal to the competition, no matter how hard they try.
Marek Greger (41) and Mat<0xC4><0x9B>j Li<0xC5><0xA1>ka (39).
No one has ever worked in the field of information technology.
Marek Greger works as a manager of the music club, Mat<0xC4><0x9B>j Li<0xC5><0xA1>ka as a television director.
In 2014, they started preparing the Shippansee LTD application, which uses already planned packages to transport the route between the world’s metropolises, especially by plane.
In 2015 they commissioned a project to process the company that created applications for example for MALL.cz, Jobs.cz or <0xC4><0x8C>SFD.
The programming lasted three quarters of a year and the application was launched in March 2016.
The Transfer app started to be developed in December last year and released this year in May.
This is a local version of Shippansee adapted for the Czech market.
The Lunar and Lunar Professional applications have been developed since January this year and made available to users at the end of July 2016.
The intention was from the beginning to make all these applications that will one day merge into one.
In the Czech Republic, they want to fine-tune the application and then, in cooperation with a strong investor, focus more on the global market.
The shared economy has been a theme lately and this is a service like AirBnB or Uber.
Don’t you worry about working in an area that no one can say much about, where is the boundary of sharing and where is the grey economy?
It’s the same, but a different product.
It is clear to us that if it succeeds and we go up with it, we will be the next thorn in the eye through the grey economy.
But even though someone saves and someone earns, it is not intended to circumvent the financial authorities and tax controls.
Every user, whether on one side or the other, will be encouraged to give his or her income if he or she earns from it.
Why do you think the company has such great potential?
The sender saves and the carrier earns, or reduces the cost of the trip.
That is the strong idea that unites interest on both sides.
In the age of social networks that divide people, we would like this to bring them closer together.
There can be nice stories, people are happy to have helped someone and they will tell each other about it.
Maybe someone will bring you your forgotten glasses, keys or pills.
I think people have been lacking in personal access for a long time, we say about this app that it is the service of people to people.
So how do you ensure that the courier does not fly with the package?
Each user of the application, along with the registration, scans the identity card and indicates the bank connection, payment or credit card.
These are channels that give credibility to service and to man.
Couriers also collect asterisks based on sender ratings.
We will also offer insurance, we will adjust the details.
The courier is responsible for the uninsured shipment in case of loss or damage, but does not accept criminal liability for the content if there is something illegal inside and does not know about it.
If he is stopped by the police and found in a closed package in his suitcase with a shotgun or ten kilograms of hashish, criminal responsibility falls on the sender.
Is there a risk of misuse of sensitive data from the database?
If necessary, they are monitored by the administrative authority, which will be the only one who will be able to view them, and we are not able to see them ourselves, the data is protected against abuse.
How much money does the courier get after successful delivery of the shipment?
The courier determines the price and receives the entire amount he says.
The sender is charged a few percent extra for the communication of contact.
This money is our profit, but it is only a few percent, because we want to push the volume.
No one can accuse the courier of not delivering the shipment when it actually delivered it, the takeover and delivery is verified using QR codes.
Are there any limitations?
Whether in relation to the size or contents of the package?
You can carry anything.
We have three sizes, small as a cube of butter, medium as a plateau of eggs and large as a basu beer.
After that, there are no more restrictions and if someone has a place in the car, they can take the refrigerator.
Plus, the sender has the option to take a picture of the package in the application, so the courier can see what he wants.
You don’t even have to pack the item if you don’t want to hide the contents unloaded.
You put the forgotten hoodie in the courier's hand and that's it.
Who came up with the idea and how long did it take to start the service?
My friend got the idea more than two years ago, at that time I didn't pay much attention to it.
Then he showed me a demo application with a transnational reach that targets mainly airplane passengers.
At that moment, I told him that I would not look for an investor, but I would like to become an investor and save money.
The next year, the development took a year before we founded Shippansee LTD in London for the greater credibility of the entire product.
This is not the version you are focusing on.
No, we focused on marketing in the Czech Republic, where we are trying to catch up with the application, because it all had birth pains and there is still something to deal with and improve.
We try to respond to feedback from customers and the foreign market is not currently solving that much.
We know it’s a long-haul run, but we don’t catch it, we want to create a really good product for people.
Shippansee LTD was the basic and most expensive application, the other two were somehow upgraded.
The transfer came about when we said that the national segment could be much more interesting and that we would at least learn it in the Czech Republic.
The third application of the Moon is local, for the city.
But it can send the package to the exact address and to the other end of the world.
It works for the sender as well as the Transfer, but the difference is that in it as a courier you see the parcels in the form of points on the map that are closest to you, thanks to the geolocator in your mobile.
Applications for couriers who want to live by it, we have called the Moon Profi.
So someone can make a lot of money by picking up parcels in the city?
Exactly, the last application is downloaded in Prague for example by a taxi driver, a student, a mother on parental leave, someone who wants to take the road to work.
Now that everyone's messing with those Pokémon, they can collect this all the same.
A person sees where the orders are throughout the city, comes to it, clicks and sees when it needs to be delivered and delivers the shipment.
It is set cheaper than competitive services.
At the moment, we are still making a web interface, which will be crucial for companies to send shipments, fill in data about them on the web, or create points on the map.
We are then able to invoice them for the use of the service every month.
Are you currently working on a full-time project?
It's annoying to us, but we normally have it on the job so we can sustain and develop the project.
There is no strong multinational investor behind us, we are two guys, one of whom had a brilliant idea and the other jumped into it with other stimuli and ideas.
Now we are looking for an investor strong enough to manage to curb not the Czech market with us, but who should with the passing of the ball go with us to the global product and become another huge player in the market like AirBnB and Uber.
The story of Titanfall 2 is supposed to bring almost forgotten variety.
This will fix the second part and the solo game in it will be, according to the first information, more diverse than in Call of Duty.
The length will be around the standard eight hours and the filling is supposed to be based on the concept of the network field in the first part.
You can therefore look forward to freedom of movement, which includes the possibility of using combat titanium in addition to running.
In addition to the action passages, the game will contain levels focused on reverse movement.
They will be reminiscent of platformers and include rebuses.
Therefore, double jumps, running on walls and rope slides are essential to overcome them.
Sometimes it will also be necessary to eliminate the enemies.
There will also be maps reminiscent of labyrinths and levels with special concepts.
In one example, it will be possible to lift and dislodge platforms and close powerful doors.
You will adjust the shape of the battlefield.
As a result, the pace of the game should oscillate between furious action and quieter moments to explore an unknown planet.
We're playing Jack Cooper, a pedestrian dreaming of a pilot's career.
At the start of the campaign, Cooper and Captain Lastimosa crash on the alien planet Typhon, which is inhabited by enemy soldiers.
And there will be no savagery therein forgiving to him.
Lastimosa also sustains fatal wounds in the crash, and Cooper is given the task of commissioning the captain's titanium.
His dream of a career as a pilot will come true sooner than he expected.
The first step, however, will be to steal the battery needed for the robot’s repair.
Cooper's talks with the titan will also be significant.
Players will be served as a source of information about the soldier's past, but at the same time robotic detached communication will create humorous moments.
For example, when titanium drought will list all the injuries that Cooper faces during the planned jump.
The first information about the campaign in Titanfall 2 was brought by the server Polygon.
In addition, the result can be assessed in two months and Bonusweb will give you the first impressions from the network game after Gamescom.
Titanfall 2 will be released on October 28 for PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
The THQ brand comes to life, but the original publishing house remains dead.
The Swedish company Nordic changes its name to THQ Nordic.
After the collapse of THQ publishing house in 2013, she acquired a number of its brands and the right to use the logo and the name of the company.
For example, Nordic has released Darksiders 2 Deathnitive Edition and Red Faction Collection.
In addition, 23 more games are being created for the publisher and 13 of them have not yet been revealed by the company.
Thirty years ago, when I was retired, my wife, after thirty years of marriage, found by twenty years a younger man, our neighbor.
I knew it from the beginning - first she apparently tried for a long time, then they got together.
He's such a big guy, probably her type, because she's been dating like that before me.
She's mad at him.
In the first days, her voice even changed, she had such a girl, a voice in love.
But when I told her I knew what was going on, she denied it.
I watched the whole thing.
He then left work regularly at half past four, so she always left at three to shop.
Every day she tried to at least see him.
Later, I found out that they were meeting at his house, in the laundry room.
How many times did I know they were there?
I got the keys, he was determined to catch them there.
But I don't know why, I always stayed at home after all.
I've never been able to go there, take that decisive step.
You may laugh at me, but I believe that my wife thoughtfully controlled me.
Soon she found out that I was manageable, that I was going to do what she wanted.
And I really did.
Maybe I'm just such a pussy.
Neighbors told me they knew that too.
I was such an idiot that I never asked them what to do.
I was afraid if it all broke down, it would be bad.
That it would affect everyone in the family, only the daughter knew something.
So I always put it off, on and on.
But one day I went to his apartment to find something I needed to help with in the laundry.
He went there with me and I told him that I got anonymous, that he was dating my wife, and that he was pointing to it all.
I asked him what he would say.
He stood there, shrugged his shoulders, stared at the ground, and did not say a word.
Then I also met his wife once on the way out of the store.
I told her, but she didn't believe it at all.
She didn't respond, and she didn't tell me.
Nobody told me anything at the time.
I'm the kind of person who's never been to much of a place, who's having trouble getting to know someone, let alone finding a woman.
So I didn't even think about divorce.
I was always counting on it to end one day.
I thought I'd forgive her for all this and life would go on.
That's not how it was.
And I've never really dealt with it all.
I still have it in me today.
I used to show it to her quite a lot, but in the end I left it alone.
He still lives in the next house, and I still live with her.
It's just that she's more like my wife than my housewife.
She always did everything at home - she cooked, washed, cleaned.
She's hard-working.
She always tried to make me have no other reason to complain.
And it can be said that she's good.
But sometimes I'd like to caress her, hug her, and she won't let go.
We go for walks and shopping together and everyone thinks what a happy marriage we have.
But she once told me that she never loved me.
That she loved me and loved me, but that she didn't love me.
And I see that she still loves him, he's her god.
And I don't get tired of life like that.
Already when it started and I was carrying it very badly, I once told her that I didn’t want to live and asked what she would say to it if I finished it.
I wanted to know if she would agree or not.
And that's what I wanted to hear from her: yes or no.
But she thought about it and finally said, "But there's plenty of room here."
Prime Minister Manuel Valls wants to establish a new French Islamic Foundation, which should serve as a bridge between the state and its Muslim inhabitants.
After the terrorist attacks, France is stepping up its fight against radical Islamists, and the government and the local Muslim minority are calling for help.
"If the Muslims themselves do not help the state against those who violate public freedom, it will be increasingly difficult for France to guarantee their freedom of religion," said Prime Minister Manuel Valls.
He intends to ensure that only the spiritually educated in France preach in the country.
He also wants to stop funding mosques from abroad, where jihad-vaccinated preachers often come with money.
By October, Prime Minister Valls wants to establish a new French Islamic Foundation, which should serve as a bridge between the state and its Muslim inhabitants.
The new institution will replace the current French Foundation for Islam, which was founded in 2005 by then Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin.
Already at that time, it should have contributed to the transparency of financial flows between the mosques and the countries that finance their construction.
But it was soon hit by internal contradictions, and so it never worked properly.
"It's a total failure," Valls said.
The new foundation is likely to be headed by the former Minister of the Interior and Defense, Jean-Pierre Chevénement, who is known as a defender of the secular state.
There are about 2,500 mosques and prayer houses in France, about 120 of which serve radical Islamism.
Since 2012, the French authorities have expelled about 80 Islamic clerics from the country, and several dozen more are considering this step.
This week, the German police also took action against jihadist clerics.
Imams reportedly recruited fighters for the Islamic State.
One of them operated a space where the believers allegedly radicalized and later attacked the Sikh temple in Essen.
After the attacks on Charlie Hebdo in January 2015, a debate broke out in France about a new institution to replace the dysfunctional foundation.
All of this was accelerated by another terrorist attack carried out by radical Islamists on behalf of the Islamic State.
The new foundation will have two main tasks – to ensure the financing of mosques from domestic sources and also to supervise the imams.
However, it is not yet clear where the funding will be obtained, although several proposals are being considered.
One of them is the special fee for halal food, that is, primarily for meat derived from slaughter according to Islamic principles.
In practice, this tax would be paid by halal food sellers, for the granting of permits.
Some of the money would then go directly to the foundation’s budget.
A contribution of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>10 to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>20 could also be paid by French pilgrims who go to Mecca.
Every year, about 30,000 people leave France on a traditional pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia.
In addition, in French mosques, only ministers who have undergone educational programs at the local universities should be allowed to work.
As a result, their preaching should be in line with democracy.
The government is also shutting down radical mosques.
"We have closed 20 of them since December and others will follow," Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said.
"There is no place in France for those who declare hatred and do not respect the principles of our country, such as equality between women and men," he said.
Zaragoza.
His ex-wife was seriously wounded by an unknown gunman in a shopping mall in Zaragoza, Spain on Friday morning, the newspaper The Independent reported.
The shooting occurred after a woman and her daughter left the garage in their car.
The man was waiting in the car outside the mall, where he also started shooting.
According to witnesses, the man then turned the gun against himself, writes the Independent.
The woman was taken to the hospital by an uninjured daughter, and an ambulance had to arrive for the man in critical condition.
The incident took place around 11 a.m. in the central part of the metropolis of the Autonomous Region of Aragon, near the local university.
Referring to the Spanish agency Europa Press, the Independent writes that the motive was probably the unresolved recent divorce of the two partners.

Summer wishes light, well-digestible meals, but we Czechs are rebels and we have our tastes and our heads.
And so from the summer gardens smells of grilled cockroaches, cockroaches, pork chopsticks.
Nothing too healthy, nothing too light, but sometimes lettuce or roasted vegetables.
True, grilling is time-saving and dishes, in addition, it is a social matter and no one needs to be locked in the kitchen.
But there are also other alternatives, how to make good delicacies, which are special meals, their preparation is a small ritual, but at the same time there is no need to cook anything for a long time, bake, fry or stew.
They will also contribute to our health.
Whether it is homemade sushi or sashimi, where high-quality ingredients and a few well-adopted griffins are enough to make the preparation fun and the food itself a real exotic treat.
As well as even easier rolls of rice paper from today's recipe.
It is even more time-consuming to cook and cool rice.
The paper can only be softened in the water for a moment and then it depends only on the imagination of the cook, how he intends to play with the fillings and accessories.
It's not an algae like an algae.
The advantage of a number of dishes of Asian cuisine today is that the raw materials are already commonly available.
Including loaded sweet and sour ginger, which is one of the basic flavours accompanying sushi or fresh rolls.
You can prepare it at home, but the real pink gari ginger has a unique spicy spice and at the same time a delicious taste thanks to the secret recipe, according to which it is mixed from several types of vinegar and ginger.
Therefore, it is enough to buy a bag of the appropriate size, and the attachment with demonstrable antibacterial effects, supporting digestion and resistance to cough or flu, is ready.
Banana leaves.
They are especially used in Buddhist and Hindu cultures when serving and decorating dishes in a variety of festive occasions and rituals.
Long ribbed banana leaves are very common in a number of countries in Asia and South America, also as a "help" for preparing a variety of baked, cooked and fried foods, which are packaged in them in a similar way as in an alobal.
The banana leaf then gives the dish a specific flavor.
We can buy them in stores with exotic fruits and vegetables, even pre-cut into the shape of wheels.
However, choose only the leaves of saturated green, and therefore healthy - uncracked and without spots.
Similarly, it is easy to prepare a salad from algae wakame, sesame and sesame oil.
You can buy it frozen again.
Who often eats or prepares sushi, probably will know especially algae nori.
In Japan, it is one of the most important types of seaweed, from which it is produced by cutting, pressing and drying the so-called nori leaves - plates intended for the production of sushi.
Wakame - a dark green algae growing in the waters around the island of Hokkaido - is also fresh and dried, and is as popular as nori algae.
By the way, who wouldn’t know miso soup with wakame, supposedly Asian women have been using it for a long time to recover after childbirth.
And at all, this algae has almost miraculous effects.
It cleanses the blood, strengthens the blood circulation, even allegedly prevents gray hair and is literally loaded with minerals.
Dry and sliced wakame also serves as spices, for example, to flavor rice.
Fresh algae are first allowed to boil in water, then rinsed, put in boiling water and boil for half a minute.
It is then cooled in ice water, the middle ribs are cut off and further processed, such as a favorite salad.
However, buying it ready, frozen, is the easiest solution.
All that remains is to wrap the roll with an easy vegetable filling, delicious and light, full of healthy flavors.
Such a longevity bomber.
If you resist and do not come with an additional grilled barbeque.
Eat healthy, light and summery.
Asians know how to do it.
Just a few special ingredients and a little skill, and you have an interesting fresh dish that deliciously combines flavors.
And it's done once two.
Four pieces of rice paper, 40 g of carrots, 40 g of white radish, 100 g of green carob, 60 g of salad cucumbers, 60 g of algae wakame and 60 g of sweet chili sauce.
A handful of chopped coriander, a tablespoon of black sesame, a tablespoon of syriach chili sauce, 20 g of mango and 40 g of loaded gari ginger, a little pine nuts.
First, let's get the rolls ready.
Soak the rice paper in cold water for five seconds.
Then we take it out and wait for it to soften.
In the meantime, in hot water, cook the sprouts for a short time, after about three minutes, let them cool quickly into ice water so that they do not lose their color.
Place a filling of vegetables on the allowed paper and wrap it.
Prepare the filling from white radish, carrots and salad cucumbers, cut into fine noodles, mix them with sweet chili sauce, add chopped coriander, thoroughly mix and put on rice paper.
Add the egg yolks to the banana leaf, add the sprouts, and finally finish the whole dish with wakame algae, stuffed with ginger, a slice of manga, sprinkle with black sesame seeds and add a few pine nuts.
Britain must settle for silver in seven-match rugby, Fiji picks gold
The impressive performance of the UK in seven-man rugby ended with a destructive footprint on the last obstacle, Fiji defeated the British in the final match on Thursday night at Deodoro Stadium here in Rio at a high 43:7.
Fijians gave a masterful lesson in processing, dumping, losing, supporting game, running on the line, and brutal forces – and won gold, their first Olympic medal ever.
The defeat came with the unprecedented price of comfort in the form of a silver medal - for Britain the third on that day - and the British could be proud of their performances in the inaugural Olympic tournament of seven-man rugby, defeating New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The win over the South Africans 7:5 in the semi-finals the same day, may have frozen in the finals.
However, Fiji would have defeated a 15-member team in its form in full health.
While it may not be comforting for the British, they can be delighted that at least one of them will have a gold medal around their necks tomorrow: the Fijians’ head coach is Ben Ryan, the former head of England from Wimbledon.
The United Kingdom has taken a step back.
Eight years ago, under Ryan’s leadership, the Adelaide Sevens lost every game.
They lost the only one.
This defeat hurts, but progress is undeniable.
Fiji began spectacularly, the British penetrations reflected for joy.
For Captain Tom Mitchell and other teammates, it was like running behind a series of moving buses and the World Cup champions led 5:0 when Osea Kolinisau emerged from the corner.
The timer showed four minutes and Jerry Tuwai added another down on the right wing from which the conversion was made.
12:0 and Britain barely touched the ball.
The great Mitchel tried to stop the huge Leon Nakaraw and prevent him from scoring for the third time, but only slowed down the Fijians.
In the seventh minute, Jas Veremalua threw the touchdown into the right corner and the British lost 17-0.
Nakarawa added another one on his return and there was still more than 1 minute left on the clock... from the first half.
Vatemo Ravouvou then penetrated through the awkward Britons and landed on the line where he scored.
After the conversion to 29:0, there was a break.
It was as if Fiji was born for rugby 7s, while the British were still learning to pass.
That's how it is.
The British made massive changes after half-time, and the Fijians stopped their efforts... for a whole long four minutes, which was good compared to the first half, until after the brilliant fijian interlude, Joshua Tuisov penetrated further.
Dan Norton tried to get a chance for the British, threw the touchdown in the left corner to increase to an 36:7. But the game was won by the inhabitants of the Pacific islands long ago and their fans at the feast sang, waved flags and danced.
It was hard not to admire the completely cheerful attitude of the Fijians.
In the final moments, Mata Williame sweetened the Fijian victory with another attempt.
The whistle sounded, the Fijians hugged, and the British fell on the lawn completely flattened.
The same day Fiji defeated Japan in the semi-finals 20:5 and the United Kingdom defeated South Africa in the narrow semi-finals - a difference of one conversion.
Kyle Brown got the South Africans in the lead in the first half, but Dan Norton, thanks to his dazzling work, broke through the defensive line and scored under the hook in the second half.
Marcus Watson, Anthony’s brother from England’s 15th team, scored a great late landfill – and eventually a silver medal as well.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning to win rowing race inspired coach’s fight with cancer
On these Games you will not find more emotional gold - and that's what to say.
From the first shot to the last, during 220 punishing breaths in history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found further significance in their golden moment at the Estacio de Lagoa.
There were two voices in the boat, but there were three voices in the boat. When the boat hovered on the surface in front of the second Olympic gold in the race of women's pairs, there was still a voice in the boat of coach Robin Williams still present. They are the first women in the history of British sport.
Their preponderance was absolute, overall it was their 39th race, in which they remained unbeaten.
What we see - two excellent athletes flying on the surface of the water with the elegance of a swan - does not fully reflect the nature of victory.
For every gold medal in rowing, there's a battalion of helping hands that make a difference piece by piece, and no hands were more helpful than the hands of a coach who 30 months ago didn't know if he would survive that day when he was diagnosed with cancer.
According to him, it was uncertain.
I was suffering from bladder cancer, which can be operated on, and I underwent this operation.
Without surgery, anything could happen.
That would be a very bad situation.
It will change your view of things a little bit.
The cancer was diagnosed by Williams in December 2013.
Fortunately for the whole trio was that it could start treatment early in 2014, off-season, and thus reduce the failure to a minimum - if that's what we can call it under such circumstances.
I needed to make money, so I had to get together quickly.
That was a stimulus.
I was in the hospital and I was walking around the room -- 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said a few steps is enough.
That's how it started.
Rowing is a journey in itself, but this was a little more difficult.
Immediately after the victory, their first thoughts on Williams, who was very nervous in the morning, spoke less than usual as he tried to manage his own restlessness.
Stanning, the captain of the Royal Artillery Regiment, who is on a mission in Aghanistan, said: "This week I've been emotionally down, maybe it's a bit extreme, but it means so much."
Again, it underscores how much it means to me, how much Helen and I have been working together, and how much Robin has been working together.
So far, it's been three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we wouldn’t be anyone, so he’s got a huge thank you, he’s the best coach in the world.
I couldn’t have wished for a better coach or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a single race in five years.
The pair set a stunning rhythm that their rivals couldn’t match.
Even in the final 500 meters, when crews from New Zealand and Denmark began to approach, Stanning and Glover had a very large reserve.
We concentrated at the maximum at the moment.
Helen shouted, "Don't stop, don't stop."
It's really important not to get carried away.
We had a good start and at the same time we did not want to achieve something fabulous.
We weren’t looking forward to today’s fireworks, we just wanted to hang out, go out and win the race, which we managed to do.
The couple takes a year to think before deciding what to do next.
Glover is getting married next week, with TV adventurer Steve Backshall as her future partner.
Now he wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn’t mean to say it would be my last race.
That would mean too much pressure.
It took about six months in London to find out that I was an Olympic champion.
It was all so new and I was so stressed.
It took about four minutes here.
I feel much better about it," she said.

Prison?
Rather, let them drive people for free, says the tax collector Rube<0xC5><0xA1> to the groundbreaking indictment.
Six taxi drivers and a former officer of the Prague Magistrate’s Office are charged, the <0xC4><0x8C>T said.
You have made a number of reports in which you have detected fraudulent practices and those who are supposed to be in the group that will be in court.
You've faced a few awkward clashes with uncovered actors for that.
How powerful is the report of the prosecution of members of the organized group to you?
I was expecting some kind of trial.
I'm mostly curious about the verdict.
But I don't think they should be in jail.
It's useless.
First and foremost, they should return all the stolen money.
And they should return them so that they'll drive all the people for free.
That's a rather peculiar solution.
Does this mean that you don’t see the punishment as effective enough?
It is enough for me that some of them are so afraid that they are no longer doing the job.
For example, one makes pingla, the other distributes pizza, and one completely gave it up.
The defendants can theoretically get two to eight years in prison.
Do you think this is an adequate rate?
In general, I have a problem with deprivation of liberty.
I consider it a bad punishment.
Imprisoning someone, especially in such a case, is nonsense.
Such people should return to the companies they took her.
For a quarter of a century, they did this by destroying our country’s name and stolen people.
So let's make a good business card now and distribute people for free.
I can't imagine any other way.
It would work as a public benefit.
As someone who goes to collect garbage, they would get a car and drive people around Prague for free.
No, I really think they're gonna get a parole and they don't care.
They'll find another way to cheat somewhere.
He studied at the Miroslav Ond<0xC5><0x99>í<0xC4><0x8D>ek Film Academy in Písek and then at the Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Bati University in Zlín.
It belongs to the people who in the Czech Republic started with viral videos and videos directly for the web.
She works as an editor for Internet TV Stream.cz, where she participates in a number of shows, and is now preparing the Prague Guide, which is intended primarily for foreign viewers.
Rube<0xC5><0xA1> advises those in the form of short reports which services in Prague are better avoided and which ones, on the contrary, he recommends to use without fear.
Previously, he filmed a series titled How to, City of Cheats?, Life in Luxury, A Enough! and Prague vs. Money.
In the prosecution, they are referred to as an organized group.
The police followed her for months.
Can such a network of fraudulent taxi drivers be labeled mafia?
They're such cute mobsters, not the ones we know from Kmotro.
It's more about mafias - juniors, but the organized ones are definitely.
The only thing is that they keep an eye on each other (taxi stations).
Prague is completely fragmented.
I followed, for example, that the main station does not like with Paris, Paris does not like with taxi drivers waiting at Karlovy Vary (disco club)
Everyone is taking care of their own place, and each group is organized.
It seems to be a complicated network.
However, only seven people, six taxi drivers and one former magistrate officer were charged, who warned the drivers against the checks.
As you say, the undesirable phenomenon has not disappeared from the streets.
So what percentage of Prague scammers are in the taxi service according to your estimate?
It is a very small percentage.
The worst people on the street are still there.
For example, I am talking about Ale<0xC5><0xA1> Ryja<0xC4><0x8D>ek.
That's a man who's really dangerous - he drives a telescopic hopper in his car, and every Friday and Saturday he stands by Charles Bridge and drives people.
The last time I went with him, he wanted seven hundred for three kilometers.
The police did not arrest him for some reason.
They chose only a few people from the whole big group.
However, the same is true in other locations in Prague.
Thus, the seven people indicted are hardly able to eradicate the already notorious Prague nesvar, which apparently has a much larger dimension.
Of course, it's absolutely useless.
It will help, but all evil will not be washed away, that's true.
Do taxi drivers who rob foreign tourists still appear in the same places that you showed in the reports, that is, at the Charles Bridge or on Paris Street?
Yeah, that's right.
In these places they stand every day and every day they violate the decrees.
It is ignored by both the city police and the Prague magistrate.
It's not even cats anymore, but absolute indifference.
Business of Prague Taxi Drivers in Numbers
Yet some of them, even if they are only part of the group, will be brought to justice.
It's already a breakthrough.
So I have to ask: do you feel satisfied?
If I took it as a satisfaction, it would be wrong, because my goal was, is and always will be to improve the center of Prague.
And even if I feel like it needs to be a little bit better, I will continue to do so.
You need to push the door on the other side.
Even if the last thief remains, we should still do something to remove him.
You can't be satisfied with that.
But that’s not the case, there are more of them.
Are you still trying to confront them right in the taxis?
Sometimes I do test drives and I have to say it's still bad.
Just last week I caught one taxi driver, by the way, from the same group, and he was very surprised to see me again.
He charged 560 crowns for three kilometers, although he later claimed that it was 56 crowns (using a decimal point trick).
He had a receipt, the cops came, and this taxi driver was so cutely bold that he was still going to those cops and asking them when someone would finally give him the 56 crowns.
A similar case.
A taxi driver crossed a decimal point on the taxi meter and stole tourists by 357 crowns.
Can it be said that the audacity of fraudulent taxi drivers has not ceased even after you showed in your footage the faces of those who charged nonsensical amounts for a short ride?
Their audacity is still unbelievable.
What happened to the cab driver claiming 56 crowns?
The police sent him away with the fact that they could not discuss with him on the spot because he issued a receipt.
And that, I think, will be a problem in that court (six taxi drivers and one ex-official).
There will be a taxi driver with his receipts on one side, and a police officer on the other.
However, according to the decision of the Supreme Administrative Court, the magistrate may not use secret recordings from the taxi service vehicle as evidence in court.
When I was filming the parts about their fraud, the taxi drivers themselves alerted me to this precedent.
I’ve always wanted to use it for my reportage.
Are you concerned that this fact could protect them from the courts?
I hope every judge understands that no taxi driver could drive for six or ten crowns a mile, because he would not enjoy it.
You talked about a decimal point trick, which, in particular, is moved by underwater taxi drivers in front of foreign clients.
Is it still up-to-date, or are they worried about continuing to use this fig after your reports are published?
I think we popularized this trick by broadcasting the show on the contrary.
Recently I was driving with one taxi driver, bragging in front of me that he is the honest taxi driver.
But then I noticed a black cardboard glued from the side of the taximeter.
When I asked him what he had in there, he said, "You know what it is."
When taxi drivers-frauders were not well served by fines, can the courts with their colleagues warn them?
Is there anything that can dissuade them from cheating?
You said that, in your opinion, they would always find a way to cheat.
I think nothing can dissuade them.
But someone can push them out of those places.
And these are the fair taxi drivers who should be fighting harder to get them out of there.
From my experience, I have to say that these fair taxi drivers in Prague fortunately prevail.
But do they want to go against those who ruin the reputation of their services?
They have a taste, but they lack a mind.
They don't know how to walk and they can't say exactly what they want.
When they organized the demonstration (because of the proposal for a comprehensive restriction coming from the office of Mayor Adriana Krná<0xC4><0x8D>ová), it was not very clear what they really wanted.
They once said they didn’t object to Uber, they just wanted the same terms as the service, then they said they wanted more than Uber.
It turned out that they just blocked Prague and from it came only the best possible advertisement for Uber.
How do you overall assess the approach of the Prague Magistrate in solving the problem of overpriced fares?
It can be seen that the criminal police had to intervene in order to resolve something.
The magistrate was short.
They had a mole out there that carried information, which means that the taxi department had been doing its job for several years completely in vain.
I hope the officer's been charged with all the checks he's done down to the last check, to make sure he realizes what he's done.
That's the worst I can think of.
I was even on a check-up ride with him, which I only learned later from their schedule.
It has been several months since the last episodes of the series were published.
What's the response?
I mean, especially for foreign viewers, which is actually what the series is most focused on.
Whenever I have friends from abroad, I play the videos.
And then when we go around Old Town Square, they are surprised that the same people who are seen in the footage are really standing there.
Unfamiliar Prague celebrities.
I'm serious.
I would build a mound around them so people would look at them.
The Museum of Communism on the street.
My last question is clear.
Do you take a taxi when you need it?
Oh, yeah.
I drive with services for which I do not have to pay in cash, but with a card.
I use services like Uber or Liftago where there is no possibility of fraud.
But there are also many dispatches that are fair.
I've only taken a taxi on the street since then.
The driver said to me after getting into the car, "Well, you have the courage."
I'm dressed as an Italian tourist.
Taxi drivers’ fraudulent practices were reported as early as 2005.
Former mayor Pavel Bem went on a control ride in disguise for an Italian tourist in the same year, and immediately on the first attempt the driver scolded him by two hundred.
But the editor Rube<0xC5><0xA1> had a worse experience.
Taxi drivers charged him 820 kroner for a ride from Old Town to Wenceslas Square, which amounts to about 195 kroner per kilometre, as the reporters calculated.
The Prague Magistrate set a maximum price of 28 crowns per kilometre.
In the filmed report there are also other surprising amounts: for example, a two-kilometer journey from Paris to Truhlá<0xC5><0x99>ská cost a tourist 400 crowns.
Expensive rides were also provided by taxi drivers waiting at the Charles Bridge.
For a drive to the Angel, which is 2.5 kilometers, they charge for six hundred crowns.
Marble is washed mostly with clean water, as much as possible without chemistry and the longer the better.
The dirt from it goes well, although sometimes the dirt has to go down with a scalpel, it needs to be lengthened from the folds.
It’s not easy and it’s not quick, the restaurateur Vanesa Trostová from Old<0xC5><0x99>ichov in Hájí approached her work.
Hat down in front of it: the tomb is paved with scaffolding, after which it is necessary to climb up and down again countless times.
“The restaurant owner should be careful, patient and unpretentious about the working environment,” she said.
This is by far not her first restoration work in Fr<0xC3><0xBD>dlantsk.
Thanks to it, for example, the stone elements of the facade in the back of the Frydlant Town Hall were restored, the statues of St. Mary Magdalene in Záti<0xC5><0xA1>í, St. John Nepomuk in Frydlant, Piet in Frydlant District Street, Mariánsk<0xC3><0xBD> sloup in Fr<0xC3><0xBD>dlí in Frydlant and at Frydlant.
The restoration of the tomb of Melchior, Kry<0xC5><0xA1>tof and Kate<0xC5><0x99>ina from Redern began in Fr<0xC3><0xBD>dlant in 2011.
Now the surface of the stone elements is cleaned from dirt and crust, the loosed stone parts are secured against falling and displacement; they will either anchor to the wall or to each other.
There is also treatment and preservation of the surface.
The inscriptions on the tomb will be gold again.
"Then the inscriptions on the marble slabs will be gilded with pure slab gold," said V<0xC4><0x9B>ra Sobotová, spokeswoman for the State Memorial Care of the Municipal Authority in Fr<0xC3><0xBD>dlant.
There is no record from the past that the grave has undergone any repairs.
At a closer look, they will catch the holes, drilled in the marble columns.
They are hundreds of years old and are the remains of the decoration of the tomb.
It was richly decorated, unfortunately after the invasion of the Swedes during the Thirty Years' War, everything disappeared.
They literally looked at the grave, Sobotova noted.
In the Church of the Findings of the Holy Cross are the restaurateurs with a slight excess as at home.
After the flood in 2010, it was necessary to put in order the tombs that were under water, the baptistery was restored, the murals in the tomb and now the tomb.
"We would also like to go into stained-glass windows in the future," Sobota said.
The church is otherwise in very good condition, every year we put money into maintenance and repairs.
Restoration works on the restoration of the Redernov tomb will total 128 thousand crowns.
They will be paid from subsidies, the city will not invest any of its money in this part of the reconstruction.
One hundred thousand crowns will come from winning the regional round of the Historic City of 2015, the remaining 28 thousand crowns is a contribution of the Ministry of Culture, said Fr<0xC3><0xBD>dlantu Mayor Dan Ramzer.
The deputy council decided to release the victory for the restoration of the tomb.
Expert opinions on future developments in selected foreign markets monitored through indices and comparisons with the Czech capital market (PX) over a period of one and a half months.
Markets are dominated by low volatility and growth.
Who would have said that at the beginning of the year?
The U.S. S&P500 index, which underwent 12% corrections in February, is now at a new historical high and has already posted 7% since the beginning of the year.
Once again, the iron rule is confirmed that traders should never go against the interests of central banks in the long run, which in the end have always achieved their goal.
In a situation where U.S. stocks are at a historic high, volatility is disappearing again, which is currently the lowest since 2014, when markets have risen happily and fearlessly thanks to the quantitative release of the U.S. central bank and when, as today, the Volatility Index (VIX) has remained steadily below the 12 percent threshold.
And you shouldn't either.
While the Fed continues to prepare markets for a gradual increase in interest rates, quantitative easing in Europe and Japan is in full swing and last week the Bank of England, which will buy <0xC2><0xA3>70 billion in bonds over the next six months, also added to the deal.
The new wave of quantitative emancipation therefore pushes the already low yields even lower and contributes to the almost complete elimination of risk and fear of the future.
How long will this state last?
That's a million-dollar question, of course.
At the moment there are no risks in sight, the world economy is undergoing almost constant growth without major fluctuations, the situation in the commodity market and in China is stabilizing and Brexit is no longer a topic, so we should probably not be too surprised if in a similarly calm regime the Americans also endured.
It's a pity that Juncker doesn't study Klaus!
I am very pleased that my friend Michel Barnier has accepted this important and demanding task.
I wanted an experienced politician for this difficult work, said Juncker, the head of the European Commission, when he named the French politician (truly experienced, because he was pierced by so many different transnational political functions that a better example of the so-called European elite would be difficult to find from the Europeans).
Juncker’s choice has blotted out hints of hope that it is in the EU’s serious interest to look for forms of future friendly coexistence with Britain.
However, most British media have accepted Barnier's name as Juncker's act of war.
Barnier is a rock European federalist.
He hates Britain.
As the European Commissioner for the Internal Market (2009-2014), he was in charge of reforming European banking law.
He conceived it in a way that only he could conceive: a stubborn enemy of the Anglo-Saxon conception of the free market and of the model of capitalism.
Advocate of multilateral regulation, he co-authored the concept of the so-called banking union and, in opposition to everything that comes from London’s City financial center, enforced legislation overwhelmingly tough regulation of the financial sector and services.
So this Michel Barnier, the representative of Paris in a dispute with London, will be a hard, unwavering and probably ruthless negotiator.
I don't think that's good news.
How not to mention in this context the peaceful and friendly division of the Czechoslovak federation, to which the balance, overview and empathy of Prime Minister Václav Klaus contributed so much.
Even today, the Czechs can be close friends and allies with the Slovaks.
It is a pity that Juncker did not learn from Václav Klaus - at least in this respect.
It would be for the good of all!
Earthquake around Putin?
The Kremlin's leader has released his closest friend Ivanov.
Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday fired Sergei Ivanov as head of the presidential office.
Anton Vajno will take his place.
This was reported by the Russian media with reference to the Kremlin press service announcement.
Putin said that Ivanov was being released at his own request.
At a meeting broadcast on Rossija 24, the president said he was meeting Ivanov's wishes when he took office that he would be head of the presidential office for a maximum of four years.
At the same time, he announced that Ivanov will be his Special Representative for Ecology and Transport.
The report on the exchange at the head of the presidential administration, which will now be led by Ivanov's current deputy Vajno, is considered quite surprising.
Ivanov, 63, is said to be one of Putin’s closest associates.
This former KGB officer, for example, has previously served as Secretary of Defense and Deputy Prime Minister.
He will now leave the chair of the President’s Security Council.
Ivanov, however, said in a meeting with Putin that the length of the stay at the head of the head of state's administration is actually a record.
It lasted four years and eight months.
In this context, he recalled that, 25 years after its establishment, 11 people have already been replaced in this role.
Neither Quito nor Deblistova Uncle will play with <0xC5><0xA0>afá<0xC5><0x99>ová in the final.
So far, none of Friday’s tennis matches have been turned into a final.
Petra Kvitová was the first to lose her fight, which yielded to the Puerto Rican surprise of Monica Puig after sets 4:4, 6:1 and 3:6.
After a while, Kvitova was followed by Czech deblists <0xC5><0xA0>afá<0xC5><0x99>iva with Uncle.
The winners of the Williams sisters scored in the first set after winning, but lost two sets and the Russians eventually looted the set in a shortened game.
The second set was lost in a ratio of 4:6.
Half of the success in the morning program in Rio was recorded by Czech rowing: skier Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Synek won his semifinals with an overview, when he defeated the second Damir Martin from Croatia, despite the relaxation in the final almost a second.
Today was good, the conditions were great, the wind calmed down.
“I tried to save as much as I could,” the son said.
It was his opponents, unlike him, who had to fight for progress.
So it took them some strength, it could be easier tomorrow.
But I’m not saying it’s going to be easy, it’s just playing cards,” said the rower of Prague’s Dukly.
Mirka Topinková-Knapková, however, did not walk in the footsteps of Snyk.
The 35-year-old rower took fourth place in today's semi-finals and on Saturday she is expected to start in the B final and fight for 7th to 12th place.
They won't defend London gold like that.
For the first time, I did not make it to the finals.
I’m a little sorry, but on the other hand I drove a quality race and I gave everything I could.
The opponents were just better, Topinková Knapková bowed before them.
She fought to the end and believed that she would get in her fourth games among the elite six.
He gave up the fight just before the goal.
I knew the girls were balanced, that anyone from that field could step in.
I was surprised by the Chinese woman who had such a finish.
And I thought I could pass through Austria to the final.
“Unfortunately, today was the race of a lifetime,” she told the 2011 World Champion.
Far behind the final gates in Rio remained the young shooter Filip Nepejchal, who did not manage to get out of the qualifications for the second time, this time a little in bed.
In it, Nepejchal occupies 33rd place.
The qualification was best for the Russians.
Sergei Kamensky scored 629 points from the first, while Kirill Grigorjan (628.9) scored the second.
Nepejchal's shot was worth 620.5 points.
Athletes also spoke for the first time in Rio, including Czech seven-footers Kate<0xC5><0x99>ina Cachová and Eli<0xC5><0xA1>ka Klu<0xC4><0x8D>inová.
After the second discipline of the Olympic competition, the Czech record holder Eli<0xC5><0xA1>ka Klu<0xC4><0x8D>inová ranks eleventh.
British Katarina Johnson-Thompson, who jumped to a height of 198 centimeters, as well as Belgian Nafissatou Thiam.
They both managed to achieve the historically best skiing performance in the Sevens.
They tried to jump another 201 centimeters, but failed.
German, Russian, who's worse?
If we look away from the absurdity of the question posed in this way: German society has gone through a deep self-reflection, while Russian society has not.
In the twentieth century, there were dictators in both major Eurasian nations, and regimes came to power that were inhumane, brutal and terrible.
From 1917 to 1989, the Russian Bolsheviks contributed to a large extent to the 94 million victims of communism mentioned in the Black Book of Communism, whether it was daily individual repression, targeted famines, incompetent warfare or inhuman experiments.
The Nazis inhumanly exterminated about 6 million Jews and the total victims of World War II is estimated to be 60 million.
Germans and Soviets carried out atrocities in occupied or abandoned territories.
In Germany and in the USSR there were not only a few individuals to blame, but a large part of the nation took part in these crimes, whether actively, passively or simply by cowardice or by throwing their heads in the sand.
This is not just the specifics of these nations, we Czechs are equally guilty.
In Germany, immediately after the end of the war, there was a denacification, the Nuremberg Tribunal.
But the most important thing came later.
As the children grew up, they began to ask, “Daddy, grandfather, why did you take part in such atrocities?”
How could you do that!
This brought real reflection and healing to society.
Until recently, the German elites were mainly concerned with the prosperity of the country, the eradication of poverty, the well-being of their citizens.
Now they have other (often na<0xC3><0xAF>vely idealistic) goals, but they certainly do not want to rejoin Alsace-Lorraine or someone - to retaliate - to attack militarily - everyone will admit it.
After the loss of the Cold War in Russia, there was no great reflection.
The window of possible positive changes finally closed at the turn of the millennium, when a former KGB officer (sic!) Vladimir Putin came to power.
Often the criminal past is celebrated in Russia today.
The policy of Putin’s Russia is revenge, the conquest of lost territories, the humiliation of the West.
The health, prosperity and future of one’s own people are of no value to the crown prince.
Strike your own, and strangers will be afraid.
I still believe that it is only in those decades of despotic regime that the Russians are not genetically or culturally inferior – destined for Asian (self) tyranny.
Who benefits from growing tensions around Crimea?
The Ukrainian Army.
In recent days and hours, the situation on the Ukrainian-Russian border in the Crimea region has deteriorated.
Who benefits from growing tensions?
After a long period of relative calm, relations between Ukraine and Russia deteriorated again.
The pretext of the Ukrainian side became the Crimean peninsula, which was annexed to Russia more than 2 years ago and is part of its territory.
Of course, the messages from both sides are contradictory and it is difficult to verify independently, so we have only the opportunity to think about an old known question to whom it benefits?
According to reports from Moscow, there have been terrorist attacks on Crimea from the Ukrainian side, which, of course, Ukraine rejects and, on the contrary, blames the Kremlin for the provocation.
Information about the arrest of members of the Ukrainian special forces on the territory of Russia has already come from the case of the pilot Savchenko, a known answer that they were allegedly kidnapped on the territory of Russia.
If we agree with the Ukrainian version, in what way would Russia benefit from worsening the situation around Crimea?
The simple answer is: nothing.
The escalation of tensions around Crimea can only harm Russia, mainly from the West in the form of further tightening of sanctions and strengthening of the anti-Russian campaign.
In the past year, the immigration crisis in Europe has led to a drawback from the situation in Ukraine.
The Ukrainian leadership has already lost all credit to its citizens, when the current support of President Poroshenko is around 15%.
Ukraine’s economy would have been bankrupt long ago without the EU’s generous financial injections, and especially the IMF.
In this situation, the Ukrainian regime needs once again to draw attention to its country in order to justify its further requests for financial assistance and to try to improve its reputation in front of voters in its country.
President Poroshenko and other members of the leadership of the forces once again want to show themselves as strong men who are not afraid to face even the great Russia.
It remains to be hoped that all those who are trying to unleash an open conflict between Ukraine and Russia will eventually realize their enormous responsibility for the lives of not only the soldiers, but all the ordinary people on both sides of the enemy, and stop their hostile actions in time.
Inflation in Bulgaria for the first time in eight months
According to national statistics, the monthly inflation rate in Bulgaria reached 1% in July.
This is the highest value in several years (since June 2012) and the first non-zero value since October last year, when a positive inflation rate of 0.2% was published.
The annual average inflation rate, measured by the CPI, for the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015) was -0.8%.
The consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 101.0%, i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0%.
The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (June 2016 vs. December 2015) was -0.2% and the annual inflation rate in July 2016 vs. July 2015 was -0.2%.
Compared to the previous month, there was an increase in the travel of the following consumer goods groups in July 2016: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%), transport (1.8%), culture and recreation (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), other goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell for clothing and footwear (2.2%), furniture, household equipment and regular maintenance (0.5%), and health (0.1%).
At the same level as the previous month, prices for alcoholic beverages and tobacco products, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communication and education remained.
The U.S. Secret Service has been monitoring Russian hacking attacks for a year.
Information about the Russian attacks came to the public last month when the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) announced it was engaged in an attack on the servers of the Democratic Party headquarters.
However, there is no official report of Russia's involvement in the attack.
Moscow has denied its involvement in the attack.
The report on the surveillance of the alleged Russian attack was strictly secret, as it would reveal that U.S. intelligence services are monitoring the hacker attack and could reveal the way they do it and what resources they use.
Two Russian intelligence services were reportedly involved in the attack.
New Advisory Board on Cybersecurity
The Russian trace tracking material was encoded and only a small group of experts had access to it, Reuters reported.
Of the public officials, only a small group of eight leading members of Congress, called the gang of eight in the United States, was informed.
It is made up of the heads of both chambers, Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan, the Democratic presidents of both chambers, Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid, and four members of the defense and security committees of Congress.
On Thursday, Democratic Party chief Donna Brazile announced that she was setting up a cybersecurity advisory board to “prevent future attacks and ensure the first-class protection of Democratic Party servers.”
There was a dangerous parasite in Alberta's smoked salmon.
The chain has apologized.
On the initiative of the consumer on health problems after consuming the food Salmon wild smoked - pieces 100 g, date of consumption 22.11.2016 carried out a check in the stores Albert on Wenceslas Square and Na M<0xC5><0xAF>stka.
The verification found that batch L23012562/T4 with an expiry date of 22.11.2016, which the customer pointed out, was no longer available and therefore the product of the same batch with an expiry date of 11.12.2016 was removed.
Laboratory examination confirmed the presence of Anisakis spp. Anisakis simplex.
It is a parasitic worm of the digestive tract of marine mammals.
It is dangerous for humans - larvae in the body cavity or muscle tissues of fish are a powerful allergen and human-eating live larvae can penetrate through the stomach wall into internal organs, <0xC5><0xA0>ticha said.
We sincerely apologize for the problems with this branded product.
We immediately withdrew this batch from the sale and for preventive reasons we also withdrew all other batches of this item.
There was a mistake on the part of the supplier we are dealing with, and at the same time we had this product tested by ourselves, said Alberto Barbora Vanko, a spokeswoman for the company.
If the customer has purchased this product, he can return it at any of the chain stores and receive a refund.
Larvae destroy frost and sufficient heat treatment
The seller was the company Nekton - Vr<0xC5><0x88>ata.
The Prague and Central Bohemian Veterinary Administration informed the hygiene authorities of the occurrence of the dangerous product.
According to the food safety website, people after eating the parasite can become ill with anisakiosis, which is manifested by severe abdominal pain, vomiting and nausea, or the disease can occur without symptoms, the <0xC4><0x8C>TK reported.
Symptoms occur one to two weeks after insufficiently heat-treated infected fish is consumed.
After three weeks from the onset of the disease, the larvae usually leave the digestive tract spontaneously.
Adult worms and larvae are sensitive to higher and lower temperatures, so they are killed either by sufficient heat treatment of fish meat or by freezing it.
Veterinarians currently checked salmon at the recipient of imported goods in the Central Bohemian Region.
Three of the five samples examined had the parasite in them.
The shipment with 1700 products arrived in the Czech Republic at the beginning of April according to the State Veterinary Administration (SVS).
Expedited, for the most part to the Ahold chain, there have been 919 packages to date.
Unsold stocks of the product are currently being withdrawn from stores, SVS spokesman Petr Pejchal told <0xC4><0x8C>TK on Friday.
Immediately after finding positive samples, veterinarians banned the shipment of other products from the warehouse.
Seventeen-year-old British woman wanted to escape from Raqqa, apparently killed by a Russian attack.
After the initial enthusiasm and rapid marriage to a jihadist who was suddenly killed, sobriety came.
The expected caliphate paradise for British girls turned into hell on earth, from which there was no escape.
According to relatives, the girl was in contact with her sister Halima.
She phoned her in the UK repeatedly and told her she wanted to go home.
Leaving the Islamic State is like trying to escape Alcatraz.
They are ordered to shoot unintentionally, The Telegraph quotes the family lawyer of the deceased girl Tasnim Akunjee.
The last tracks led to Rakka, from where the girl called the last time.
Then came the news of her death, which cannot be verified.
The family was communicating with her from an apartment in East London.
They discussed how to get out of Raqqa and cross the Turkish border.
He hoped to meet his former student again.
But Kadiza was probably killed before she could escape because the house she was staying in was overrun by a raid in May, British ITV News reported.
The TV said the bomb was apparently dropped by a Russian plane that attacked an ISIS bastion in Syria.
You would take the blue out of the sky just to get your child out of a dangerous area, said Tasnim Akunjee, a family lawyer.
In the week when Kadiza was planning to flee Islamic State territory, an Austrian woman was captured in an attempt to flee and, according to the information available, publicly beaten to death.
I think she (Kadiza) set it up as a warning and decided not to take any risks, according to BBC Akunjee.
The family would do anything.
Kadiza Sutlana, along with 15-year-old school friends Shamima Begumova and Amir Abasova went on a trip on February 17 last year.
All they said at home was that they were going out.
But they headed to Gatwick Airport and from there via Turkey in IS-controlled territory.
The girl's family, according to the lawyer, did everything in her power to get Kadis back.
You'd take the blue out of the sky just to get your child out of a dangerous area, and this family did everything they could, pulled all the strings to get their daughter home.
But it was not possible without risking being caught, the lawyer added.
The only positive, he said, is that Cadiz’s fate could serve as a deterrent for other girls or even boys who are fooled by Islamist propaganda.
"There are many cases where people went there, realized how things are going there, understood how far it differs from the promises of Islamic State propaganda, and wanted to come back," Akunjee said.
The fate of Cadiz's classmates is unknown.
But since they have also been silenced, their families have to accept that they are most likely dead.
To jail for money.
In Scotland, you can go to jail without committing a crime.
For many centuries, the village of Inveraray was the county center and the seat of the Duke of Argyll.
Since the middle of the 18th century, courts have been held in the town hall and the basement under the hall has served as a local prison.
The conditions in which the prisoners lived were deplorable and many prisoners tried to escape.
Many of them are also successful.
Therefore, the city officials decided to move the premises of the prison to a new location.
The new building was completed in 1848 and was much more welcoming to prisoners, with heating and gas lighting.
However, it was not in operation for a long time, its closure took place for economic reasons already at the end of August 1889, since the smaller repair facilities were expensive to operate and did not pay too much.
Convict stories and hunting ghosts.
The prison opened to the public a whole century later, visitors can compare the old building with the new one to see for themselves how different conditions prevailed in them.
Guides in period costumes further enhance the authentic experience.
There is also a torture room, where visitors can learn what forms of punishment were applied to criminals, whether it was breaking fingers or burning marks on the body.
As part of the tour, tourists can be locked up in one of the cells, mostly for the purpose of photographing a memorial, or to invoke the feeling experienced by prisoners behind bars.
Inveraray Prison is one of Scotland’s most famous prisons.
There have already been several groups of hunters of paranormal activities and to this day the museum allows people to come to hunt some ghosts.
However, such a night will go to 300 pounds, which is about 9,500 crowns.
In addition to this popular tourist attraction, the village also attracts great food, surrounding panoramas and history.
The "Anime" effect on Snapchat is criticized as an Asian cartoon
According to Snapchat, this filter is inspired by anime, but some observers say it is racially insensitive.
Every day, Snapchat allows about 150 million users to change reality and play with identity in ways that border on absurdity.
You can make a pineapple, a dog or a character that looks like it came out of Roy Lichtenstein’s painting.
Filters are simple tools that distort reality and generate more than 30 million improved selfies every day.
Any errors will be made public immediately.
Snapchat’s filters have been criticized in the past with accusations that the app promotes blackfacing or that it promotes white skin shades as an ideal of beauty.
So when she offered users this week a filter that allowed them to have slanted eyes, curved teeth, and swollen faces, some critics called it a racist Asian cartoon — “yellowface.”
And they asked whether these repeated controversial questions pointed to a larger problem of society - a problem of diversity.
On Wednesday, Verge and Motherboard wrote about it, and the news and outrage spread quickly, and Snapchat immediately said the next day that it had canceled the feature.
The company offered an explanation: The filter was intended as an expression of accounts to the characters of the anime, not as a caricature of Asians.
But to observers who witnessed racism, the filter reminded them of painful stereotypes in action.
Others without a package of comparisons with the anime refused.
Grace Sparapani, an American art student from Korea whose tweet about the photos was widely shared, said in an email that the filter was “at least harmful and embarrassing.”
She added that “it’s hard to argue against comparing the obvious Asian cartoon and filter effects.
It turns out that the filter is not only about the yellowface (yellowface), but that the yellowface is touched to the contemptuous extreme.
Snapchat is not the only company that has crossed these cultural boundaries.
It seems that American culture has an endless struggle for diversity and inclusion in it, from corporate meeting rooms to Holywood and the facilities we all carry in our hands.
And the huge number of young people on Snapchat — who are more racially diversified than their older partners — can mean that even greater sensitivity can be expected.
“When a single Snapchat filter creates an image that is offensive to some user,” Katie Zhu, 25, said in an interview Thursday, “it’s very difficult for these things to go unnoticed today, as it used to be.”
Katie Zhu, a product manager and designer working for Medium, decided on Thursday to delete her Snapchat account and urged others to do the same.
In an article for Medium and in a phone interview, she said she believes racially motivated issues reflect a lack of diversity in recruiting Snapchat workers.
Katie Zhu criticized the predominantly white, all-male leadership of the company and ended the article with a hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
“It’s either that they don’t have any diversity among employees and people of color at the time when these things are being decided,” said Zhu, who is of Chinese-American descent, “or that’s where people of color work, but not in positions to feel safe or comfortable to speak.”
Other observers share her view – a complaint that Snapchat left largely unanswered.
The company does not publish figures relating to the diversity of its employees with the fact that it has the status of a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to talk about the racial origins of its employees, but according to a spokesman, the company recently hired a recruiter to focus on underrepresented populations and internal inclusion management.
Zhuowa adds: “I’m curious if they really need more users who can say it’s not okay,” with her account remaining cancelled.
Military officers distorted intelligence about ISIS, says parliamentary committee
The parliamentary committee said in a report issued Thursday that U.S. headquarters officers had changed intelligence reports to portray a more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than the events in the country provided.
According to the preliminary report of the working group by the Republican chairman of the Armed Forces Committee, the Intelligence Committee and the Subcommittee on Defense, there was a "widespread dissatisfaction" among analysts of the Central Intelligence Service, according to which their superiors changed their assessment of the U.S.
The Central Command, known as CentCom, is an army headquarters in Tampa, Florida, that oversees U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
The report’s statement reads: “The intelligence services’ outputs approved by Centcom’s superior officers usually offered a more positive picture of the U.S. counter-terrorism efforts than were confirmed by the facts on the ground, and were consistently more positive than the analyses obtained from other parts of the report.”
“What happened at Centcom is unacceptable – our fighters are damaged when the policymakers are presented with the wrong analysis,” said Ken Calvert, a California congressman and Republican.
The failure in the leadership of Centcom goes all the way to the top of the organization.
The ten-page report describes in detail the ongoing problems of the Central Staff in describing and analysing US efforts to train Iraqi forces in 2014 and 2015.
While there is no conclusive evidence that the top officials of the Obama administration ordered the reports to be amended, the report states that analysts had the impression that they were under pressure from Centcom leaders to present a more optimistic view of the danger posed by the Islamic State or the Islamic State.
“In the first half of 2015, many press releases from the Central Staff, statements and congressional statements were substantially more positive than what the actual events were,” the report said.
For example, a Centcom official publicly stated that a major military attack to take over Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq’s second-largest city, remains under Islamic State control.
"This is quite clear after months of investigation," said MP Mike Pompeo, a representative of the Kansas Republican Party.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, top intelligence officials at the U.S. headquarters manipulated the staff’s intelligence output to minimize the danger of IS in Iraq.
The Republicans formed a working group after they learned of analysts' concerns that intelligence information related to the Islamic State was being manipulated.
After the report published on Thursday, further investigations must be followed by a more detailed investigation.
The Centcom intelligence services are still under investigation by the Inspector General of the Ministry of Defense.
Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday, which were consistent with some of the findings of the Republican working group.
“Between 2014 and 2015, Centcom created a very narrow process for compiling the assessment of information on IS and Iraqi security components,” said Adam B. Schiff, chairman of the committee and representative of the Democrats.
According to Adam Schiff, this process “has led to distortions in the outputs of the intelligence services,” it has damaged the morals among analysts, and “has not sufficiently taken into account disagreements.”
However, Schiff and the Democrats say they have found no evidence that the White House is trying to push Centcom analysts to adjust their findings to the “proposal or political situation.”
The preliminary results of the parliamentary investigation were published in the Daily Beast on Tuesday.
Last August, the New York Times reported on an ongoing investigation by the Pentagon’s Inspector General, which was launched following complaints from Centcom analysts.
Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement that the Department of Defense would not comment on the parliamentary report as the Inspector General's investigation is still ongoing.
But he said that “experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence community and the Department of Defense welcome a healthy dialogue on these critical national security issues.”
The investigation has implications beyond the question of whether the U.S.-led bombing of Iraq and Syria is successful (a verdict now proclaimed by the growing number of defense officials).
However, last year’s accusations raised questions about the extent to which President Obama can rely on the central staff to honestly assess military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis locations.
Criticism of Islamic State reporting reflects conflicts for more than a decade, when Centcom intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker wrote a research paper stating that the administration of President George W. Bush - in spite of the objections of many analysts - would overreact to this.
Hooker also played a key role in resisting Islamic State intelligence services.
Last year, authorities reported that Hooker’s team had concluded that, despite public statements to the contrary, the airstrikes against Islamic State’s refineries had not significantly weakened the terrorist group’s financial resources, as the group was building temporary refineries and refineries.
The Times reported in September that the findings were not disclosed outside of headquarters.
The commander of the Centcom, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was then subjected to criticism last year after many lawmakers found the testimony of the Senate too positive an assessment of the war.
General Austin resigned in April and was replaced in Centcom by General Joseph L. Votel.
The U.S. won ground hockey in the fourth game in a row, so today will be the decisive game in the UK team
Katie Bam scored three goals in a 6-1 win against Japan, and just a day later, for the U.S. women's ground hockey team, she scored the first two goals of the match, in which on Thursday America defeated India 3:0.
Five goals in two games is a memorable success, but Bam, 27, said she wasn’t sure if she ever made it.
'I have no idea, 'she said.
I'm not one of those people who scores goals.
But he knows this: The Americans in the Olympic tournament lead in games 4:0 and share the first place in the group with the United Kingdom, which remained unbeaten on Thursday after the 2:0 defeat of Japan.
The United Kingdom and the United States will face each other on Saturday in the final game of the first round.
Both teams qualified for the quarter-finals and the match will decide which of the six teams will finish in the first and which in the second place.
The team from the first place will avoid the strong Danes, who are at the head of the second group, for a little longer.
Whatever Saturday's game ends, the Americans have sparked an uproar here with their surprising ride, four years after finishing between the 12 teams at the London Games.
Bam was on the team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and first took ground hockey in her hand when she was 3 years old (her older twin sisters played in Drexel) and joined the national team when she was 16 and became his youngest player ever.
She missed the 2008 Olympics because she did not make it to the final list.
Then came the year 2012, when neither she nor her team members had much success.
The following year, coach Craig Parnham was appointed, and things began to change.
“Cultural change, mental change, physical change,” Bam said.
In London, we didn't have the pace of work we have today.
We've made a complete turnaround.
On Thursday night, Bam started in the first half with a close-up shot from the goalkeeper.
India entered the match without winning the tournament, but the team proved surprisingly tough and kept the score 1–0 until the third quarter, when Bam took advantage of the opportunity.
She escaped on the left side of the playing field, then rolled into the center and shot the ball into the goal to get the American in the lead 2:0.
Melissa Gonzalez added the last goal in the second quarter.
The elimination of American goalkeeper Jackie Briggs, who helped one goal in each of the three wins, was the first in the tournament at all.
She's in great shape.
Just like Bam.
"We're in a good place now," Parnham said, "but how good it is will depend on the result of Saturday's match.
Zen trampoline in the middle of Olympic rage
It doesn't matter where you are, it doesn't matter what time it is - it's the Olympics.
From the events in Rio de Janeiro there is a feeling of persistent, indescribable and passionate alternation of competitiveness and effort.
It is as if the Olympic torch itself were a hot relay pin, handed over from a sledgehammer to a swimmer, a gymnast and a triathlete.
You can’t turn on the TV, read the newspaper, or listen to your neighbor’s conversation in the queue at a cafe without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky, or the hostility between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, the upcoming loveliness of women with cheekbones in their faces, is at the Olympics for the first time and could also be among those whose names will be heard in households in the prime broadcast time between ads and sponsor spots, if he were a swimmer, gymnast or even a striker.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, is fighting for Olympic gold in jumping on a trampoline.
The Olympic fire does not shine on all competitions the same.
Far from the center, a little in the shadow are sports that are not generally recognized: shooting with air guns, archery, badminton, taekwondo.
We will always be successful in the classic swimming style - and will probably rule for a long time.
But if I can name my extraordinary favorite, let me draw attention to the unobtrusive charm of the trampoline.
Although jumping on a trampoline has been an Olympic sport since 2000, when it was first introduced at the Games in Sydney, after 16 years of intervention, the sport remains almost unnoticed - many people I questioned didn't even know it was an Olympic sport.
It could be regional indifference.
The U.S. never won a medal in jumping on a trampoline, and until 2012, none of the athletes reached the final.
Prices in the male category are usually divided between China and Russia and in the female category between China and Canada.
This year, the gold medals from London will be won by Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada.
But jumping on the trampoline is even more unfortunate, partly because the uninitiated ear will seem to be more suitable for clown university than for the Olympics.
I have to admit, I'm not an expert, I'm just an enthusiast watching from the ground up.
It has comic potential - the comic vibration of infinite reflection - but also the lure of gymnastics and diving, two sports that combine.
The word “trampoline” is derived from the Spanish “el trampoline”, which means “jumping board.”
Aspiring champions jump on a huge trampoline that shoots them up to a height of almost 10 meters and perform sets with several elements (salt, heat and combination) before finally landing on their feet again.
According to the official Olympic program, they are evaluated by design, difficulty, and “age in the air”.
Twenty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio.
The usual trajectory of the Olympic track is forward.
Warriors for the gold medal must go further, faster and even higher, sometimes to the end, sometimes there and back, up and down.
It is trying to catch up not only the target belt or the start wall, but, as the TV news reports, also another imaginary line: the world or Olympic record.
This unanimous effort is noble, admirable, a bit fanatical – and enough to bring the audience to tears.
But I think it’s a bit exhausting when you’re watching the Olympics.
Jumping on the trampoline in this regard brings relief.
The track of the athlete on the trampoline is upwards.
The point is not to move forward.
He or she reflects as if they were in a weightless state as astronauts, flying up, then down, and then again effortlessly up.
Without competition and, of course, without difficulty, this is not possible, but for the duration of the set, there is no fierce struggle to achieve the goal, no measurement of distance, but only perfect, smooth stretch of time and gravity.
This is the closest the Olympics and Zen are approaching.
The women's qualifying and finals are held on Friday afternoon, at 1 p.m. Eastern time, and the men's competition on Saturday at the same time.
NBC will finally broadcast within the afternoon block, which starts after both days at 2:00 p.m.
In the midst of the Olympic madness, they promise calm, pleasant moments that you will probably miss through other fights.
And if attention is only to be gained by making male athletes the subject of lovers’ views and materialization – as recently suggested by US gymnasts, according to the Wall Street Journal – then Logan Dooley is just waiting for his new fans to catch their breath.
“Protesting Generations” in Ethiopia, longtime ally of the US
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Protesters demanding political change in Ethiopia have come across violent opposition from the government.
Witnesses say many protesters were shot dead during clashes with the police.
Is there a war in Ethiopia?
In the past decade, it has been one of the most stable nations in Africa, a strong Western alliance with a fast-growing economy.
But in recent months, the country has been gripped by anti-government unrest, which is spreading to more and more areas.
In the last week alone, thousands of people have taken to the streets demanding major political changes.
According to human rights organizations, the government’s response was ruthless.
Witnesses say policemen shot and killed crowds of unarmed protesters.
Video footage of the protests, probably from the end of last year or the beginning of this year, captures security forces beating young people with sticks after being forced to stand by a wall on their hands.
The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights is now calling for a thorough investigation.
“It has always been difficult to keep this country together and it will be even harder to take a step forward,” said Rashid Abdi, head of the Horn of Africa project for the International Crisis Group.
Ethiopia is the second most populous nation in Africa after Nigeria and its stability is supported by the West.
U.S. military and intelligence services are working closely with Ethiopians to eliminate the danger of a terrorist attack in the region, especially in Somalia, and few African countries, if any, are receiving such assistance from the West.
Ethiopia’s economy was developing at an impressive pace.
Its infrastructure has improved dramatically - in the capital Addis Ababa there is even a new suburban train.
And the streets of the city are typically quiet, safe and clean.
However, Ethiopia can hardly be described as a model of democracy – human rights organizations constantly talking about government repression – the opposition in the country has been suppressed, dissidents effectively silenced.
Many of them were deported, imprisoned, executed, or exiled far into the desert.
However, this may change.
“When you suffocate people and they have no choice but to protest, there will be a breakthrough,” said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer at the University of Central Ethiopia.
All young people are protesting.
A whole generation protests.
There are many complaints, ranging from land disputes to absolute control of the ruling coalition.
After last year’s elections, which were widely criticized, the ruling party and its allies have won the last seat held by the opposition and now control 100 percent of parliament.
At the same time, the pressure on the border with Eritrea is growing, and the conflict along this inaccurate, controversial border has claimed hundreds of lives in June.
Anylistists fear that separatist groups that have been more or less suppressed in recent years, such as the Orom Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, may try to exploit the confusion and rearm themselves.
There are several factors that explain why, now after years of citrus under the surface, these bitter feelings have rekindled.
The first of them is seemingly harmless: smart phones.
Many Ethiopians can communicate through social networks until the last few years, when cheaper smartphones have become commonly available and the provision of Internet services has improved.
And even if the government bans access to Facebook or Twitter, as is usually the case especially during protests, many people can still communicate via internet proxies that hide the location of these people.
Several young Ethiopians spoke about how they gathered for the protests.
Furthermore, there is greater solidarity between the Oroma and Amhara, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.
The Oroms and Amhars are not natural allies.
For many centuries, the Amhars, mostly from the Christian mountains of Ethiopia, excelled in politics and commerce and exploited the Oroms, many of whom are Muslims and live in the lowlands.
But that's also changing.
"We are on our way to unified leadership," said Mulatu Gemechu, leader of the Oromo.
The largest protests took place in areas inhabited by Amhara and Oroma.
Many Amhars and Oroms believe that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the ethnic Tigris, who make up about 6% of the population and control the army, intelligence, trade and politics.
The third cause of unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Zenawi, a former leader of the rebels, was Ethiopia's prime minister for 17 years until his death in 2012, when he succumbed to an unspecified disease.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could see through the corner.
Analysts say he was particularly skilled at detecting initial signs of dissatisfaction and using envoys to process opponents and win them over to his side.
“The current regime lacks basic knowledge,” said Abdi, a conflict analyst.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Hailemariam Desalegn, was pulled out of relative obscurity in order to replace Zenawi.
Unlike Zenawi, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analysts say he does not trust the security services controlled by the Tigers.
Many fear that the result will be further bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such a riot was in 2005 after thousands of people protested against what analysts described as elections that the government coveted and then stole.
This was followed by a hard strike in which many protesters were killed – albeit fewer than in recent months – and this period of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts praised Ethiopia’s leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new suburban train and measurable progress in the fight against poverty.
However, it is quite clear that the gradual increase in disputes within the Ethiopian government did not stop it.
And there is a dangerous ethnic formation.
Last month, protesters in the Amharic city of Gondar attacked Tigris-owned trading firms and social media outrage against Tigris is becoming more and more common.
Analysts say the protests are putting the US and other Western allies in an uncomfortable situation.
The U.S. government is using Ethiopia as a base for drone overflights over neighboring Somalia, although it has recently declared the base closed.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, at the same time it does not want its ally to disintegrate in the already unstable region.
"That," said Abdi, "is a very sharp edge of the blade."
Donald Trump Explains His Statement on Obama and the Financing of ISIS as “Sarcasm”
Donald J. Trump on Friday tried to downplay the latest controversy that flooded his campaign by saying he didn’t mean it seriously when he insisted several times this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the “founders” of the Islamic State terrorist group.
The explanation raised new questions about the Republican presidential candidate’s ability to speak clearly to the American public.
He also puts his supporters in an awkward situation, who fought hard to defend him in a stormy time and must explain that he may not have taken his remarks seriously.
Following this proposal at a meeting on Wednesday night, Trump confirmed the statement on Thursday, insisting in interviews that he did not really intend to say that the president and Clinton created IS.
In a tweet on Friday morning, Trump said he was being sarcastic.
The post was the opposite of the old man’s claim for just one day, when Trump said in several interviews that he was serious about his accusations on the contrary.
When conservative radio moderator Hugh Hewitt tried to help ease Trump’s remark by reminding him that Obama was seeking to destroy ISIS, the Republican candidate for president did not respond.
The latest storm comes at a time when Trump has tried to focus his campaign on the economy as his preferences in pre-election polls decline.
Trump and Clinton took part in an economic duel in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Trump attempted to return to the issue.
He again warned on Twitter that Clinton’s proposals were linked to tax hikes, saying her speech was boring.
Trump has used sarcasm before.
At the end of July, when he picked up a wave of criticism when he proposed that the Russians should infiltrate Clinton’s emails, he later explained his remark with the words: “I am of course sarcastic.”
This approach allows Trump to push the boundaries of political statements and mitigate them as needed.
“I think it’s his way of testing the extent to which some of the response messages from his supporters have to find out how they react, and according to the reaction then one way or another, he ‘provides an explanation,’” said Ruth Sherman, a communications specialist who watched the language that both candidates used.
But I also think that he is adept in his statements and knows that they are vague enough to be able to explain them differently.
As the results of pre-election polls in his favor continue to decline, Trump has chosen an even more divisive tone in recent days, rather than softening things for general voters.
A new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll released on Friday showed Tump was far behind Clinton in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado, and very close behind her in Florida.
Trump tries to avoid apologies for the provocative statements he makes, but often accuses his critics of misinterpreting his words or misunderstanding his sense of humor.
But as Trump faces increased attention in the final months of the presidential campaign, Trump’s jokes have put his devoted supporters, who must publicly stand behind him, into an awkward situation, no matter how provocative his remarks may be.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York City, who is one of Trump's most prominent supporters, had to defend the candidate in an interview with CNN on Thursday.
“I think what he’s saying is a legitimate political comment,” Giuliani said when asked about the credibility of Trump’s claim that Obama and Clinton founded the Islamic State.
This is true in the sense that before Obama, ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, which he mistakenly called a newcomer, and it happened because he withdrew his troops from Iraq.
Most ordinary Republicans try to argue that the Obama administration, in which Clinton served as Secretary of State, allowed ISIS to rage and failed to aggressively handle the situation in the Middle East.
Before Friday’s meetings in Pennsylvania, Trump continued to put out a fire on the media around him on Twitter for retaliating and being interested in him.
He laughed at the “poor, pathetic” television scholars who were trying to understand him and said, “They can’t!”
Several Democrats have apologised to Trump for saying that this is just further evidence that he is not eligible for the presidential office.
The coffee shop has been pushed out of the market price. Now back in Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a shabby place in Williamsburg where you could only pay in cash, without Wi-Fi, but where coffee has been served for 15 years.
Naturally, she was squeezed out of the front of the house on Bedford Avenue.
Soap Cherie - a store that Verb replaced in the summer of 2014 - sells cake-shaped soaps.
The locals mourned it as the last loss of a growing city.
Artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter: “New York is a change, I know, but I still can’t believe that the CBGB is dead, the Chelsea Hotel is looted and Verb is now a soap store.”
But if New York is a change, then it is also a rediscovery.
The resurrected Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of the original location.
New Verb has wifi and accepts credit cards, but there are some of the original employees working there and there is a similar, modest atmosphere.
Coffee is still good, too.
The manager of the new Verbo is Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime employee of the original café who is both the owner and CEO of the new location.
In Verb it began in 2001 and remained until the end.
When one of the customers offered him to pay for the move to a new place, he said he would be happy to do so.
Rodriguez (36) left a lot of things as they were.
Verb still has the same bakery supplier and bought the same model of espresso machine.
He even re-used the lighting from the old Verb.
Rodriguez said he wanted to try something new.
He started using new ingredients.
Sandwiches with ham, egg and cheese and toppings such as capers and fried onions are on offer.
You will also find bowls of brown rice.
The café no longer serves beer, but offers you fresh fruit juices.
After nine months, Rodriguez noticed a steady influx of the original staples.
“Many of the original customers had to move out of Williamsburg because of the prices,” he said.
Last Sunday, there was one of those clients, Rebecca Oliveira.
Mrs. Oliveir, 34, lived in Williamsburg and frequented Verb Cafe.
It was happening even after the cafe moved to Greenpoint.
She said that when Verb closed, she had completely stopped drinking coffee for a while.
“I found that what I like is the coffee and culture in Verbo,” she said.
Now she drinks coffee again, but that day, instead of her usual iced coffee, she took a mixed chai, another novelty.
Tom Rosenthal, another long-time customer, has been loyal to Verba since 2003.
He goes before work and always orders the same.
“At four and eight o’clock every day, I come here like a watch, and they’re already preparing my case with everything and butter for me,” he said.
Photo: Rodriguez said he wanted to try something new and add new ingredients to the offer.
Mr. Rosenthal still orders what he usually orders, but occasionally lets him put bacon, eggs and ham on his cheek.
Rodriguez said he didn't regret that the soap shop had taken his old place.
The truth is that the owners of Soap Cherie offered him to make special soap for Verb and use filtered coffee from the cafe as an ingredient.
"I think we could still use it," Rodriguez said.
Traditional Polish residents of Greenpoint also welcomed the café well.
One of the new customers translated the offer into Polish and Rodriguez said he wanted to find a place where he would soon expose it so that his new neighbors would feel at home.
The new location has other advantages.
A local producer of fruit juices wants to bottle and sell filtered coffee.
It is possible to expand the café to the neighboring building.
A lot of customers just have to get their old favorites back.
Joseph Whitt was a regular customer, and when the cafe closed, it broke his heart.
Mr. Whitt says that when the cafe reopens, getting in and having coffee is like coming home.
"I missed the smell," he said.
Depressive food from the time of crisis - in "Square Meal"
Shortly after taking office in March 1933, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat in the Oval Office and ate lunch.
President Roosevelt enjoyed a selection of 5th Avenue meals, such as goose patties and Maryland turtle soup.
But his menu for this day was more modest: eggs in a devilish way in paradise sauce, potato puree and as a dessert plum pudding.
“It was an act of culinary solidarity with the people who suffered,” said Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe added: “It was also a message to Americans how to eat.”
The couple, who live in Brooklyn Heights, are dedicated to gastronomic history.
Andrew Coe’s last book, “Chop Suey,” was about Chinese cuisine in America, while Jane in her book, “97 Orchard,” tells the life story of a residential home on the Lower East Side through food.
Their new joint work, “A Square Meal,” published by Harper on Tuesday, is the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.
They themselves showed their culinary solidarity and met with the reporter for dinner at Eisenberg’s sandwich shop, a small steep buffet in the Flatiron district that has been in operation since the crisis, since 1929.
Jane (54) ordered cream cheese and a sandwich with chopped olives, Andrew (57) ordered turkey, mashed potatoes and mixed vegetables.
The reporter ordered a mass carbonate, which, according to the couple, was great for talking about food during the crisis.
"Carbuncles were very popular," said Ms. Ziegelman.
Peanut, liver and bean carbonates were sold.
They were made from that compound and other cheap foods that set the ingredients.
Change the amount of peanuts you would have to eat for dinner.
Andrew Coe was ugly.
"They'd lie in your stomach like lead," he said.
In the years before the crisis, American cuisine, especially in rural areas, was served in the form of a buffet of what you eat.
Teams of women cooked for the farm workers and freshly baked cake was served for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during World War I. A Square Meal looks at how the nation coped with the fact that it was suddenly not a land of abundance.
“It was a time when food became a central, feared point for the American people,” Coe said, explaining why he and his wife decided to write about it.
Equally feared was the new budget diet: Mysterious foods, such as carrots and casserole foods, were spread as “an amazing way to use the residue,” Ziegelman noted, because chefs could hide unsightly ingredients under a layer of cream omelet.
Fresh fruit has been replaced with cheaper dried fruit.
Meat – for many years the central point of American food – has become an economically-assigned luxury.
Strange mixtures, which were supposed to serve as a calorie and nutritional filler, were preferred to taste or even common sense when cooking.
During surveys for a book containing recipes, Ms. Ziegelman prepared a daily meal of baked onions filled with peanut butter.
"It wasn't a favorite addition to the evening table," Andrew Coe said.
Jane Ziegelman said, “It was surreal.”
Peanut butter with baked onions does not go together.
It was typical for a lot of homemade recipes.
Like never before and never after, domestic economists—including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Office of the Domestic Economy from 1923 to 1943—controlled the country’s eating habits.
They published recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, urged women to take over budget constraints, and slugs, such as cream spaghetti with carrots, turned into tasty foods.
The book “A Square Meal” is a celebration of historical sensations.
Above all, desserts were created in the government’s response to its hungry citizens, such as the pose of President Herbert Hoover “I’ll have a cake”.
While publicly praising the simple Iowa farm kitchen of his childhood, he ate as the chosen millionaire he became.
“He liked to eat continental cuisine, like cucumber sauce fish,” Andrew Coe said.
He ate in an almost gold-plated room, wearing a tuxedo.
He was incredibly old-fashioned.
President Roosevelt would probably have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor hadn’t accepted him to set an example with his own stomach.
As the book relates, Mrs. Roosevelt hired a housewife who was not interested in taste at all. This led to the White House “serving not only almost the most gloomy food in all of Washington, but also the most disgustingly prepared way.”
Many of the eating habits of the crisis have gone away as soon as the country has re-established itself.
The message has remained in our constant study of calories and nutritional values, says Ms. Ziegelman, and in the way science is applied to cooking.
The couple says that while writing the book, they better understood Ms. Ziegelman's mother's eating habits - such as why she couldn't throw away the food.
“She was really afraid of wasting food,” Andrew Coe said.
Ziegelman recalled, “The people were sick of it.”
There was an accident with the wreaths.
When Eisenberg's tables were clean, she and Mr. Coe drew out a dessert they had prepared at home: a plum dessert that President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
“It’s called plum cream,” Ziegelman said, adding that the usual trick was to give modest recipes elegant names.
There was no cream, just plums, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone reluctantly plunged the spoon into dense brown matter.
Surprisingly, it was bad.
Andrew Coe added, and then again.
And as the right farmer said to his wife, "A little chopped stew would be a good fit."

Most of the refugees who flee to Europe come for economic reasons.

Gilead is entitled to reimbursement of legal representation costs in the case of a patent against Type C jaundice against Merck Group
The District Court judge ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc. is entitled to reimburse the fees incurred by it in the case of the patent against type C yellow fever against the drug manufacturer Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was ordered to pay $200 million in damages for violating Merck’s two patents in connection with the highly successful Gilead, Sovaldi and Harvoni drugs, after the federal judge found repeated misconduct and misconduct on Merck’s part.
Federal Judge Beth Labson Freeman said in a case file Thursday that Gilead is entitled to the forgiveness of fees incurred in connection with the case.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gilead, which dominates the market for next-generation anti-jaundice C drugs that can cure more than 90 percent of patients with this liver disease.
The case comes from 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other and claimed to own basic laboratory research for sofosbuvir, the active ingredient of Gilead’s drugs.
U.S.-backed troops claim they have gained full control of Manbij
U.S.-backed military units have gained full control of the northern city of Manbij near the border with Turkey after the last Islamic State fighters fled the city, a group spokesman said on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) is now sweeping through the rest of the group of radicals hiding in the city.
The units freed more than 2,000 civilians detained by the radicals, Sharfan Darwish of the SDF alliance and the military council of Manbij told Reuters.
“The city is now fully under our control, but we are still searching it,” he told Reuters.
Clinton earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid a federal tax rate of 34.2 percent.
Hillary Clinton released her 2015 tax return on Friday, stating that the Democratic presidential nominee and her husband had earned $10.75 million in that year and paid a real tax of 34.2 percent.
In 2015, Clinton was donated $1 million to charity, mostly to the Clinton Foundation (Clinton Foundation). Ex-President Bill Clinton contributed to the joint cashier with an amount of nearly $5.3 million in fees for lectures, and the former Secretary of State admitted a $3 million in income to the Secretary of State for his appointment.
Clinton’s co-candidate, U.S. Senator Tim Kaine of the state of Virginia, along with his wife Anne Holton, published tax returns in 10 years.
In 2015, they paid a real tax of 20.3 percent.
“Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to be a model for financial transparency,” said Jennifer Palmieri, who helped Clinton campaign.
In contrast, Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and renounces his earlier promises to make his tax returns public.
It is customary for presidential candidates to publish their tax returns, even if they are not required to do so by law.
Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers cited an audit of the U.S. Treasury Department as a reason for his refusal to publish tax returns.
“Your move,” campaign campaigner Hillary Clinton said on Twitter, following the Democratic candidate’s tax returns.
Michael Cohen, a special adviser to Trump, told CNN on Thursday that he would not allow Trump to publish tax returns until the audits were completed.
Trump’s critics, including Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other members of the Republican Party, agree that his rejection raises questions about his net profit, charity contributions, business transactions, and various other relationships, including relations with Russia.
Clinton made a strong statement on the issue and posted a video Friday reminiscent of how Republicans’ high positions on Trump urged him to publish his tax returns.
On Thursday, he mentioned the question in his speech on economic issues in Michigan.
“She refuses to do what all the other presidential candidates have done for decades — to publish her tax returns,” she said.
The Politico organization said Trump had paid no or very low taxes in the last two years of the 1990s, and the New York Times publicist quoted a number of tax advisors and accountants as saying it could be so today.
Federal tax rates have become a theme in the election of the president.
Clinton enforces a rule named after billionaire Warren Buffett that would ensure that anyone earning more than $1 million a year will pay a tax of at least 30 percent.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
Last week, Buffett at a Clinton meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, where Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate is based, called on Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffett said he had also been audited by the IRS and that Trump was “not afraid” of the finance ministry, but of voters.
Clinton's campaign published tax returns back to 2007.
Clinton, who now lives in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average federal tax of 32 percent between 2007 and 2014 and a combined tax of about 40.5%.
According to Clinton’s 2015 tax return, unlike most Americans, their income is only $100.
Their main investment was a low-cost mutual index fund, from which the Clintons reported income on dividends and interest in the amount of $109,000.

Condoms filled with chili or fireworks to protect elephants in Tanzania
Tanzania’s conservationists are using an unorthodox way to prevent elephants from walking into human dwellings – throwing condoms filled with chili powder at them.
The Honeyguide Foundation, which came up with the idea a few years ago, together with the U.S. environmental organization The Nature Conservancy, promotes and trains volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use this non-violent four-step procedure to protect their homes and crops without harming them.
Many of them used spears to defend themselves.
Friday is World Elephant Day, which is dedicated to the protection of these animals.
“Since they have developed this... toolkit, we’ve seen a change in behavior in these communities. People are much more confident that they can keep elephants out of their fields without hurting them,” said Damian Bell, executive director of the Honeyguide Foundation.
The first and second step is to light a flashlight on the passing elephant and start the bell.
If it does not dissuade him, the so-called “chili cloud” will be thrown out.
Chili powder mixed with salt is wrapped together with firecracker in a condom, its end is enclosed so that only a knot looks out of it.
After firing, the condom explodes and fine chili powder is sprayed into the air.
Usually just one breeze and the elephant goes in a different direction.
The last option is to ignite the fireworks, which will provoke a loud, bright explosion.
A Jewish director leaned on a Berlin hotel for removing the code for calling Israel at the "request" of the Arabs - RT News
A French film director of Jewish descent has sparked a riot in the media after finding that the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin does not have a call code for Israel, according to a staff member based on a “request” from Arab clients.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentary film Shoah, ventilated his frustration from the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin in an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During his recent stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel in the list of hotel calling codes.
However, the state is not listed among the countries to which it is possible to call directly from the room.
How is it possible that in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of Germany, Israel was removed and erased?
Written by Lanzmann.
Hotel Kempinski Bristol instead offers the possibility to call to Israel via its own call center.
The director sought an explanation and, with difficulty, turned to the hotel reception.
The answer he received, Lanzmann said, “shocked.”
The hotel staff responded that the measure was “decided at the discretion of the management of Kempinski Hotels.”
The reason for this move was even more encouraging to the director.
“Most of our guests are Arabs and they demanded that Israel’s dialing code be erased,” Lanzmann said in a letter.
According to the Suddeutsche Zeitung, Israel’s ambassador to Germany, Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, called the case a “great shame”.
We were terrified and shocked by the event.
It's a shame in itself.
The fact that something like this happened in Germany, and in such a hotel chain, is even more shameful.
No further explanation is needed.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions," he said.
The event sparked a strong online reaction, people called it scandalous.
Some believe that the Kempinski Hotel is simply “lost” in the demands of Arab customers.
"Shame on you," says another post, pointing out that the hotel, located on the noble street of Kurfurstendamm, stands near the synagogue.
According to the Spiegel newspaper, the hotel itself promptly dismissed any accusations by calling the event a “oversight” and “apologizing” to Lanzman.
"There has never been a direct order" not to include Israel in the list of calling codes, the Suddeutsche Zeitung quoted Kempinski as saying.
It adds that the call code has been added to the list.
Police use tear gas and rubber projectiles against protesting Brazilian students
Students and police clashed in Brazil’s São Paulo on Thursday as students gathered to protest government reforms in the public education system.
The police used tear gas and rubber projectiles against the protesters.
The problem arose when government law enforcement tried to disperse students, which ended up with police using rubber projectiles and tear gas.
Hundreds of students took part in the demonstration to express their concerns about the plans.
Among the proposals of the Governor of the State of San Paulo Gerald Alckmin in order to save money is also the closure of nearly a hundred public schools and the relocation of 300,000 students.
Some of the protesters could be seen spraying inscriptions on the wall against interim President Michel Temer.
The latest protest comes just days after protesters took to the streets in support of deposed President Dilma Rousseff when the country’s Senate decided to indict her.
Trade between Russia and Iran grows 71% - RT Business
According to the Russian ambassador to Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan, after the lifting of sanctions between Moscow and Tehran, trade turnover rose by 70.9 percent year-on-year.
As the ambassador said, since the lifting of international sanctions against Iran, there has been an increase in interest on the part of Russian companies that trade in the country.
Russian companies are renewing existing ties with Iran, while new companies are ready to enter the market.
Further expansion of trade is, of course, one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran," Dzhagaryan said.
He noted that during the first five months of 2016, trade turnover between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015, reaching $856 million.
Specifically, Russia’s exports to Iran jumped 91.5 percent to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $158 million.
The jumping increase in trade was ensured by the supply of machinery, ground vehicles and weapons," the ambassador said.
Dzhagaryan also expects Russia to visit a record number of tourists from Iran this year.
Last year, a Russian diplomatic mission in Iran issued about 35,000 visas to Iranian citizens, mostly travel visas.
For the first time, Iran has been ranked in the top 20 countries by the number of tourists arriving in Russia.
It is safe to say that the record number of tourists from Iran to Russia from last year will be surpassed," he said.
At the same time, however, Iran is visiting a relatively small number of Russians, and the ambassador hopes that there will be a change.
"I personally can recommend a visit to the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, where the monuments of ancient Persian civilization are preserved in good condition," he said.
Callum Skinner rushed home after the British won gold in cycling
Callum Skinner of Scotland entered the Hall of Fame last night in a men's team sprint at the Rio velodrome when the VB trio defended the 2012 London title.
A 23-year-old Glasgow native was in the role of the brake that Sir Chris Hoy took for his Scot, and the young man delighted the legend when he made his way to the finish line and stole the victory from the hands of the favored New Zealand.
Britain won a surprise victory four years ago and Hoy won the fifth of its six Olympic gold medals.
And they repeated the same trick after finishing modestly sixth at the World Cycling Championships in March, even though Hoy ended his career in the meantime.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement for the specialized introductory racer Jamie Staff.
Hindes arrived just in time.
After Hoye's departure, there was also a vacancy, which Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton attempted to fill.
Skinner was a man of British coaches and the search for potential has now been confirmed.
Kenny Hindes - who was the champion with Hoy four years ago - and Skinner set an Olympic record in qualifying, but took over the jersey in the first round of New Zealand.
And the British trio won gold in the team sprint.
Hindes was slightly behind in his lap, but Kenny pushed the team forward and Skinner held the lead.
The change of strategy was a big part of the transformation when Hindes went to a higher transfer to slow down and allow Kenny and partly Skinner to keep up the pace.
Hoy watched the race from his position as a BBC commentator and when Skinner, Kenny and Hindes went on stage, he did not let his eyes off them.
Twenty-three-year-old Skinner, a native of Glasgow, said, "It's a flattering comparison."
I'm here to get the best out of myself and honor my name.
We set an Olympic record in the final and beat the best.
It was just unbelievable.
There is no better way to win it.
After a triumph alongside Kenny and Hoye in London in 2012, Hindes admitted that he deliberately fell on the track after a weak start.
He later withdrew his remarks and the British rivals had no way of appealing.
This time around this victory, there was no such problem.
Hindes said, “With all the British flags on the stands, I felt like I was in London.”
For the last three months, we've all been together as a team.
We lost in many world races, so winning the Olympics again is just amazing.
It’s one event, one gold medal for a nation that won seven out of ten competitions in Beijing and London.
If this is to be an indicator of progress over the past five months, then a successful five-day ride awaits us.
With the form Kenny showed, it’s not unthinkable that he would repeat Hoy’s success and win three gold medals at one Olympics at a time.
For Kenny, who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, it would also be his birthday on 23 March (this date seems to be sacred to British sport, on this day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister also celebrate their birthdays) – a total of six gold and one silver medal.
No matter how much Hoy won.
As a follow-up, Kenny will take part in a sprint that starts today and will last another three days.
An eighty-eight-year-old native of Bolton said, “I’m enjoying this one right now.
A team race is always the best.
You win along with the others.
To be honest, winning for yourself is a bit lonely.
Hindes said, "When he wins another two gold medals, he should get a knightly title."
It was the only medal race of the day, but Britain was waiting for more good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified as the fastest in a four-kilometer race.
They finished with a time of 3:51,943.
The world record, which fell in London in 2012, is 3:51,659.
The first round and the final (22:42) take place on the second day of the race, which Wiggins will definitely focus on.
Yesterday, before the qualifying race, he was debating with the commissioner when the referees asked him to measure the height.
In a similar women’s race that continues and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie reached the world record with a time of 4:13,260.
The VB team relied on their strong track cycling team to dominate the mid-season Olympics and won many medals.
After truly exceptional performances, demonstrating absolute supremacy in Beijing and London, expectations fell during the preparations for Rio.
In the background were dramatic events, not least the resignation of Technical Director Shane Sutton in April on charges of sexism and discrimination, and the end of the careers of giants such as Hoy or Victoria Pendleton.
However, as the first night of racing on the velodrome proves, it seems that the legendary reputation that the UK team can deliver top performance with perfect timing could be reaffirmed.
Uncertain future of Portland smelter after end of power supply contract
The future of the Portland aluminium smelter in Victoria - and the jobs of hundreds of workers - is uncertain due to the power plant that the company supplies electricity and which informed about the intention of one of the owners of the smelter to terminate the contract for the supply of electricity.
The move comes after the Victorian government decided earlier this year not to extend the grants that keep the company running.
The fixed 20-year subsidy expires in November.
Up to 2,000 jobs in Alcoa Portland may be at risk.
Up to 2,000 jobs - direct or indirect - may be at risk when closed.
And since the smelter consumes about 10 percent of the total electricity produced in Victoria, there may be further avalanche impacts.
Alcoa closed the Point Henry tavern in 2014, which led to the closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.
Alcoa's tavern in Portland is overdue and in danger of closing.
This move follows several years of speculation about the company’s future, initially in response to the strong Australian dollar and recently due to plant production prices.
AGL, which supplies electricity to a large aluminum smelter from the Loy Yang A power plant in the Latrobe Valley, said it expects one of the other three owners to also decide to terminate the contract.
The majority of the plant is owned by the joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, small commercial shares are held by the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp.
“AGL expects the Portland plant to continue to operate, in other words, that the demand for power from the tavern will continue,” she said.
The AGL stated that the contracts are so-called “insurance contracts”, which were to enter into force from November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month notice period, so they will actually expire in 2017.
“AGL continues to assume that the contracts will share in the profits for the fiscal year 2017,” the power plant said.
Any possible impact on AGL’s profits from fiscal year 2018 onwards is currently limited due to the strong outlook of the commodity market for wholesale electricity prices.
The AGL said it had already written down the value of the contracts according to its accounting books in the amount of $187 million “in case of termination.”
Alcoa said its decision to terminate the contract “has no impact on its ability to operate the smelter or secure the supply of electricity to the smelter.”
The U.S. company said it had signed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which was due to come into effect in November of this year, although it still had to explain why it had withdrawn from the contract.
Analysts are very cautious about the possible closure of the Portland tavern in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle due to the weak economy in the sector.
AGL operations manager Stehpen Mikkelsen, who turned to analysts earlier this week, said Portland consumes about 600 megawatts of electricity annually and Tomago around 900 megawatts.
If both of these companies withdrew from the market, this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the [electricity] market.
It would not be good for us as producers,” he said.
Kendall isn't just a star of Kardashian's real estate TV show - now it's the cover of September's Vogue
Kendall Jenner (20), model and the fourth daughter of the clan's mother-manager Kris Kardashian-Jenner, appeared on the front page of the September issue of Vogue magazine.
Kendall, Estee Lauder’s ambassador who showed at fashion week in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on Thursday on her Instagram account.
“In a room full of people I love, I want to cry when I look at this front page,” Kendall wrote.
The revelation of the title page was followed by a bizarre (or simply a continuation of the humor of the Kardashians?) staged video in which the whole family of the Kardashians-Jenners (the baroque thugs Rob and Caitlyn and together with them all could make their favorite uncle from the show.
It's the plotline of almost every "birthday" part of a children's television show (Seacrest says, "Did you think we forgot about you?" with the sincerity of the cartoon rabbit on the show at eight o'clock in the morning), but Kris somehow needed to make sure that the other girl was on the public.
Because when we look at the September issue of Vogue magazine, we're definitely entering a new era of the Kardashians.
Kim's older sister may have pressed Kendall on the cover of Vogue (she was on it with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a different league.
The September issue of Vogue magazine is the best-selling issue of the year.
The edition, which in its thickness resembles a book for advertising purposes rather than a fashion magazine, attracts a number of advertisers (Fashionista estimated that out of 832 pages in last year’s edition there were 615 pages with advertising content).
The discovery of the star appearing on the front page is eagerly awaited, so it’s no surprise that in the past two years, the magazine’s footage has been leaked before it was officially released.
Among the women who have appeared on the cover in the past are Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista or Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have certainly been more “celebrities who make models” on the front page than “models who are celebrities.”
Jennifer Lawrence, Oscar-winning and Dior ambassador, appeared in the title in 2013, a year later she had the honor of Lagy Gaga.
But while it’s highly unlikely that Kendall – whom the magazine describes as the “breakthrough model” of her generation – will fall into the first category, she’ll be in very good company.
These celebrities are not relatives of acquaintances, not even real-estate celebrities, or kids today who know how to make a well-cut video (even though Jenner represents all of this).
They are demonstrably talented women who excel in the entertainment industry.
Beyoncé, who appeared on the front page last year, had one of the strongest years of her career thanks to the release of Lemonade.
Of course, not everyone is excited about Jenner’s success.
Her position in the world of fashion will always be difficult because of her participation in the reality show.
Stephanie Seymor, the original Victoria’s Secret model, criticized Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid in June, calling them “whores of the moment.”
These feelings rekindled with the news that Jenner would appear on the cover of Vogue.
But this dissatisfaction is not in place.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of Vogue.
She is a supermodel in the true sense of the word.
He plays for Mark Jacobs.
She sells you makeup from Estee Lauder.
She and all her sisters sell you pictures of themselves on their own paywalls.
She sells photos of Cindy Crawford's daughter, who she photographed for LOVE magazine.
And in her free time she performs in a reality show, perhaps just as one of the ways to see Kourtney and her children.
Community Legal Aid Centers Reject 160,000 People Every Year
More than 160,000 most vulnerable citizens are denied legal aid in community centres each year and are preparing for the impact in the sector itself, which will have further restrictions on funding for already overused services.
In Queensland, three out of five people—mostly elderly people, immigrants, endangered workers, victims of violence, and people without funds to fight unjust displacement and the like—are being rejected as soon as they seek help and a free right.
Community legal services, which are already so tense to crack, are about to make further cuts.
As of June of next year, these legal aid centers will lose another 30 percent of federal funding.
James Farrell, director of community legal aid centers in Queenslade, said that according to the latest summary report of the National Association of Community Legal Aid Centers, 5,000 people are found to be rejected each year.
Farrell said the situation would get worse without repealing the federal government's decision.
“Queensland’s community legal aid centers are chronically underfunded, meaning thousands of people are being denied the vital services they need,” he said.
People who have escaped from relationships with a rapist, people with excessive and paralyzing debts, families going through separation, workers who are unfairly dismissed - all these people have problems with legal dimensions and this report shows that they have no chance of getting the help they need.
As of June 2017, the federal government will cut funding by 30 percent, leading to thousands more endangered people from Queensland having to grapple with complex legal issues without assistance.
We call on the Queensland Attorney General and Senator George Brandis to immediately prevent this shortfall in funding so that people get the help they need when they get into legal trouble.
In the past year, the state government has fulfilled its commitment to ensure the financing of legal aid up to the national average.
Now is the time to look at the needs of community legal aid centers and the community of their clients and Palaszczuk’s government must invest in this important work.
Donald Trump's Campaign Prosecution After Staff Member Allegedly Targeted a Weapon
New York: Donald Trump’s campaign was sued for alleged inaction after they were told that a North Carolina operations director had pointed a gun at a staff member during a jeep ride in February.
The incident was described in a court file handed over Wednesday to the Charlotte state court by Vincent Bordini, a former software trainer for the state's campaign.
Bordini said he had waited months for the situation to be resolved internally before coming to the conclusion that “it won’t happen.”
Director Earl Phillip "pointed the gun with his fingers, pointed the right point at the trigger, and pointed the cannon at Vincent in the Czech language," Bordini said in the lawsuit.
Bordini, after complaining to the local and regional leadership of the campaign, found that at least four other people had experienced the same with Phillip.
“Weapons don’t have to fire to cause harm,” Bordini said in the lawsuit.
The lawsuit comes just two days after the Republican presidential nominee triggered an upheaval when he told voters in North Carolina that gun owners and gun owners could intervene (which is regulated in the U.S. in the Second Amendment of the Constitution) if his opponent, Hillary Clinton, is elected.
Trump’s campaign says the media has taken his words out of context and Trump has not defended violence.
Bordini in the lawsuit demands compensation from the campaign for negligent surveillance and from Phillip for threatening personal safety, illegal use of violence and causing emotional harm.
Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks did not immediately respond to the message with a request for comment.
Attempts to obtain a statement from Phillip were unsuccessful.
WCCB, a local news agency in the city of Charlotte, announced that Phillip had recently left the campaign.
The call to his consulting company Innovative Consulting Services was not answered within a short time.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is conducting a controversial pre-election campaign.

Britain must continue to spread the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will also be a source of renewal and prosperity not only for our local communities and across London, but across the country.
For me, Heathrow is hugely attractive, just as it was in London in 2012, when we made extraordinary efforts to ensure that all our nations and regions will be able to benefit from the Olympics.
The Olympics were a huge success for both East End and Startford.
And we will do it again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
For our local communities alone, we will create 10,000 new learning jobs, 40,000 new jobs and end the unemployment of young people around the airport.
Just like before the 2012 London Olympics, there will be those who will think that the Heathrow expansion is too big.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the Olympics and that we would make fun of ourselves on the world stage.
The doubters were wrong in 2012 and even in the case of Heathrow it turns out they were wrong.
It will always be necessary to overcome obstacles, but Heathrow can answer every question that concerns him.
Just like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project that involves many people and companies, not just a few.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create 180,000 new jobs, economic growth of <0xC2><0xA3>211 billion, to leave behind a legacy of skills and jobs both around the airport and across the UK.
We have a great team at Heathrow that has put in place a <0xC2><0xA3>11 billion infrastructure investment program in time and on a budget, starting with Terminal T5 – which was chosen the best terminal in the world five years in a row, after Terminal T2 which was built between the two busiest runways in the world.
Now they are ready to deliver the third instalment, which is worth <0xC2><0xA3>16 billion of private investment.
The 2012 London Games was a huge success for the UK and I am convinced that the expansion of Heathrow will be a huge success.
It’s time to further spread the spirit of the Olympics and expand Heathrow, secure trade for the future, and leave a legacy of skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is Chairman of the Board of Directors and former Vice-President of the Treasury Department for Business Affairs.
Adblock Plus - Facebook in a game about cat and mouse in ad blocking
From attempts to circumvent ad-blocking programs, for companies that make money on online marketing, it has become a game of cat and mouse. At least that is what one of the companies that program such software claims.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced it would block ad filters on its desktop site, Adblock Plus posted a post on its site stating that users can update filters in their program and re-block ads on that social network.
Facebook said on Tuesday that its desktop website would change the encoding around ads to make it more difficult for ad filters to find out which parts of the site are ads.
But Adblock now claims that the new codes have already been circumvented.
Adblock spokesman Ben Williams wrote in a blog post that “this kind of war between the open source ad blocking community and those who are trying to circumvent it has been going on since ad blocking was invented,” and that Facebook is likely to come up with another self-correction.
The fact that the company, which owns the largest social network in the world, was involved in the war only proves how big the problem of blocking ads for the industry has become.
According to the study, it was carried out by Pagefair last year and Adobe uses ad filters around 200 million people worldwide – nearly four times as many as it was in 2013.
Mobile ads now make 84 percent of the profit from Facebook ads, with 1.03 billion active users visiting Facebook every day from mobile devices.
The spokesman said the company is going against desktop ad filters because mobile ad filters for social networking and Instagram mobile apps do not work.
Desktop ads still represent profits high enough for Facebook to decide to invest in it.
Facebook also said on Tuesday it would update its ad preferences tool to allow people to better control how ads are shown to them.
On Thursday, Facebook said that the new Adblock filters are worrying them because they could also block content on the site that is not related to the ad.
"This is not a pleasant experience for people and we want to solve this problem," a Facebook spokesman said in an emailed statement.
Blocking ads is an insensitive tool, so we’d rather focus on building tools like Ad Preferences that give people control.
A woman was hit by a car on a Swiss highway.
The victim lay on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police are looking for witnesses to an incident in which a woman who allegedly attempted suicide was hit by several cars on the highway on Thursday morning.
The accident occurred on the A1 motorway near Morges in the canton of Vaud shortly after midnight on Thursday.
Police in Vaud said in a statement that the actor of the "desperate act" lay in the dark on the road and was crossed by several cars.
It is clear that the victim, a 49-year-old woman, wanted to kill herself and was hit by several cars, including a truck.
She died on the spot.
Several drivers have already been questioned, but police say they have not yet identified all of them, and the police are urging the drivers and everyone else who witnessed the accident to report.
A criminal investigation was opened, a “logical” step in a situation like this, Gilles Hofstetter, a lawyer, told Le Tribune de Genève.
It is still necessary to find out if any of the drivers involved will face any charges.
Was it possible to prevent the impact?
The prosecutor has to find out," Hofstetter said.
On the basis of two similar cases in the past five years, it seems that drivers will not be held liable.
In both cases - one of which was a person walking on the highway - it was decided that motorists could not expect a pedestrian crossing the highway in the middle of the night, the newspaper said.
Last year, a police officer was acquitted of negligence killing after she crashed and killed a man lying on the A1 motorway near Paynerne on the night of August 2014.
The court heard that the victim at the age of 22 drank alcohol and fainted on the road.
The court found that the police officer - who responded to the emergency call - was driving in a reasonable manner and that the man's presence on the road was "a completely exceptional and unpredictable situation," the judge said.
Anyone with information about the Thursday incident that occurred at Morges should report to the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
A tolerant city.
Prague is a popular destination for the LGBT community.
The Association of Czech Travel Agencies and Agencies (A<0xC4><0x8C>CKA) expects up to 20,000 visitors to Prague as part of the Prague Pride.
This was announced on Friday by A<0xC4><0x8C>CKA Executive Director Kate<0xC5><0x99>ina Pet<0xC5><0x99>í<0xC4><0x8D>ková.
The sixth edition of Prague Pride began on August 8th, the festival brings the lives of lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transgender people (LGBT) closer together.
Last year, about 35,000 people took part in the event.
"Prague is one of the most popular destinations for the LGBT community, for its high tolerance and wide range of specialized businesses," Pet<0xC5><0x99>í<0xC4><0x8D>ková said.
According to a survey of the organizers, foreign visitors to the festival spend an average of 3,100 crowns per person per day.
Gay tourists are available to support their travels special maps of Prague with a complete list of Prague gay and gay-friendly bars, clubs, cafes and restaurants in the form of mobile applications, etc.
"To tourism in general, the LGBT clientele is very lucrative, interested in stays in higher price segments with a high standard of travel services and spends more than others," said Pet<0xC5><0x99>í<0xC4><0x8D>ková.
This year, the first Pride Tourism Symposium will be held as part of the festival programme.
It is hosted by experts from the LGBT tourism sector from Europe, the US and China.
The festival will continue until Sunday, August 14.
The main theme this year is love, but the event will also focus on several thematic areas, including family, AIDS prevention and transgender issues.
The highlight of the festival will be a traditional parade with allegorical cars, which will go from Wenceslas Square to Letná.
The march, attended by thousands of people in recent years, this year celebrates a minute of silence in memory of the victims of the June nightclub attack in Orlando, where the assailant shot 49 people, mostly homosexuals.
Pat and Mat celebrate 40 years.
The irresistible cute Pat and Mat, whose endeavor usually ends in disaster, have entertained small and large audiences for forty years.
The pilot part of this evening series directed by Lubomír Bene<0xC5><0xA1> premiered on August 12, 1976.
After the creation of this animated series, which is now known to viewers in more than a hundred countries of the world, there were cartoon jokes by the artist and director Lubomír Bene<0xC5><0xA1>, who invented for the magazine with two cutlery Mr. Ouholí<0xC4><0x8D>ek and Mr. Sedlec.
Bene<0xC5><0xA1> then invited the playwright Ji<0xC5><0x99>í Kubí<0xC4><0x8D>ek and the artist Vladimír Jiránk to collaborate and together they created the film Ku<0xC4><0x8D>áci.
The present form with the yellow and red t-shirt and the kuliche and radio station was given to the characters in 1979, when a series for Slovak TV began to be created in the Prague Short Film.
The names Pat and Mat were then given to the kutilov in 1985, this time it was already filmed directly for the Prague Short Film.
In 1990, Lubomír Bene<0xC5><0xA1> founded his own studio of the animated film AIF Studio in Prague and Zurich, where other works were produced.
After his death in 1995, other works continued with other creators, many of which were attended by Bene<0xC5><0xA1>'s son Marek.
Currently, there are over ninety episodes with the stories of these squirrels, with which everything is spilled under their hands, but they never get angry at each other and are always filled with optimism, ideas and squirrel enthusiasm and finally are satisfied with their work, which is evidenced by the familiar gesture "...and it is!".
Pat and Mat have even moved from television screens to books, DVDs and theaters, and characters or other toys depicting Pat and Mata are a hit of every toy store.
A fairy tale for Fiji and for the two-year Harmony.
The end of the week is under the sign of fairy tales, we have chosen for you one sports and one of life.
Both have a good ending.
Well, let's take a look.
Fiji has achieved a historic success.
What is the reason for the joy of the whole earth?
A two-year-old British girl has an identical friend and is happy with her.
What do people spend the most money at airports for?
This is a Friday's overview of the world's websites.
The first medal of the Olympic Games.
The island state of Fiji celebrates its historic success.
The rugby selection of this archipelago defeated the United Kingdom in the final of the Olympic seven-man rugby tournament.
This is the first medal that Fiji won in the Olympics.
Waiting for the first precious metal to make a profit took sixty years from the launch of the first Olympic expedition.
A great credit for the success is borne by the coach of Fiji.
It is ironic, though, that he is Brit Ben Ryan.
The team has been leading since 2013 and after the finals as a British citizen could be satisfied unlike his compatriots.
"Let's play freely and lightly and see if we can make the biggest game in our history," the coach said.
Fiji eventually became sovereign, and a small state with 900,000 inhabitants is now experiencing the Olympic fairy tale.
This was reported by the French newspaper Le Monde.
A new friend and good luck for the little girl.
Two-year-old Harmonie-Rose Ivy Allen, who has been living without her arms and legs for 11 months, has made a new friend.
A doll that looks like her.
"Mom, she's like me," the two-year-old girl said to ABC News.
She added that her daughter likes to take off the doll’s arms and legs and then sit together without prostheses.
Harmonia was diagnosed with type B meningitis in less than a year of her life, with doctors giving her only a ten percent chance of survival.
There's nothing I wouldn't love about her.
She's beautiful, she's smart, she's funny and she never gives up.
He's got oversight, too.
I saw her introduce herself to other children with the words Hello, I'm Harmonie and I don't have hands.
Look at the joy the doll has brought.
What do we spend the most at the airport for?
According to CNN, people spend the most on bottled water at airports.
Hudson’s travel essential stores has published data for the past year, summarizing the 10 products that customers buy most often in its airport stores.
Water was sovereign first.
Drinks were generally very popular, with eight of them placed in the top ten.
Ninth place was occupied by a large package of M&M sweets with a coconut flavour.
And can you guess who's closing the top ten?
One of the things mentioned above is not to eat.
According to CNN, it is The Wall Street Journal.
Other popular newspapers sold at airports include: The New York Post, The New York Times USA Today.
The magazines include US Weekly, In Touch and The Economist.
Sovereign rowers.
We're just going to win, they laughed at Murray and Bond.
New Zealand rowers Eric Murray and Hamish Bond have been sovereignly ruling the steerless duo category for seven years and have confirmed their dominance at the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.
At first glance, the pair switched to a smaller crew after the Beijing Olympics and has been crushing competition since 2009.
At the Rodrigo de Freitas lagoon, they scored their 69th consecutive win in Thursday’s final.
In what are we different from the others?
We’re just prettier, Murray joked already during the Olympic regatta, when he was supposed to answer questions about the dominance of the New Zealand pair.
Honestly, we don’t do anything different than others.
We're just training hard, very hard.
And we’re constantly trying to improve our technique, that’s our philosophy,” Murray said.
Their dominance is remarkable also because they are physically different.
Murray is a nearly two-metre and stokyle caterpillar, the academically-looking Bond is five centimeters smaller and 15 kilograms lighter.
They also have a different nature.
As Bond studies and finances, Murray has a charitable boxing match.
They don’t spend a lot of time together outside of rowing.
Eric boards the ship basically with the fact that we can't lose.
We're just going to win.
I tend to think about what might go wrong, admitted Bond, who also demonstrated at a press conference that Murray is dominant in the crew.
He was always the first to answer, and Bond was waiting for his chance.
On the water, however, it destroys the opponent with a calm force.
They are going at their own pace, and although they are often not in the middle of the track, opponents have not yet found a recipe for their gradual acceleration.
We race on a two-kilometre track and we never wanted to drive the first kilometre uphill.
We're just trying to go at a pace that no one else can.
“We know what we have to do to win,” said Murray, 34.
With his four years younger partner, he won seven gold medals at the World Championships.
They also triumphed in 2007, when they were both members of the Golden Four without a steering wheel.
Just after the unexpected failure of the larger crew at the Beijing Olympics a year later, they decided to switch to a two-wheeler without a steerer.
At the Olympics in London, they scored the biggest defeat of their careers and confirmed their dominance in Rio.
London has been very intense.
We did everything the coach told us, and they didn't ask for anything.
This time it was a little more fun.
“We knew it was going to be damn hard, and we had to make sure we were mentally well,” Murray said.
We all know they want to take us out of the throne.
We still have the target on our backs.
We are trying to be a step ahead of everyone, he added.
NASA climate model: Venus was once habitable
According to NASA’s new climate model, Venus was once habitable.
Scientists at NASA’s Goddard Institute for the Study of Space have developed a model for exploring Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus, whose surface is hot, waterless and saturated with CO2, could once have conditions similar to those on Earth.
Scientists have previously suggested that the low rotational speed of Venus can be explained by its dense atmosphere.
However, according to the latest simulations, Venus may have once boasted of a rare Earth-like atmosphere while rotating slowly.
The model also dealt with the earlier topography of Venus.
The planet was probably drier than the Earth, but once there was enough water and geographic diversity to rule life and provide protection against rapid evaporation.
Venus also used the Sun, which was 30 percent darker.
“In a simulation of the GISS model of Venus during a slow rotation, it exposes its daily side to the sun for almost two months at a time,” GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio explained in a new report.
This heats the surface and creates a rainfall that creates a dense layer of clouds that behave like an umbrella and protect the surface from excessive solar heat.
The result is a climate with average temperatures that are actually slightly lower than currently on Earth.
The model compiled a story of Venus similar to an evolution previously hypothetically compiled by planetary scientists.
Although Venus was probably habitable in the past -- over several billion years -- it was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet radiation.
Its oceans evaporated and water vapors were burned by ultraviolet light.
Hydrogen has escaped, leaving only a dense atmosphere of carbon dioxide with the deadly effect of greenhouse gas -- this is Venus as we know it today.
The researchers published their findings from the new Venus climate model in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigns as coach of Colorado Avalanche
Patrick Roy resigned from his position as coach and vice president of hockey operations for the Colorado Avalanche team on Thursday, citing his inability to participate in the decision-making process on team issues.
Colorado executive vice president/general manager Joe Sakic confirmed the move, saying the club would immediately start looking for a new coach.
“For the past three years, I have served as head coach and vice president of hockey operations for the Colorado Avalanche, with energy, passion and determination,” Roy said in a statement.
For a long and intense time over the summer, I’ve been thinking about how I can improve the team, give it the depth it needs, and get it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this, it is necessary that the vision of the coach and vice president of hockey operations are in line with the vision of the organization.
They must also be able to participate in decisions that have an impact on the team’s performance.
These conditions are currently not met.
Sakic, who received Roye on 23 May 2013, thanked him for his contributions to the team.
"Patrick informed me of his decision today," Sakic said.
We appreciate everything he has done for our organization and wish him all the best for the future.
Roy was nominated to win Jack Adams as the league's best coach during his first season with Avalanche 2013/2014.
He led the team to 112 points and first place in the Central Division, but Colorado faced Minnesota in the first round of the play-offs, and in the last two years, he never made it through the season.
The Avalanche team scored 39:39:4 in the 2015/2016 season and was missing five points to get the second wildcard in the Western Conference.
Roy, who entered the Hall of Fame, won the Stanley Cup four times -- twice with the Montreal Canadiens and twice with the Avalanche.
Oil rig workers in the North Sea resume talks and interrupt strike
Senior officials of the parties said strikes over wages for workers on the North Sea oil platform were interrupted, while all parties to the dispute met for a new round of negotiations.
Strikes against the oil company Wood Group have occasionally taken place on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
“The Wood Group and the Unite and RMT unions can confirm that they have agreed to reopen the process for resolving current disputes,” the statement said.
Starting next week, we will have a series of full-day meetings over the next few weeks, where we will try to look at the problems from a new angle.
According to trade unions, their recent action, which was the first in more than 25 years, is up to 30 percent to protest wage cuts.
Wood Group cut rates this year and paid its suppliers in the North Sea about 9% less due to negative market pressure.
The reduction in company rates comes after a 10% reduction for coastal companies in 2014.
The company claims that further cuts would give the company room to cope with the market downturn.
On the other hand, Shell has removed thousands of people from its payrolls and announced plans to quit operations in the oil and gas fields in up to 10 countries to modernize its processes – immediately after a mega merger with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to low oil prices, the economic situation linked to the June decision of the UK to leave the European Union.
Earlier this week, Scottish MP Dave Anderson met with trade union leaders to discuss one of the biggest job disputes of the entire generation that led to the North Sea strike.
The North Sea, he said, is vital to the economy in the region.
“In the North Sea and across the country, we need an economy that works for everyone, not just for some,” he said.
For comparison, nearly $1.4 billion of investment in new projects in the North Sea is expected in 2016, while the average for the past five years has been around $7 billion.
Kepler Measures the Rotation of Stars in the Pleiades
The latest mission of the Kepler Space Telescope to help astronomers is to obtain an almost complete list of the rotational speeds of stars from the Pleiades cluster.
The new data help astronomers understand why the stars in the star cluster rotate at different speeds, and also how the rotation time is related to the formation of the planet.
“We hope that by comparing our results with other star clusters, we will learn more about the relationship between stellar matter, its age and even the history of its solar system,” said Luisa Rebullová, a researcher at Caltech’s Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas.
The Pleiades cluster is located 445 light-years from Earth.
Many stars in the cluster are now reaching maturity and have been formed for more than 125 million years.
Now it's spinning the fastest.
At moments of maximum rotational speeds, these teenage stars release huge amounts of stellar wind.
Because these winds move along the magnetic fields of stars, they have a slowing effect on them.
As the star ages, its rotational speed slows down.
Kepler measures the speed of rotation of each star by measuring the time between the discovery of recognizable points on stars -- similar to sunspots.
According to the latest data on rotation speeds, larger stars rotate more slowly than less massive stars.
The Revolver compares the stars to dancers, the bigger ones make pirouettes slower than the smaller ones.
“In the ‘ballet’ of the Pleiades, we see that the slower-revolving stars are more massive, while the fastest-revolving ones are usually very light stars,” Rebullo said.
Because the Pleiades cluster is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory for comparing the quality of stars and the speed of rotation.
“The Pleiades provide us with an anchor for theoretical models of star rotation in both directions, in younger and older stars,” Rebullo said.
There’s still a lot we want to learn about how, when, and why the stars slow down their spinning speed and, so to speak, “hang their dancing shoes on a nail.”
Rebullova and her colleagues detailed the latest analysis of the speed of rotation of the Pleiades in three studies that will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
Is a qualification agreement necessary?
If I did not apply, then the qualification agreement would not be closed and after a few months I could be transferred to another hospital?
Is it even possible to work after graduation without enrolling in specialty education?
The point is that in the field in which I would like to work, there is now a job vacancy only in a slightly more remote hospital, but in about six months there might be a vacancy in another one where I would like to work.
I do not know how to deal with the situation about that half-year, the question continues.
The answer is Mgr. Lenka Vlková.
No legislation provides for an obligation to conclude a qualification agreement with an employer - a hospital.
A qualification agreement is a legal institution governed by the Labour Code and may be concluded between an employee and an employer in order to ensure the reimbursement of expenses incurred in increasing or deepening the employee’s qualifications.
In the field of health, long-term pressure is being exerted to not conclude these agreements with a view to ensuring the labour mobility of health workers, and not all hospitals currently require this agreement.
According to Act No. 95/2004 Coll., on the conditions for acquiring and recognising professional qualifications and specialised qualifications for the exercise of the medical profession of physician, dentist and pharmacist, however, it is expressly valid that participation in specialised education is considered to be an in-depth qualification (not to increase it).
This means that a qualification agreement can only be concluded according to the Labour Code if the costs reach at least CZK 75,000.
There is no legal requirement to enrol in specialised education.
The law only lays down the conditions for the application for inclusion in the field of specialised education.
However, according to the law, the doctor is authorized to carry out the profession of doctor already due to the completion of the necessary higher education, even if under the conditions established by the law (under the supervision of a doctor with specialized competence in the relevant field).
The law provides for a situation in which vocational practice in another field of specialisation may be included in the specialisation training of a doctor, provided that its content and scope correspond to the relevant training programme.
Theoretically, it would be possible to calculate the time spent elsewhere, which would correspond to the interrogator's situation.
However, in view of the fact that I do not know the specific circumstances of this case, it is advisable to consult the relevant department of the Ministry of Health (the Department of Science and Medical Professions), since the Ministry of Health provides by law an advisory and consultancy service related to the admission into its specialization education.
The advisory service is also provided free of charge by the Czech Medical Chamber, of which every doctor must be a member.
Syrian doctors in Halab are asking for U.S. intervention.
The United States has made no effort to end the siege (insurgent parts of the city by government troops) and has not used its influence to promote the protection of civilians, AFP said in a letter to the White House.
"We don't need tears, compassion, and even prayers; but we desperately need to create a no-fly zone over eastern Halab to stop the attacks, and we need international action to ensure that Halab is not besieged again," the doctors said.
Russian forces, which support the army loyal to President Bashar al-Assad, have announced that they will stop every day for three hours strikes in the Halab area to allow safe passage for humanitarian convoys.
From 9:00 am to 12:00 pm all military activities, air strikes and artillery fire are to be stopped.
U.N. Chief of Humanitarian Operations Stephen O'Brien welcomed the move, but stressed the need for at least a two-day ceasefire.
According to AFP, 15 of the 35 doctors operating in eastern Halab, who are now under the control of the rebels, addressed Obama in a letter.
It says that during the five-year war they witnessed the violent, cruel deaths of countless patients, friends and colleagues.
The world sees and notes how complex Syria is, but does little to protect us.
Recent offers to evacuate residents from the Syrian regime and Russia sound like mere lightly veiled threats, pediatricians, surgeons and other doctors said.
Doctors said there had been 42 attacks on medical facilities in Syria in the past month, including 15 on the hospitals where they work.
The saddest thing is that we have to decide who will live and who will die.
Little children with so serious injuries come to us in an emergency room that we have to choose the ones that are most likely to survive.
And sometimes we don’t even have the material to help them, doctors describe.
Two weeks ago, four newborns suffocated when the explosion interrupted oxygen supply to their incubators.
They were breathing, and then their lives were over - before they could really begin, they remembered.
In recent weeks, an army loyal to President Bashar al-Assad, backed by Russian forces, has surrounded the rebel-held eastern part of Halab, with more than 200,000 people without food supplies inside.
The rebels, who are under constant Russian and Syrian air strikes, managed to break through the siege and launch a counteroffensive after three weeks on Saturday.
Thereafter, reinforcements arrived in the city and its surroundings.
