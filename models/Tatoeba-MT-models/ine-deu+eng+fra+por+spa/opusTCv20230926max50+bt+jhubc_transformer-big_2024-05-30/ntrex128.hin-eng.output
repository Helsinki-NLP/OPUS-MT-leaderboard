Welsh AM (Member of the Assembly) is concerned about 'map-like images'
Some members of the Assembly are obsessed with the suggestion that the title of their post should be changed to MWP (Wales MP).
This is due to the fact that the Welsh Parliament has been planned to change the name of the Assembly.
All the AMs involved in the scope of politics are concerned that this could blow up their jokes.
A Labour AM said his group was concerned that "it should not be connected to Twp and Pwp."
For readers living outside Wales: In Wales, twp means stupid and pwp means dirt.
One Plaid AM said the whole group was "not happy" and has suggested other options.
A political party in Wales said his group was "independent" about the change of name, but he noted that MWP could be mapped by verbally making small changes in words.
In this context, the pronunciation of the letter w in Welsh is exactly the same as the pronunciation of the letter u in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting a legal draft on the change of name, said: "Whatever the members of the Assembly are called upon to say, the final decision of any detailer in this regard will certainly be a matter of their own for the members."
According to the Government of Wales Act 2017, the Welsh Assembly has the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission reported on the results of the public consultation on the proposals in which the Assembly had received much more support for the Welsh Parliament by changing its name.
In the case of the title of the AM post, the Commission supported the Welsh MPs or WMP, but found the MWP option to be the most supported in public consultation.
Apparently, AM is suggesting a number of other options, but petty officer Elin Jones is having a hard time getting common consent, hoping they will submit a legal draft for the change within a few weeks.
Other changes to the working methods in the Assembly will be included in the drafting of the amendments, including the format of the Rules and Committee System for the disqualification of AM.
When debating legislation, AM will get the final vote on the question of what they should be called for.
The people of Macedonia are going to vote to change the name of the country
Voters will vote on Sunday whether to change the name of their country to "Republic of North Macedonia" or not.
Famous votes were bid to resolve a decades-old dispute with the neighboring country Greece, whose province is also named after Macedonia.
Athens has long been insisting that the name of its northern neighbor country refers to its province and has also repeatedly objected to its membership bids in the EU and NATO.
The Macedonian president, a rival to the referendum on the change of name, says he will ignore the vote.
However, Prime Minister Zoran Zev as well as supporters of the vote have argued that the change in name is only necessary to join the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells are falling due to declining churches in Harlem
Mr. Adams said, "For the things related to history that I have spoken to the elders, I must say that at first there were times and churches at every corner."
"Today, it's all over."
It makes sense to cut back on time, he said.
"The society of today is becoming different,"" he said."
"Bars are no longer like the neighborhood's living room where people go every day."
For the churches, they are concerned that the money spent on the sale of the properties will not last long as expected by the leaders, "and soon this money will run out or later they will come to the same place as the leaders from where they started."
He added that it may be that the churches have been converted into proprietary apartment buildings where people of all kinds live, which will not help to keep the remaining places of worship nearby safe.
He said, "In these buildings there will be a growing number of those who are buying houses built in them as property rights, and thus there will come a time when these churches will be completely closed, because it is unlikely that most of them will become members of those who are gaining ownership of them.
In the 1870s, after a decade of St. Martin, Harlem's Black Metropolis-Metropolitan Community was formed by the white people of both churches of the religious community.
The original white people of the Methodist religious society moved into the 1930s.
These buildings were occupied by the black people of religious society who worshipped at nearby places of worship.
Under the clergyman John Howard Johnson on St. Martin, a black religious society that led to the removal of retailers on 125th Street was occupied. This place was the main place for shopping in Harlem, where the state raised or hired black people.
The building was badly damaged due to a fire in 1939, but after plans by the followers of Father Johnson to rebuild it, an hour's play was started here.
Father Johnson's son and St. Martin's heir, Pastor David Johnson, proudly called the hour-long work of playing "opening the doors of fortune to the poor."
The hour-playing expert in July described it something like this: it's "a cultural heritage" and "an invaluable historical instrument."
Tiffany NG, an expert at the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first hour in the world played by black musician Dionisio A. Lind, who played a very large hour at the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merryveder said that no other person was put in his place in St. Martin.
Whatever happened in St. Martin in the last few months became a complex story of craftsmen and contractors, some of whom were appointed by common leaders of the church and the rest by provinces associated with religion.
Parish (priests of the district) made of common leaders on Vestry (where the goods of worship are placed) became entitled - in July, the province expressed concern that the province would "demand to meet the needs of Vestry", even if the Vestry was not made in the same manner as the ones appointed in Vestry province.
Some clergy of the area complained about the lack of clarity on the part of the province.
13-Year-Old Shark Injured in Scuba Diving to Catch Shrimp
Officials say a shark attacked a 13-year-old boy on Saturday and injured him while he was catching a lobster scuba diving in California on the opening day of the lobster season.
The attack took place near the beach of Encinitas before 7 a.m.
Chad Hammel, from San Diego's KSWB-TV, said he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning, at the same time he heard the voice of a boy shouting for help and then he came with a group to pull him out of the water.
Hammel said he thought the boy had been screaming in an excitement to catch the shrimp, but then he felt he was yelling, "I'm biting something!"
I'm cutting something!"
When she saw the boy, she found that the boy's entire cheekbone had broken.
"I shouted to everyone to get out of the water: there is a shark in the water!"
The teen was admitted to the Reddy Children's Hospital in San Diego where his condition is being said to be serious.
The species of the attacking shark has not been identified.
In a conversation with the media, Lifeguard Captain Larry Giles said a shark was detected in the area a few weeks ago, but it was found that it is not a dangerous species of shark.
Gils further stated that the upper part of the victim's wrist has been seriously injured.
For investigation and security purposes, authorities have blocked access from Ponto Beach, Casblad, to Swamis Beach, Acinitas, for 48 hours.
Gils said there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to go to the UK beauty market
By appointing expert assistants with Sainsbury's beauty products, the department store is going to include Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams.
Despite continued decline in sales of fashion goods and household goods, it is going to join the UK's 2.8 billion-pound beauty market with good volume, these huge volumes of beauty products will be examined in 11 stores across the country and if the scheme was successful, it would be increased to Karoa in 11 stores across the country.
The investment in beauty is being made in the supermarket, which aims to find its place in the market after bringing TV, microwaves and home goods.
Sainsbury's said it will double the products it offers by bringing up to 3,000 products for the first time, including brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Existing products from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more opportunities with branded products found in stores like Boots.
The supermarket is also restarting its boutique makeup products, so that most products are vegan-friendly - this will increase its demand in small-fat stores somewhat faster.
In addition, perfume retailer Fragrance Shop will also examine the special facility at two stores at Sainsbury's, the first of which was opened last week in Croydon, South London and the second at the end of this year in Cely Oak, Birmingham.
More and more efforts are being made to increase people's visits to online shopping and local convenience stores i.e., the daily shift in the amount of food sold in the supermarket.
Sainsbury's chief executive, Mike Coop, said that people like department stores at the outlet will come out faster because the supermarket chain has more services and non-food outlets. Aldi and Lidl are trying to get rid of them.
Sainsbury's has been putting the outlet of Argos in hundreds of stores and since it came to both channels two years ago, it has also opened several stores, showing that grocery sales have been promoted and the deal has been made more profitable.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to bring beauty and pharmacy products back to the market had failed.
Sainsbury's had been doing business in conjunction with Boots in the early 2000s, but due to the way the incomes met from drug stores in its supermarket had to end this combined business.
Three years ago, Sainsbury's sold 281 stores of the pharmacy business to Lloyd's pharmacy chain owner Celeste for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million, followed by a new strategy.
Lloyds will play an important role in the plan by adding La Roche-Posay and Vichy to the four stores as well as many top luxury skincare brands.
Sainsbury's commercial director, Paul Mills-Hicks, said: "We have changed the look and feel of our beauty products to enhance the environment for our customers.
We have also specially added those trained colleagues who will assist us in providing advice.
We have created the scope of our brand according to everyone’s needs and attractive environment and in convenient locations, which means that we have reached an attractive destination for beauty products that challenge the old way of shopping.”
Peter Jones reveals 'narrative' after Holly Willoughby's 11-million-pound deal
To focus on his new contract with Marks & Spencer and ITV when TV presenter Holly Billubi decided to separate from the 11 million-pound deal for the lifestyle brand business of Dragons Den's star Peter Jones, Peter Jones showed up on it.
Billubi doesn't even have time for his homewares and accessories brand Truly.
The business of the two was being compared to Gweneth Paltro's brand Goop.
This 37-year-old morning presenter announced his separation on Instagram.
Holly Billubi set herself apart from her charming lifestyle brand business at the last minute with Dragons Den's star Peter Jones - so she could fully focus on her new best contract with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources have revealed that when the TV's Golden Girl doesn't show up on Tuesday at Bhagavad-gita, Bhagavad-gita, Bhagavad-gita, Bhagavad-gita, Bhagavad-gita, Bhagavad-gita, Bhagavad-gita, Bhagavad-gita, Bhagavad-gavad-gavad-gava, Bhagava, Bhagavad-gavad-gava-gava-gava-gava-gava-gava-gava-gava-gava-gava-gava-gava-gava-gava-gava-gava-gava-gava-gava-gava-gava-gava-gava-gava-gagagagava-gava-gava-gava-gava-gava-gagagava-gava-gava-gava-gava-gava-gava-gava-gava-gava-gava-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-gava-gava-gava-gava-ga-ga-ga-gava-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-gaga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga-ga
The trade was being compared to Gweneth Paltro's brand Goop and was being considered to double it by the estimated 11 million pounds given by Willubi.
The 37-year-old announced on Instagram that she was separating from Truly, after which Jones moved from the UK to go to his holiday home.
A source said: "Truly was ever the top of Holi's priorities.
It was supposed to be his long-term future which would make this brand far ahead in the next few decades.
His decision shocked everyone involved in this business, he said.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, it was very close to getting started.
The warehouse located at Marlo Headquarters is full of goods to be sold.
Experts believe that the UK’s richest star may have caused millions of losses to the firm as it has invested a lot in products such as cushions and candles, clothing and home furnishings. It has also started investing a lot more and this is even more likely
This can also lead to a long friendship.
Billubi's three children and husband Dan Baldwin have been close enough to Jones and his wife Star Cap for the past ten years.
Willoughby joined the Cap in 2016 and joined Truly as the 52-year-old Jones chairman in March.
Baldwin's TV production company has a 40 per cent stake in couples and Jones who spend their holidays together.
Billubi has now become M&S' brand ambassador and will be placed in the place of Ant McPartlyn to host I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
Last night, a close source to Jones said, "We don't want to talk about their business case."
"We've had some serious discussions, and then we've agreed."
Joking at the criticism, he said the news media would continue to comment on him, some would consider it a "different job from the presidential office" and become much more positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump done so much of this?
Trump said in his appearance in "News Anchor" voice.
"I have not abandoned anyone."
He said Kim's interest is in the second meeting after his first meeting in Singapore in June, a major step was taken by Trump to make North Korea nuclear-free in the first meeting.
Nuclear-free talks, however, have been halted.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told leaders around the world at the U.N. General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea's "early disarmament" is not responding to the U.S.'s "Keeping the Disarmament" steps.
Instead, he said, the U.S. has continued to exert pressure to maintain the sanctions.
In Trump's rally speech, he saw a much more optimistic outlook.
"We are committed to building good relations with North Korea,"" he said."
"We were going to fight with North Korea.
which killed millions of people.
Now our relationship has been very good."
He said his efforts to improve ties with Kim have led to positive results - including completing the rocket test, helping free the hostages and bringing the remaining US troops back home.
At the same time, in negotiating relations with Kim, he defended his unusual approach.
Speaking directly to the crowd in front of him, Trump said, "It's very easy to stay in the presidency, but 10,000 people outside the country are trying to join this area, we will have about 200 people to stop them."
A tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia have devastated an island, killing hundreds of people.
After the earthquake in Lombok, foreign NGOs were told they did not need them for the incident.
Despite the fact that more than 10 per cent of the population of Lombok is depressed, no national disaster was declared, as well as, a condition for providing international assistance was also put in place.
Ms. Sumbu said, "In many situations, unfortunately, they were clearly seeing that they were not asking for international help, so it became something too challenging."
Still, Save the Children visited Palu together with a team, but it is not yet clear whether other country's employees can come here to help.
Sutopo, a spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, said Indonesian officials were examining Palu's situation, looking at whether or not international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the relief effort.
Given the situation that comes up in Indonesia over and over again, it seems that there is absolutely no preparation for the outbreak of nature in this country.
However, shelters have been built for people suffering from tsunami in Aich, but they are not like shelters located on other beaches.
There has been a decrease in the siren warning for tsunami in Palu, no matter how damaging the warning may be, it is likely to increase the loss of life.
Whether or not it’s the best time to go for a stroll, it’s challenging to travel between many of Indonesia’s islands.
Arranging businessmen and goods from natural disasters is always complicated.
The victims of the earthquake are being taken to a hospital in Lombok for treatment that is far enough away from Palu and takes at least three days to reach here from the new disaster site.
President Joko Widodo challenged Indonesia's very poor infrastructure for his election campaign and he spent enough money to improve roads and railways.
But, Mr. Joko's administration was dispersed due to the lack of funds as elections are set to resume next year.
Mr. Joko is also under pressure from sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where Muslim-majority members have made religious ideology more conservative.
More than 1,000 people died and more than ten thousand people became homeless because Christian and Muslim gangs were fighting each other on the streets using knives, bows and arrows and other dangerous weapons.

He hit the ball with his left leg before making a long post shot.
His effort went to the top right corner of the net with the height above the box.
Eventually, the ball fell out of the hands of Kapa Arizablaga and went into the net.
"It was just an attempt to get in touch with the ball and get it as far away from players like Shack as possible, so I tried to take as much time as I could just for myself,"" he told LiverpoolFC.com."
"I saw the cones coming and once touched and didn't think about it much and just shot."
Belgium's best player, Eden Hazard, was ahead of Chelsea 1-0 in halftime after scoring in the 25th minute.
Before the ball approached the midfield and reached the Liverpool half-game, Blues' striker passed Mateo Kovasik in that game.
Kovasik reached the ball very early in the midfield.
Then, he shot the ball beautifully, leaving the Hazards in the box.
Hazard pulled out of the defense and kicked Ellison Baker from behind Liverpool's left leg and sent away from the net.
Liverpool will now face Naples in the Champions League group stage at Naples, Italy's San Paolo stadium, at 3 p.m. on Wednesday.
Chelsea will face off with a videotone in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.

The statue of Cromwell in front of Parliament recently became the most famous monument, it was re-established in ‘history’
Its exile would be ideal justice for the destruction of many of England's many cultural and religious artifacts, such as its Taliban, made by its radical puritan followers.
But, Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's suggestion as "stupid" and "trying to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "The ongoing debate over the removal of statues was full of fear that the statue of Oliver Cromwell would be targeted outside the Palace of Westminster.
No order was given for the symbol of the English Civil War, nor was Cromwell made of it.
It may be wrong that Cromwell had given up on the works of his ancestor Thomas in the last century.
The best representation of Cromwell, according to Sir William Hemo Thorcroft, is evidence of a 19th-century idea and part of the history of an image that many still consider commendable.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is revered by many, perhaps for this reason most people today still know him as a defender of parliament standing against external pressures in the case of the monarchy at the end of the 19th century.
Yet, they are considered to be the exact representative, which has historically remained the subject of debate.
It is obvious that our nation has been developing since the conflict in the middle of the 17th century, and Cromwell's statue remains a personal identity in which there is a glimpse of one side of that division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are commendable and memorable."
A deadly pig attacked a Chinese farmer, killing the farmer.
According to local media reports, in a market in south-west China, a pig attacked a farmer, resulting in the death of the farmer.
The South China Morning Post on Sunday reported that only his surname "Yuan" has been identified, his body has been found seriously wounded, and that in the market of Liupansui in Liupansui, in Guizhou province, he has been found to have been found near the pork-bar.
On May 30, 2005, a pig farmer was preparing to vaccinate pigs at a pig farm in Xinning, China's Kinhai province.
He allegedly came to the market on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs with his cousin who lives in the nearby Yunnan province.
The next morning, her cousin died and it was found that the door of a pig-barn had been opened in the vicinity.
He said that in the pig shed there was a large male pig with blood on its mouth.
According to the report, a forensic investigation confirmed that a pig weighing 550 pounds attacked the farmer and killed him.
According to the Guang Yiwing News, her cousin, who is nicknamed "Wu", said, "My cousin's feet were bleeding and completely wounded."
The security camera footage showed that Yuan had come to the market to feed his pigs at 4.40 a.m. on Thursday.
His body was recovered about an hour later.
The pig that attacked the person was not Yuan or his cousin who killed him.
A market manager told Ewing News that the pig was kept locked up so that it could not attack anyone, although police collected evidence from the scene of the incident.
People of Yuan's family and market officials are allegedly negotiating compensation for his death.
However, there have already been rare cases of attacks by pigs on people.
In 2016, a pig in Massachusetts attacked a woman and her husband on her farm, seriously injuring the man.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig attacked a Welsh farmer at the time he was on his tractor, attacking the farmer until his wife frightened the animal.
A farmer in Oregon who was attacked by his pigs in 2012 killed him to death and made his own food, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are generally not aggressive, but they can be "dangerous" when they taste the blood.
"They're just playing.
They cut their teeth and are very inquisitive...They don’t have to hurt you.
You just have to give them enough respect," he said.

On Monday, it will rain 10 inches in parts of Mexico due to the rainfall.
Subsequently, the moisture coming from the dust in the coming days will bring heavy rainfall to the south-west along with tropical moisture.
Locally, hazardous floods, drift of debris and landslides in the desert are likely due to 1 to 4 inches of rainfall.
The rainfall will be 2 to 3 inches in some places due to much more tropical humidity, especially in some areas of southern Nevada and Arizona, it is more likely.
The south-western part, especially most areas of Arizona, is likely to receive 2 to 4 inches of rain.
Due to the tropical rainfall, there can be a lot of flooding with bad conditions.
Given the risk of tropical rainfall, it will be advisable to stay out of the low-level desert.
Due to heavy rains, the valleys can become risky rivers and winds will flow and dust in local areas as well as clouds.
Due to the coming thunderstorm, there will be a lot of local rainfall in some parts of the southern California coast.
A total of more than half an inch is likely to rain, which can lead to some debris drift and slippery conditions on the roads.

Temperatures throughout the U.S. may change rapidly during the month of October as the Arctic weather cools at this time, but there is plenty of heat remaining in tropical areas.
Occasionally, due to this short distance, there are strange changes in temperature.
A strange change in temperatures in Central U.S. on Sunday is a good example of this.
Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska and St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa have temperatures that vary by about 20 degrees.
In the next few days, due to the upcoming heat, the weather will start to warm and the heat will increase.
Most areas of the central and eastern U.S. are expected to warm from October, which could extend from the southern plains to some areas of the northeast in the 80s.
On Tuesday, New York City's temperature could reach 80 degrees, which will be about 10 degrees higher than the average temperature.
According to our long-term climate forecast, we are getting a hint that there are enough chances to stay above the average temperature of the Eastern U.S. in the first six months of October.
More than 20 million people have seen the hearing of Brett Kavanaugh.
On Thursday, more than 20 million people witnessed the trial of Brett Cavanaugh and the woman who allegedly accused Brett Cavanaugh of sexual exploitation, allegedly in the 1980s, in the Supreme Court. The woman's name is Christine Blacey Ford.
Meanwhile, political stagnation was also seen, broadcasters suspended the regular program of Friday's Last-Minute Twist: Anne Agreement Engineered by Arizona State. This lawsuit was filed by the FBI's Jeff Flake after D's investigation into the allegations for up to a week
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was completely sure that at a high school party, Cavanaugh had tried to drink her drugs and take off her clothes.
Kavanaugh, defending himself, said that he is absolutely sure that this did not happen at all.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people saw Nielsen's report on Friday.
The company was counting average viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Statistics for PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network as well as other channels showing it were not quickly present.
In addition, Nielsen usually has some difficulty counting the people who see in the offices.
From this perspective, this playoff football game is equal to the number of spectators of the Academy Award.
Nielsen said the Fox News channel, which the reviewer host has strongly supported Cavanaugh's appointment, was ahead of all channels, with an average of 5.69 million viewers present during the whole day's hearing.
The number of spectators on ABC was 3.26 million and it was in second place.
There were 3.1 million on CBS, 2.94 million on NBC, 2.89 million on MSNBC and 2.52 million viewers on CNN, Nielsen said.
There was a lot of interest from the audience.
Flake was the central figure in the drama on Friday.
A statement was issued after the term of office of the Liberal Republican saying that they would raise voices on behalf of Cavanaugh, they came before the cameras of CNN and CBS on Friday morning, at the time the protesters were yelling to oppose the hearing of the Judiciary Committee.
When they were being called blasphemous, at that time they stood with their eyes bent for a few minutes, it was seen live on CNN.
A woman said, "Here, I'm standing here in front of you."
"Do you think they're telling the country the right thing?"
They were told, "Have you been brought to power to make many women powerless?"
Flake said a statement was issued by his office before the elevator was closed and that he would be able to put his entire case at the hearing of the committee.
When the Jewish Committee was pushing forward Kavanaugh's nomination for the vote for the entire Senate, cable and broadcast channels were still showing everything live hours later.
But, Flack said he would do so with full understanding that the FBI will look at the allegations made against the nominated individuals next week, which is being urged by the minority Democrats.
Flake talked about it with his friend, Democratic Sen. Chris Coons.
After negotiating with Cones and several senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake liked the power very much, as it was clearly seen that if Cavanaugh was approved without investigation, the Republicans would not get a vote.
President Trump has approved the FBI's investigation into the allegations against Cavanaugh.
The British Prime Minister has accused critics of being "political" about Brexit.
In an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper, Prime Minister Theresa May urged critics to stop playing with Britain's future by "making politics a game" in the EU and to focus their full attention on the national interest.
British Prime Minister Theresa May may attend the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, UK, on September 29, 2018.

"Who will take his place now, his concern will always remain,"" Wade said."
Volcanic ash found in Mexico City
Ash emanating from the Popocapital Volcano has been found in southern areas of Mexico's capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention on Saturday warned Mexican citizens that they were staying away from the volcano and said that the order of exit of gas and ash had been recorded 183 times in 24 hours.
The centre was monitored for several shocks and pulses.
Pictures posted on social media show that thin layers of ash coating car windshields were visible in the neighborhood of Mexico City like Exochimilco.
In September 2017, a 7.1-intensity earthquake had hit central Mexico, since geophysicists focused on the volcano's increasing activity at a distance of 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital.
The volcano "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
On the occasion of the Independence Vote Anniversary, police clashed with separatists from Catalonia
Six people from Barcelona were detained on Saturday after clashes of independence-sponsored protesters with riot police, and thousands of rival protesters took part in the first anniversary celebrations celebrated for not voting for secession in Catalonia.
A group of pro-Nakabposh separatists threw egg and powder paint at riot police, blackening the roadblock, causing trouble for those who would normally come and go.
The police used their poles to control the clash and later handcuffed them.
Pro-independence groups have been chanting "no forgetting, no apologies" for hours, while union protesters have chanted "Spain remains immortal."
According to a local press report, fourteen people who were injured as a result of the demonstration were treated.
According to Madrid, the October 1 referendum, which is considered illegal, has been raising tensions in areas with independent views for a year, but people with separatist views in Catalonia were celebrating it.
Voters chose a very good way for independence, although there were fewer people who strongly opposed voting against isolation.
Catalonia officials said about 1,000 people were injured last year when police were trying to stop people from going to polling stations in the area amid clashes.
Freedom-supporting groups stopped there on Friday night to assist the National Police in stopping the protests.
The performance was advanced, but he had to be forced to make a different decision.
The 68-year-old electrician Narcisse Terminus had arrived to take part in the separatist protests with his wife, he said, noting that he saw any possibility of independence from Catalonia.
"It was our best year last year.
I had seen my parents cheering up by voting, but it seems that now we are trapped," he said.
Even with a small victory in the regional elections held in December last year, Catalonia’s pro-independence parties struggled this year to maintain influence with their many famous leaders, whether it was in exposing themselves or organising the ballot box in an ongoing proclamation of independence.
The 42-year-old mechanic, who recorded the protest on his phone to help the police, said the clash between politicians on both sides had been halted.
"""It's become too stressful,"" he said."
On Saturday, Orol Junqueras, one of Catalonia's nine leaders involved in pre-trail prisons since last year, announced that he would fight in next year's European Parliament elections.
"Fighting the European elections as a candidate is the best way to return to democratic values and denounce that return that we have seen in the Spanish government," he said.
London: Car-attackers detained at home
Three people, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been detained on suspicion of repeatedly assaulting a home in London.

Deputy Inspector Bob Blamings said the doors and buildings of the house had been damaged.
In some places, the crossbow may have been attacked by a car.
Manga defeated Livingston 1-0 against Rangers
Dolly Manga's first goal ensured Livingston's win
Livingston, the fast-moving manager of the Ebrox club, shocked the Rangers, forcing Steven Garrard to take responsibility for his second loss in 18 games.
Dolly Manga's strike made the difference that Gary Holt's side move with the Hibrid in the second part of the match had equalized.
Garrard's side took a step away from winning this season's premiership and will face the leaders hearts next Sunday, who are eight points behind.
Earlier, on Thursday, the Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna in the Europa League.
Meanwhile, Kenny Miller's replacement for Chief Coach Holt last month has consistently won in the six-game division of Livingston.
Livingston missed out on showcasing his game to the visitor
Long before scoring, Holt's team should have gone ahead, as well, the Rangers had a lot of problems due to their great game.
Scott Robinson broke the record, but lagged behind by attempting to score, then managed to remain direct only to complete the goal in Craig Hulkett's header after Alan Lithgo slipped his best effort.
The hosts got a chance to play against the Rangers, they knew they could put the visitor in trouble on set peace.
And because of that, he got an important goal.
The Rangers got a free-kick and Livingston opened, the Declan Gallery and Robinson worked to set up the Manga, who touched and scored from the box's center.
At that stage, the Rangers had strengthened their position, but missed home defense and goalkeeper Liam Kelly lagged far behind,
The pattern also ran in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos insisted on serving on Kelly.
Scott Pitman's shot was blocked by Rangers goalkeeper Alan McGregor and Lithgow flicked from the second Livingston to fully capture the game.
The Livingston box continued to come cross-over and go on to be rounded, while after Hulkett's challenge, two penalties were claimed, one on bringing Glenn Middleton and the other on handball.
An analysis of Livingston's "Extraordinary Goal"
BBC Scotland's Alaskader Lamont to be included in Tony Macaroni's arena
Livingston's extraordinary performance and results.
For anyone, they were the best, they have continued to raise expectations on this growing trajectory.
Their way of playing and personality has changed surprisingly since their return from the top flight, but most credit goes to the way Holt has reshaped the team since their arrival.
There were a lot of great players in it.
Captain Hulkett was the best player, he saved in a fantastic way, while Manga put Connor Goldson and Joe Warl behind him.
However, there was a lack of learning in the rangers.
The kind of great performance they have performed many times under Gerard, they were less than their standard.
Their lack of a final ball - they were only able to cut to their home side open once - and it was like some wake-up calls for the Rangers, who kept themselves in the mid-table.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an's welcome in Cologne
When the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin on Saturday (September 29th), the smiles scattered but found no benefit.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - aimed at improving relations with NATO's allies.
They were caught in controversy on a number of issues including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's upheaval in the EU.
Afterwards, Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an talked about the construction of a very large new mosque in Cologne.
Outside of Turkey, this city is an area where the majority of Turkish residents live.
Police prevented a crowd of 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque for security reasons, but many supporters flocked to nearby places to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters who opposed Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an - some of whom were also Kurdish - also shouted slogans, strongly condemning Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him into the country.
The two-sided protests saw divisions among those who welcomed the visitor, some of whom considered him a German Turkish hero and others insulted him as a volunteer ruler.

The prison office said that six prison officers have been injured due to disturbances in the prison of high security men.
The HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire on Sunday at around 09:30 BST has been disrupted and is still ongoing.

In addition, riot officials were summoned to jail in October last year to remedy a serious disorder, during which an employee from the pool ball was attacked.
Hurricane Rosa is at risk of rapid flooding in Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City (dry areas may benefit)
Hurricane Rosa has remained a dangerous situation in tropical areas after colliding with Arizona, but it is very likely that it is the same that the remaining capacity of this storm in the coming week could affect Desert Southwest, which is why Bhagavad-gita is much more likely
On Monday and Tuesday, the National Weather Service had already announced that Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City cities as well as southern and eastern Nevada of western Arizona, south-eastern California, and Tennessee are located in south-eastern California.
Due to the rainfall on Monday evening, it is expected that on Tuesday, the entire Phoenix will have a direct exit.
The Phoenix-based National Weather Service tweeted, "Ten tropical cyclones within 200 miles of the Phoenix have maintained a tropical storm or depression status since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was within 40 miles of the Hurricane AZ boundary."
Recently, the National Hurricane Center model has estimated that Arizona's Mogolone Rim could have rainfall of 2 to 4 inches, as well as, it is likely to be up to 6 inches.
Central Rockies and the Great Basin as well as other areas of the Desert Southwest are likely to rain from 1 to 2 inches, as well, it is likely to be up to 4 inches.
Outside of areas at risk of rapid flooding, the rainfall of Rosa may prove to be a gift as the area is dry.
However, flooding has remained a very serious concern, but the drought situation in the southwest has remained so far, which is likely to benefit much more from the rain.
According to the U.S. Draft Monitor, only 40 percent of Arizona's area is much drought, it's the second highest-ranking drought," the weather.com report said.
First, Hurricane Rosa will pass through Mexico's market through the California peninsula.
On Sunday morning, Hurricane Rosa's maximum wind speed was 85 miles per hour, at that time it was 385 miles away in the southern direction of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and it is now moving at a speed of 12 miles per hour towards the north.
The storm is currently in the cold waters of the Pacific region, which is causing its power to decrease.
Thus, it is hoped that the power of tropical storms could lead to landslides in Mexico on Monday afternoon or in the evening.
In some areas of Mexico, heavy rains are likely to increase the risk of flooding.
According to a report by weather.com, "It is expected that the baza from California to northwestern Sonora could have 3 to 6 inches of rain, as well as, it is likely to be 10 inches."
Rose will then travel across Mexico as a tropical storm on Tuesday morning before reaching the Arizona border, before heading south in southern Arizona and southern Utah on Tuesday night, the report said.
The National Hurricane Center said, "The most endangered market from Rosa or its remaining parts is California, north-western Sonora, and the U.S. Desert Southwest where heavy rain is likely."
These rains are estimated to pose a threat to the public as a result of rapid floods and debris flowing into the deserts and landslides in mountainous areas.

Trump called Kavanaugh's problem annoyed by the Democratic Party
At a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, Trump said, "Judge Kavanaugh is a person who has been denied the reckless and defamatory strategy of the Democratic Party."
Trump says the trouble Kavanaugh is going through is the result of the Democratic Party's anger during his nomination process.
On Thursday, Kavanaugh cleared the Congress for what Christine Blacey Ford accused him of sexually harassing Ford many decades ago in his teenage years, while giving the clearance, Kavanaugh has done this violently and emotionally.
Ford also testified about the allegations during the hearing.
On Saturday, the President said, "U.S. residents saw the qualities and courage of being Kavanaugh's best man that day."
"Voting Justice Kavanaugh means voting for a person who is the most skilled lawmaker of our time, who can confirm the law and judge with the actual record of public service,"" he told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia."
Speaking about the importance of the Republican vote in the medieval elections, the President referred to Kavanaugh's nomination.
"Now there are only five weeks left from the election that is most important to our lives.
I'm not involved, but in reality I'm involved," he said.
"That's why I'm fighting for all the candidates who are truly worthy."
Trump said the Democrats are on a campaign of "resistance and obstruction."
A senior associate of the GOP told CNN that the first counting of votes on behalf of the Senate in Kavanaugh's nomination is due to begin on Friday.
Hundreds of people have been killed by tsunami in Indonesia, the death toll is rising
When a major earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Saturday, high-altitude waves began to rise in the sea and at least 384 people died, officials said.
On Friday, a festival was being celebrated on the beach of the city of Palu where hundreds of people gathered, after a six-metre (18 ft) high tide arose in the evening, it caused devastation, which also caused the deaths of many people and their deaths
The tsunami occurred after an earthquake of magnitude 7.5.
Sutopo Purvo Nugoroho, spokesman for Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency BNPB in Jakarta, said: "When the tsunami hit yesterday, in the meantime, the people present were engaged in their activities and were not in a position to leave immediately."
"The tsunami was not only caused by the deaths of people, but it also dragged on the ground, wrapping cars, logs and houses. Before attacking the beach, the tsunami hit a speed of 800 km/h (497 miles per hour).
To avoid the tsunami, some people climbed trees and defended themselves, he said.
16,700 people were evacuated from 24 centers of Palu.
Photos posted from the plane by the disaster agency showed that many buildings and shops have been destroyed, bridges have turned and collapsed and a mosque has also been surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the aftermath of the accident continued on the rocks in the coastal city.
More than 2.4 million people in the area experienced a continuous earthquake.
Indonesia's Agency for the Assesment and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the capacity of the energy emanating from the very large earthquake that came on Friday was about 200 times the capacity of the nuclear bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
It said the geography of the city at the end of a long, narrow bay could increase the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho said the damage was "very terrible" and caused thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels to collapse.
The bodies of some people were trapped in the rubble of the collapsed buildings and 540 people were injured while 29 people have not been identified, he said.
Nugroho said there is a high likelihood of damage and damage in the area called Dongala, 300 km (190 miles) north of Palu, near the centre of the earthquake.
Nugroho said the communication system in Dongala had been "completely damaged".
In a statement, the Red Cross said more than 300,000 people were living here and its employees and volunteers were visiting the affected areas.
"It's a sad event at first, but it can be even more awful,"" it said."
The agency on Saturday criticised why no information was given earlier if the tsunami was about to hit Palu, though officials said the warning was about to be issued but the waves had already gone away.
A person hobbyistically made some videos and posted on social media in which it can be seen that the position on the upper floor of the building was voiced by the people present on the street down and a horrific warning could be heard in it.
Within a few minutes, too much water began to flow out of the pool and the buildings and cars were also dragged along.
Reuters was not able to immediately certify the footage.
Due to the earthquake and tsunami, power problems in Palu and communication lines were cut, making it difficult for authorities to link rescue efforts together.
Officials have started sending cargo planes with assistance to Jakarta and other cities, officials said, people still need to be evacuated and met with food as well as other needs.
The city's airport has been reopened for relief efforts only and will close in October.
President Joko Widodo was due to visit the withdrawal centers in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to more than 800.
It's awful.
Mr. Doseba said that the staff of World Vision based in Dongagala made every effort to make the city of Palu safe, the staff are living in it by making tarpaulin shelters in the courtyard of their office, they have seen with their own eyes the disaster.
He said, "When he spoke to them, it turned out that he saw many houses being destroyed."
It's awful.
Assistance groups began the work of bringing supplies for disaster relief seriously, some complaining that external assistance personnel who acquire specialised expertise are being barred from coming to Palu.
According to Indonesian rules, funds, any goods and employee assistance from abroad can only be taken when the disaster area is declared as a national disaster area.
But that has not been done yet.
Red Cross spokeswoman Aulia Aryani, based in Indonesia, said: "This disaster is still at the province level."
"After the government has said that it is okay, it is a national disaster, only then can we involve international aid personnel in the rescue work but that has not yet happened."
Even after the second night of the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, people whose friends and family members had not been identified in Palu had hoped that their loved ones would be found miraculously somewhere as happens after natural disasters.
On Saturday, it was found that a small boy was trapped in the sewer.
The rescue team on Sunday pulled a woman out of the rubble next to her, her child had been trapped in the rubble for two days.
Indonesian National Paragliding Team coach Gandan Subando trained two paragliders of the Asian Games to find the lost, who have been dedicated to it since the beginning of this month in Indonesia.
Mr. Mandgi was also among those stranded with his students at the Roa Roa Hotel.
"As a senior in the paragliding field, I am also emotionally depressed,"" he said."
Gandalf said the paragliding community began its work only after receiving the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel, sending messages to the Palu contestants participating in the festival between them via WhatsApp.
However, only grey marks appear on his message, not blue marks on it.
"""I think that means that the message could not reach people."

Kanye West: The rapper changed his name
Rapper Kanye West is going to change his name.
Speaking on Twitter on Saturday about the change, he said: "Officially, his name will be Kanye West."
The 41-year-old West has taken its name for some time and will use the name for the title of his eighth album, released in June.
The change is being made in his presence at Saturday's Night Live, where he is expected to start his new album Yandy.
The show's creator said he had removed singer Ariana Grande from the show who had refused to join the show for "emotional reasons."
In addition to shortening his existing professional name, West had already pointed out that the word has religious significance to him.
Speaking about the title of his album with Radio Host Big Boy earlier this year, West said, "I believe the word 'this' has been used many times in the Bible, and according to the Bible it means 'you'."
"So I am you, I am we, it is us."
This word is taken from Kanye, which means only one, which is just this - it represents our good, our evil, our illusion, everything.
In the album, we are shown who we are.
He is one of many famous rappers who changed his name.
Sean Combs also have many names, such as, Puff Daddy, P. Daddy or Daddy, but this year they have kept their names Love and Brother Love while announcing the name.
An old friend of West, Jay-Z (JAY-Z) has also changed his name with or without hyphens and capital letters.
Mexico's AMLO vows not to use the military against non-military civilians
On the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the country's deadly revenge against students, Mexican President-candidate Andrés Manuel López Obrador has sworn that the sworn military force will never again be used for civilians.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday in Teltelco Plaza that "military force will never be used to put pressure on the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, soldiers fired at a peaceful movement in the plaza that killed more than 300 people, at a time when left-wing student movements were spreading throughout Latin America.
López Obrador has pledged to help Mexico’s youth, grant students who read every month and open more and more free government universities.
He said that because of the unemployment and the low opportunities to get education, the young class joins those who commit crimes.
The U.S. should double the funds given to AI.
Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and AI businessman who has been downsizing Google, Microsoft and Apple, said that as China is becoming more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount of research spending in the field.
After several actions by the U.S. government, AI has commented on this, also saying that there is a lack of overall formal AI strategy in the U.S.
Meanwhile, last year, China launched a plan: it aims to reach number one in AI innovation by 2030.
"Doubling the AI research budget will get a great start, looking at all the other countries differently, so the U.S. is far behind this case, and we are trying for AI's next success," Lee said.
"Duplicating the fund could double the likelihood that AI's next big achievement will be in the U.S.,"" Lee told CNBC in an interview this week."
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Huton Mifflin Hercourt, CEO of Sinovision Ventures, is one of China's top AI companies investing in Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that left the most ranked American othello player behind, and later he took the post of executive at Microsoft Research and the post of president at Google's China Branch.
Lee outlined the previous U.S. government's technical skills, including the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's robot-related challenges, and said who would be the next government to identify the next vision.
Lee said that U.S. researchers often face enough hardships to get government help.
"This is not China removing academic leaders, it's corporate,"" Lee said."
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired giants from the university to work on AI.
Lee said that by changing the immigration policy, the U.S. can get help in its AI efforts.
"""I think you should get permission to do a PhD in AI through a green card yourself."
In July 2017, the State Council of China released its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan, which is the first of its kind.
"The National Natural Science Foundation of China has given funding to people of academic institutes in the same way that the National Science Foundation and other U.S. government organizations give financial grants to researchers, but the quality of education in China is not very good.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense opened a joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which aims to involve industry and academic partners, and the White House selected KIT for Artificial Building Intelligence.
In addition, this month, the DARPA launched an initiative called AI Next in which it talked about an investment of $2 billion.
For the NSF, this investment is now more than $100 million a year in AI research.
In the meantime, legislation was made in the U.S. that demand for the creation of a National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence would be ignored for months.
The people of Macedonia voted for whether or not the name of the country will be changed
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia voted to change the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia" or not, it is a task that would resolve the decades-old dispute with Greece, due to which Greece was suspending its membership in the EU and NATO
There is also a province in Greece called Macedonia, which says its northern neighbor's name is on its territory making two names for the same claim and it is already part of NATO and the EU.
The two governments made a deal in June on the basis of the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents opposed it and said that changing the name of Macedonia would weaken the ethnic identity of the majority of people living in Slavic.
President George Ivanov said he would not vote in the polls and would exclude the campaign, doubting that a minimum of 50 per cent of the votes required for this vote would be valid.
The question would be written on the ballot: "Do you give your approval for the agreement to be made with Greece for membership of NATO and the EU."
Along with Prime Minister Zoran Zev, supporters associated with the name change say it is essential for Macedonia to be a member of bodies like the EU and NATO, one of the countries that emerged from the fall of Yugoslavia.
"Today I have come to vote for the future of the country, it is for the future of the young people in Macedonia, so that they can live independently in the shadow of the EU because it means we have a safe life for all,"" Oliviera Georgijevska, 79, who lives in Skopje, said."
However, legally not being pushed for it, most MPs say they will work according to the results of the vote to make it decisive.
A two-thirds majority in Parliament is needed for a change of name.
The State Election Commission said no irregularities had been reported till 1 p.m.
However, when the last parliamentary election was held in 2016, there were only 16 per cent votes compared to 34 per cent, with 66 per cent of registered voters casting their votes.
Gozo Tanevsky, a 62-year-old voter living in the capital, said, "I came to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe."
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zev along with his wife Zorica and son Duschako voted in Macedonia for a change in the name of the country, to join NATO and the EU on September 30, 2018 in Stromika, Macedonia.
54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov, who lives in Skopje, was preparing a small stage in front of parliament, and those who are going to oppose this vote were putting up chairs in front of their tents.
"We need NATO and EU membership, but we want to join it by raising our heads, not through an agreement,"" Kavdarkov said."
"Our country is poor, but we have our own self-respect.
If they don't want to join us on behalf of Macedonia, it doesn't matter, we can become part of the Euro-Asia integration by joining other countries like China and Russia."
Prime Minister Zev has said that accession to NATO will give Macedonia a very important investment, with the unemployment rate here exceeding 20 per cent.
After casting his vote, Zev said, "I think there will be a lot more vote positivity as more than 80 per cent of our citizens agree to join the EU and NATO."
He said the "yes" result would be a "confirmation of our future."
Last Monday, a survey published by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research showed that 30 to 43 per cent of voters in the emergency polls will take part in this poll.
A second survey conducted by Macedonia's Telma TV on Sunday showed that 57 per cent of people are planning to vote.
Of those, 70 percent agree to vote yes.
More than 50 per cent of the votes needed to be successful.
If the vote fails, the Western government's policy, which was formed in May last year, will suffer the first serious blow.
Watch: Manchester City's Surgeon Eggero forced to defend the entire Brighton to score
On Saturday, at Manchester City, England's Etihad Stadium, Surgeon Eggero and Rahim Sterling defended well from Brighton in a 2-0 win over Manchester City.
Funnyly, Aguero scored his easy goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker was handed over to the midfielder in the first round.
As soon as he landed in the open field, he defended against three Brighton players.
After that, Aguero found himself surrounded by four opposing players.
He pushed a player to defend before moving forward from the corner of the Brighton box.
Then, looking for Sterling, he sent a pass to his left.
The English forward used his first touch in the box to give back the ball to Aguero, Aguero used his left boot to beat Brighton Kipper Matthew Ryan and the ball went out from his right side to the net.
City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters, "There are some problems in Aguaro's feet that make him annoyed."
"We talked about their game for 55, 60 minutes.
Thats what happened.
We were lucky that they scored at the same time."
But, it was because of Sterling who gave Sky Blues the initial advantage in the Premier League clash.
He scored in the 29th minute.
In that game, Aguaro found the ball deep in the area of Brighton.
He pulled the ball beautifully from the left side of Leroy Sen.
Sen touched a few before sending away the sterling playing nice.
Just before the game's hand slipped, Sky Blues tapped the ball forward.
The Champions League Group game will now be played in Rhine-Neckar-Arena, Germany, at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday.
Shazir wants to defeat him by playing against the Rockies
After the playoff dispute with the Nationals ended, there was no big reason to push for another start.
But, the always-competitive skipper hopes to score big against Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but the playoffs for Rockies are still just the odds, he wins the game played with the Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West.
With a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, the Rockies got a wild-card spot, but they're still looking to get the first division title.
"Although we're not getting a great game, but at least we can play to know that Denver's crowded and second-team environment will probably be for the highest-level game I'll face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to participate in that game?"
The Nationals still have to tell about the starter for Sunday, but it is coming to hear that in such a situation, the Chess can be included.
Shazer, who plays for his 34th start, took the risk of a bullpen session on Thursday and will pitch on his normal on Sunday.
Washington's right-hander stood at 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikes in the 220 2/3 innings of this season.
Trump's rally in West Virginia
Speaking about the importance of the Republican vote in the Midterm election, the President referred to Brett Kavanaugh about the situation around his Supreme Court in Laket.
"All the work we have done will be on the stakes in November.
There are only five weeks left for the most important election of our lives.
"This is a very big election - I am not involved in it, but really I am involved, because I am fighting for all the great candidates,"" he said."
"You can take a look at this much more terrible radical group of Democrats, you can see all the things that are happening right now," Trump said.
In addition, they are trying to arm the power by using other essential means, which you know is useless and useless.
To get power and control, they don't care who's sad, who's capable of it, they just want power and control here, but we won't let that happen," he said.
He said the Democrats' campaign is "to oppose and obstruct."
"Besides, you can see what-has happened in the last four days, the anger of the Democrats you saw and also see how mean and bad they are,"" he said."
Referring to the Senate Judicial Committee, he cited the name of the Democratic Sen. Diana Feinstein, who was highly appreciated by the audience.
"Do you remember his answer?"
Have you leaked the document?
What.
No, no, I'm waiting for that -- whose body language was really bad -- such a bad body language I saw for the first time."
Work is no longer a big church.
For those who speak their minds, it is not worthy of being tolerated.
When the activists advancing my local party voted to elect me, it was a big surprise to me.
After all, I am the youngest among those Labour MPs whose importance has been left quite low - we can't say the whole thing of our minds.
My MP colleague John Ryan was also here because he had also raised a voice for anti-sociality.
In my case, Sensor Motion condemned my disagreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, there were similar problems in Europe which Jeremy disagreed with senior leaders in a similar way.
For the Nottingham East Labor meeting on Friday, we wish that all things be included in the meeting and that these be beneficial.
During my eight years as a local Labor MP, I have mostly seen here that the Friday Night GC meeting was exactly the same.
Sadly, many meetings today do not agree and or promise that the politics of "merciful and devout people" are really forgotten, here too.
It is clear that if the attitudes in the Labour Party are different, they are not tolerated and it is decided for every consideration whether this party is eligible for leadership.
Immediately after becoming Jeremy's leader, the colleagues for whom I had previously thought that they held political opinions like mine, began to expect me to turn my back on my words and work on positions with which I could never agree with Saeed Singh - whether it was for national security or again
Whenever I raise a voice for the public - and it really doesn't matter what I said - bad words are seen on social media, it is strongly commented on, the politics of the Centre is condemned and I am told that I am not worthy of the Labour Party.
Besides, it's not just my experience.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues because my comments are related to politics.
I know about the way businesses work and I’m dedicated to colleagues who always face sexual or racial abuse, but don’t shy away from raising voices.
There are many disappointing aspects in today’s political era, one of which is how to normalize the levels of abuse.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn claimed that it is necessary to promote a culture of intolerance for the Labour Party.
The reality is that we are no longer the broad church and the changes taking place in the selection rule of every proposal or party of "disbelief" have been greatly diminished.
In the last two years, many people have advised me and urged me to remain silent, not to talk too much, and then I will be "considered right."
But I didn’t come into politics for that.
32 years ago, when I was engaged in work as a school student, I was urged to oppose the Thatcher government, I was asked to abandon the broad classroom of my school completely, I demanded that those who are most in need of better public services be given back to the government - whether they are in need or not.
I never hid any of my politics, including the politics I did in the last election.
There is no one in Nottingham East who has any doubts about my policy post and no area of disagreement about my current leadership.
I would like to say to all those who promoted the proposal on Friday that when the country is heading towards Brexit that is damaging our homes, businesses and public services, I do not understand the need to waste my time and energy showing my honesty to the Labour Party.
But, in fact, I have a message that is not for Nottingham Momentum, it is for my supporters, whether they are Labour members or not: I am proud that I am serving you and I promise that there can be any sort of intrusive risk in my work or political campaigns that can block all of them, not just you.
Chris Leslie is the MP of East Nottingham.
EYE 38 - 17 Melrose: Get to the top of the defeated EYE
The two late attempts may have some impact on the final result, but there is no doubt that Ire Tenent's premiership deserved to win in this best entertaining match.
Now they are at the top of the table of only ten defeated sides.
Ultimately, his defense was the best, he found the best opportunity he could get, which led him to push the home team forward and give Coach Peter Murchi a chance to be happy.
"We have fully checked our game and we are still defeated, so it makes me happy,"" he said."
Robin Christie of Melrose said: "It goes to Ayr, who has wasted as much of his opportunity as possible."
The 14th minute attempt by Grant Anderson forced Fresier Clemo to come in front of Ayr, but Scottish player Rory Hughes was given a yellow card for the game by the Warriors, who got a chance to score for Melrose, who got a chance to score for Cosby and Jason Baggins.
With the help of a penalty just before the half-time, Clemo increased the aerial, he scored and then attempted to sideline the match for the aerial 17-5 at the time of the break.
But Melrose was better in the second half and Patrick Anderson's effort turned the baggot into a goal, reducing Levy's five points.
Thereafter, Ruridiah Nott suffered a serious injury due to which he had to halt the game for quite some time, he was stretched, then after the game began, Ire moved on and tried through Stafford Macdonald whom Clemo turned into a goal.
At the time, Ier's team captain Blair McPherson had received a yellow card, and then due to too much pressure at the end of the game, Melrose gave an extra effort to Bruce Colvin who failed to beat him.
However, the host team lagged behind and when Strun Hutchinson got a yellow card due to facing Billa Ball's climax from the penalty line-out, McPherson downed the touchdown, pushing the air from behind.
After collecting David Armstrong's box kick by Kelly Rowe and sending Flenker Gregor Henry away for the home side's fifth attempt, Clemo turned it into a goal, as he could when the game restarted.
The stars of the game are still looking for a new career in the restaurant industry.
The star of the game, Ford Kearne, is still looking for a way to go into the hospitality industry, some time ago it turned out that he was chosen to be the director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old Jack is associated with Jarvis's famous BBC show, in which he works as a writer and co-star in the acting role of comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The two have said that the upcoming ninth series will be their last series in the world of the show, and it seems that what Kieran has to do after Craiglang is what they are planning to do.
Based on the official record list, they are the directors of Edriftmorn Ltd.
The actor declined to comment on the story, yet a Scottish Sun source hinted that he wanted to join an "adult restaurant trade" based in Cairns, Glasgow.
'We have a right to the sea': land-restricted Bolivia hopes court will reopen path to peace
Naval patrols are being conducted at the Naval Headquarters in La Paz.
The blue-ocean flag is waving on government buildings.
From Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, the Navy base has a slogan: "We have the right to the sea.
It is our duty to find it again."
The coastal region of Bolivia, losing to Chile in the terrible conflict for land in the 19th century, is still desperate to regain its land - they want to once again wave their address in the Pacific Ocean.
He now hopes that decades ago he will be able to regain his Bolivian land, as it is awaiting a judgement from the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calazilla said, "Bolivia now has enough zeal, there is a sense of unity and peace here, and the hope of the people here is to get a positive result."
Many people in Bolivia will see the big decision of the ICJ on the big screen across the country, they fully hope that the decision that will come from the Court of The Hague will be in the favor of Bolivia - which has been in talks for decades - Chile has been forced to do so through talks.
Bolivia's finest president, Ivo Morales - who will face a controversial contest in next year's re-election - also showed the positive side in Monday's rule.
Last August, he said, "We are very close to getting back to the Pacific Ocean."
But, some analysts believe that the court's decision would not be in the interest of Bolivia - and if the decision also comes in its interest, there will be enough conditions.
The UN body present in the Netherlands does not have the right to reward the province of Chile, and it has decided that the possible outcomes of the talks will not be determined.
In the International Court of Justice, Chilean expert Paz Zarat said the ICJ's decision would come six months after the final talks, in which the hearings pointed to the fact that the case was "not complicated."
Also, unlike the conditions of Bolivia, it seems for the past four years that it may come back to the old state.
"The issue of access to the sea has been blocked by the current government of Bolivia,"" Jarret said."
He suggested that the controversial statement of Morales has eliminated Chile's remaining goodwill.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to negotiate on certain terms, but it will be very difficult to negotiate this time after the decision is made.
The ambassadors of the two countries have not been living in each other's country since 1962.
The former president of Bolivia, Eduardo Rodriguez Veltze, who is present in The Hague, has denied that the court's decision was unusually too swift.
He said that on Monday there would be "a better opportunity for Bolivia to open the way for new relations with Chile" and it would be an opportunity to "end 139 years of disagreement on mutual benefit."
Calazilla has denied that Morales - who is still one of Latin America's most famous presidents - was politicizing the maritime problem.
"Bolivia will never back down on its right to access the Pacific Ocean,"" he said."
"The decision is an opportunity to know what we needed to do in the past."
North Korea says nuclear inspections will not be stopped until it trusts the United States
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has said he will not destroy his nuclear bomb until his nation trusts Washington.
Ree made a speech at the General Assembly of the United Nations on Saturday.
He urged the United States to fulfill the promises made at the Singapore Summit between the leaders of other countries.
He commented that U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems to be resuming nuclear diplomacy more than three months after North Korea's Kim Jong-un's pledges in Singapore.
Ree said it was one of those "pipe dreams" that would defeat North Korea's sanctions and U.S. objections to the declaration of an end to the Korean War.
Washington is cautious about the consent of the important disarmament campaign already underway without Pyongyang's announcement.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want another summit to be held.
But, it is completely suspicious that Pyongyang is serious about ending the inspection of the nuclear bomb because they do not want to jeopardize the security of the country.
Pompeo is planning to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second summit of Kim-Trump's will.
A number of new design headsets have appeared for your nearest high street at the Paris Fashion Show
If you need to increase your hat collection or completely protect your head from the sunlight, there is no longer any need to wait too long.
Both Valentino and Tom Brown designers have created a range of the best headwear for their SS19 collection on the runway that appears in the special style of the famous Paris Fashion Week.
The best profitable hats are designed to avoid this year's heat and these designers have sent their beautiful creations to showcase.
The finest hats made by Valentino were large enough, decorated with that wide brim like wings that hung around the head of the model.
The much larger second-sided accessory included Waterloo Hats, Wizard Hats and Pineapple Design Hats made in bezel design - but they're not designed to protect your head from frost.
Thomas Brown also showed specially designed face masks - and they can only be used in time for Halloween.
People were surprised to see many colorful faces and saw things more like Hannibal Lecter than Highte Coucher.
One creation saw all sorts of gear for scuba diving including snowballs and glasses, while the other creation saw a melting ice cream cone design.
In addition, if you've seen too much fashion - you're lucky.
Style-looking amateurs assume that this is the best collection that can soon reach the great shops around you.
The very large hat will come with a la Bomba-designed heel, ranging from the two-foot wide-brimmed straw hat Rihanna to Emily Ratajkovsky.
Behind the best-performing hat was a cult label that looked pretty pretty, with the second creation shown with a catwalk posted on social media - showing the model wearing a swimsuit on a straw beach bag.
The Burnt Orange Rafia bag was trimmed with Rafia fringing and worn with white leather handles, it was the best attraction of the La Riviera SS19 collection of the Jacquims at Paris Fashion Week.
Famous fashion celebrity Luke Armitage told EMail: "I hope that big-big hats and beach bags will arrive in stores soon for the upcoming summer season - because the designers will be so impressed that the big-sized accessories will be unmade.
John Edwards: Language skills are a must for citizens from outside the country.
Scotland’s private schools keep track of the track record of excellence in education, and since 2018 it has continued to deliver the best exam results, strengthening individual and collective success in sports, arts, music and other community endeavors.
More than 30,000 students across Scotland are affiliated with the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), these schools under their leadership are trying to provide the best service to their students and parents.
The aim of private schools is to prepare their students for better and higher education, their chosen careers and their places are benefiting citizens of foreign countries.
As an education sector that can build and implement the school curriculum, we are seeing that schools continue to choose modern languages as the choice of the famous and desired subject.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If you speak to a person in the language he understands, you become the best for him.”
If you speak to him in the same language, the thing is very good to his heart."
When we want to build a relationship and trust the people of other countries, we feel that we can rely more on English.
In this year’s recent exam results, we can see that languages with the highest passing rates in private schools are at the top of the league table.
Of these, 68 per cent are students who have achieved the highest grade A in foreign languages.
The data collected by the 74 member schools of SCIS can be seen in 72 percent of students achieved the highest grade A in Mandarin, while 72 percent of students achieved A in German, 69 percent of students achieved A in French and 63 percent of students achieved A in Spanish.
This shows that Scotland’s private schools are collaborating in foreign languages, giving children and young people the necessary skills they will need in the future.
Languages are now incorporating the courses of private schools and other subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) as an alternative subject.
A 2014 survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills found that employers struggled enough to hire employees on vacant positions, with 17 per cent of candidates lacking language skills.
Therefore, it is becoming compulsory to have more language skills to prepare young people for their future careers.
Due to the more potential employment opportunities that language needs, these skills are necessary to work anywhere in the world.
Whether or not there is a choice for a career, if people have learned a second language, then such skills will certainly benefit them in the future.
If you are able to speak directly to foreigners, being a multilingual person will lead you to the competition yourself.
More than 4,000 adults in the UK participated in the YouGov survey in 2013, according to which 75 percent of people could not speak a foreign language sufficiently and only French was the subject that 15 percent of people could speak and it was the only language to reach a double-digit percentage.
For this reason, today it is necessary to invest in teaching languages to children.
Knowing many languages, especially the languages of countries with developing economies, will give children a better chance of finding the right job.
The languages taught in each of the schools in Scotland will be different.
There are also many schools that will focus more on classical modern languages, while other schools will teach those languages whose approach is towards 2020 and are considered the most important for the UK, for example, Mandarin or Japanese.
No matter why your child is interested in learning any language, they will always be able to choose that language in private schools and they will also find teaching staff who are experts in the field.
Scotland’s private schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children for the future and give them the necessary skills for success, enabling them to move forward in the future.
For the global business environment, it cannot be ruled out right now that learning languages in the country is very important for the future, so it should be better placed in education.
In fact, modern languages should really be accepted as "international communication skills."
The choice to choose this option, diversity and excellence will continue to be given to young people in Scotland by private schools.
We have to do it.
Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools is John Edwards.

Next week, Trump has set five more rallies including Tennessee and Mississippi as well as other favorable spots.

The time of Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia is set for Saturday night, September 29, 2018 at 7pm ET.
You can watch Trump's rally online in West Virginia via live stream on YouTube.
Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh could make a speech at this week's hearing, with the confirmation of the Senate vote expected for a week during the FIT's probe due to allegations of sexual offences against Kavanaugh.
But, the main goal of this tense rallies is to help the Republicans face the November elections.
According to Reuters, President Trump said during the campaign, "The aim of these five rallies next week is to protect and increase their blocked majority in the Senate and the House of Representatives" as a result of the Republican effort in the form of volunteers and co-workers.
According to Reuters, the spokesman, who has been removed from Trump's campaign, said, "Congress control has become so important to their agenda that the president will only visit those states where the season of our campaign will be very busy."
According to the West Virginia Metro News, "Wesbanko of Wheeling's set in the arena, the attention of supporters of Ohio and Pennsylvania from tonight's rally can be brought to the Pittsburgh media."
This will be the second time Trump has visited West Virginia on Saturday last month, receiving more than 40 percent of the vote from the region in 2016.
West Virginia Republican Senate polling candidate Patrick Morris is on his way to try to help the Republicans out.
According to Reuters, Simon Hyder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, said, "If the president is trying to push Morris in the election, that's not a good sign for him."
Rider Cup 2018: Team USA showed willingness to compete to keep expectations of staying at the top of the Sande singles
After three one-sided sessions, the result of the fourth session on Saturday afternoon will be what is going to happen in this Rider Cup.
Time-lapse cycles are a completely new concept for players, but when a player moves forward and which player to trust, it cannot be predicted in such competitions.
So, what will they say about this momentum now?
"He had a six-point lead that is now four, so I think we have to step up our pace a little bit,"" Jordan Spith told reporters."
Of course, Europe took advantage and took 12 points to four points in the game.
According to Spieth, the American thinks they have a little too many opportunities left and a lot to encourage, not only from the form of Spieth but also from the form of Justin Thomas, who played together all day and both got three out of four points from their game that
Spieth is deadly for everyone from T to Green and is the best in the game.
As soon as they moved on to their game, the people cheered with excitement and cheered loudly, when they and Thomas went down two more points after two, they scored important puts to complete the four all-square.
Because of his putt, his team came in 15th position with the same scream, a sort that tells you that you don't believe the American team out of it.
"You really just have to play well and take care that the win is yours,"" Spieth said."
That's what all the players who have gone out of the game say.
18 holes to make a mark.
In the past two days, there are only two players with more points than Spieth and Thomas, named after Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fletwood, who are making new history in the Rider's Cup.
Different styles but better couples from Europe scored four points out of four and are ahead.
There was a single couple who did not shoot a bogie on Saturday afternoon, but they stayed away from the bogie until nine o'clock on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and Friday morning.
On Sunday, he found the way to get the run and that run in this overwhelming crowd and from this overwhelming crowd as if they were beating players, and there is no player who could turn the possible win of the European team into a defeat. It seemed that Fleetwood or Molinari would have taken the scoring of the golf national first.
It is good that the two are on different holes in different ways.
However, the question of European dignity has been raised a long time ago.
Bubba Watson and Web Simpson made it a little easier for football hero Surgeo Garcia in the morning, at the time their pair were made up with Alex Noren.
One bogie in front of nine dogs and two doubles spanishards and swedes had never even reached before.
However, there was no one on Sunday to help you get to your hole.
The football and the fours were very good at watching because the interaction between the pairings was quite good, he advised that they do not need to seek advice and how to change the strategy they are well-versed in.
As a team, Europe played very well and took a significant lead in the last day, but this fourth session also showed that the team has the ability to compete with the USA which, especially in the Stateside, is questionable.
The last day of the Rider's Cup Europe took a lead of 10-6
Europe will take good advantage of the last day of the Rider Cup after a 10-6 lead over the United States on Saturday and a fourth match.
Best pairs Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari took the lead on the tiger woods battling two wins so they could take their match far ahead of the four points of the Golf National.
In retaliation for his defeat of the trophy two years ago in Hazeltine, Thomas Bezorn was dominated by the misfire of the American side in European side tomorrow's football, which gave him a 3-1 lead in the series.
The U.S. showed a lot of resistance in the fourth, winning two games, but they could not escape defeat.
Jim Furrick's side needs eight points in 12 singles matches on Sunday to maintain the trophy's win.
Fleetwood are the first European stops to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari started with "Mollywood" after a sensational weekend, they are the second pair to have won four points in their first four matches in the Rider's Cup history.
After losing to Woods and Patrick Reed in football, he again defeated the best player Woods and American Ruckie Bryson Deshambue by 5 and 4 points, performing better than ever before.
The two-match Woods showed their best performance on Saturday, but they have now lost 19 times in their 29 games of foreball and fours and seven games of roost.
In the rest of the morning football, Justin Rose returned to fourth with his quarterback Henryk Stenson and defeated the world's top three players Dustin Johnson and Brooks Copeka 2-1.
However, the petitioner in the South West of Paris, Breezy Day, had no break in Europe.
Major players Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three times on Saturday, set a benchmark for the American by scoring two points.
He defeated Spain's John Rahm and Ian Paulter 2-1 and sent Pauls and Rory McLareroy 4-3 in the first two holes.
This has only happened twice in the history of the Rider's Cup when a team came back from a singles match with four points, although the same kind of need was on Furrick's side, drawing everyone's attention in the trophy.
However, the counter-attack that will take place on Sunday after remaining second-best for two days is going to be as different from their old game.
North Korea says disarmament will only be one side that can't be trusted
North Korea's foreign minister said on Saturday the United Nations had continued sanctions that depended on its mistrust in the United States and showed no way to allow the country to stop inspecting a nuclear bomb on its own behalf in such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho said at the annual general assembly of the World Body that last year North Korea had tried a number of ways that were associated with "important ways of sanity", such as, stopping nuclear bombs and missile tests, detonating nuclear bombs and detonating nuclear bombs, testing places
"However, we have not found any answer to this from the US,"" he said."
"There will be no confidence in our national security without relying on the U.S. in any way and there is no way in such situations that we can begin unilateral disarmament."
While Ree reiterated that the complaints made by North Korea in view of the disarmament are about Washington's "step-by-step" approach under which North Korea could gradually take advantage of one-sided, his statement that the first step is to make it completely clear that one-sided
At the summit between the U.S. President and North Korean leader serving in Singapore on June 12, for the first time, Rei referred to the statement made jointly by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump, when Kim addressed the "disarmament of the North Korean Peninsula" in the direction of the "disarmament of the North Korean peninsula"
North Korea is demanding a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States says Pyongyang should stop making its nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also objected to the call to end the stringent international sanctions on North Korea.
"The U.S. has first emphasized disarmament and increased the level of pressure on the sanctions so that it can forcibly achieve its purpose, and at the same time, it has also objected to the "declaration of the end of war."
"The restraint can bend us, such a perception is a pipe dream of those who are ignoring us."
But the problem is that the continued ban is decreasing our confidence even further," he said.
Ree did not discuss the plan for the second summit between Kim and Trump, saying the U.S. leader had outlined the beauty of the United Nations last week.
Instead, the minister discussed the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon J-in over the past five months, adding: "If the party for disarmament is South Korea and not the U.S. for this problem, then there will be no disarmament of the Korean peninsula."
Yet, Ree's speech was very different from last year's speech when he spoke about the U.N. National Assembly saying targeting U.S. Mainland with a North Korean rocket after "Mr. Evil President" called "Rocket Man" on the Suside mission.
In the United Nations this year, Trump, who threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea last year, praised Kim's courage to take up disarmament but said there was still a lot of work to be done and the sanctions would remain in place until North Korea disarmament.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time limit for it, "if it takes two, three or five years - it doesn't matter."
China and Russia are arguing that Pyongyang should be rewarded for the steps taken by the U.N. Security Council.
However, on Thursday, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council: "The sanctions of the Security Council should remain in place until we realize without any failure that we are completely, last and verified."
The Security Council has extended sanctions on North Korea in full agreement in 2006 to deposit funds for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile program.
Pompeo met with Ree at the U.N. General Assembly and then said he would return to Pyongyang for the second summit next month.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit was not a good one.
They returned from Pyongyang in July and said work had progressed, within just a few hours North Korea condemned them for "gangster-like demands."
At a meeting this month, North Korea decided to destroy the missile site and if the United States adopts a "compliant measure" it will also destroy the nuclear facility.
He said Kim had promised him a "coherent measure" to ensure security that Trump would make a resolution in Singapore and he moved on to build normal relations with Washington.
Harvard's students are taking a course for a comfortable enough job.
Harvard University has launched a new course this year that is for all its undergraduates who are struggling in a growing Macho culture for study through caffeine-fueled 'All-Nighters'.
The world's number one university teacher who teaches students often has no choice when it comes to exactly what to do in order to relax.
Charles Kazisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and expert at Brigham and Women's Hospital, has created a course that he believes is the first of its kind in the U.S.
After talking about the impact of low sleep during teaching, he came up with the idea of starting this course.
"A girl came to me at the end of the year and said, 'Why do I say this every time I have to go to next year's class?'
She said no one told her about the importance of sleep - which shocked me.
This year, for the first time, students will learn how important good habits of sleeping in study-writing and athletic performance are, as well as how this will improve their general health.
Paul Barrera, Professor of Psychiatry and Executive Director of the Health Services of the University at Harvard Medical School, said that students do not get enough sleep every week for which the University decided to start this course.
A series of interactive tasks has been included in the hours-long course.
In one section, there will be an image of a dormitory room, where students will click on coffee cups, curtains, instructors and books to tell what the effect on caffeine and light will be and also tell about the importance of the lack of sleep in the day, what kind of impact on athletic performance
In the second section, participants will be told that lack of sleep can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
A map of the campus with interactive icons will be shown, then participants will be encouraged to think about their daily routines.
"""We know this will not change the behavior of the students immediately,"" Professor Zessler said."
But, we believe that they should have knowledge of this - just as they have knowledge of the health impacts of smoking."
He said that the culture of experiencing pride in 'wake up reading all night' is still present, the increasing pressure on modern technology and students means they have less sleep which has become an increasing problem.
Whether or not you sleep enough and good sleep, it's like making sure students have a 'secret weapon', which can help them cope with stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said - it protects them from the impact of weight loss because their brains are always hungry because of the lack of sleep.
19-year-old Raymond Soe of California, who studies chemical and physical biology, worked in the construction of Professor Jessler's help course, completing his last year class at Harvard during the last year.
He said that due to the course he became aware and inspired for the campus-wide course.
In the future, he hopes that it will be considered necessary for all postgraduate students to complete this course before joining the competitive institute.
Prof Jessler suggested that students should consider setting an alarm before going to bed, as well, they should also decide when to wake up, and they should be aware of the damaging impact of the 'blue light' emitted by the electronic screen and LED light that can cause dye, which is more likely to occur on them.
Livingston's 1-0 against Rangers: Menga scored against Garrard
Due to Dolly Manga's strike, the Rangers faced trouble in another match, putting the responsibility of Livingston's 1-0 win on the wrong side of Steven Garrard.
Ibro Side were looking for their first win after a 4-1 win in a match played in St Johnston in February, but Gary Holt's team instigated as the manager for a second loss to Garrard in the 18 games, so that Landbrooks would score a first-place finish.
Before the half-time, Manga struck for seven minutes and then the Rangers' line-up shorts didn't even get a chance to match the game once.
However, the Rangers have now dropped to sixth place in the rankings, Livingston has reached third place and is only behind the Hiberian due to the goal difference.
Also, since Lynnsman's Calam Spans head wound has been treated clearly at the other end of the object, the game can be even more troublesome for the Rangers.
Due to the eight changes made to the side of the Garrard, the previous year got the chance to go to the Bettfried Cup semi-finals.
On the other hand, Holt was included in the same Live 11 that took a point from Harts last week and the way he drilled well troubled the opposition team at every turn.
The Rangers could have won the match, but Livingston played better than he did.
When Menga first sent Scott Pittman to Alan McGregor's goal by a late-off, he should have given him only two minutes, but the midfielder missed this big opportunity he had found.
When Keegan Jacobs, present in the Deep, free-kicked, the kick went to Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgo, present on the back post, could only widen the stab.
The Rangers did get control, but in the final third they were more confident in their game than they expected.
Certainly Alfredo Morelos experienced that he should have penalized the quarter-over mark as he and Steven Lolas collided with each other, but referee Steven Thomson denied Columbia's appeal.
The Rangers saved two shots on the target in the first-half, but Ibro's former goalkeeper Liam Kelly faced difficulties with Lasana Kolibili's header and Twee OV Azaria's strike.
However, Levi's opener could have gone against the run of the game in the 34th minute, but no one can deny that they are the only ones entitled to this graft.
Even after that, the best player in the Rangers Deep could not touch Jacob.
When Dekan Galagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, Scott Arfield showed no interest in it, Scott Robinson had kept Manga quiet to pick for the simple finish.
When Garrard swapped Colibelle for Ryan Kent and switched to show immediate effect while slotting by Wingr in Morelos, at the time he had taken a break, but Kelly blocked his line while running great.
But, Livingstone showed the visitor the same game as the kind of game they could really enjoy, sweeping the long ball with Lithgo and Hulk after the long ball.
Holt's side in the final stage could have increased his edge, but McGregor prevented Jacobs from well-studying up before widening the corner by Lithgow.
The Rangers called the existing Glenn Middleton as an alternative, they made another late claim for penalty as they were confused with Jacobs, but Thomson didn't let them succeed again.
Elmanac: Inventor of the Geyser Counter
Now a page of our "Sunday Morning" schedule: 136 years ago today, September 30, 1882 and beyond... the day when the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
For the method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, Geiger invented a device later known as the Geiger counter.
Geiger is a major base of counter-science, it has become the main basis of pop culture, as well as, in 1950, a film on it, "Bells of Coronado", in which scientists Roy Rogers and Del Evans acted for the first time:
Man: "What does he do for the world?"
Rogers: "This is a geyser counter used to detect radioactive minerals like uranium.
After turning on these earphones, you can certainly hear the impact of hidden atoms due to radioactivity in minerals."
Evans: "Tell me, it's definitely popping right now!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, at the time he was about 63 years old.
But due to his invention, his name is still alive.
New Cancer Vaccine Could 'See' Bad Cells of Immune System
New cancer vaccine can ‘see’ bad immune system cells and eliminate them <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
The vaccine instructs the immune system to identify the damaged cells during treatment.
With this method, the immune cells of a patient in the laboratory are removed and can be replaced
After that, they can ‘see’ the common protein for many cancers and then remove it and re-implant it.
In a trial for vaccines, promising results are being seen in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman was given the vaccine, which looked at her malignant cells present in the immune system, then it was seen that her ovarian cancer, present for more than 18 months, had disappeared.
With this method, a patient's immune cells can be removed in the lab and replaced, so that they can "see" the common protein found in many cancers called HER2, and then be re-implanted by removing the cells.
Professor J. Burzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our findings show that this vaccine is very promising."
Pro Burzofsky said that HER2 causes "many types of cancers to develop", including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancers.
The removal of patients' immune cells and the detection of cancerous cells is beneficial in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
After his SNL presence, Kanye West on the MAGA hat denounced Trump's old controversial speech.
It didn't go well
After Kanye West's best performance, in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said that he will be his government in 2020, he condemned in the studio during Saturday's Night Live.
After performing his third song of the night called Ghost Town, in which he wore the Make America Great Cap, he denounced the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"So, I talk to white people many times and they say, 'Why do you like Trump, they're racist?'
Yet, if I was concerned about racism, I would have left America a long time ago."
SNL started the show with Matt Damon's sketch, in which the Hollywood star made a joke about Brett Kavanaugh's case, it is already known that the Senate Judicial Committee has already done sexual assault on them by Kristin Blacey Ford.
However, nothing like this was shown, footage of West's condemnation was uploaded by Chris Rock on social media.
It was not revealed whether or not Rock was trying to blow West's laughter with the posting because of the post.
Along with this, West complained in front of the audience that he was threatened with going to the backstage with his headwear.
"He threatened me backstage.
"""Don't wear that hat,"" he said."
They threatened me!
Besides, he also said I was stuck in the wrong place," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West said, "Do you want to see the wrong place?" At the same time, he said, "They'll make a play for my Superman Cape, because it means you can't tell what to do with me. Do you have the desire to move the world forward?
Love it."
In his comments, he mentioned the audience at least twice and felt embarrassed by SNL's artist, one person told the publication in a separate report: "The whole studio was completely silenced."
Singer Ariana Grande was called to West due to a delay in her arrival, a few days ago, Ariana Grande's old boyfrid rapper Mac Miller died.
West gave performances on the song I Love It to many audiences, she was dressed like a Periyar bottle.
West again met with the head of the Conservative Group TPUSA, Candes Turner, who tweeted: "For one of the most courageous people: Thank you for raising the voice for the public."
But, the host of the talk show, Karen Hunter, tweeted that the West is just there "what she said and which is absolutely amazing."
"But, I didn't choose anyone who took advantage (buying your music or clothes or supporting your 'art') that in my opinion was promoting the wrong idea for my community or saying the wrong thing to my community."
He is free.
That's why we exist," he said.
Prior to the show, the rapper tweeted that they had changed their name, as well, also said that they were now "formally going to go by the name of Kanye West."
They are not the first artists to change their name, but before that, Daddy and Puffy had also done what the old names were Puff Daddy and Puff Daddy respectively.
Along with the rapper, Snoop Dogg's old name was Snoop Leon and the music's late famous prince had also changed his name to a symbol and the artist was already known by the name of the prince afterwards.

The allegations will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
Game of Thrones star Kit Herington raises questions about toxic masculinity
Kit Herington is best known for his role as John Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But, the 31-year-old actor has questioned the role of Macho Hero, saying that seeing such roles on the screen often inspires many young boys to do such a difficult job in order to earn respect.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kitt said he was feeling "something wrong" and asked how to end the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Recently, Kit married his 31-year-old co-star Rose Leslie of Game of Thrones, who believes he feels "enough stamina" to talk about the issue.
"Personally, I feel quite strongly that right now - are we doing something wrong with Masculinity?"""
‘Are we teaching men that when they grow up, they will have to deal with the problems that appear on the screen?’
Kit thinks that television may be partially responsible for toxic masculinity, he thanked its much more masculine principal character.
He said, "What is taught and what is taught?"
Whatever is taught on TV and on the street, do young boys feel that in order to be a man, they must do some certain work?
In my opinion, this has indeed become one of the big questions of our time - how can we make a change in it?
Because it is obvious that something has gone wrong with the thoughts of the young men.'
In an interview, he also assumed that when the Game of Thrones series reappears at the end of next summer, he will not participate in any of its prequels or sequels, as well, he also said that he has done many programs with 'Warfields and Horse Riding'.
From November, Kit will be working on the new series of True West by Sam Shepherd, which is the story of a film producer whose brother is a thief.
Recently, the actor said that the best thing that happened to him from Game of Thrones is to meet his wife Rose.
"I got my life partner through this show, so I believe this show has given me my future family and my life has moved on from here,"" he said."
Rose has played the role of Ygreet, who is the girlfriend of Kit's character John Snow in the Amy Award-winning fantasy series.
In June 2018, the couple got married with a family agreement in Leslie, Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: According to the report, there has been a 14% increase in new cases in China
China has announced that there has been a 14% increase in people suffering from HIV and AIDS in the country.
Health officials said more than 820,000 people across the country are suffering from the disease.
Around 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
Given the changes that have taken place in recent times, most of the new cases are being reported due to sex.
Traditionally, HIV is spreading rapidly in some parts of China due to infected blood infections.
At a conference in Yunnan province, China's health officials said the number of people suffering from HIV had gone to near zero.
However, the number of people suffering from HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 every year.
HIV infection from sex by the LGBT community in China is a serious problem.
In 1997, homosexuality was promoted in China, but it is reported that there is enough discrimination against the LGBT community.
Studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women due to the country's conservative importance.
Due to many infections of the disease, in these relationships there is inadequate protection regarding sex.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has tried to solve this problem, for which every person has been promised that they will be given access to HIV medicine.
Maxine Waters denied that her employees had leaked data from the GOP senator, calling it a "dangerous lie" and a "way to conceal"
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday said the allegations were unfortunate, saying one of his employees posted private information of three Republican U.S. Senators on Lomaker's Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrats claimed that the claims were being investigated by the Pandit and the website of the "Ultra-Right Wing."
Waters tweeted, "Lies, lies and too much disgusting."
The information allegedly included the addresses and phone numbers of South Carolina Senator Lindsay Graham and two U.S. Senators Mike Lee and Orin Hatch's home.
This information was seen online on Thursday, which was posted by an unknown person on Capital Hill, when the Senate panel was hearing allegations of sexual abuse against the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
Kavanaugh was being questioned over the leak of information from three senators.
Hill says that addresses from a conservative site like Gateway Pundit and RedState that tricked IP addresses that identify the source of the person posting, it was reported that the source was connected to the Waters office and an employee of Waters had released the information.
"This allegation is completely unfounded, wrong and absolutely false,"" Waters said."
"No one of my employees - whose identity, personal information and security is being put at risk due to these false and false allegations - was responsible in any way for leaking this information.
This allegation is unfounded, completely wrong and absolutely false."
Waters soon posted online for clearance of criticism, including the White House's former press secretary.
"This rejection is due to anger,"" Fletcher wrote."
"It is known that their character is not the kind that should be of a member of Congress.
When an accusation is made against someone, they should not get angry.
They should not be rebels.
They should not question the person who has accused.
They need to be calm and patient. "
It seemed that the response of the flavour waters was being compared to the condemnation of Judge Kavanaugh's Democrats, critics accused Kavanaugh of being very angry during the hearing on Thursday.
Republican candidate Omar Navarro also tweeted his views on the loss of the waters in the Midterm elections.
He had tweeted, "If that's true, it's a very big thing."
In his statement, Waters reported that his office had alerted the appropriate authorities and enforcement units to these claims of fraud.
"""We will make sure that the criminals will be told whether or not, and whether or not they will be held legally liable for all the deeds they have done which are too bad and dangerous for any and all of my employees."
Johnny English Strikes Again Review - Rowan Atkinson's spy act wasn't considered too obscene
From a British point of view, the importance of Brexit in any new film is still seen traditionally and it seems to be applied to this revival of Johnny English's action-comedy spool franchise, which originated with Johnny English back in 2011 and reborn with Johnny English back in 2003.
Will we be self-deprecating on the issue of how we certainly consider it nonsense to talk about the nation's new export opportunity?
Johnny English, with a pop approach and a rubber face at any rate, has his license to re-create basic things - which is much more famous than anything else by just his name. The people who are indifferent to those areas have a wide range of commonalities.
They are definitely the Daft Secret Agent who managed to showcase Mr. Bean's Dash Clouseau in spite of his bizarre glamour in Smoothie Glamour and there is a dollop for the chap who won the 2012 Olympic Open in London.
They are originally travelers and are the International Man of Secrets Atkinson whose role was forgotten in the Barclaycard TV ads except for the Chaos of Wake.
You only get to see one or two good scenes in this new JE outing.
I liked Johnny English enough to go in a helicopter wearing a medieval suit of armor and wrap the rotor blade on his helmet.
Doing physical comedy on the screen is a kind of gift for Atkinson, but laughter came very little and seemed a strange kind of semi-finished, especially the "best" movie brand like 007 and Mission Impossible itself as a component of the comedy. Made with complete confidence
Laughter comes as if comedy is not for adults but for children, and Johnny English's strange misunderstandings are not at all tolerable to me and I've liked Bean more in Atkinson's silent-film.
What has always been relevant here is that there is a serious crisis in the UK.
A cyber-hacker has hacked Britain's most secret network of spies, identifying all of Britain's working agents on the network that could affect the agent's work - this is a sad event for Kevin Alden.
This is the last resort for the fabulous and rather troubled Prime Minister, they are already struggling with many political and unpopular problems: this quasi-Teresa-Me character can play Emma Thompson well, but this script is not scripted to work on
Her intelligence advisers told her that having made an agreement with every employed spy, she would have to bring someone who has retired.
In this way it meant that Johnny English would have to fight himself, who is now a school master at a posh institute, but how an undercover operative should be different from the record is to work on it: it has some good humor stories, as well, is a rock-type academy by the spy.
The Englishman has been sent back to the emergency Whitehall for briefings and Ben Miller's replayed role has been mixed with his rather old-fashioned sidekick bof.
Now that Bof is married, he is eager to become a submarine commander, his role is of Jolly-Hockey-Sticks in which wiki paperdine has not been jammed.
Therefore, in his Majesty's secret service, Batman and Robin find some very big mistakes when they confront Olga Crullenko's beautifully-famed Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister comes into danger in the face of that charismatic tech billionaire who claims to have a solution to Britain's computer crises: the sinful Jason Volta played the role of Jake Lacey.
The English and the Bugs make their own odyssey of the Fairy Tales High-jinx. The English make their own odyssey of the Fairy Tales High-jinx: the Waiter sets fire to a French restaurant while working as a waitress; they smuggle through the expensive boat of the Volta; and the English make their own odyssey of the Fairy Tales High-jinx.
The film is certainly drawn everywhere for that last sequence, but still it's fine-tuned and entertaining, there are quite amusing things for kids throughout the film.
It's a medium-sized.
Also, as I saw in the other Johnny English films, in this film I didn't understand whether Rowan Atkinson should be given a role in the British film industry that really is according to his talent?
Labour has denied that he plans to work only four days a week for the British people, but the money will come in five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering becoming a democratic plan, in which British residents will have to work only four days a week - but the money will be met by five days.
The party allegedly wants the company's owner to give the workers a share of the savings made through the Artificial Intelligence (AI) revolution, so that they can get an extra day's leave.
This will give the employee three days a week leave - but still they will be able to get the same salary.
Sources say such an idea will remain 'grown up' with the party's economic agenda and it plans to benefit the country's workers.
The Trade Union Congress is promoting a four-day shift per week so that workers can take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior employee of the Labour Party told The Sunday Times: "Policy review is likely to be announced before the end of the year.
"This will not happen overnight, but it is expected to start the four-day work week, which is in line with the party's overall industrial strategy as well as the party's approach to rebalancing the economy in favour of the workers."
While the four-day working week of the 2017 general election campaign is being held by the Green Party, the Labour Party will not be the first party to support such an idea.
However, this desire is not being fully supported by the Labour Party at present.
"""Four-day work week is not party policy and is not being considered by the party,"" a Labour Party spokesperson said."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell had used last week's Labour Conference to introduce his approach to the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said that he is determined to regain power in utility firms from the "faceless directors" and the "munafakhhors."
Shadow Chancellor's plans also mean that existing shareholders in water companies cannot get their full share back because the Labour government can 'cut' on the basis of alleged wrongdoings.
He also confirmed plans to create an inclusive ownership fund to include employees in the company's boards and to assign 10 per cent equity of private sector firms to employees, which can receive an annual dividend of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsay Graham, John Kennedy tells "60 Minutes" if the FBI's investigation of Cavanaugh could change his mind
The FBI's investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Cavena delayed his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least a week, and the question arises whether the Bureau's findings helped a Republican senator withdraw his support.
In an interview aired on Sunday, "60 Minutes" reporter Scott Pele asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if there was a chance the FBI would find something that would prompt them to change their minds.
Kennedy came to look more open-minded than his colleagues in South Carolina.
"Well, I think so," Kennedy said.
"I said that I spoke to Judge Cavanaugh during the hearing.
After that happened, when the charge came up, I called them, asking, 'Did you do that?'
They were sure, steadfast, clear."
However, Graham's vote seemed to be the line of stone.
"I had made up my mind about Brett Cavena and it needed explosive accusations," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett refused in a powerful way," Graham said, citing Kristin Blacy Ford.
"And whatever they called it, it could not be verified."
It is 36 years old.
I don't see any new changes."
What is the Global Citizens' Festival and has it reduced poverty?
This Saturday, New York, will host the Global Citizens Festival, which is an annual music event featuring many extremely influential stars, and equally influential is its mission; to end the world’s poverty.
Now in its seventh year, in the Great Lawn of Central Park at the Global Citizens Festival, not only will tens of thousands of people come to enjoy artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardy B and Shawn Mendes, but also will make Kadha Kahta Kahta extremely poor by 2030.
Starting in 2012, the Global Citizens Festival, an extension of the international advocacy group, is the Global Poverty Project, which hopes to end poverty by actively increasing the number of people fighting against it.
To get free tickets to the program (except when you are not ready to pay for VIP tickets), attendees at the concert will be able to become volunteers to help create awareness of their goal of eradicating poverty, send e-mails to one of the world's leaders, such as "switches, phone calls, etc."
But how successful has the global citizenry been in the remaining 12 years to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people through a free music program the right way to persuade people to call for action, or is it just another case of so-called "cliticism" - people feel like they're signing up for an online petition or sending a tweet really matter?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has said it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters while advancing efforts for various goals.
It says these actions have helped global leaders to announce commitments and policies equal to more than $37 billion set to impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements generated from its actions, of which at least $10 billion are already distributed or are to be fund-raised.
The group estimates that the safe fund has had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world so far.
Some key commitments include, The Power of Nutrition, a U.K.-based partnership of investors and executives, which has helped the county to end malnutrition by delivering $35 million to Rwanda after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from global citizens.
"With the help of the UK government, donors, national government, and global citizens like you, we can make history's footnote to the social injustice of malnutrition," said Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ulman during a live concert in London on April 2018.
The group also said that calling on the U.K. to improve nutrition for mothers and children, after more than 5,000 actions, the government announced funding for a project called Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition intervention.
In response to a frequently asked question on your website, “Why do you think we can erase extreme poverty?”
Global Citizen responded: "It will be a long and difficult way - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, just like the great civil rights and anti-discrimination movements before us, we will succeed, because together we are more powerful.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardy B, and Janel Monay are among some of the performers at this year's event in New York, hosted by Debra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. may use the navy for "blockade" to create barriers to Russian energy exports - Interior Secretary
Citing the Washington Examiner, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke revealed that Washington could rely on the U.S. Navy "if necessary" to stop Russian energy in U.S. markets, including the Middle East.
Zinke alleged that Russia's work in Syria - especially where it is operating at the invitation of the legitimate government - is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
He allegedly said that "I think the reason for their presence in the Middle East is because they want to broker energy, as they have done in southern Europe, Eastern Europe."
And, according to the official, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"The United States has the ability with our Navy to ensure that maritime routes remain open, and, if necessary, blockade, so as to ensure that their energy does not enter the market," he said.
Zinke was addressing attendees of the event hosted by a nonprofit group, the Consumers Energy Alliance, who called themselves the "energy consumer voice" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approach to dealing with Russia and Iran, saying that they are effectively the same.
Referring to Russia as "a tricky tatoo" with a fossil-fuel-dependent economy, he said, "In the case of Iran and Russia, economic alternatives, virtually, are taking advantage of and replacing fuel."
The Trump administration, replacing Russia, is on a mission to promote exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe as the cheapest option for European consumers.
To that extent, officials of the Trump administration itself, including US President Donald Trump, tried to persuade Germany to pull out of the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, according to Trump, who has made Berlin a “blockade” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion North Stream 2 pipeline, which is set to double the existing pipeline capacity from 110 billion cubic meters, is purely an economic project.
Kremlin argues that Washington's widespread opposition to the project is motivated only by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
After meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said, "I believe we share the idea that energy cannot be a means of pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers."
Germany has opposed the U.S. stance, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's industry-leading organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has urged the US to stay away from the EU's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
The head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), Dieter Kemp, said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin, "When a large state interferes with our energy supply, I am overwhelmed.
The Massachusetts senator said Elizabeth Warren would "seriously consider" the possibility of joining the presidential race in 2020.
Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would "seriously consider" running for president after the midterm elections.
During a town hall in Holloway, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider taking part in the race.
According to The Hill, "It is time for women to go to Washington and join our broken government and that includes being a woman at the top."
"After November 6, I will seriously consider fighting for the presidential election."
While evaluating President Donald Trump during the town hall, Warren said, "They're taking this county in the wrong direction.
"I am completely concerned from the inside about what Donald Trump is doing for our democracy," he said.
Warren, Trump and their Supreme Court candidate Brett Cavanaugh have been vocal in their criticism.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "Of course we need to investigate the FBI before the polls."
However, a poll released on Thursday showed that most of Warren's constituents don't think they should contest the 2020 election.
According to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe Poll, eighteen percent of Massachusetts' "potential" voters said that the senator should not contest the election.
Thirty percent supported such an election.
The survey showed more support in the case of contesting by former governor Deval Patrick, where 38 per cent supported potential participation in the election race and 48 per cent were against it.
Other high-profile Democratic names discussed to potentially contest the election by 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would be making an official decision by January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin cites Palin's PTSD at Donald Trump rally
26-year-old Track Pauline spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in the military in September.
He was arrested in a domestic violence incident on Monday night.
In a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma, he said to the audience, "My son is going through a period that he feels after he's come back, because of what I'm feeling to other families, who are feeling the impact of PTSD, who are coming back, who are feeling the impact of PTSD and who are killing us.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said of his son and other retired soldiers, "They come back with a little change, they come back hard, they come back thinking whether it is honor for him who has been his fellow soldiers and aircraft-managers."
According to a spokesman for the Vasila police department, Dan Bennett, he was arrested Monday in Vasila, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence and drug abuse against a woman.
18 states, D.C. support the challenge of new asylum policy
Eighteen states and Colombian districts are supporting a new U.S. policy of legal challenge that refuses to shelter victims fleeing gangs or victims of domestic violence.
NBC News reported that representatives of 18 states and districts filed a justice-friendly summary in Washington on Friday to support a refugee who challenged the policy.
The full name of the plaintiff has not been disclosed in the Grace vs. Sessions suit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy.
He said his partner "and his violent gang members' sons" abused him, but U.S. officials rejected his request to give asylum on July 20.
He was detained in Texas.
Prosecutors supporting Grace described Al Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala as nations facing widespread problems of gang and domestic violence, which generate large numbers of applicants for U.S. refugees.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a 2014 ruling by the Immigrant Appeal Board that allowed unorganized immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Attorney General Carl Resin of the District of Columbia said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law."
"The federal statute expects that all asylum claims should be judged on the basis of the particular facts and circumstances of the claim, and such obstruction violates that principle," the justice friend said.
The attorney further argued in the summary that the policy of denial of admission of immigrants, saying it harms the U.S. economy, is more likely to become an entrepreneur and to "supply the necessary labor."
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to provide shelter to victims of domestic abuse and mass violence in June.
In his June 11 policy announcement, Sessions said, "Refugee is available for those who leave their homeland because of persecution or fear due to membership of their race, religion, nationality or a particular social group."
Asylum was never meant to alleviate all the problems - even all the serious problems - that people around the world face every day.
Rescue efforts in Palu have doubled the number of deaths in the race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation was very serious.
"It sounds extremely stressful," said 35-year-old Resa Kusuma, comforting the fever-stricken child in the exhaust centre of the Tehsa-Nahas Palu city.
"Every minute an ambulance brings bodies.
Clear water is rare."
Residents were seen returning to their abandoned homes, picking up flooded goods, trying to save whatever was found.
Hundreds of people were injured in the quake of magnitude 7.5 and the hospital drowned.
Some of the injured, including Dwee Haris, who were facing broken backs and shoulders, rested outside Palu's military hospital, where patients were being treated outdoors due to sustained strong earthquakes.
The tears flowed into his eyes as he felt the violent quakes in his fifth-floor hotel room shared with his wife and daughter.
"We didn't have time to save ourselves.
I think, I was crushed in the ruins of the wall," Harris told the Associated Press, as well as telling that his family was in town for the wedding.
"I heard my wife crying for help, but then silently.
I don't know what happened to him and my son.
I hope they are safe."
U.S. ambassador accuses China of 'threat' over 'promotional advertisements'
A week after running a four-page ad in a U.S. daily newspaper, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of spreading propaganda using the U.S. press, citing the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade.
U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday accused China of trying to interfere in the November 6 congressional elections - Iowa's best-selling newspaper - of paying tribute to Des Moines's record-setting China Daily, citing
Trump's allegation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the U.S. election, U.S. officials told Reuters that there was a new stage in Washington's campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is common to advertise to foreign governments to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently involved in such a growing trade war that they have seen rounds of imposing tariffs on each other's imports.
Chinese and U.S. experts say China's retaliatory tariffs were designed to hit exporters in states like Iowa in the first trade war, which supported Trump's Republican Party.
Terry Branstead, a longtime U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, the chief exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had hurt U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstead wrote in Sunday's Des Moines Register that "China is now doubling that bullying by running advertising in our own independent press."
"In its propagation, by providing advertisements paid in the Des Moines Register, the Chinese government is taking advantage of America's nurtured tradition of free speech and free journalism," Branstead wrote.
"Given that the media is locked in the strong fist of the Chinese Communist Party, on the contrary, here at the newsstand on the side of the road in Beijing, you will find limited dissatisfied voices and no correct reflection of those inconsistent opinions will be visible to the Chinese."
He said that "one of China's most important news-papers prevented him from apologizing for the proposal to publish his article", though he did not give the name of the news-paper.
With Cavanaugh's defeat, Republicans are isolating female voters before midterm elections, analysts warn
As top Republican Supreme Court candidates facing multiple allegations of sexual harassment are supporting and defending Brett Cavanaugh, the analyst has warned that they will see a reaction during the upcoming medieval elections, especially from women.
The sentiments around it are quite overwhelming, and most Republicans are already showing on record that they want to move forward with the vote.
There is no going back on those things," Grant Reher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University, told The Hill for an article published on Saturday.
Rihar said he suspected that the last-minute pressure by Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) would be enough to calm angry voters for an FBI investigation.
According to a Washington D.C. newspaper, a senior adviser to the progressive group MoveOn and national spokeswoman Karin Jean-Pierre said on Friday, "Women can't forget what happened yesterday - neither in Ain tomorrow nor in November."
On Friday morning, when the Republicans controlling the Judiciary Committee wanted to move forward with Cavena's nomination despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blacey Ford, protesters in the Senate hall shouted, "November is coming!"
A non-political analyst, Stu Rothenberg, told the news site, "Democratic enthusiasm and motivation is going to go away from the chart."
“People are saying it’s already awesome; it’s true.
But it could be more, especially among women voters from suburbs and 18-to-29-year-old young voters, who often don't vote when the president doesn't like it."
While describing in detail the allegations of sexual harassment by Ford against the nominee of the Supreme Court, analysts had already said before the public testimony that there is a possibility of opposition if the Republicans move forward with confirmation.
According to NBC News, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, Michael Steel, said, "This has become a messy mess for the GOP."
"It's not just about the committee vote or putting the last vote or the cave on the bench, it's also about the case of how the Republicans handled it and how they treated them," said Dee Dee Dee Dee, a deputy from Dee Dee Dee's constituency.
However, Americans seem somewhat divided in this case as to who to believe in in view of Ford and Cavanaugh's testimony, most of whom took the Cavanaugh's side.
A new YouGov survey found that 41 percent of respondents believed Ford's testimony was certain or potentially, while 35 percent said they believed Cavanaugh was certain or potentially.
In addition, 38 percent said they felt that Cavanaugh had probably or certainly lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford as well as, at least another indictee, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Cavanaugh had beaten him intoxicated at the age of 17.
Ramirez alleged that the Supreme Court nominee displayed his genitals when he joined a party while reading in Yale in 1980.
The inventor of the World Wide Web is planning to launch a new Internet instead of Google and Facebook
The inventor of the World Wide Web, Tim Burns-Lee, has launched a startup that wants to hit Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company that builds Burners-Lee's open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people will be allowed to access which information.
In a special interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt is to achieve "world domination."
"We have to do it now," he said of the startup.
"This is a historic moment."""
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data store" or POD.
It may include contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music libraries, and other personal and business tools.
It’s as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available on one browser and at the same time.
The unique thing about personal online data stores is that it entirely depends on the user who can access what kind of information.
The company calls it "personal empowerment through data."
According to the company's CEO John Bruce, Inrupt's idea is to bring the company the resources, process and appropriate skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently includes a security platform purchased by Burners-Lee, Bruce, IBM, a community of on-staff developers contracted to work on the project, and volunteer coders.
As of this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized app using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Burns-Lee said he and his team were "not talking to Facebook and Google about whether or not to initiate the whole change, where all their business models will end overnight."
"We are not asking permission from them."
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Burns-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "mission is to provide commercial energy and ecosystems to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid.
In 1994, Burns-Lee changed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the net neutrality debate.
Even at the launch of Inrupt, Burns-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic for this next era of the web," Burns-Lee said.
Bernard Von: WW1 celebrates the celebration of the Victoria Cross cleric
The 100th anniversary of the only Church of England's clergy to win the Victoria Cross as a warrior during World War I was celebrated in their home town.
Lieutenant-Colonel Reverend Bernard Von won this award in the September 29, 1918 attacks in Belengues and Lehigh Court.
However, they were killed by a sniper four days later and they never knew that they had won the supreme British military honor.
The monument stone was unveiled by his two ships at a parade held in Rashdan, Northamptonshire on Saturday.
One of his offspring, Michael Vonn, said it was "beautifully symbolic" that the show was being unveiled just 100 years after his grandfather won the award.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Von led his battalion in Canal de Saint-Quentin "amidst a very dense fog, heavy firing on the battlefield and under machine guns."
Later they moved towards the firing line and, with "great bravery", led the military-row before taking the field-gun alone in hand and dismantled three pieces.
On October 4, 1918, just a month before the end of the war, Lieutenant Colonel Von was killed by a German sniper.
72-year-old Michael Vonn said that his grandfather's actions "were something that I know he can never equal, but that we feel hurt about."
He and his brother Dr. James Vonn also performed after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vonn said he "feels very honored to play the role in the parade" and said "the support given by many people is demonstrating the bravery of a real hero."
MMA fans were up all night to watch the Bellator 206, but instead they found the Peppa Pig
Imagine, you woke up all night to watch the bulldog-filled Bellator 206, but were deprived of watching the main show.
San Jose's bill had 13 matches, including six on the main card and being shown live all night on U.K. Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., as Geggard Moussassi and Rory McDonald were preparing to face each other, viewers in the UK were stunned by the shift to Peppa Pig.
Especially after waking up to the match in the morning, some were extremely disappointed.
A fan on Twitter described switching to children's cartoons as "a kind of sick joke."
Asked about the broadcast, Belator's senior vice president Dave Schwartz said, "This material was not suitable for 6 a.m. according to government regulations, so they had to switch to children's programming."
"""Papa the Pig,"" yes."
Scott Cocker, president of the Bellator company, said they will work on their schedule to include UK audiences in the future.
"From my point of view, when I think about replay, I think we'll probably find a solution to it," Cocker said.
"But then there will be six o'clock on Sunday morning and we will not be able to work on it Sunday, our time, their time until Monday.
But we are working on it.
Believe me, there were a lot of text movements going on when this change took place and they weren't all favorable.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it was a technical failure.
But it wasn't, it was a government issue.
I can promise you this won’t happen next time.
We'll keep it limited to five matches instead of six - as we usually do - and when we tried to deliver something more to the fans, it became something more.
This is an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Disk: Tom Daily felt 'innocence' in the case of sexuality
Olympic divers Tom Daily says he was overwhelmed with a low emotion towards everyone because of his sexuality - but it inspired him to succeed.
The 24-year-old Daily said he didn't realize until he got into high school that "everyone isn't like me."
Speaking on Radio 4 Desert Island Disc, first presented by Lauren Laverne, she said she talks about gay rights to give others "hope."
She also said she was less concerned about winning the Olympics when she became a father.
Regular host of the long-running show, Kirsty Young has taken several months off due to illness.
On appearing as a sociable person in Laverne's first show, Daley said she was feeling "less" about herself than anyone else because "likeing boys and girls was socially unacceptable."
"Even today, those feelings of feeling inferior to others, and feeling different, are real things that have given me the strength and strength to be able to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was also "special," he said, so he wouldn't disappoint everyone when he finally found out about his sexuality.
The two-time bronze Olympic medal winner has become a high-profile LGBT promoter and used his presence at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to lesbians from more countries to reduce homosexuality.
She said she spoke openly because she felt lucky to be able to live openly without any hassle and she wanted to give "hope" to others.
The three-time world champion said a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - when he fell in love - "I was surprised."
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than her, but she said the age difference was never an issue.
"When you go through so many experiences at such a young age" - she had gone to her first Olympics at the age of 14 and her father died of cancer three years later - she said that at such a young age she was going through a flurry of similar experiences. To someone who had passed through a flurry of humour
In June, the couple became parents to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daily, and Daley said his "whole attitude" had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, it would have all been related to 'I need to win a gold medal'," he said.
"You know, there are a lot more things than Olympic gold medals.
"My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."""
His son is named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 after being diagnosed with brain cancer at the age of 40.
Daley said his father did not admit that he was going to die and the last thing he wanted to know was whether he had gotten tickets to London 2012 - because he wanted to sit in the front row.
She said, "I couldn't tell them you wouldn't stay in the front row, Dad."
He said, "When they could not breathe, I held their hand and held them until their breath stopped and they were dead, so I went and found that they were not innocent."
The following year, Daley took part in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
"All I knew was that this is what I dreamed of all my life - diving in front of the native crowd at the Olympics, there was no better feeling than that," she said.
This also inspired his favorite first song - Proud Bye Heather Small - which was resonating with him during the preparations for the Olympics and which his rugs still stand by listening to.
Desert Island Disc will air on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Out-of-form Michaelson out of the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickleson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Rider Cup match, but he will have to change his form to save it from becoming a unfortunate milestone.
Playing in the biennial event for the 12th time for the record, Michaelson was put out of the game for Saturday's foreballs and for the fours by captain Jim Furrick.
Instead of becoming a hub of attraction, as he has often been for the United States, the five-time major winner spent his day living among cheerleaders and working in the hope of improving the weaknesses of his playing style.
Never driving straight to the extreme even at the end of his career, the 48-year-old player Tight Lee was not the ideal fit for the Golf National Course, where long-time inactives are regularly punished for wrong shots.
And where the course is not so easy, in Sunday's ninth match, Michaelson will face British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has played alongside Ruckie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of his matches this week.
If the U.S. starter starts four points down in 12 singles matches, then Michaelson's match could prove to be quite significant.
Furyk trusted his man, not that he could say anything else.
"They fully understood their role, squeezed my back and wrapped me around in their arms and said they would be ready tomorrow," Furick said.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is a Hall of Famer and he has contributed a lot to these teams in the past and this week.
I probably didn't want to play two games.
I had imagined more, but it worked the way and the way we thought we had to move forward.
He wants to go out there like everyone else."
Michaelson will break Nick Faldo's record for the most-played Rider Cup matches on Sunday.
This rider cup could mark the end of a career that has never touched the heights of their personal record.
Michaelson has won 18, 20 defeats and seven halves, though Furik said his presence brings some intimacy to the team.
"He's funny, he's figurative, he's responsive, he likes to fly people's jokes, and his presence in the team room is special," he explained.
"I think the young players also enjoyed going to them this week, which was a lot of fun to see.
He gives a lot besides just playing."
Europe's captain Thomas Byron knows that the big bang could soon disappear
Thomas Byron, the European captain, knows from his experience that a fairly large margin in the last-day singles in the Rider Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable move.
Dan made his first appearance in a 1997 match in Valledoria, where a side under Sev Ballesteros had scored a five-point lead over the Americans, but with a win of 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2, taking the lowest margin, just reached the finishing line.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a big lead in Valderrama; we had a big lead in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderrama, we just got the win," he said at the 2018 class on Friday 5-3 and yesterday at the Golf National, thinking about the 10-6 lead, just after looking at the lead,
So history will show me and all the people of that team that it's not over.
You'll pay the full price tomorrow.
Get out there and do all the right things.
It doesn't end until you get points on the board.
We have a goal, and that is to try to win this trophy and that is where to keep the focus.
I have always said, I focus on the 12 players who are on our side, but we are well aware that the world's greatest players are on the other side."
Bjorn went on to explain how his players performed on the tough golf course: "I will never be able to get ahead of myself in this.
Tomorrow is a different hard time.
There will be a personal show tomorrow, and that's a different matter.
It's great to go there with a partner when everything's going well, but when you get out there personally, your full potential as a golfer is tested.
This is the message that you need to reach out to the players to show off your best tomorrow.
Now, you leave your partner behind and he has to go and he has to give his best performance too."
Unlike Byron, the opposing Gym Furyk would have been looking for better performance for their players personally than he did as a partner, with the exception of Jordan Spith and Justin Thomas, who scored three out of four points.
Before facing defeat due to Europe's display of "miracles in Medina", being part of the winning team in Brooklyn, Furyk himself has been on both ends of those great final days of revenge."
"I remember every flick of it," he said in response to a question about how Captain Ben Craneshaw handled his players last day in 1999.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you'd like to start as fast as you saw in Brooklyn, as you saw in Medina.
When this speed is one-sided, it puts a lot of pressure on the matches between them.
We set up our line-up on our own and involved people like this, as we felt, you know, we're trying to do something more miraculous tomorrow."
Thomas has been assigned the task of leading the retaliatory attack with Rory McLaren in the top match, where Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Rehm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Paulter are the top half of the other European order.
"I grouped them in this order because I think it covers everyone," Bjorn said of his single selections.
Germany's new warship was postponed again.
New German Navy warships were supposed to be commissioned in 2014 to replace period-affected Cold War-era warships, but due to faulty systems and rapidly rising costs, at least next year will not be so, local media said.
According to a military spokesman, the commissioning of the "Reineland-Pfalz", which is the flagship of the brand new Baden-Württemberg-class warships, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019.
The ship was supposed to join the Navy in 2014, but the troubled issues after delivery affected the fate of the ambitious project.
Four Baden-Württemberg-class ships were ordered back in 2007 by the Navy to be brought in as a replacement for time-induced Bremen-class warships.
It is understood that they will feature an array of powerful cannons, anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles as well as some Stealth technologies such as low radar, infrared and acoustic division.
Other important features include a long maintenance period - it is possible to deploy the latest warships from native ports for up to two years.
However, the continued delay means that state-of-the-art warships - which could give Germany an opportunity for an electricity project abroad - will be delayed until the period of entry into service, Die Zen commented.
The Durant F125 warship was the headline butterfly last year, when the German navy officially refused to commission the ship and returned Blohm and Was Shipyard to Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to the ship's manufacturer after delivery.
Very few people knew about the reasons for the return, but the German media cited several important "software and hardware flaws" that rendered the warship useless when deployed on a war mission.
The software shortcomings were particularly important because the Baden-Württemberg-class ships would be operated by a crew of some 120 sailors - which is only half the manpower of the old Bremen-class warships.
In addition, it also emerged that the ship is dramatically overweight which reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
The 7,000-ton "Reinland-Pfalz" is considered twice as heavy as the same class of ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the defective hardware, the value tag of the entire project - including the training of the crew - is becoming an issue.
It is said to have reached <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion ($3.6bn) from the initial <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The problem of new warships, which became particularly important in light of recent warnings, is fastening on Germany's naval power.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's defence committee, admitted that the navy is actually "deployable ships are running out."
The official said the issue has become serious over time, as old ships were removed from use, but no replacement ships were made available.
He said none of the battleships of the Baden-Württemberg-class were able to join the navy.
The National Trust is listening to the secret life of bats
The purpose of the new research being done at a estate in the Scottish Highlands is to reveal how bats use the natural landscape in their hunting for food.
It is hoped that the findings will shed new light on the behaviour of unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study, conducted by scientists of the National Trust of Scotland, will follow the common and soprano pipestrels as well as the long-eared brown and Dobbanton bats in Weston Ross' Invervee Garden.
Special records will be placed at key locations around the property to track the activities of bats throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
The frequency of bat calls from expert sound analysis of all recordings and reveals what species are doing.
A map and report of the natural habitat will then be prepared for depiction on a detailed landscape-scale of their behavior.
Rob Dever, nature conservation consultant at NTS, hopes that the results will reveal which areas of natural habitat are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of natural-housing management tasks such as the construction of grasslands and how to maintain forestlands well for bats and other related species.
There has been a significant decline in bat populations in Scotland and across the U.K. in the last century
They are endangered by construction and development works, which affect the herds of birds and damage the natural habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, as some chemical treatments of flypapers and building materials, as well as an attack by pet cats, can also pose a risk.
Birds aren't really blind.
However, due to their hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching the prey.
They use a sophisticated eco-location technique to point out flaws and obstacles in their flight path.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
It has ten trained specialists, who regularly survey, inspect the bird's nests and sometimes save them.
The organization has established Scotland's first and only dedicated bat reserve in Dumfries and Galloway's Three Estates, home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
David Thompson, the estate manager, says the estate is the best place for him.
"We have a great area for bats here in Trivago," he said.
"We have old buildings, many old trees and all good natural-dwellings.
But there is so much about bats that is still unknown, so the work we do here and in other properties will help us understand what things they need to flee."
They stress the importance of checking bats before keeping them inside the properties as it is possible that the destruction of 400 females and infants by the unconscious maternity ward alone could destroy the entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass or disturb them or destroy their bones.
Elizabeth Farrell, a Scottish officer of the Bat Conservation Trust, has urged the public to come forward to help.
"We still have a lot to know about our bats and we still don't know how their population is growing about our many species,"" he said."
Ronaldo dismisses allegations of rape while lawyers file a lawsuit in German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has called the rape allegations against him "fake news" that people want to "promote themselves" using his name.
His lawyer is going to sue the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
Portugal and Juventus forward are accused of raping an American woman named Catherine Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Dere Spiegel said in a report on Friday that she allegedly paid the woman $375,000 to remain silent about the incident.
Addressing his 142 million followers in an Instagram live video after the claims were reported, 33-year-old Ronaldo called the reports "fake news."
"No, no, no, no, no.
What he said today is fake news," the five-time Ballon d'Or winner said in the camera.
"They want to promote themselves using my name.
This is normal.
They want to be popular by my name, but that’s part of their job.
I'm a happy person and everything is fine," the player said with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for those allegations, according to Reuters, which they have called "suspicious invalid reporting in the area of privacy."
Attorney Christian Shertz said the players would "demand compensation for moral damages in proportion to the severity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident is said to have taken place in June 2009 at a sweet spot at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
According to the papers filed in Nevada's Clark County District Court, after meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Meyorga allegedly returned to the player's room, where they allegedly raped him.
Meyorga claims that after the alleged incident, Ronaldo fell on his knees and told him that he is "99 percent" a "good person" whose "one percent" has disappointed.
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had had sex, but there was mutual agreement for it.
Meyorga also claims that she went to the police and also drew photos of her injuries in a hospital, but later agreed to an agreement out of court because she felt "terrified by retaliation" and she was "anxious about being publicly insulted".
The 34-year-old says she is now trying to terminate the agreement as her harassment has continued since the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and dealt <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million with Italian giant Juve this summer.
Brexit: The U.K. 'would regret losing the manufacturer forever'
Secretary of Commerce Greg Clark said the UK would "regret forever" if it loses its title as the world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit.
He said Toyota UK had told the BBC that if the UK left the EU, it would temporarily stop production at its factory in Bernstone near Derby.
"We need a deal," Mr. Clark said.
The Japanese carmaker said that in the event of a no-deal Brexit, border delays could have an impact on jobs.
The Burnstone plant - which makes Toyota's Oris and Avensis - produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the EU.
"I believe that if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, we will stop production at our factory," said Toyota's Managing Director Marvin Cook in Bernstone.
Other U.K. carmakers have expressed concerns about how trade will work across borders, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, leaving the EU without consent.
For example, BMW says it will shut down its mini plant for a month after Brexit in Oxford.
According to automakers, the main concerns are related to the risk of supply chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line runs on a "just-in-time" basis, in which parts of made-to-order cars arrive every 37 minutes from both suppliers in the UK and the EU.
If the U.K. leaves the EU on March 29 without a deal, there could be disruption at the border, according to the industry, which could result in delays and shortages of spare parts.
The company said it would be impossible for Toyota to keep inventory for more than a day at its Derbyshire plant, so production would be stopped.
Mr. Clark said that Theresa May's checkers plan for future relations with the EU "has been calibrated to avoid those checks on the border."
"We need a deal. We want the best deal that, in my opinion, can be enjoyed not only in the present, but which is also essential to gain this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's TUDE program.
"Not only Toyota but also other manufacturers have gotten proof that we should be able to fully continue the set of supply chains that have been extremely successful."
Toyota was unable to say how long production would stop, but in the long run, warned that the plant's competitiveness from the extra cost would be reduced and jobs would eventually go away.
Peter Sauvaliers, who has worked at Burnston for 24 years and is the founder of the United Association at the plant, said his members are extremely concerned: "In my experience, once these jobs go away, they never come back after the bid.
A government spokesman said: "We have advanced a precise and credible plan for our future relations with the EU."
According to the White House, Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again
The White House said Sunday that Donald Trump's deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein's high-profile meeting with Trump could be delayed for "one more week" as the Supreme Court's candidate Brett Cavena's fight continues.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating the Russian election interference, the relationship between the Trump aide and Russia, and the possible obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether or not Trump's deputy attorney general will be removed, and putting the freedom of the dollar at risk, this news has warmed Washington's rumours market for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of wiring up talks with Trump to record and remove the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday they went to the White House amid the news that they were going to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced on Thursday, which was then in the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he would "not like" the removal of Rosenstein but then delayed the meeting to avoid confrontation from that Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, in which Cavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blacey Ford, both testified
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI probe into allegations against Cavanaugh, delaying the Senate's full vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
Asked about the Rosenstein meeting, he said: "There is no date set for it, it may be this week, I can see that the eye can be pushed forward one more week in view of all the other cases going on with the Supreme Court.
But we will see and I always like to keep the press updated."
Some journalists have claimed that: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10.
The host, Chris Wallace, asked why.
Sanders said the lack of briefing was not due to interest in the "predictability" of TV reporters, although he said, "I do not disagree with the fact that they are magnificent."
He then suggested increasing direct contact between Trump and the press.
"""The president does more quiz sessions than any other president,"" he said, without citing evidence,"" we have seen those numbers."
There will still be briefings, Sanders said, but "if the press gets a chance to ask the U.S. president a direct question, it's better than talking to me."
We try very hard to do that and you have seen us do a lot in the last few weeks and when you can talk to the President of the United States he is going to take the place of the press talks."
When leaving the White House or attending open sessions or at a press conference with dignitaries, Trump regularly answers questions.

Secretary of Health NHS writes to EU workers in Scotland about fears of Brexit
The health secretary has written to the EU staff working in Scotland's NHS with a wish to express the country's gratitude and remain after Brexit.
Jean Freeman MSP sent a letter from the European Union to the UK less than six months after the withdrawal.
The Scottish Government is committed to meeting the cost of settlement status applications for EU citizens already working in its decommissioned public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: "During the summers, talks between the UK and the EU are continuing, moving towards the expected decisions this fall.
But the U.K. government is also advancing its preparations for a potential no-deal scenario.
I know it will be a time of great uncertainty for all of you.
That's why I wanted to reiterate now how much I value their contribution, regardless of the nationality of each staff member.
The European Union, and beyond, bring together valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve healthcare work, and benefit the patients and communities we serve. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Christiane Ambercrombie's emergency surgery after a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christian Ambercrombie, who lost 31-27 to Vanderbilt Commodore on Saturday, underwent emergency surgery after a head injury, said Mike Organ.
Tennessee state head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury took place just a little while before the blast.
"He came to the shore and just fell there," Reed said.
The trainers and medical staff put him on the stretcher and gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sidelines before taking him back for further evaluation.
An official from the state of Tennessee told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that the abdomen has been removed from surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris said "no details on the type/limit of injury are yet available" and the Tennessee state is trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, who is a red shirt sophomore, is in his first season with the state of Tennessee after moving from Illinois.
He scored a total of five tackles on Saturday before quitting the game, making his season a total of 18 tackles.
High stamp duty will be taken from foreign buyers when buying property in the U.K.
When foreign buyers buy property in the U.K., high stamp duty will be taken from them, which will be used to help homeless people under the new tori schemes.
This move will undermine the success of Corbin's campaign to attract young voters.
Increased stamp duty will be imposed on those who are not paying tax in the U.K.
The Treasury expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help homeless people
Preparations are being made to recover high stamp duty rates on purchases of properties from foreign buyers in the U.K. - which additional cash will be used to help homeless people, Theresa will announce today.
The move is seen as an attempt to undermine the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign, which attracts young voters with the promise of providing more affordable housing and targeting high earners.
The stamp duty increase will be imposed on non-paying individuals and firms in the U.K., with additional funds to boost the government's campaign to deal with those who are sleeping under uneven circumstances.
The surcharge - which is in addition to the current stamp duty, which includes two homes started two years ago and lease buyers, can be a maximum of three percent.
The Treasury is expected to grow to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of newly built London properties are bought by non-UK residents, leading to price increases and making it difficult for first-time buyers to step on the staircase of housing.
Many wealthy areas of the country - especially in the capital - have become "ghost cities" as the number of such foreign buyers is higher, spending most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after a call for a cut in stamp duty was made by Boris Johnson to help more young people build their first home.
He accused large construction firms of land-grabbing but not using them to boost property prices, and urged Ms May to leave quotas on affordable homes to fix Britain's "housing shortages."
Mr. Corbin has announced an attractive series of proposed housing reforms, including the end of rent control and "no-fault" disputes.
They want to give more authority to councils for the construction of new houses.
"Last year I said that I would dedicate my premiere to restoring the British dream - that life should be better for every new generation.
And that means repairing our scattered housing market.
The UK will always be open to those who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it’s not right that it’s just as easy for non-UK residents as it is for overseas-based companies to buy homes for hard-working British residents.
For many people, the dream of owning a house has become very distant, and the anger of sleeping in uneven circumstances is extremely real."
Jack Ross: 'My last ambition is to manage Scotland' . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
Federerland boss Jack Ross says his "final ambition" is to become Scotland's manager at some stage.
The 42-year-old Scott is repeating the challenge of reviving the North-East Club, which is currently in third place in the League One, and which is three points away from the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after guiding St. Mary's for the Scottish Premiership last year.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a B cap and that's just what it was," Ross told BBC Scotland's SportsSound.
"But I grew up seeing Scotland in Hampden with my father from childhood, and it's always been something that brings me back.
This opportunity will only come when I succeed in club management."
Ross' predecessors as manager of the Confederate include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardis, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keen, Gus Poitiers and Paul de Canio.
The former Eloi Athletic boss says he felt no hesitation in following such established names in such a large club, which had previously rejected the initiative of Barnesley and Ipswich Town.
"At the moment, the assumption of success for me can be based on whether I can return this club to the Premier League?"
Due to the structure and facilities of this club, it undoubtedly comes into the Premier League," he said.
"It's not an easy task to get there, but I'd probably see myself as a success here if I could get the club there."
As Dumberton's assistant boss and after spending 15 months in Harts' coaching staff, Ross's management career has only taken three years.
He then helped Aloe recover from the declining third-tier, and replaced St. Mary's with the declining edge of the championship title winners in the next season.
And Ross says they now feel more comfortable than the work done during their careers at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mary's and Hamilton Academy.
In the case of taking over the post of Aloa, he said, "It was probably a real crossroads."
"I really believed that management was more fitting for me than playing.
It seems odd because I did the right thing, made the right amount of money, and enjoyed some reasonable heights.
But it can be difficult to play.
You have to get a lot of things on a weekly basis.
I still pass through them in the case of job stress and pressure but everything seems fine in the case of management.
I always wanted to manage and now I’m doing it, it makes me feel the most comfortable in my entire adult life.”

The correct time for a pint is Saturday evening at 5.30 pm, found in the survey
Summer rushes have boosted Britain's struggling pubs, but it has put more pressure on restaurant chains.
The pub and bar group saw a 2.7 percent increase in sales in July - but downturns in restaurants were 4.8 percent below, the statistics showed.
Peter Martin, Business Council CGA, which compiles the statistics, said: "July also meant that the ratio of the Sunshine and England's expected participation in the World Cup was higher than that of the Sunshine in the last month of June and the percentage of those who followed the same pattern was 2.
The restaurant trade fell by 1.8 per cent in June and worsened in July.
The pubs and bars selling liquor performed the strongest with more preference than the restaurant.
Food-driven pubs also had to suffer damage in the sun, though not dramatically like restaurant operators.
It seems that people just wanted to go out for a drink.
Sales of drinks in all pubs and bars rose 6.6 per cent for the month, while food fell by three per cent.''
Paul Newman, leisure and hospitality analyst RSM said: "These results have continued the trend we've seen since the end of April.
The influence of weather and major social or sporting events becomes the biggest factor for sales in the outdoor market.
It’s no surprise that restaurant groups continued to struggle, though a drop of 4.8 percent year-on-year in sales, particularly due to current cost pressure, will be painful.
The weather of the long summer could not have been a bad time for food-material operators and time will tell whether the more moderate temperatures we have experienced in August will provide an extremely necessary relief."
In July, the increase in total sales in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 per cent, reflecting the slow pace of brand roll-out.
Coffee Peach Tracker UK tracks industry sales for the pub, bar and restaurant sector by collecting and analyzing data from 47 operating groups performing joint business of <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion, and it is the established industry benchmark.
One in five children has a secret social media account that they hide from their parents.
The survey shows that one in five children - some of whom are younger than 11 - have a secret social media account that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students found an increase in "Fake Insta" pages
The news has raised fears that sexual content is being posted.
Twenty percent of students said they have a "main" account to show parents
One in five children - some of whom are under the age of 11 - are creating social media accounts that they keep secret from adults.
In a survey of 20,000 secondary school students, "Fake Insta" accounts rose rapidly - a reference to the photo-sharing site Instagram.
The news has raised fears that sexual content is being posted.
Twenty percent of students said they operate a clear "main" account to show parents, while they also have a private account.
A mother who suddenly saw the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter found that a teenage girl in it was urging others to "rape me."
Research from independent schools conducted by Digital Aviation UK and The Headmasters' and Headmasters' Conference (HMC) found that 40% of children aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, half of which were accepted to hold private accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: "It's very disturbing that many teenagers are tempted to create a place online where parents and teachers can't find them."
Elidh Doyle will be a "Voice for Athletes" on the Scottish Athletics Board
Elidh Doyle has been elected to the Scottish Athletics Board as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the Governing Body.
Doyle is Scotland's most refined track and field athlete, and Chairman Ian Betty has described this move as a great opportunity for those guiding the sport to take advantage of his extensive international experience over the past decade.
Betty said, "Elidd has a lot of respect for the Scottish, UK and world athletics community and we are confident that athletics in Scotland will have a lot of benefits because of bringing them to the board."
Doyle said: "I am eager to work as a voice for athletes and I hope I can really contribute and help in guiding the game in Scotland."
In addition to his four Olympic gold medals, Americans who won the 200m and 400m races at the 1996 Atlanta Games and now who are regularly sponsored by the BBC, were unable to walk after a temporary ischaemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago today I had a trauma.
I can't walk.
The doctors said that time will tell if I will be well or not and to what extent I may be well.
It was an awful job, but to get completely well, to walk again and learn to practice flattery today!
Thank you for the messages of encouragement!"
Compared to mothers' cows by breast pump advertising, it created differences in people's opinion online
A breast pump company split online opinion by an ad that compares breastfeeding mothers to cows' milk by doubling.
To mark the launch of a product called "the world's first silent wearable breast bump," consumer tech company Elvie released a new funny music video-driven ad, in which the new pump gives mothers the freedom to express themselves.
Four real mothers dance to a song in a barn filled with cows' grass that includes some of the like sayings: "Yes, I breastfeed milk myself, but you don't see any tails" and "If you haven't looked, these aren't thin, these are my breasts."
The course continues: "Pump It Out, Pump It Out, IAM Feeding Dem Babies, Pump It Out, Pump It Out, IAM Milking My Ladies."
Whatever the case, the advertisement, which has been published on the firm's Facebook page, has caused online controversy.
With 77,000 observations and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed feedback from audiences, many saying it presents the dairy industry's "terrorism" in a light-hearted manner.
"Using cows to advertise this product is a very bad decision.
"They need to give birth just like us to be pregnant and give birth to milk, except that their babies are stolen from them only in the lunar days after giving birth," one wrote.
Elvie Breast Pump Fits Sensually Inside Nursing Bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment: "Obviously painful for both mother and baby.
But why not use them to advertise breast pumps for mothers who get the opportunity to keep their children?”
Someone else added: "What irrelevant advertising is."
Others defended the advertisement, one of which said that she found the song of that advertisement "humorous."
"I think that's a very good idea.
I would have had it, too, if I was still breastfeeding.
I've got the experience of being a cow.
This ad is a little odd, but I saw it the way it is.
One wrote that this is a great product."
The second commented: “This is a fun ad for mothers who pump (often in their workplace or toilet) and experience “cows” like that.”
This is not a promotional or decisive advertisement for the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women reported that they were dancing carefully pumping into their bra.
The concept behind this campaign is based on the knowledge that many women who pump breasts say they feel like they are a cow.
However, the Elvi pump stays well hidden, has no wire or tube and fits directly into a nursing bra, giving women the freedom to walk without pumping, catching their children and even going out.
The ECD in Ana Ballerina, Partner and Mother commented: "The Elve Pump is a revolutionary product, which deserves a thrilling and splendid launch.
By drawing parallels between women and dairy cows, we want to bring breast pumping and its challenges to the spotlight, displaying a sense of freedom in an entertaining and related way, which will bring a new pump.
This isn't the first time Elvis has been in the headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two children using the product, designer Martha Jacubosky, appeared to be catwalking.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border
The captured migrant children were spied on even when there was no change in relatively monthly border crossings, to some extent because the harsh curvature and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult to appoint children with sponsors.
Traditionally, the maximum sponsors themselves had appointed undocumented migrants and were afraid of putting their own ability to live in the country at risk by claiming them on any child.
The threat increased even more in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adults or senior members of the household would have to give their fingerprints and the data would then be shared with immigrant officials.
Last week, Matthew Elbens, a senior officer of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, submitted evidence to Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied to sponsor unmarried minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 per cent of those arrested do not have a criminal record already.
"About 80 percent of people who are either sponsors or members of the sponsor's household live illegally in the country and are the highest offenders.
So we continue to search for those individuals," Mr. Elbens said.
Demanding to prepare the children quickly, the authorities introduced new rules, according to which it was necessary to appear in court within a month of the children being caught instead of 60 days, which was the previous standard according to the sheltered staff.
Many people appear through videoconferencing calls instead of being personally presented to an immigrant judge to present their case for legal status.
Those who are deemed unfit to be released are immediately dismissed.
The longer the children remain incarcerated, the more likely they are to be battered or depressed, which may result in violent impulses or attempts to escape, according to the system's report of protection workers and in recent months.
Lawyers or advocates said those cases are taken to a high facility like Tornillo, where the indication that the child is struggling is ignored because of their size.
He also said that taking the children to the tent city without giving them enough time to be emotionally prepared or saying goodbye to friends would further exacerbate the shock they are already struggling with.
Syria urged the US, French and Turkish occupying forces to return immediately.
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid Al-Maoulam also asked Syrian refugees to return home, even when the war in the country was now in its eighth year.
Moalam, who also serves as a deputy prime minister, said that foreign military forces illegally live on Syrian soil under the pretext of fighting terrorism and "will be treated accordingly with them."
"They should be immediately and unconditionally withdrawn from the war ground," he told the assembly.
"The war in Syria is nearly over," he said, adding that more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and that millions of people have been uprooted from their homes.
He said that Damascus will continue to fight this "foreign war until we clear all Syrian areas of both the terrorist groups and the "presence of any foreigner."
The United States has some 2,000 military forces in Syria, mainly to train and advise both Kurdish and Syrian military forces in opposition to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 military forces on land in a country devastated by war.
In the case of the refugees, Moulam said that the circumstances were okay for him to return and he blamed "some Western countries" for "spreading fear of vanity," which prompted refugees to stay away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to simplify this return,"" he said."
"They were politicizing on a completely humane matter."
The United States and the European Union warned that Syria will not receive any assistance for rebuilding unless there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.S. politicians say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in the fortress of Idlib's final major uprising creates an opportunity to press ahead on political talks.
The Russian-Turkish deal or agreement averted a massive attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces in that province, where three million people lived.
However, Moulam said the agreement has a "clear time limit" and also expressed hope that military action will target jihadists including al-Qaeda-linked fighters on the Nusra front, which will be "deleted."
The representative of the United States, Stafán Di Mistura, hopes to hold the first meeting of a new committee with government and opposition members to prepare the post-war constitution to fix the path of Syria and elections soon.
Moalam placed certain conditions in the committee for the participation of the Syrian government, stating that the panel's work should be restricted to "review the articles of the current constitution" and give warnings against interference.
Why will Trump win in the second term?

External money has flooded in the strong middle class in the run-up to the Election House
It was not surprising that Pennsylvania was flooded with money or cash in the 17th, which was credited to the rebuilding of the Congress Mandate, causing two officials to appear for the same seat race.
Who recently opened the front for the Democratic rape lamb of suburban Pittsburgh district - who won his seat in the second district in the special election last spring.
The lamps were also included in the race for a second post, Republican Katherine Rothfuss, who currently represents the 12th district of Old Pennsylvania, which intersects with the new 17th.
Following this decision of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January in the case of unconstitutional misrepresentation in favour of the Republic by the old districts, maps or maps were rebuilt.
The empty-handed battle between the major financial weapons, the Democratic Campaign Congress Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC) in the new 17th race touched the economy of the campaign.
Lamb's name became quite prevalent in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory widely seen in the March special election of the 18th Congressional District of Pennsylvania.
For that reason, the Republicans had held that seat for nearly a decade and President Donald Trump had won that district by 20 points.
The political pandits provoked the democrats a little more.
U.S. to punish El Salvador for backing China, then backing back
The diplomats noted that due to Washington's resistance, the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing.
Mr. Trump held a fierce meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and stayed at a hotel in Panama until the Trump organization's management team fired the partners.
Earlier this month, Department spokesman Haider North said in a statement that state department officials on the "recent decision no longer to recognize Taiwan" made by U.S. diplomats from Al-Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama to return to the U.S. from the diplomatic mission
But only El Salvador was penalized, which received an estimated $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including narcotics control, development, and economic assistance.
The proposed penalties, which included cuts in financial assistance and targeting visa restrictions, would be painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
When progress was made in the internal meetings or meetings, North American and Central American officials postponed the high-level conference of RUSA in KU, which was attended by immigrants from the United Nations to KU, while focusing on security and economic prosperity similar to that of the previous year.
But by mid-September, top administration officials made it clear that they want the conference to move forward and effectively end while considering any punishment or penalty for El Salvador.
The politicians said that Vice President Mike Pence is now ready to address the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, in a sign of importing administrative spaces at the conference.
And three Americans from Washington returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any harsh message or punishment.
A White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate or controversy described by three U.S. officials, including two politicians, who agree to discuss internal considerations on the condition of not clarifying the name.
Their accounts have been confirmed by an external analyst who is close to the administration and also talks on the condition of not clarifying the names.
Study History
The next case could be Mr. Trump's Special Council's report on potential resistance to justice, of which there is now sufficient evidence in the public record.
At the same time, according to Mr. Mueller's report, change the direction of his investigation if Mr. Trump's campaign ties with Russia to invade our elections.
When Congress shakes hands, Mr. Trump finds himself accountable in that body, when he prepares himself again to go before voters and perhaps before a jury of his peers.
That is, a lot if or if and I mean not to give the signal or suggest that the collapse of Mr. Trump and his counterparts in Europe is not inevitable.
We all have options to choose on both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect how long the conflict can be.
In 1938, German officials were ready to make a move against Hitler, only if he was opposed from the West and supported by Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed, as a result of which we missed the opportunity to stop so many years of genocide.
The functioning of the historical center points around such discord points and the unacceptable march of democracy is accelerated or delayed therein.
Americans now face many of these divisive points.
If Mr. Trump's Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosentain, the person who controls the final outcome of Mr. Mueller's investigation, is fired from the job, what will we do?
Rosentain has been in this confusion ever since this paper reported it last year, suggesting he secretly keep the president's record and consider his ineptitude for the office.
Mr. Rosenstein said that the Times account is not accurate.
"If the F.B.I. investigation of recently requested Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair - or if he remains firm in the Supreme Court despite authentic allegations of sexual exploitation and false testimony, how will we respond?"
And beyond this, will we vote for the Congress in the medium term, for which Mr. Trump will be responsible?
If we fail in those investigations, democracy will continue to be built until the long winter.
But I think that because of the lessons I have learned in pregnancy, we will not fail.

Graham Dorn's Rangers are optimistic even after intense Vienna encounter
The Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that after an impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, defeating the Austrian people would put them in a strong position to qualify for Group G of the Europa League.
Knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Tournament from appearing for the first time in a session up to 2-2 with Villarial, but he believes Rangers could use that result as a springboard for bigger things.
"It was a good thing for us because Villariel was good," the 31-year-old said.
"We moved forward in the game with the belief that we can achieve something and come to a conclusion.
Maybe we can finally get it, but overall, the draw is likely to be a fair outcome.
They were probably better in the first period and we came out even better in the second period.
Moving on to Thursday, this is a second major European night.
Hopefully we can get three points but it will be a difficult game because they got good results with our back crowd or crowd in their previous game, I am sure we will play well and get positive results.
Whatever happened with my injuries and with the changes made in the club itself was certainly difficult last year but now there is a good experience in this place.
The squad is good and the guys are really enjoying it; they have gotten good training.
Hopefully now we can move forward and be successful, leaving behind our last session."
Women are losing their sleep because of the fear of retirement savings.
Despite the fact that survey participants clearly know what kind of care they need, some people were talking about it to their family members.
Nearly half of the individuals across the country said they were talking to their partner about long-term care costs.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them or take care of them, but they don't take any steps to negotiate," said Holly Cinder, vice president of life insurance business across the country.
Here is where to start.
Talk to your partner and children: You won’t be able to prepare to take care of your family if you don’t tell them your wishes in advance.
Discuss with your counselor and your family where and how to get care, as those options can be important factors in determining the cost.
Ask your financial advisor: Your advisor may also suggest ways to pay for those expenses as well.
Your delinquency options for long-term care include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid cash-value life insurance policy, to help pay for these expenses or to insure your own health. As long as you have
Introduce your legal documents: Make your legal battle easier.

Also, consider the attorney's right to inspect your finances.
You will choose a trusted person to make financial decisions for yourself and make sure your bills are paid if you are incapacitated.
Don't forget the little information: Imagine that your elderly parents have a medical emergency and are taken to the hospital.
So will you be able to answer questions related to their medications and allergies?
Put that information in a written plan so that you are ready.

A man has repeatedly fired bullets into the air in Lafraconb.
A man was shot several times by an air rifle when he was going home at night.
The 40-year-old victim was in Devon's Oxford Grove area when he was shot in the chest, stomach and hand.
Officials describe the shooting of the BST at about 02:30 as an "accidental incident."
The victim could not see his assailant.
His wounds were not so deep so the police appealed to him to become a witness.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
Officials said at least 384 people were killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami in the Indonesian city on Friday and the death toll is expected to increase further.
When communications were shut down, rescue officers were unable to obtain any information from the Dongala Regency, the northern region of Palu which is near the upper centre of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated in the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Dongala, located on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi Province, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017, located on the shore of a narrow bay on the west coast of the Sulawesi island.
When the earthquake and tsunami struck, the city was celebrating its 40th anniversary.
Dongala is a regency on the beach in the northwest of the Sulawesi island, spread over an area of more than 300 kilometers (180 miles).
The administrative province has an estimated population of 299 in the region below, which was 200 in 2017.
The main basis of the economy of the Central Sulawesi Province was fishing and farming, especially in the coastal areas of the Dongala.
Nickel mining is also very important in the province, but it is concentrated in Morovoli on the coasts opposite to maximum sulavazi.

Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eastern Alaska ruler and vice-presidential candidate, was arrested on charges of assaulting Sarah Palin's eldest son.
Vasila, 29, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, along with a report of domestic violence, according to a report released by the state of Alaska on Saturday.
According to the police report, when a woman acquaintance tried to call the police to report an alleged crime, she took the phone from him.
According to the KTUU report, Palin was sent back to the Moot-Su Pretrial facility as well as fined $500 for unsecured bonds.
The network's report said that he appeared before the court on Saturday, where he declared himself "not guilty" when asked about the argument.

At the same time, he is charged with a one-day prison sentence and a $2,000 fine under Class B offences.
This is not the first time that criminal cases have been registered against Palin.
In December 2017, he was convicted of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged assault.
The case is currently before the Court of Experienced Persons of Alaska.
In January 2016, he was accused of obstructing domestic violence, domestic violence reports and holding a gun while drunk in connection with the incident.

Federal prosecutors are demanding rare death penalty for suspects of NYC attack
Federal prosecutors in New York are demanding the rare death penalty for Safulo Sipov, suspected of a terrorist attack on the city of New York that killed eight people -- a virulent punishment that has been handed over to the state since 1953 for federal crime.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a home depot rental truck to attack pedestrians and cyclists down the Manhattan highway on the way to the west in October.
According to the information of intent to demand the death penalty imposed in the southern district of New York, in order to prove the death penalty appropriate, the prosecution has to prove that Sipov has "intentionally" beaten eight victims and "intentionally" killed them.
According to the court documents, the two countries are likely to impose the death penalty.
A week after the assault, a federal grand jury smashed Sipov with a knife for 22 charges, including eight murder charges for assisting in racketeering, which are specifically committed in cases of organized crime and in cases of violence and motor vehicle destruction
Prosecutors said the attack requires "enough planning and pre-conceived consultation," explaining the way in which Cypov executed it in a "disgusting, cruel and vicious" way.
"Safulou Habibulaivic Saipov by Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleves Enloir Dicat, Deren Drake, Ariel Elier, Hernán Ferruqui, Hernán Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Pág.
Five of the victims were tourists, who were from Argentina.
The death penalty case has been on trial for more than a decade in the southern district of New York.
Mulazim Khalid Bran was found guilty of murdering two drug suppliers but eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
In 1953, the New York federal case for Julius and <0xC3><0x86>thel Rosenberg was last sentenced to death, a married couple found guilty of conspiracy to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years ago.
Jones Rosenberg was sentenced to death by an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, a local resident of Uzbekistan, Saipov did not have any glans or regrets for days and months after the attack.
The police said that she told the investigators that she liked what she did.
Saipov told officials that he was motivated to attack after watching videos of ISIS encountering the crime on his phone.
Police said he also requested to show the ISIS flag in his hospital room.
He pleaded not to be convicted for the offence of 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Cypov, says they are "clearly disappointed" by the prosecution's decision.
"We think our decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting life imprisonment without any possibility of being released will only postpone the mental trauma of these events to include everyone," Patton said.
Saipov's defence team had earlier asked the prosecution not to demand the death penalty.
Tory MP says Nijel Phraaz should be appointed to be in charge of Brexit talks
Nigel Faraz swore to "gather an army of people" during the protests at the Tory Conference.
The Eastern UK leader asked politicians to "understand the environment" from Eurosceptics - because Theresa May's own MP suggested that she should negotiate with the EU.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bone told a March rally in Birmingham that if Mr. Farage was a Brexit secretary, Britain would have been 'expelled' by now.
But the challenges faced by Smt. Me in solving his highly divided rank have been underlined by Pro-Remen Tory to add a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is struggling to keep his checker agreement plan on track during the Brexiteers, remnants and attacks from the EU.
Colleagues urged him to try to compromise with Brussels rather than backlash - and force Eurosceptics and workers to choose between their package and the chaos.
Mr. Bone said leaving means leaving the rally at the Solihaal, in which he wants to 'throw the checkers'.
She suggested that Mr. Faraj should become a partner and be given responsibility for the dialogue with Brussels.
"If he was in charge, we would have gone out by now," he said.
Wellingborough MP or MP said: 'I will stand for Brexit but we need to get the checkers out.'
Setting up its opposition in the EU, he said: 'We don't need to be subject to anyone to fight a world war.'
We want to make our own laws in our country."
Mr Bon dismissed all the suggestions that changed public opinion after the 2016 vote: 'The idea that the British people have changed their minds and they want to stay is completely false.'
Tory's Brexiteer, Andrea Jenkin, said: "I'm just saying this: Prime Minister G, people are listening.
"Checker is not popular among the general public, the opposition will not vote for it because it is not so prevalent between our party and our activists who actually surround the streets and elect us in the first place.
Please leave the checkers and start listening.'
In a focused message to Smt, he said: Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they do not break their promise.
Mr. Fraj said that the leaders of the rally should be 'aware of the environment' if they cheat with the decision taken in the 2016 Referendum.
"This is now a matter between our people and our political classes,"" he said."
"They are trying to cheat on Brexit and today we have come here to tell them that 'We will not let you escape by doing so.'"
Speaking to enthusiastic crowds, he said: "I want you to create our political class, which is on the verge of deceiving Brexit while understanding the environment.
"We are organizing an army of the people of this country that has given us victory in Brexit and that will not rest until we become an independent, self-governing and proud United Kingdom."""
Meanwhile, the remnants march from Birmingham two hours before a rally in the middle of the city.
A group of activists pointed to the protests against the Brexit banner after the group's launch this weekend.
Labour Peer Lord Adonis appears to be negotiating for security issues with the party app at the opening of the conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can have appropriate IT systems and all the technology for Canada, the unresistance-free border and unrestricted free trade in Ireland.
"It's a complete swing.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit, he said.
Waran plans to take a 'strict look' at the President's operations
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will "keep a close eye on the president's operations" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that on Saturday, during a town hall in western Massachusetts, the Massachusetts Democrats or Democrats talked about their future.
President Donald Trump's regular critic, Warren GOP state nominee Geoff Diehl, is running for re-election in November, who was Trump's co-chair of the 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
They were being pushed to take Trump's place in 2020.
It was his 36th meeting with voters using the Town Hall format since Trump took charge of the office on Saturday afternoon in Hollywood.
One of the attendees asked if he was going to join the presidential race.
Warren responded that now is the time for "women to go and fix our broken-footed government and include women first."
LSU Sim's death has been confirmed.
Police on Saturday announced that a suspect in the murder of LSU basketball player Wade Sim was arrested on Friday in Baton Rouge, LA.
The Bethon Disease Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dayton Simpson at an ET news conference or conference at 11 a.m.

The Russian Grand Prix: Louis Hamilton finished the world title after the team's victory over Sebastian Vettel
From that moment it became clear that Valtteri Bottas deserves to play a major role in the Louis Hamilton Mercedes Team Order Race on Saturday.
From the pole, Bottas made a good start and knocked out Hamilton as he made his place in the first two turns and invited Vatel to create an obstacle in his team's drivers.
Vettel first went to the pits and left Hamilton in traffic behind the pack, something that should be decisive.
The Mercedes was behind a lap and came out from behind the vet but Hamilton went ahead after some wheel-to-wheel action that saw the Ferrari driver unwillingly leave without any risk after a double-move defending on the third corner.
Max Versteppen started from the back row of the grid and was in second place on reaching the end of the lap before his 21st birthday.
Then he moved on to a large part of the race when he focused on changing his tyre and quickly moved on from Km Raconen in fourth place.
He finally, came to the pits on the 44th lap but was unable to increase his speed in the remaining eight laps, when Reconen scored fourth.
It was a difficult day when Valerie did a great job all weekend and is a really great gentleman.
The team did a great job by getting one-two, Hamilton said.
It was really a very bad feeling.
President Donald Trump on Saturday lied to Senator Dean Feinstein at his request, failing to leak Christine Blacey Ford's letter in which he accused Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual exploitation.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the President did not address the statement made by Ford directly before the Senate Judiciary Committee, instead commenting on the Senate's current situation, saying that people are "moderate and evil and unfaithful."
"A very good thing or thing in the last few days in the Senate that can happen when you see anger, when you see angry, mean and bad and unfaithful people," he said.
"When you see releases and leaks and then they say, 'Hey, I didn't do it.'"
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Dean Feinstein, have you leaked?
His answer is remember... did you leak the document - "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't leak."
Well, wait a minute.
"We didn't leak, we didn't leak," he said, pointing to the senator.
Finstein was sent a letter describing the allegations made against Kavanaugh by Ford back in July and it was leaked in early September - but Finstein denied it had been leaked from the office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't leak his story," Finstein told the committee, Hill reported.
"He asked me to keep it confidential and I have kept it confidential as he said."
But the president did not find his rejection justified, who commented at Saturday night's rally: "I want to tell you that it was really a very bad mood.
Maybe he didn't, but I've rarely seen such bad moods before."
Continuing to defend the candidate of the Supreme Court, by whom three women have been accused of sexual abuse, the President said the Democrats were using the allegations on their behalf.
"They are prescribed to withdraw power by any necessary means."
You see their meanness, their dirt, and also that they don't care who they hurt or who they're running after to gain power or power or control," the arbitrator reported the president's words.
Elite League: Dundee Star 5-3 Belfast Giant
Patrick Dever scored two goals for the giant against Dundee
Dundee Stars won a 5-3 return match in Dundee on Saturday and offset the loss of the Elite League against the Belfast Giant on Friday.
Through attacks from Patrick Door and Francis Bouviller, the Giant initially got a two-goal lead.
Before Giant's lead, Mike Sullivan and Jordan took the home side level before re-establishing the Crown Diary.
Before securing a two-goal win by Lucas Lundwalt Nielsen, Francos Bossard equalized it for Dundee.
This was the third elite defeat of the season for Adam Keyfee's men, who came from behind to defeat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
With the Giant winning the last three matches, it was the fourth meeting of the session on the sides.
Dwyer's opener came in the fourth minute at 3:35 with the help of Candle McFall, in which David Ruddford helped Beauviller double the lead in the next four minutes.
In the busy initial period, Sullivan demonstrated his home game back at 13:10 before the equivalent of the county came at 15:16 of Matt Markudrat.
Door ensures that the Giants make an edge in the first pause until they set their second goal of the night at the end of the first period by him.
The domestic side is regrouped and the Bossard once again takes them to the level with a power play goal at 27:37.
Cowney and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen take the lead for the first time in the second period of the match and he secured his team's fifth win in the final period.
Giant, who had lost his last five matches so far, is now set to play at his home Milton Kane in his next match on Friday.
The air traffic controller was killed to ensure that hundreds of people could escape from the earthquake.
An air traffic controller in Indonesia has been hailed as a hero or hero since he was killed in ensuring that a plane carrying hundreds of people could be safely landed on the ground.
More than 800 people were killed and many more are missing after the tsunami struck on the island of Sulawesi on Friday.
Subsequent injuries in the area continued to ravage and many people were trapped beneath the rubble in the city of Palu.
But while his associates were fleeing to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung refused to leave his busy-controlled post at Mutiara Sis al-Zafari airport in Palu.
He remained there to ensure that Betik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could land safely.
Then he jumped from the traffic control tower, when he thought it was going to fall.
He later died in the hospital.
A spokesman for Indonesia's Air Navigation, Johannes Siratrat, said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, Australia's ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take them to a large hospital from another city.
Unfortunately, we lost them before we reached the pole of the helicopter.
"Our hearts were broken when we left," he said.
Meanwhile, officials fear that the number of deaths with the destruction of the country could reach thousands, the mining agency says access to Dongala, Sigi and Botonsh is limited.
"The death rate may still be rising as many bodies may still be squeezed into debris or debris, or in many places where it can't be reached," said Sutopo Nugheroho, a spokesman for the agency.
Waves of up to six meters in height devastated Palu, resulting in a mass burial on Sunday.
The military and commercial aircraft are providing support and supplies.
Reesa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute the embolic bodies were brought in.
It is rare to find clean water.
Everywhere, small markets were looted."
Jain Galfand, head of the International Red Cross, told CNN: "Indonesia is running a race to help Red Cross survivors, but we don't know what they'll get there.
It's already a tragedy, but it could be even worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's army: "I am asking you to work day and night to complete every task related to the withdrawal or evacuation of all of you.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
In Indonesia earlier this year there was a quake in Lobonk, in which about 550 people were killed.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini now says a man has been missing since Laguna plane crash
The airline operating the crashed plane in the Pacific Lagoon in Macedonia now says a man is missing when it was last reported that 47 passengers and crew or crew were safely removed from the plane by drowning.
Air Niugini said in a release on Saturday afternoon that it did not identify a male passenger.
The airline said it is working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to locate the man.
The airline does not immediately respond to requests for information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
While trying to land at Fault Island Airport when the plane fell into the water, local boats helped save other passengers and crew.
Officials said on Friday that seven people were taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers were in the hospital on Saturday and the condition of all of them is now stable.
The cause and event of the crash is unclear.
The airline and U.S. Navy said the two planes did not land on the runway properly.
Some witnesses or eyewitnesses thought that the plane did not land on the runway.
U.S. passenger Bill Jane said the plane had come a long way down.
Jane said, "It's a very good thing."
Jen said he and others were pulled out of the deep water by an emergency evacuation present on the plane while sinking.
He said the crew of the plane was terrified and screaming and suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said navigators working around to improve the ferry also helped rescue people by using an airboat to bring people to shore in nearly 30 meters (100 feet) of water before the plane sank.
Data from the Aviation Security Network indicates that 111 people were killed in the crash of a PNG-registered airline in the last two decades but none were involved in the Air New Guinea.
Analyst tells the time of night when the woman was burned alive
The prosecution on Saturday restored its case to prosecute a man on charges of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
The US Department of Justice analyst Paul Roulette presented evidence for hours as an expert witness in the field of investigative analysis.
She told the jury how she used the phone record to bring together the activities of 29-year-old Mulazim Quinton Teles and 19-year-old victim Jaisika Chamber on the night of her death.
Roulette said she received location data from several cell phones, which shows that the deceased was with Talis Chambers on the night of his death while denying his previous claims, The Clarion-Laser reported.
When the data shows that when he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, at the time his cell phone was near the cameras, police told Sanford.
Sanford came forward on Saturday and presented his speech and evidence that he was not in the city that day.
Asked if Tallis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "lies because his truck was in Nashville."
The second inconsistency was that Talis said he knew Chambers about two weeks before his death.
Cell phone records show that they had known each other for only a week.
Some time after the camera's death, Tallis has removed all the camera's text or message, call or contact information from his phone.
Hal said, "He wiped it out of his life."
The defense is ready to begin its closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he was expected to go to the jury for the trial on that day.

The other black man?!
NY Naini filed a lawsuit against the couple after firing a "racist" text
A New York Naini complains by a mother that she is "the other black person" after misleadingly texting, prosecuting a couple for sniping.
The couple deny property that they are resisting, suing for "abduction."
Linsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, finds out that new-born babysitter Giselle Maurice expresses her bachelorette, who was black on her first working day in 2016.
"No other black person," Ms. Plasco Flaxman told her husband in a text.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Ms. Morris twice.
According to a New York post, after realizing her oblivion, an "uncomfortable" plastic-Flaxman fired Ms. Morris, stating that her outgoing Naini, who was African-American, was doing a bad job and she had a philippine instead.
Ms. Morris was sent home to Uber after paying for her one-day work.
Now, Morris demands a $350 per day allowance to retire from work on the estate and for six months, however, he was appointed to start work at Live-in Gig without a contract.
"Look, I want to show them that you don't do anything like that," he said, explaining that "I know it's discrimination," he said in a post on Friday.
The couple said on the claims that they were racist, stating that after insulting him they could not trust him, it was appropriate to terminate Morris' employment.
"My wife sent me something that she didn't mean.
He is not a racist.
We're not racist people," the husband told the post.
But can you give your children into the hands of someone you have ever insulted, even if it happened by mistake?
"Your newborn child?
Let go, too."
Like the "abduction" trial, Plasco said his wife had only been pregnant for two months and she was in a "very difficult situation."
"Are you going after someone like that?"
It's not right to do that," the investment banker said.
While the legal case is still underway, there has been a quick reaction to convicting the couple on social media while silencing them for their behavior and reasoning.
Paddington publishers fear the reader won't add it to their own thoughts and opinions, new letter reveals
Bond's daughter, Karen Jenkel, who was born after the book was approved, said in the letter: "It's hard to think of putting someone in their place when they read it for the first time before it's published.
It's amazing to know about Pandington's success."
Regarding his father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before writing a children's book inspired by a small bear toy, he was optimistic about refusing to accept his work, he said in the 60th anniversary of the publication of his book after his death.
About Paddington, about whom she describes as "an important member of her family," she explains that her father was proud of her potential success.
"He was a calm man and was not at all proud," he said.
But because Pandington was so real to them, it was almost as if you had a child who gets something: you're proud of them, even if you're not really doing it.
I think they've seen Paddington's success that way.
Even though it was his imagination and composition, he always credited Paddington for it."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
Upon landing, his daughter was taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital of Nice, where the work done by doctors was wasted.
"Nad was regularly saying that it was really bad, he didn't expect that," Ms. Eden-Lapperous said.
"Nad then called me and told me that she was going to die in the next two minutes and I have to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you very much, son.
I will be with you soon.
I will be with you.
The medication that the doctors had given to beat her heart was slowly ending up leaving her system.
He had died a long time ago and it was all over.
I just had to sit there and wait, even knowing that it was all going to end.
I couldn’t do anything screaming, screaming or crying, because I was surrounded by the people of my family.
I had to take care of everyone."
Eventually, Ms. Eden-Lapurus, saddened by the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers - who were unaware of the situation they were going through.
"No one knows," he said.
"I put my head down and there were tears all the time.
It was hard to express, but I found a feeling of utter empathy for the nade on the plane.
He needed my love and understanding.
I know how much he loved her."
Postcards of women victims to prevent suicide on bridge
Two women who lost their loved ones to suicide want to stop others from losing their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphrey post cards and phone numbers on Wales' bridge with inspiring messages, on which people can call for help.
Mr. Davis' son was 13 years old when he suffered from depression and he committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel the way I feel every day," she said.
Mr Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said his son was an avid chef who spread his smile everywhere.
"Everyone knew him for his smile.
He always said that his smile could light up anywhere."
However, he had left work before he died and he lived in a "very dark room."
In 2014, Tyler's brother who was looking for his missing brother or sister at the age of 11, after which he committed suicide.
Ms Davis said: "I was constantly worried that there would be any cumulative impact."
Ms Davis created the card, "to tell people that there are people out there you can go and talk to, even if he's not a friend."
Don't sit still - you need to talk."
Ms. Humphries, who has been a friend of Ms. Davis for years, lost her friend Mark at the age of 15, shortly after her mother's death.
"He didn't say anything that he was feeling sad or upset or anything else," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we will make some changes in his behavior.
He was very sad on Christmas day - when the children opened their gifts, he could not see them."
He said his death was a big shock to him, but he had to get out of it: "It tore the family from the inside out."
It made us sad.
But we all had to fight ahead."

Kavanaugh's future was hung in the dark when the FBI began its investigation.
"I thought, if I could really find something that he's looking for - a limited time and limited scope investigation - maybe we'll find a little unity," Mr. Flake said Saturday, as well as that he feared the alleged biased gridlock.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
His unwillingness was due to time.
The midterm elections were only five weeks away, on November 6 - as is expected, Republicans perform very poorly, so in the land they wanted to win in the High Court, they will seriously weaken in their efforts.
George W. Bush picks up the phone to call Senator, promotes him to support Mr. Kuwangua, who worked for Mr. Bush in the White House and through him meets his wife Ashley, who is Mr. Bush's private secretary or secretary.
What happened after the FBI filed its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, which currently seats 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not clear that Mr. Kuvangua could get at least 50 votes on the Senate floor, which Mike Pence, Vice President, had to confirm by ending it and in the Supreme Court.
North Koreans have been 'defeated' by Kim
North Korea's presence in South Korea declined when John-Un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean administrator said.
Citing the southern integration ministry, Park Beyong-siyog said 1,127 people have fled their duty in 2011 compared to 2,706.
Mr. Park said the strong borders between North Korea and China and the high rates imposed by smugglers and tax collectors were the main factors.
Pyongyang did not make any public comment.
A large number of horses from the north are eventually proposed for South Korea's citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Maximum China fled, whose border is the longest with North Korea, and it is easy to cross the heavily protected decommissioned area (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China treats predators as illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often sends them back to their homeland by forcing them.
The relationship between the north and south - which is still technically in a state of war - has seen improvement in recent months.
Earlier this month, leaders of both countries meet in Pyongyang for talks, which focuses on blocked nuclear talks.
This came after the historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June, when they broadly agreed on terms for working towards a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea's foreign minister Ri Yang-ho blamed U.S. sanctions for slowing progress since then.
"Without any faith in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and in such circumstances, we will have no way but to harm ourselves unilaterally first," Mr. Rai said in a speech at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelori called Brett Kavanaugh "funny," saying he was not eligible for the Supreme Court
House minority leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court candidate Brat Kavanaugh "funny" and said he was inherently unfit to work in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi commented in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas, on Saturday.
"I can't think of a month that can do such a demonstration, they call it "fun," Pelosi said Thursday, giving his reaction to the evidence of Kavanaugh before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied the allegations that he had ever sexually abused Dr. Christine Blacy Ford when they were both teenagers.
In his initial statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes screaming and stopping breathing while talking about his family and his school years.
He clearly punished the Democrats on the committee by proving them to be accusations of "strange and coordinated character secrecy" by liberals, who were angry at Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential election loss.
Pelosi said he thinks that the witnesses of Kavanaugh have proved that he cannot work in the Supreme Court because it shows that he is acting against the Democrats.
"I think he misrepresented himself with those statements as well as the way he went to Clinton and the Democrats," he said.
Pelosi doubted that if asked if the Kavanaugh became permanent and if the Democrats won a majority in the House, he would still convict the Kavanaugh.
"I would say that if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he's not fit for the Supreme Court, but because he's invited, he can work right now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeal.
Pelosi said that as a Democrat he was concerned about Kavanaugh's potential rules against the adequate care of the Act or Ro V.Wed, as they are known to do conservative justice.
In the wake of his certification, Kavanaugh evaded questions as to whether he would reverse some of the judgments of the Supreme Court.
"In hearing his confirmation, Kavanaugh diverted the questions raised on whether he would reverse some of the judgments of the Supreme Court.
And women need to shake it.
It's a religious objection, the anger of months and years comes out and she can't stop herself from crying.
Ms. Stemin told me after 45 years that "When we cry, we get angry."
"I don't think that's unusual, do you?"
She said, "A woman helped me a lot who works as an officer somewhere, who said that even when she gets angry, she cries, but she has developed a new technique, which means that when she gets angry and she starts crying, because she's sick, so I'll tell you that she can talk to the person she was talking to."
I'm angry."
And then she was talking.
And I thought it was great."
Tears are allowed to come out as part of anger because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
An early job, one of my sharpest memories of a male head office, when I found myself weeping in an indescribable anger, I found that an old woman had grabbed my neck from behind - a sharp manager I was always terrified of - who I was always terrified of.
He said, "Don't ever cry in front of anyone."
"They don't know how fierce you are.
They think you are sad and you will be happy to meet them. "
Patricia Schroeder, a Democratic Congresswoman from Colorado, has worked with Gary Hart on the presidential run.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in connection with anything other than a wedding in a boat or name called Manki Business and his name was withdrawn from the race, Mrs. Shrodder, who was extremely disappointed, decided to take part in the presidential race herself.
"It wasn't a thought-provoking decision," he said, laughing at me after 30 years.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called him "Snow White and Sevan Dwarfs."""
Since the campaign was delayed, he did not have time to raise money and so he swore that he would not participate in the race until he collected $2 million.
It was a losing battle.
He found that some of his supporters who gave men $1,000 would give him only $250.
"Do they think I got any exemptions?" she wondered.
When he made his speech announcing that he would not launch any formal campaign, he could not overcome the emotions - thanks to those who gave him along with him, disappointment with the system that made it difficult for him to collect money - and frustration with the fact that he was unable to raise money - and disappointment instead of representatives
"You may have thought I'd have a nervous break down," Mrs. Shrodder recalled how the press would have reacted about her.
"You may have thought that Klanex is my corporate sponsor.
I remember what they would put on my samur?
"She was crying?"
How the U.S.-China trade war could be good for Beijing
The initial salvo of the trade war between the U.S. and China was going to slow down and while the war is just far from over, the rifts between the countries could be beneficial to Beijing in the long run, experts said.
U.S. President Donald Trump said the first warning was given earlier this year by imposing major Chinese export taxes, including on solar panels, steel and aluminum.
With the new tariff affecting items up to $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), the most significant increase this week is effectively taxed on more than half of all goods coming from China to the US.
Beijing has retaliated every time in its own way, most recently by five to 10 percent slapping tariffs on US goods worth $60 billion.
China has pledged to match the US with the world's second-largest economy, and it is likely that the second-largest economy in the world will soon collapse.
Getting Washington back means hollowing out demands, but publicly leaning heads in front of the US would be very embarrassing for the Chinese president.
Still, experts say Beijing could make its move, the US trade war could positively support China in the long run while decreasing the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a swift political decision in Washington or Beijing can create situations that either initiate an economic tailspin in the country, which is actually even more dangerous than what audiences have seen before,” said Abigail Grace, a research associate at the Center for the New American Security, said in a statement.
Syria is 'ready' to return refugees, foreign minister says
Syria has said it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is appealing for help to rebuild the country devastated by more than seven years of war.
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid Al-Moulam said that the situation in the country is improving.
"The situation on the ground is more stable and safe because of the progress made today against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to relocate to areas destroyed by terrorists to re-establish the normal situation.
Due to terrorism, all circumstances are now present for the voluntary return of refugees to the country and unilateral economic measures targeting their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
The other six million people living in the country still need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moulam said the Syrian regime would welcome help to rebuild the devastated country.
But he stressed that it will not accept conditional aid or assistance from the countries sponsoring the uprising.
Europe wins the Rider's Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Rider's Cup at the U.S. Golf Nationals from 16.5 to 10.5.
The US has now faced six consecutive losses on European soil and has not won the Rider's Cup in Europe since 1993.
When Danish captain Thomas Jörn's teen reaches the 14.5 points needed to defeat the American, Europe regains its title.
American star Phil Mickleson, who wrestled in the maximum tournament, showed his T-shot in the water at the 3rd 16th hole by accepting a match from Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari has won all his rounds by becoming one of four players to score 5-0-0 since the tournament's current format began in 1979.
American Jordan Spith was defeated 5 and 4 by Denmark's Thorbjon Olesen, the lowest-ranked player of the European team.
The world's top ranked player, Dustin Dunson, lost 2 and 1 to Lan Polter, of England, who had probably played his last rider's cup.
An experienced eight-rider cup, the Spanish Surgeon Garcia has become the European winner every time in the tournament with a 25.5 career point.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't stop myself.
It was a difficult year.
So thank you Thomas for choosing me and trusting me.
I'm very, very happy to get the cup back.
It's about the team, and I'm very happy that I was able to help," Greece said emotionally after Europe's victory.
He defeated his teammate John Ram Thompson, who defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods 2 and 1 in a single play on Sunday.
The 23-year-old Rahm said, "I'm extremely proud to have defeated Tiger Woods, I've grown to see them."
Wood lost all four of his matches in France and now he has a 13-21-3 career rider cup record.
One of the greatest players to date has won 14 major titles in second place after only Jack Nicholas.
The U.S. team struggled throughout the weekend to find fairways with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finney, who played golf with the entire caliber throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furk said after his squad's disappointing performance, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
In the morning, we put some pressure on Europe.
We defeated them.
Congrats to Thomas.
He is a great captain.
All 12 of his players played a great game.
We will regroup, I will work with the PGA and Rider Cup Committee of the United States and move forward with Thosom.
I like these 12 guys very much and I am proud to be their captain.
You should congratulate them.
We played better."
