Members of the Assembly (AM) of Wales are concerned about "looking muppets"
Some Members of the Assembly are baffled by the suggestion that their title should be changed to Members of the Parliament of Wales (MWP).
This confusion arises from plans to change the name of the Assembly to Parliament of Wales.
Members of the Assembly from across the political spectrum are concerned that this may be ridiculed.
A Labour Party Assembly member said his group was concerned “that he stays with Twp and Pwp.”
For readers from outside Wales: In Welsh, twp means silly and pwp means shit.
A member of the Welsh Party Assembly commented that his entire group was "dissatisfied" and has suggested alternatives.
A member of the Conservative Party of Wales said his group was "open" to the name change, but noted that the pronunciation leap from MWP to muppet was small.
In this context, the pronunciation of the letter w in Welsh is similar to that of the letter u in English of Yorkshire.
The Committee of the Assembly, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce the change of name, states: "Of course, the final decision on any descriptive element of the designation of the Members of the Assembly will be the responsibility of the members themselves."
The 2017 Welsh Government Act gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals that revealed broad support for calling the Parliament of Wales to the Assembly.
On the question of the title of Members of the Assembly, the Commission preferred Members of the Welsh Parliament (or WMP), but the MWP option received most of the support in a public consultation.
Apparently, Members of the Assembly are suggesting alternative options, but the struggle to reach a consensus could bring headlines to the President of the Assembly, Elin Jones, who should submit the bill on changes in a few weeks.
Legislation on reforms will include other changes related to the functioning of the Assembly, such as rules on the disqualification of Assembly Members and the design of the committee system.
Members of the Assembly will have the final say on the question of how they should be called when deliberating on legislation.
Macedonians go to the polls to vote on a referendum on changing the country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether their country's name will be changed to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular vote was convened in an attempt to resolve a decades-long conflict with the neighboring country, Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has always insisted that its northern neighbor’s name implies a claim to its territory and has repeatedly opposed its bid to join the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the referendum on the name change, has said he will ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price to pay to join the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells remain silent due to difficulties in Harlem churches
“Historically, the older people I’ve talked to say there was a bar and a church in every corner,” Adams says.
"Today, there is neither one thing nor the other."
He noted that the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
“People are socializing differently now,” he says.
"The bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighborhoods to which the neighbors regularly go."
With regard to churches, he is concerned that the money earned from the sale of goods will not last as long as leaders expect and that “sooner or later, they will return to the starting point.”
The churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment buildings filled with the kind of people who won’t help the shrines left in the neighborhood.
“The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white people,” he said, “and, therefore, will accelerate the closure of these churches, as it is unlikely that the majority of people who move to these apartments will end up being members of these churches.”
The two churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis: the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin a decade later.
The original White Methodist congregation left in the 1930s.
A black congregation worshiping nearby acquired the building.
A black congregation took the reins of St. Martin, under the direction of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of merchants on 125th Street, a major shopping street in Harlem, who resisted hiring or promoting black people.
In 1939, a fire left the building severely damaged and, while Father Johnson's parishioners were making plans for its reconstruction, they also commissioned the lane.
Reverend David Johnson, the son and successor of Father Johnson in St. Martin, proudly called it “the campaigns of the poor.”
In July, the expert who played the carillon called it "a cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
In addition, University of Michigan expert Tiffany Ng said it was the world’s first carillon used by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who left to play the larger Riverside Church carillon 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather commented that St. Martin did not replace him.
What has happened in San Martín in recent months has been a complicated history of architects and contractors, some brought by the secular leaders of the church and others by the diocese.
The parish board, the governing body of the parish, composed of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July commenting on its concern that the diocese "try to pass the costs" to the board, although the diocese had not participated in the recruitment of the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained of the diocese’s lack of transparency.
Shark Injures 13-Year-Old Boy Scuba Diving for Lobsters in California
A shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while diving for locusts in California the day the locust season opened, authorities said.
The attack occurred shortly before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told San Diego's KSWB-TV channel that he had been diving with friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy asking for help, so he approached with a group to get him out of the water.
Hammel commented that, at first, he thought he was just thrilled to have captured a lobster, but then realized that "he was screaming that they had bitten him.
,
He had a broken jaw,” Hammel observed when he arrived next to the child.
“I shouted to everyone to get out of the water because there was a shark,” Hammel added.
The child was transported by helicopter to Rady Children’s Hospital, where he is in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
The rescuer, Captain Larry Giles, commented at a press conference that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but that it had not been considered a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim showed traumatic injuries in the upper part of the torso.
Authorities closed access to the beach, from Ponto Beach, in Casablad, to Swami Beach, in Encinitas, for 48 hours to investigate and for security reasons.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but that most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans boost UK beauty market
Sainsbury's acquires Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, which have many employees specializing in the hallways of their establishments of style and beauty.
In order to significantly boost the UK beauty market, valued at <0xC2><0xA3>2800 trillion and with growth rising compared to the fall in fashion and household sales, the largest beauty halls will be tested in 11 stores across the country and, if they successfully overcome it, the same will be done in more stores over the year.
The investment in beauty comes at the same time as this chain of supermarkets is looking for ways to use the space in shelves that used to be used for televisions, microwaves and household appliances.
Sainsbury’s said it would double its beauty offering with up to 3,000 products, including brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
In addition, the existing L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees ranges will be given more space, with areas similar to those of other establishments, such as Boots.
The chain will also relaunch its Boutique makeup range with a majority of animal-friendly products, something increasingly demanded by younger customers.
The fragrance shop will also test its concessions at two Sainsbury's establishments, the first newly opened in Croydon, South London, last week, and the second will open at Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online stores and the shift to the daily purchase of small amounts of food in local stores force supermarkets to make an effort to convince people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, executive director of Sainsbury's, has said that stores will increasingly resemble malls as the supermarket chain tries to fight off Aldi and Lidl discount stores by offering more non-food services and products.
Sainsbury's has integrated Argos discount outlets in hundreds of establishments and has introduced several Habitats since their purchase of these chains two years ago. This is considered to have boosted grocery sales and profitable plus these acquisitions.
The previous attempt by the supermarket chain to renovate its beauty and pharmacy departments was a failure.
Sainsbury's tested a joint operation with Boots in the early 2000s, but the collaboration ended after a discussion on how to split the revenues from pharmaceutical outlets in their supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after the sale of Sainsbury’s 281 pharmaceutical establishments to Celesio, the owner of the chain Lloyds Pharmacy, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
It is noted that Lloyds will participate in the plan, adding an expanded range of luxury skin care brands, such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Chief Commercial Officer at Sainsbury’s, commented: “We have transformed the look and feel of our beauty hallways in ways that enhance the environment for our customers.
In addition, we have invested in a specialized staff who will be available to offer advice.
On the other hand, an attractive environment and a comfortable location makes us an irresistible beauty product destination, challenging the old way of buying.”
Peter Jones is "furious" after Holly Willoughby breaks <0xC2><0xA3>11m deal
Peter Jones, the star of Dragon's Den, went "furious" after TV presenter Holly Willoughby broke an 11-million-pound deal with her lifestyle business line to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn’t have time to dedicate to the fashion brand and accessories Truly.
This business had been compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old This Morning presenter announced she was leaving the business on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has angered Peter Jones, the star of Dragon's Den, by leaving his lucrative lifestyle business at the last minute to focus on his extraordinary new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to the sources consulted, Jones was "furious" when the TV gold girl admitted that her new deals, valued at up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million, did not leave time to dedicate themselves to Truly, her fashion brand and accessories, during a tense meeting held Tuesday at the headquarters of her business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire.
The business had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was profiled as a favorite to double Willoughby's fortune of about <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
While 37-year-old Willoughby announced that he was leaving the business on Instagram, Jones was leaving Britain to go to one of his holiday homes.
As one source said: "Truly was, by contrast, Holly's top priority.
It was going to be her long-term future, which would keep her for the next two decades.
His decision to quit left all involved completely shocked.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, so close to the launch.
There's a warehouse full of merchandise at Marlow's headquarters, ready-to-sell products."
Experts believe the departure of the presenter of This Morning, one of Britain’s most profitable stars, could cost the company millions due to the significant investment in products ranging from cushions and candles to clothing, and possibly further delay its launch.
It could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, are parents of three children and for ten years have maintained a close relationship with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp.
Willoughby established Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as president in March.
The couples were on vacation together and Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin’s television producer.
Willoughby will become a brand ambassador for M&S and replace Ant McPartlin as host of I'm A Celebrity on the ITV channel.
A source close to Jones said last night “no business issues were discussed.”
A difficult conversation "and then we fell in love"
He joked about the criticism he received from the media for making a comment that some would consider “unprecedented” and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so many things?
Trump commented with his ridiculous voice of "news presenter".
"I have not given up on anything."
He noted that Kim is interested in meeting with him again after Trump praised the first meeting held in June in Singapore, which he considered a major step towards North Korea’s denuclearization.
Negotiations for denuclearization, however, have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea’s top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, explained to world leaders gathered at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that his country does not see an “adequate response” from the US to the first steps towards North Korea’s disarmament.
On the contrary, he noted, the U.S. continues to impose sanctions in order to maintain pressure.
Trump’s outlook was much more optimistic in the speech he gave during his rally.
"We're doing great with North Korea," he said.
“We were going to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a fantastic relationship.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have generated positive results: the end of missile tests, help to free hostages and bring the deadly remains of U.S. soldiers back home.
In addition, he defended his unusual approach in talking about relations with Kim.
"It's very easy to be presidential, but so, instead of 10,000 people out there trying to get into this crowded stadium, we'd have about 200 people right here," Trump said, pointing to people right in front of him.
A tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastate an island, leaving hundreds of dead
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs were informed that their assistance was not needed.
Although more than 10 per cent of the population of Lombok had to move, no national emergency was declared, a prerequisite for catalyzing international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they have made it very clear that they do not seek international assistance, which complicates things a little," Mrs Sumbung explains.
Although Save the Children is preparing a team that will send to Palu, they are still not sure if foreign personnel can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesman for the national emergency agency, explained that authorities were evaluating the situation in Palu to see if international organizations were allowed to provide assistance.
Given that the earth is constantly moving in Indonesia, the country remains incredibly unprepared when nature unleashes its anger.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, not so many are seen in other coastal areas.
The apparent lack of tsunami warning sirens in Palu, even though there was a previous warning, is likely to have contributed to the loss of lives.
At best, traveling from one island in Indonesia to another is quite a challenge.
Natural disasters further complicate logistics.
A hospital ship that was in Lombok to attend to the victims of the earthquake is headed for Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the enclave of the new catastrophe.
President Joko Widodo has made the improvement of Indonesia’s worn-out infrastructure the central axis of his election campaign, and has spent a lot of money on roads and rail lines.
However, the lack of funding has affected the administration of Mr. Joko, who faces a re-election next year.
In addition, it must face the pressure of Indonesia’s persistent sectarian tensions, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people died and tens of thousands were forced to flee their homes as gangs of Christians and Muslims fought in the streets using machetes, bows and arrows, and other rudimentary weapons.
Watch this: Liverpool’s Daniel Sturridge equalizes the score against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat against Chelsea with a goal in the 89th minute on Saturday at London's Stamford Bridge.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri to just over 27 metres from Chelsea's goal when the scorer was 1-0.
He placed the ball on his left foot with a touch before throwing it at the second stick.
The action sent him over the area and headed towards the upper right corner of the net.
Finally, the ball passed over Kepa Arrizabalaga who tried to stop him with a jump and fell into the net.
"I was trying to put myself in that position to get the ball and players like Shaq always play very ahead, so I tried to give myself all the time I could," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante approaching and I gave him a touch. I didn't think too much, I just threw the shot."
Chelsea were going to win 1-0 in the first half after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored a goal in the 25th minute.
The Blues midfielder made a heel pass to Mateo Kovacic in that play, before spinning a regatta near the midfield and entering Liverpool's field.
Kovacic quickly passed the ball and ran out into the middle field.
Then he made a nice pass to the space that led Hazard to the area.
Hazard stood in front of the defense and finished throwing the ball into the net of the second pole with a kick with his left foot that Liverpool's Alisson Becker couldn't stop.
On Wednesday at 15:00, Liverpool plays against Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League. The match will be held at the Stadio San Paolo, in Naples (Italy).
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 15:00 in London.
Indonesian tsunami death toll rises to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the country's emergency agency said early on Sunday.
Many people were trapped among the debris of the buildings that collapsed during the 7.5 magnitude earthquake that occurred on Friday and that unleashed waves of up to six meters, according to the agency's spokesman, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho during a press conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered with the remains of the collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man as murder suspect after woman was stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been opened after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
The 44-year-old woman was found stabbed at 7:55 a.m. at Grayson Mews on John Street, which involved the arrest of a 32-year-old man as a murder suspect.
The police have urged people in the area who have seen or heard anything to go to the police.
Inspector Brian O'Hagan commented: "The investigation is in the early stages, but it would encourage anyone who has been near John Street, Birkenhead, and has seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
In addition, I would recommend anyone, especially taxi drivers, who has been able to capture something on dashcam to contact us, as they may have vital information for our investigation.”
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was from Birkenhead and was found inside a property.
This afternoon some people who believe they know the woman came to the crime scene to find out where they had found her this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and police have reported that they are in the process of informing the victim’s relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews has tried to get back into his apartment, but police tell him no one can get in or out of the building.
He was stunned when he found out what had happened.
Now, residents are informed that they will be allowed to re-enter in a few hours.
Someone heard an agent tell a man that the whole area was being treated like a crime scene.
A woman appeared in tears.
He keeps saying, "It's terrible."
At two o'clock in the afternoon, there were two police vans inside the cordon and one more outside.
Several agents remained standing inside the cordon controlling the block of floors.
Anyone with information is requested to send an email to DM <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111, September 30, registration 247.
The Cromwell Statue of Parliament becomes the last commemorative success for "rewriting history"
His ban would be an act of poetic justice for this Taliban-style destruction of so many cultural and religious objects of England carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
However, the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's suggestions as "crazy" and an "attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, commented: "In the current debate over the removal of statues, it was inevitable that taking Oliver Cromwell's figure out of Westminster Palace would become an objective.
The iconoclasm of the English civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
He may have sacrificed the wrong Cromwell for the actions of his ancestor, Thomas, during the previous century.
Cromwell’s magnificent depiction of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is proof of 19th-century opinion and part of the historiography of a figure that many consider worthy of celebration.
As Mr. Goldsmith pointed out to The Sunday Telegraph: "Many consider Cromwell, perhaps more in the late nineteenth century than today, an advocate of parliament in the face of external pressure, in this case, it is clear, the monarchy.
If this is a fully accurate description, it is a matter of continuing with the historical debate.
What is true is that the conflict of the mid-17th century has shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure who represents a face of that division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebration and commemoration.”
Killer Pig Attacks Chinese Farmer
A pig attacked and killed a rancher in a market in southwest China, according to local media.
The man, identified solely by his surname "Yuan", was found dead with a blood-covered, sectioned artery near a market spot in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
On May 30, 2005, a pig breeder prepares to inject vaccines into pigs from a swine herd in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He apparently travelled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that the door of a nearby pocilga was open.
He said there was a big pig with blood in his mouth.
The forensic examination confirmed that the nearly 250 kilogram pig had attacked the rancher to death, according to the report.
“My cousin’s legs were bloody and shattered,” the cousin, to whom they address by his surname, “Wu,” told The Guiyang Evening News.
The footage from the security camera showed Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told The Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking anyone else, while police were collecting evidence on the spot.
It seems that Yuan's family and market authorities are negotiating compensation for his death.
Although they are rare, this is not the first time a pig has attacked a person.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on his Massachusetts farm, leaving the man seriously injured.
Ten years earlier, a pig weighing nearly 295 kilograms strangled a rancher in his tractor until his wife frightened the animal.
After, in 2012, pigs were eaten by an Oregon rancher, a Manitoba rancher told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but that the taste of the blood can act as a “trigger.”
“They’re just playing.
They are like children, very curious... their intention is not to hurt.
What needs to be done is to have proper respect for them,” he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa will leave heavy widespread rainfall in the southwestern U.S.
As expected, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will leave torrential rainfall across northern Mexico and southwestern U.S. in the coming days.
Rosa provoked wind gusts of more than 136 km/h, a Category 1 hurricane, from Sunday morning to five in the morning (Eastern Time) and was located nearly 620 kilometers southwest of Punta Eugenia (Mexico).
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, low pressures are beginning to generate in the Pacific Ocean, moving eastward toward the U.S. West Coast. As Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday, a tropical storm will begin to push the intense tropical rains in a northerly direction, toward the southwestern U.S.
Rosa will leave more than 25 centimeters of rain in some areas of Mexico on Monday.
Finally, when tropical rain collides with the approaching low pressure, there will be strong widespread rainfall in the southwest over the next few days.
Locally, between 2 and 10 centimeters of rain will cause dangerous sudden floods, debris flows and possible detachments in the desert.
Intense tropical rains will cause rainfall of nearly 5 to 8 centimeters per hour in specific areas, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Between 5 and 10 centimeters of rain is expected in parts of the southwest, especially most of Arizona.
Due to the dispersed nature of tropical rainfall, sudden flooding with rapidly worsening conditions may occur.
Due to this threat of tropical torrential rains, it is not recommended to venture into the desert on foot.
Heavy rains could turn the cannons into embracing rivers and storms will cause cracked winds and dust clouds locally.
The approaching low pressures will leave heavy rains in specific parts of the southern California coast.
The torrential rains may leave up to nearly two centimeters of water, which could cause small flows of debris and make the roads slippery.
This would be the first torrential rainfall in the region during the wet season.
Some scattered tropical lizards will begin approaching Arizona late on Sunday and early on Monday, before the rain is widespread late on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rains will spread to the Four Corners on Tuesday and throughout Wednesday.
In October, there will be some intense temperature changes in the U.S. due to the cooling of the Arctic and the warming of the tropics.
Sometimes, this involves drastic temperature changes over short distances.
A good example of these temperature differences is what will happen across the center of the U.S. on Sunday.
There will be a nearly 7-degree difference between Kansas City, Missouri and, Omaha (Nebraska), and between St. Louis and Des Moines (Iowa).
Over the next few days, the prolonged summer heat will try to recover and expand again.
In much of central and eastern U.S., a warm October start is expected, with widespread temperatures around 26 degrees from the South Plain to parts of the northeast.
On Tuesday, temperatures in New York could reach as high as 26 degrees, about 12 degrees above average.
Our long-term forecast indicates high odds of above-average temperatures for the east of the United States during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh’s appearance
More than 20 million people followed the heartbreaking testimonies that Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of allegedly sexual assault in the 1980s, gave on six television channels on Thursday.
Meanwhile, the policy was still deadlocked and the media interrupted its usual programming to relay Friday’s latest news: an agreement designed by Arizona Senator Jeff Blake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was absolutely certain that Kavanaugh had touched her in a state of drunkenness and that he had tried to take her clothes off at a high school party.
During his passionate testimony, Kavanaugh said he was totally sure that that had not happened.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people who commented on Nielsen on Friday have seen it.
The company accounted for the media audience on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for other channels that relayed it, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen usually has some trouble calculating how many people see something in the office.
To put it in perspective, it is an audience similar to that of an American football game of the playoffs or the Oscars.
Fox News Channel, whose tertulians have strongly supported Kavanaugh’s designation, fuels the leading channel, with an average of 5.69 million viewers during a day-long appearance, Nielsen said.
ABC ranked second, with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
After the show, there was still a lot of interest.
Flake was the central character in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican office issued a statement saying he would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, on Friday morning CNN and CBS cameras caught protesters yelling at him as he tried to climb an elevator to attend a hearing before the Judiciary Commission.
While receiving these reproaches, broadcast live on CNN, he was overwhelmed.
"Looking at me in the face," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?"
He continued, “You have power when there are so many women who don’t have it.”
Flake said his office had issued a statement and, before the elevator doors were closed, he would tell more in his appearance before the Commission.
Cable and broadcasters broadcast it all live hours later, when the Judiciary Commission had to vote to propose Kavanaugh’s candidacy for the Senate.
However, Flake said he would only do so if the FBI investigated the accusations made against the candidate during the next week, which some Democrats had been asking for.
Flake was convinced, in part, by the conversations he had had with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several senators later, Flake made his decision.
Flake’s decision was fundamental, as it was clear that Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without that investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of 'doing politics' with Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union of "making politics" with Britain's future and undermining national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Congress to be held in Birmingham, UK on September 29, 2018.
In another interview published alongside his on the newspaper cover, his former foreign minister, Boris Johnson, insisted on his attack on Chequers' alleged Brexit plan, saying that a proposal for Britain and the EU to levy the other's tariffs was "totally absurd."
Wayde Murder: Police Arrest Dyteon Simpson as Suspect of LSU Player's Death
Police have arrested a suspect for the death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player, during a shooting.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and imprisoned on a second-degree homicide charge, according to the Baton Rouge Police Department.
Authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police say Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered the glasses at the crime scene and said they had found Simpson’s DNA in them, according to WAFB, a subsidiary of CBS.
After questioning Simpson, police say he admitted to shooting Wayde.
A bail of $350,000 has been set up, according to the defense.
The Baton Rouge District Court of Instruction issued a preliminary report Friday stating that the cause of death had been a bullet wound in the neck that had reached the head.
The department recognizes the merits of the Louisiana State Police Refugee Unit, the State Police Forensic Laboratory, Southern University Police and citizens for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
Joe Alleva, LSU’s sports director, thanked the police forces in the area for their “diligence and pursuit of justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
The player, who measured more than two meters, grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball at LSU.
He had scored an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds in one game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said his team was "destroyed" and "in shock" by Wayde's death.
“These are the things people always worry about,” Wade said.
Volcano throws ashes in Mexico City
Ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the neighborhoods located south of the capital of Mexico.
The National Disaster Prevention Center on Saturday warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after the crater showed activity and recorded 183 emissions of gas and ash in 24 hours.
The center recorded several tremors and tremors.
On social media, the images showed thin layers of ash covering the windshields of vehicles in neighborhoods of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed increased activity in the volcano, located 72 kilometers southeast of the capital, since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police face Catalan separatists ahead of independence referendum anniversary
Six people were arrested Saturday in Barcelona after independent protesters clashed with anti-disturbance protests as thousands took part in opposition demonstrations coinciding with the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarized secession referendum.
A group of hooded separatists who had been cut off by the rioters threw eggs and powder paint, creating dark dust clouds in the streets, which are usually full of tourists.
There were also clashes in later hours and police used rags to contain the fight.
For several hours, the independentist groups, with messages such as "no forgetting or forgiveness", faced unionist protesters shouting "Viva España".
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries sustained during the protests, according to local media.
Tensions remain high in this region a year after the October 1 vote, considered illegal by Madrid, but held by separatist Catalans.
Voters overwhelmingly voted for independence, although participation was low, as people opposed to secession largely boycotted the referendum.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police attempted to prevent voting at polling stations across the region, where violent clashes took place.
Pro-independence groups camped Friday night to avoid a demonstration of support for the National Police.
The demonstration went on, but was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician attending the separatist protest with his wife said he no longer had hopes that Catalonia would become independent.
“Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents weeping with joy to be able to vote, but now we’re stuck,” he said.
Despite achieving a vital, albeit narrow, victory in last December’s regional elections, pro-Catalan parties have struggled to retain momentum this year, as many of their best-known leaders, whether in self-imposed exile or detained, are awaiting trial for their role in organizing the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in support of the police on his phone, said the conflict had been fueled by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting more and more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in pre-trial detention since the end of last year, announced that he would participate in next year’s European Parliament elections.
"Being a candidate in the European elections is the best way to denounce the regression in democratic values and the repression we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested for harassing a house with a car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested after repeatedly harassing a Londonderry house with a car.
The incident occurred on Thursday at around 19:30 in Ballynagard Crescent.
Inspector Bob Blemmings commented that damage was caused to the accesses and to the building itself.
At some point, you may have shot the car with a swing.
Menga strike gives Livingston 1-0 win over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured victory
A promoted Livingston impressed the Rangers by scoring a second defeat for Steven Gerrard in 18 games as Ibrox club coach.
Dolly Menga's attack made the difference: Gary Holt's men climbed a spot, with the Hibernian in second place.
This season, Gerrard’s have yet to score any away wins and next Sunday they face the Hearts, the table leaders with eight points of lead.
Before that, the Rangers host Rapid Vienna on Thursday in the Europa League.
In the meantime, Livingston has expanded its division-winning streak to six games. Holt, head coach, has not yet tasted the defeat since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston lets opportunities pass in front of a strong visitor
Holt’s team had to have gone one step ahead long before scoring, causing all sorts of problems to the Rangers for their direct play.
Scott Robinson overtook the defense, but failed his attempt ahead of goal, and then Alan Lithgow took the diverted shot after interning to finish Craig Halkett's header in front of goal.
The host team was content to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could cause problems to visitors with the ball playing stopped.
That’s how the decisive goal came.
The Rangers granted them a free kick and Livingston sought an entrance, with a combined play by Declan Gallagher and Robinson for Menga, who hit the ball and scored from the center of the area.
At the time, the Rangers dominated the possession, but could not pass the defense of the host and the goalkeeper, Liam Kelly, was quite calm.
That game continued until the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced a stop by Kelly.
Allan McGregor, the Rangers' goalkeeper, rejected Scott Pittman's shot from a kick, and Lithgow stayed away from another move from Livingston.
In the Livingston area, long passes were constantly entered, but were always cleared. Two requests for penalties were rejected, one after Halkett's entry over alternate Glenn Middleton and another by one hand.
"Fenomenal" by Livingston (analysis)
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Stadium
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
The unanimous opinion is that they made an excellent game that continued to exceed expectations of an upward trajectory.
His playing style and staff have barely experienced changes since his ascent, but this is largely due to Holt for the way he has reinforced the team since his arrival.
He had a lot of heroes.
Halkett, the team’s captain, was huge and led a magnificently organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall alert at all times.
However, the Rangers were lacking in inspiration.
Although they had very good moments with Gerrard, they were short.
They failed to materialize the moves, as they only managed to get into the opposite field once, which is a call to attention for the Rangers, who are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan received an ambiguous reception in Cologne
On Saturday, September 29, there were smiles and a blue sky during the breakfast of the leaders of Turkey and Germany in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, with the aim of restoring relations between NATO allies.
They have discussed issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Afterwards, Erdogan headed to Cologne to inaugurate a huge new mosque.
The city hosts the largest population of Turks outside Turkey.
The police claimed security reasons to prevent 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many sympathizers stood in the vicinity to see its president.
Hundreds of Erdogan’s opponents, many of them Kurds, were also heard condemning both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to receive him in the country.
These demonstrations reflect how divisive this visitor is, received as a hero by some German Turks and considered an autocrat by others.
Traffic accident in Deptford: a cyclist dies after colliding with a vehicle
A cyclist has died in a car accident in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwookd Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road from Deptford, southeast of the city, around 10:15 a.m.
The driver of the car stopped and the cyclist was taken care of by the paramedics, but he died there.
The accident comes after another cyclist died after being hit by a vehicle that ran away on Childers Street, nearly two kilometers from Saturday's crash site.
The Metropolitan Police said officers were working to identify the man and inform his relatives.
Roads have been cut and buses diverted, and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured after riots
Six prison officials have been injured in an altercation in a high-security men's prison, according to the Prison Center Directorate.
The riots began at Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire around 9:30 a.m. on Sunday and are still ongoing.
Specialists from an elite team (called "Tornado") are in charge of controlling the altercations, in which eight inmates participate and affect a pavilion.
Officers were assisted for minor facial injuries at the scene.
A spokesman for the prison service commented: “Specialized prison personnel have been deployed to deal with the ongoing incident at Long Lartin Prison.
Six staff members have received medical care for injuries.
Violence is not tolerated in our prisons and we make it clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and could spend more time in jail.”
Long Lartin Prison is home to more than 500 inmates, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison director had received hospital medical care after an inmate attacked him.
In addition, in October last year, anti-disturbance agents were asked to go to prison to face a serious altercation in which prison personnel were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden flooding (arid areas could be benefited)
It’s unusual for a tropical depression to reach Arizona, but that’s exactly what could happen early next week when Hurricane Rosa’s last hits cross the southwest desert, with the risk of sudden flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued sudden flood alerts for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada and southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to head directly to Phoenix on Tuesday, leaving rain at the end of Monday.
The Phoenix National Meteorological Service commented in a tweet that only "ten hurricanes had retained their tropical storm or depression status within a 321-kilometre radius of Phoenix since 1950.
In 1967, Hurricane Katrina approached nearly 65 kilometers from the Arizona border.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict between 5 and 10 centimeters of torrential rainfall, which can reach 15 centimeters in isolated areas of the Mogollon Escarpment, in Arizona.
They are likely to fall between 2 and 5 centimeters of rain, with the possibility of reaching 10 in isolated places, in other areas of the southwest of the desert, including the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin.
In places that are not at risk of sudden flooding, Rosa rains can be considered a blessing, as the region is affected by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious matter, some of these torrential rains are likely to be beneficial due to drought conditions currently experienced in the southwest.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, more than 40 percent of Arizona is suffering from at least extreme drought, the second highest category, as reported on weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa’s itinerary will hit Mexico’s Baja California Peninsula.
Rosa, who on Sunday morning will still have a hurricane force with maximum bursts of 136 kilometers per hour, is 619 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia (Mexico) and is moving north at 19 kilometers per hour.
The storm is finding colder waters in the Pacific, so it is losing strength.
Thus, it is expected to rebound in Mexico with the intensity of a tropical storm over the course of the afternoon of Monday.
Heavy torrential rains could fall in parts of Mexico, which are at considerable risk of flooding.
“A 7 to 15 centimeter torrential rainfall is expected from Baja California to the northwest of Sonora, with the possibility of reaching 25 centimeters,” according to weather.com.
Afterwards, Rosa will head north of that Mexico as a tropical storm, before arriving at the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday morning as a tropical depression. Later, she will travel through Arizona to southern Utah at the last hour of Tuesday night.
"The main danger of Rosa or her remains is the heavy torrential rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and southwestern U.S. desert," the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
These rains are expected to cause dangerous sudden floods and debris flows in deserts, as well as landslides in mountain areas.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Arrests for Attempted Murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old boy have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after another 16-year-old was found with gunshot wounds in Somerset.
The teen was found wounded in the Excelsior Terrace area, in Midsomer Norton, around 4:00 a.m. on Saturday.
He was transferred to a hospital, where he remains "stable".
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and one 20-year-old were arrested that same night in the Radstock area of Avon, according to Somerset Police.
The agents have appealed to anyone who may have recorded what happened with the phone.
Trump Says Kavanaugh "Suffered the Mischief and Anger" of Democratic Party
“Voting for Judge Kavanaugh is voting to reject the Democratic Party’s ruthless and outrageous tactics,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh has "suffered the melancholy and anger" of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, vigorously and emotionally denying the accusation of Christine Blasey Ford that she had been sexually assaulted decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing on this allegation.
On Saturday, the president said that on that day, “Americans saw Kavanaugh’s cunning, quality, and bravery.”
“Voting to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is voting to confirm one of the most accomplished legalists of our day, a lawyer with an admirable record in public service,” he told supporters in West Virginia.
The president made indirect references to Kavanaugh’s candidacy when he talked about the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
“Five weeks are missing for one of the most important choices in our lives.
I don’t present myself, but it’s a race,” he said.
“That’s why I’m going from one place to another struggling to get great candidates.”
Trump claimed Democrats are embarking on a mission of “resistance and obstruction.”
The Senate’s first key procedural vote on Kavanaugh’s appointment is expected to take place no later than Friday, a senior Republican leadership official told CNN.
Hundreds of dead in earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, the figure is rising
At least 384 people have died and many have been dragged by the huge waves that swept the beaches after a strong earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered to celebrate a festival on the beach of the city of Palu on Friday when waves of up to six meters reached the coast at dusk, dragging many to death and destroying everything on their way.
The tsunami occurred after a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
"When it was warned yesterday that a tsunami could occur, people were still on the beach and did not flee immediately, so they were victims," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia's National Agency for Disaster Management (BNPB).
"The tsunami didn't come alone, it dragged cars, logs, houses, it ravaged everything that was on land," Nugroho said. The tsunami had moved through the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before reaching the coast.
He also added that some people had climbed the trees to escape the tsunami and had survived.
Around 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
The aerial photographs published by the agency showed the destruction of many buildings and shops, broken and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
The replicas continued to hit the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area with 2.4 million people.
The Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday's great earthquake was 200 times that of the atomic bomb that fell on Hiroshima in World War II.
He added that the geography of the city, which sits at the end of a long and narrow bay, may have magnified the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "important" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
According to him, the bodies of some victims were found trapped under the debris of the collapsed buildings, as well as 540 people had been injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the number of casualties and damage could be higher along the 300 km coastline north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the earthquake's epicenter.
Communications "were totally paralyzed and there was no information" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
"More than 300,000 people live there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy in itself, but it could be much worse," he said.
On Saturday, the agency received many criticisms for not reporting that a tsunami had struck Palu, although officials say the waves had already reached the coast when the alert was issued.
In a footage captured by a fan and shared on social media, a man is heard standing on the top floor of a building warning people he was on the street that a tsunami was approaching.
Within minutes, a wall of water hits the coast, taking buildings and cars ahead.
Reuters was not able to validate the material immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major blackout that cut off communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue work.
The army began sending cargo planes with aid from Jakarta and other cities, authorities say, but the evacuated people still need food and other commodities.
The city’s airport has been reopened only for rescue tasks and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo has a scheduled visit to Paul’s evacuation centers on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami is more than 800.
It's a very bad thing.
Although Donggala’s World Vision staff has arrived safely in the city of Palu, where employees take refuge under canvases installed in the garden of their offices, they have seen a devastating panorama on their way, Mr. Doseba said.
“They told me they had seen many houses destroyed,” he said.
It's a very bad thing.
Even as the aid groups set up disaster assistance gears, some people complained that the displacement to Palu of co-operators with extensive experience was not allowed.
Under Indonesian law, foreign funding, supplies and staffing can only be used if the affected site is declared a national disaster zone.
And that hasn't happened yet.
“It’s still a disaster at the provincial level,” said Aulia Arriani, spokeswoman for the Red Cross in Indonesia.
“As soon as the government says it considers it a national disaster, we can start providing international aid, but it hasn’t happened yet.”
On the second night in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, friends and relatives of the people who were still missing still had hope that their loved ones would be the miracles that would bring some light to the desolating stories written by natural disasters.
On Saturday, a small child was taken out of a sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been trapped under debris for two days beside her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, instructor of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which concluded earlier that month in Indonesia.
Others who were trapped in the Roa Roa hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
“From my experience in the paragliding field, I carry my own emotional load,” he said.
Mr. Gendon recalled how, in the hours following the news that the Roa Roa hotel had collapsed in the paragliding community, he had sent desperate WhatsApp messages to the competitors of Palu, who were participating in the festival held on the beach.
However, their messages showed only one check mark in gray, not two in blue.
“I think that means the messages weren’t delivered,” he said.
Thieves take $26,750 during an ATM reload in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves raided a Brink employee recharging an ATM in Newport on the Levee, taking $26,750, according to a Newport Police Department press release.
The driver of the vehicle had emptied an ATM located in the leisure center and was preparing to recharge it with more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the note.
While he was busy, another man “came running behind Brink’s employee” and stole a bag of the money for the refill.
According to the note, there are witnesses who saw several suspects leaving the scene, but police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identities should contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changed his name to Ye
The rapper Kanye West will start to call himself Ye.
He announced the change on Twitter on Saturday: “The person formerly known as Kanye West.”
West, 41, has long been nicknamed Ye, a name he used as a title for his eighth album, released in June.
The change comes before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new album, Yandhi.
It replaces singer Ariana Grande, who had to cancel her performance for “emotional reasons,” as the creator of the show commented.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West had previously said that the word had a religious significance to him.
“I think it’s the most used word in the Bible, where it means ‘you’,” West said earlier this year as he talked about the album’s title with radio host Big Boy.
"It's you, it's us, it means us.
It went from being Kanye, which means ‘the only one’, to Ye, a reflection of our good, bad and confusing things, everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are.”
He is one of the many famous rappers whose name has been changed.
Sean Combs has been known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year announced that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
A former West collaborator, JAY-Z, has used his name in uppercase or lowercase, with or without script.
The Mexican AMLO promises not to use the army against the civilian population
Mexican President-elect Andrés Manuel López Obrador has vowed never to use the army against the civilian population, now that the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students in the country is approaching.
On Saturday, López Obrador promised in Plaza Tlatelolco that he "would never use the army to repress the people of Mexico."
On October 2, 1968, troops fired at a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing 300 people at a time when leftist student movements were tightening throughout Latin America.
López Obrador is committed to supporting young Mexicans by giving monthly grants to those who study and opening more free public universities.
He claimed that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities led young people to integrate into criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double I.A. funding.
Now that China is more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double its investment in research in this field, says Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and professional from I.A. who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after announcements concerning I.A. from various parts of the U.S. government, even when, in general, the U.S. lacks an official I.A. strategy.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: its goal is to become the number 1 innovation in IA by 2030.
“Duplicating the budget for I.A. research would be a good start, given that all other countries go far behind the U.S. We have a look at the next advance in the field of I.A.”
Double funding means double the likelihood that the next big achievement in IA will be achieved in the U.S., as Lee stated in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the executive director of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China’s leading I.A. companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an I.A. system that defeated Othello’s best American player. Later, he was executive at Microsoft Research and president of Google’s subsidiary in China.
Lee gave recognition to previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the DARPA Robotics Challenge, and asked when it would be next, which would allow identifying the next generation of visionaries.
In the U.S., researchers often have to work hard to get government subsidies, Lee said.
“It’s not China that’s taking academic leaders; it’s corporations,” Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired prominent people from universities to work at I.A.
Lee commented that changes in immigration policy could also help the U.S. intensify its initiatives in IA.
“I think doctors in I.A. should have permanent residence cards automatically,” he said.
The State Council of China presented its Plan for the Development of the Next Generation of Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
The National Science Foundation of China funds people from academic institutions just like the National Science Foundation and other government organizations fund American researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, which aims to attract partners from the industrial and academic spheres, while the White House announced the formation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, this month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the National Science Foundation, it currently invests more than $100 million a year in research from I.A.
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislation that tried to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not taken any action in months.
The Macedonians decided in a referendum on whether to change the name of their country
The people of Macedonia decided in a referendum on Sunday whether to change their name to “Republic of North Macedonia,” a gesture that would resolve a decades-long conflict with Greece, which had blocked its bid to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that its northern neighbor’s name is a claim to its territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, both governments reached an agreement on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slav population, mostly in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign has questioned whether participation will reach the minimum 50% required for the referendum to be considered valid.
The referendum paper asked the following question: "Is it in favour of joining NATO and the EU with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying for Macedonia, one of the countries emerging from the disintegration of Yugoslavia, to try to access bodies like the EU and NATO.
“Today I have come to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the protection of the European Union, because this means a safer life for all,” said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it will not be legally binding, many Members of Parliament have said they will respect the result of the vote to make it decisive.
The change of name requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission stated that no irregularities had been reported by 1 p.m.
However, the turnout was only 16%, compared to 34% of the last parliamentary elections held in 2016, when 66% of registered voters cast their vote.
"I have come to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, who voted in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko cast their vote in the Macedonian referendum on a country name change that would open the way for NATO and the European Union to join in Strumica (Macedonia) on September 30, 2018.
In front of Parliament, in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov was preparing a small stage and pulling out chairs in front of the tents planted by those who were going to boycott the referendum.
"We are in favor of entering NATO and the EU, but we want to do it with our heads high, not through the back door," Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want us to enter as Macedonia, we can establish relations with other countries, such as China and Russia, and be part of Eurasian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership would provide the investment that Macedonia so much needs, whose unemployment rate is more than 20%.
"I think the vast majority will be in favor, as more than 80% of citizens are in favor of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after casting his vote.
He said a positive result would be a “confirmation of our future.”
A poll published Monday by the Institute for Policy Research said that between 30 and 43% of voters would participate in the referendum, which means less participation than required.
Another survey conducted by Macedonia’s Telma TV revealed that 57 percent of respondents had planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% said they would vote in favour.
For the referendum to be considered a success, participation must be 50% plus one vote.
Should it fail, it would be the first serious blow to pro-Western government policy since it came to power in May last year.
Watch this: Manchester City’s Sergio Agüero avoids the entire Brighton defense to score a goal
Sergio Agüero and Raheem Sterling topped Brighton's defense in a 2-0 victory for Manchester City on Saturday at Manchester's Etihad Stadium.
For Agüero, it was ridiculously easy to score a goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentine midfielder received a pass in the midfield at the beginning of the game.
He ran between three Brighton defenders before entering the open field.
Once there, he was surrounded by four green shirts.
He evaded a defense before overtaking several others on the edge of the Brighton area.
He made a pass to the left, where Sterling was.
The English forward used his first touch in the area to return the ball to Agüero, who hit him with his right foot to avoid goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot that reached the right side of the net.
"Agüero has some foot problems," Pep Guardiola, City coach, told reporters.
“We talked about playing between 55 and 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored a goal at the time.”
However, it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial lead in the Premier League contest.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
In that play, Agüero received the ball well within the territory of Brighton.
He made a nice ball pass to the left flank for Leroy Sane.
Sane gave him a few taps before heading Sterling towards the second pole.
The Sky Blues frontman threw the ball into the net just before coming out of bounds.
City face Hoffenheim in a Champions League group match on Tuesday at 12:55 at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim (Germany).
Scherzer wants to give the Rockies a party
With the Nationals eliminated from the playoffs, there was no reason to force another opening.
Still, the always-competitive Scherzer hopes to step on the mound on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if they triumphed against the Los Angeles Dodgers in the West Division of the National League, they still have opportunities in the playoffs.
The Rockies secured at least one wildcard spot thanks to a 5-2 victory over the Nationals on Friday night, but they are still pursuing their first division title.
“Although we don’t play anything, we can at least step on the gum with the certainty that the Denver audience will be excited and that the other team will probably play at the highest level I’ve faced this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to participate?”
The Nationals still have to announce an opener for Sunday, but it seems they are inclined to let Scherzer be thrown into that situation.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th opening, did a practice session on Thursday and will return to his normal rest on Sunday.
Washington’s right-hand record is 18 wins and 7 losses, with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts with 2/3 in 220 entries.
Trump meets in West Virginia
The president made indirect references to the situation around Brett Kavanaugh, his selection for the Supreme Court, when he talked about the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
“In November, everything we’ve done is at stake.
Five weeks are left for one of the most important choices of our lives.
It’s one of the most important, I don’t present myself, but it’s a race, so I’m going from one place to another fighting to get great candidates,” he said.
“We have this terrible radical group of Democrats, it’s happening right now.
And they are determined to regain power by all the necessary means, you see meekness, evil.
They don’t care who they hurt or who they have to go over to get power and control, that’s what they want, power and control, and we’re not going to give it to them.”
The Democrats, he said, are embarking on a mission of “resistance and obstruction.”
“We’ve seen it these last four days,” he said, saying the Democrats “were angry, they were bad, they were horrible and they were fake.”
He referred to the Senate Judiciary Commission by naming Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, who received the abuses from the public.
“Do you remember his answer?
Do you filter the document?
Mmm, Mmm, what?
No, no mmm, I expect an answer. Her body language was terrible, the worst I've ever seen."
The Labour Party already embraces a wide range of opinions.
He is intolerant of people who say what they think.
When momentum activists from my local party voted to censor me, I was barely surprised.
After all, I am the last in a row of Labour Party Members of Parliament who are told they are not welcome, and just to say what we think.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, received a similar treatment being categorically against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censure criticized me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
I disagreed with the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe. It is ironic that these were matters in which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
As stated in the notice of the Nottingham East Labour Party meeting on Friday, “we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
For most of the eight years I have been a Member of Parliament of the local Labour Party, that is exactly what the Friday night meetings of the General Committee have been.
Unfortunately, this is not the current tone of many meetings and the promise of a "more kind and kind" policy is already more than forgotten, if indeed it was applied at some point.
It is becoming increasingly clear that dissenting opinions are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that each opinion is judged on the basis of whether or not party leaders consider it acceptable.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, when colleagues with whom he previously thought he shared a similar political vision began to expect him to radically change his mind and take positions with which he would never have agreed, either on national security or on the EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public, no matter what I say, there is a diatribe of insults on social media demanding my retirement, denouncing the center’s policies, telling me I shouldn’t be in the Labour Party.
I'm not the only one who has experienced it.
Indeed, I know I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, as comments about me tend to be political.
I am amazed at the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face a torrent of sexist or racist insults on a daily basis, but never run away.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is the normalization of insults.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we no longer have that wide range of opinions and, with each “censorship” motion or each change in the rules of selection, the party becomes narrower.
Over the past two years, I’ve received a lot of advice recommending that I keep my head down and not make myself hear so much and that that way “it would be okay”.
But I didn’t get into politics to do that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a high school student, motivated by the negligence of the Thatcher government that left the classroom of my integral school literally in ruins, I have tried to support the improvement of public services for those who need them most, either as a councillor or as a government minister.
I have never concealed my political ideas, not even in the last election.
It is impossible for anyone in Nottingham East to be unaware of my political stances or the areas in which I disagreed with current leaders.
The only thing I would say to those who promoted Friday’s motion is that I don’t understand this eagerness to waste time and energy on questions about my loyalty to the Labour Party leader when the country heads for a Brexit that will affect households, businesses and utilities.
The real message is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for voters, Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no withdrawal threat or political opportunism will prevent me from doing what I think is best for all of you.

Ayr 38 - Melrose 17: an undefeated Ayr rises to the top
Two rehearsals at the end of the match may have decided to some extent the final result, but, without a doubt, Ayr deserved the victory in this entertaining match of Tennent's Premiership day.
They now head the table and are the only undefeated team out of the ten participating.
In the end, it was the superiority of his defense, as well as his ability to take better advantage of the opportunities, that granted the victory to the local team, so coach Peter Murchie had every right to be happy.
"We've been tested in every game and we're still unbeaten, so I have to be happy," he said.
Melrose's Robyn Christie commented, "Ayr deserves recognition, they took advantage of the opportunities better than us."
Grant Anderson's rehearsal in the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, placed Ayr ahead; but a yellow card to Scottish captain Rory Hughes, Warriors loan for the game, allowed Melrose to take advantage of this opponent's disadvantage and Jason Baggot got an unconverted rehearsal.
Climo expanded Ayr's lead with a penalty. Earlier, just in the middle, he scored and turned a solo rehearsal, leaving the score in 17-5 in favor of Ayr in the break.
However, the Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's rehearsal, converted by Baggot, reduced this difference to five points.
Then there was a long interruption due to a serious injury from Ruaridh Knott, whom they had to pull on a stretcher, and, as the game resumed, Ayr advanced with a Stafford McDowall rehearsal converted by Climo.
The yellow card to Ayr captain Blair Macpherson allowed Melrose to take advantage again of having one more man with an unconverted rehearsal of Bruce Colvine, at the end of a period of enormous pressure.
However, the locals recovered and when Struan Hutchinson was shown the yellow card for scoring Climo without the ball, from the penalty line, MacPherson did a rehearsal when he was in the back of the advancing maul.
Climo converted it, as he had been doing almost since the game resumed, after Kyle Rowe received the ball sent by David Armstrong from a kick and sent Gregor Henry to the bottom to do the fifth rehearsal of the venues.
The protagonist of Still Game wants to direct his career towards the catering sector
Still Game star Ford Kieran seems determined to move into the catering sector after it was revealed that he has been appointed director of a restaurant chain.
The 56-year-old actor is Jack Jarvis on the famous BBC show, who writes and co-stars with his longtime comedy partner, Greg Hemphill.
The duo have announced that the ninth season will be the last of the series, and it looks like Kiernan is making plans for his life after Craiglang.
According to the official record, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor did not want to comment on the matter, although a source for the Scottish Sun noted that Kiernan wanted to get involved in Glasgow's "flowing restoration market."
"The sea belongs to us": a Bolivia without a coastline has hopes that the court will reopen the route to the Pacific
Marines guard a naval headquarters in La Paz.
In public buildings they wave blue sea flags.
From Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, the naval bases show the motto: "The sea belongs to us by right,
Recovering it is a duty.”
Across Bolivia, a land without a sea, they still remember vividly the coast lost to Chile in a bloody conflict over resources that took place in the 19th century, in addition to the desire to re-season the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes may be the greatest in decades, as Bolivia awaits a resolution by the International Court of Justice on October 1, after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity and, of course, is waiting for the result with a positive vision," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will observe the International Court of Justice’s ruling on large screens across the country, hoping that the Hague court will rule in favor of Bolivia’s claim that, after decades of intermittent talks, Chile has an obligation to negotiate to grant Bolivia a sovereign exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, who is fighting a controversial battle for re-election next year, also has a lot to say about Monday’s resolution.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean,” he promised at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe it is unlikely that the court will decide in favor of Bolivia and that the situation would change little if it did.
The United Nations agency based in the Netherlands has no power to award Chilean territory and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
The fact that the decision of the International Court of Justice comes only six months after the final allegations indicates that the case "was not complicated," said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
Far from promoting the cause of Bolivia, the last four years may have stunned it.
“The problem of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration,” Zárate said.
In addition, he suggested that Morales’ belligerent rhetoric has undermined any residual Chilean goodwill.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to hold talks after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltze, Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court’s decision-making was unusually quick.
On Monday, Bolivia will be offered “an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile” and the possibility of “ending 139 years of mutually beneficial disagreements,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents, would use the maritime issue as a political crutch.
“Bolivia will never renounce its right to access the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
“The resolution is an opportunity to see that we have to leave the past behind.”
North Korea says there will be no nuclear disarmament unless it can trust the U.S.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never be the first to end nuclear disarmament if it can’t trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to deliver on promises made during a summit held in Singapore among rival leaders.
His comments come at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be about to resume paralyzed nuclear diplomatic talks more than three months after this summit with North Korea’s leader Kim Jong-un.
Ri points out that the continuation of continued sanctions and U.S. opposition to a declaration that ends the Korean War to subdue the North is a “chimera.”
Washington is suspicious of accepting the statement without Pyongyang making any significant disarmament moves before.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want to hold another summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism about Pyongyang’s seriousness in renouncing an arsenal that the country probably sees as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for another summit between the presidents.
Paris fashion shows reveal the latest line of huge hats that are about to land on a shopping street near you
If you want to increase your collection of hats or completely protect yourself from the sun, look no further.
Valentino and Thom Browne’s designers unveiled a set of eccentric large hats for their spring-summer 2019 collection on the runway, dazzling the style of Paris Fashion Week.
Impossible hats have flooded Instagram this summer and these designers have brought their spectacular creations to the catwalk.
Valentino’s most outstanding piece was a beige hat with a wide wing adorned with feathers that wrapped the heads of the models.
Other large-sized additions were jeweled watermelons, a witch hat, and even a pineapple, but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of bizarre masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had sewn lips and resembled Hannibal Lecter more than the high seam.
One creation was reminiscent of a complete scuba gear, snorkeling and glasses included, while another looked like a melted ice cream cone.
If you like big fashion, you are in luck.
Style hunters predict that huge hats could begin to appear on the streets of shops.
The big hats come hand in hand with a straw hat with a wing of more than 60 centimeters used by all, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind this so impractical hat that flooded social media presented another great creation on the walkway: a straw beach bag as large as the swimsuit model that wore it.
The dark orange raffia bag, decorated with raffia flakes and a white leather handle, was the main piece in the Jacquemus Riviera collection for the spring-summer 2019 season at the Paris Fashion Week.
As famous stylist Luke Armitage commented to FEMAIL: "Next summer, I hope to see huge hats and beach bags on the shopping streets. Since the designer has had a big impact, it would be hard to ignore the demand for large-sized accessories."
John Edward: Language skills are fundamental for the citizens of the world
Scotland’s independent educational centers have a track record of academic excellence that has continued in 2018 with another set of extraordinary exam results that is reinforced by individual and collective successes harvested in the areas of sport, art, music and other community projects.
With more than 30,000 pupils across Scotland, these centres, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to deliver the best level of service to pupils and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students to continue their higher education studies, for the career they choose and for the place they occupy as world citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and implement an adapted curriculum, it is noted that modern languages remain a popular and desired subject in the centers.
As Nelson Mandela said, “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, the message comes to his head.
If you speak to him in his tongue, it reaches his heart.”
This is a powerful reminder that if you want to establish relationships and build trust with people from other countries, you cannot rely solely on English.
If we take into account the recent results of this year’s exams, we can see that languages are at the top of the rankings, with the highest passing rates in independent schools.
In total, 68% of students who studied foreign languages received an A, the highest grade.
The data, collected from the 74 SCIS centres, showed that 72% of students obtained an A in Mandarin, while 72% of those who studied German, 69% of those who studied French and 63% of those who studied Spanish also obtained an A.
This demonstrates that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as a fundamental competence that both children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
At present, it is considered that, as a subject, languages are at the same level as the CTIM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) subjects in the curricula of independent colleges and everywhere.
A 2014 survey by the UK Commission on Employment and Competencies revealed that 17 % of the reasons given by employers for the difficulties they encountered in covering jobs were attributed to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are increasingly indispensable in preparing young people for their future careers.
Possible job opportunities that require languages are on the rise, so these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career someone chooses, if they have learned a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future thanks to a competition like this, which will last a lifetime.
Being able to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will allow that person to automatically outperform the competition.
According to a survey conducted by YouGov among more than 4000 UK adults in 2013, 75% of them did not speak any foreign language well enough to maintain a conversation, and the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage, 15%, was French.
For this reason, investing in language teaching is now important for children today.
If they speak several languages, especially those in developing economies, children will be equipped to have better opportunities to find quality employment.
In Scotland, each school will teach different languages.
Some centers will focus on the most classical modern languages, while others will teach the languages considered most important for the UK by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the interests of a child, in independent schools you can always choose between several languages taught by teachers specializing in this subject.
Independent educational centres in Scotland dedicate all their efforts to providing a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills needed to succeed, whatever the future holds for them.
At present, it is undeniable that, in a global business environment, languages continue to be of vital importance for the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages must be considered "competence for international communication".
Independent schools will continue to offer these options, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
We have to do it.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Colleges.
LeBron debuts with the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The wait for fans waiting to see LeBron James debut in his first game with the Los Angeles Lakers is about to end.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play the preseason opening game Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, it remains to be determined how many minutes he will play.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James was likely to play for a few minutes.
After a training session earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers’ six-game preseason program.
“At this stage of my career, I don’t need pre-season games to prepare,” he said.
Time of Trump rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump begins a series of campaign rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of Trump’s five planned rallies next week, including stops at places with supporters, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With his nominee’s confirmation vote to fill the pending Supreme Court vacancy, Trump seeks support for the upcoming midterm elections as Republicans risk losing control of Congress when the votes are cast in November.
What time is Trump's rally in West Virginia tonight and how can it be watched online?
The Trump rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 19:00 tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch it online through a live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to comment on this week’s appearances of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who were strained over allegations of sexual misconduct and have put on hold an early Senate confirmation vote for at least a week as the FBI investigates them.
However, the main goal of this series of rallies is to help Republicans facing the November election take a boost.
President Trump’s campaign said the five rallies next week aim to “encourage volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they retain in the Senate and House of Representatives.”
“Congress control is so crucial to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we enter the campaign,” a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters.
Scheduled at Wheeling's Wesbanco Arena, the rally tonight could attract "Ohio and Pennsylvania supporters, as well as have coverage in the Pittsburgh media," as reported by the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in a month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state in which he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, a Republican candidate for the West Virginia Senate, who is lagging behind in polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come to give him a boost in the polls,” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
Ryder Cup 2018: The U.S. team demonstrates that they dare to fight to keep hope alive in the face of Sunday’s individual matches.
After three individual sessions, Saturday afternoon foursomes may be what this Ryder Cup needed.
The Pulse Oscillating Pendulum is a completely invented sports concept, but players really believe in it, even more so in competitions like these.
So where would you say the impulse is now?
"We were six points ahead and now we are four, so I guess that can be considered a small boost," Spieth said.
Europe has an advantage, of course: four points ahead with twelve more in play.
As Spieth points out, Americans feel they have some wind in their favor and plenty of reasons to be excited, among other reasons by the pair of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and scored three points out of four each.
Spieth has been lethal from tee to green and preaches by example.
The celebratory gutural screams rose in volume as his round progressed, introducing a vital putt to tie the fourth game as he and Thomas went two down after two holes.
The putt that gave them the game on the 15th was received with a similar cry, from those who broadcast that believe that the American team has not yet left out.
"What we need to do is redouble our efforts and focus on the game," Spieth said.
That’s what these players have done.
18 holes to leave a mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed history of the Ryder Cup.
The strange and adorable couple from Europe takes four out of four and nothing can go wrong with them.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't make a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also avoided the bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and in the last nine holes on Friday morning.
That streak and the way his energy flows with the bustling public make it clear that these are the players to beat on Sunday, and that there will be no other players as popular as Fleetwood and Molinari to seal a possible European victory when the sun sets at Le Golf National.
Preferably, the two at the same time in different holes.
Still, it is still premature to speak of European glory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson dispatched Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning's four balls, after forming a couple with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles in the first nine holes buried the Spaniard and the Swede in a hole from which they could not get out.
But on Sunday there will be no help coming out of the holes.
Fourballs and foursomes are fascinating to watch closely because you appreciate the interactions between couples, the tips they give and the ones they don’t, and the way a strategy can change in an instant.
So far, Europe has played better as a team and has a big lead over the last day, but this foursome session also showed that the U.S. team dares to fight, something some, especially the Americans, doubted.
Europe advances 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe starts with a good lead on the last day of the Ryder Cup, after finishing the fourballs and the foursomes with a score of 10-6 over the United States.
The motivated duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the contest with two wins over a struggling Tiger Woods, ahead of four points in the Le Golf National standings.
European Thomas Bjorn, trying to preserve the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an American team that made many mistakes during the morning fourballs, which ended 3-1.
The U.S. offered more endurance in the foursomes, winning two games, but failed to shorten distances.
American Jim Furyk needs to score eight points from Sunday’s 12 individual matches to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row, and he and Molinari, who received the nickname "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are the second pair to win four points in their first four games in Ryder Cup history.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, their magnificent union served to defeat a discouraged Woods and American rookie Bryson Decahmbeau by a 5-4 round.
Woods, who hadn’t made much headlines in Saturday’s two games, had occasional moments of brilliance, but has now lost 19 of his 29 fourballs and foursomes games, and seven straight.
Justin Rose, who was resting for the morning fourballs, was again Henrik Stenson's partner in the foursomes, defeating Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, world number one and number three respectively, with a 2-1 result.
Although the day was pleasant and quiet in the southwest of Paris, Europe did not have everything on its side.
The three-time winner, Jordan Spieth, and Justin Thomas served as references to the Americans, scoring two points on Saturday.
They scored an exciting 2-1 win over Ian Poulter and Spanish Jon Rahm in the fourballs and then defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in the foursomes after losing the initial two holes.
In Ryder Cup history, a team recovering from a four-point difference in individual matches has only happened twice, although Furyk, as the trophy holder, only needs a tie to keep it.
Although they have been the second best for two days, it seems that carrying out a counter-attack on Sunday is beyond their possibilities.
North Korea says there is "no chance" that they will disarm first unilaterally if they do not have confidence
On Saturday, the North’s foreign minister told the United Nations that the continuation of sanctions deepened his mistrust of the United States and that there was no possibility that his country would unilaterally renounce nuclear weapons under those circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the International Organization’s annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken “important measures of goodwill” over the past year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling nuclear testing facilities and committing to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we have not received any similar response from the United States," he said.
"If we don't have confidence in the United States, we can't have confidence in our national security, and in those circumstances, there's no chance we'll disarm unilaterally first."
Although Ri reiterated North Korea’s well-known complaints about Washington’s resistance to a “phased” denuclearization formula that rewards the country as it takes gradual steps, his statement is important, as he did not without further rejecting a unilateral denuclearization, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump following the first summit between an active U.S. president and a North Korean leader on June 12 in Singapore, when Kim pledged to work for the “denuclearization of the Korean peninsula” and Trump guaranteed North Korea’s security.
North Korea has pursued the official end of the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said Pyongyang must give up its nuclear weapons sooner.
Washington has also resisted calls to soften international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States has insisted on denuclearization first and has increased pressure through sanctions in order to achieve its purpose coercively, even by objecting to a declaration ending the war," Ri said.
“The idea that sanctions can make us fall on our knees is a chimera of people who don’t know us.
The problem is that the continuation of sanctions deepens our mistrust.”
Ri made no mention of the plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, announced by the U.S. leader before the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings held between South Korea’s leader Kim and Moon Jae over the past five months, adding: “If South Korea had been interested in denuclearization rather than the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not be in such a stalemate.”
Even so, the tone of Ri’s speech was radically different from last year’s speech, when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable to direct North Korea’s missiles to U.S. soil after “evil president” Trump, on a suicide mission, called Kim “a rocket man.”
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea, praised Kim for his bravery in advancing toward disarmament, but said there was still a lot to do and that sanctions needed to continue until North Korea denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said there was no set deadline for this: “We can take two years, three years or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its advances.
However, as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday, “The imposition of Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously and without breach until we realize definitive and fully verified denuclearization.”
The Security Council has unanimously imposed sanctions on North Korea since 2006, in an attempt to cut funding for Pyongyang’s ballistic missile and nuclear programs.
Pompeo spoke with Ri outside the UN General Assembly and later commented that he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was not good.
He left Pyongyang in July saying progress had been made, but a few hours later, North Korea denounced his "demands as those of a mobster."
In a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle a missile site and a nuclear complex if the United States applied the "corresponding measures."
He said Kim had told him that the “corresponding measures” he was seeking were the security assurances Trump had promised in Singapore and steps toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to get enough rest
Thanks to a new course taught this year at Harvard University, all college students sleep more in an attempt to fight the growing male culture of studying all night drinking caffeine.
One professor found that students at the world’s number one university usually have no idea about basic self-care.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School, and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital designed the course, is believed to be the first of its kind in the U.S.
His motivation to start the course came after giving a talk about how sleep deprivation affects learning.
“At the end of the course, a girl came up to me and asked me why she just found out about this now, in her final year.
He said no one had ever told him about the importance of sleep, which surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
The course, taught for the first time this year, explains to students the basic concepts of how good sleep habits contribute to academic and sports performance, as well as improving overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university’s health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students barely slept during the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section, there is an image of a bedroom, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, sneakers and books that inform them of the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of lack of sleep on athletic performance and the importance of establishing a routine to go to sleep.
In another section, participants are informed about how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, embolism, depression, and cancer.
Then, a campus icon with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
“We know it’s not going to change the behavior of students instantly.
However, we believe that they have a right to know, just as anyone has a right to know the health effects of smoking tobacco,” added Professor Czeisler.
He asserted that the culture of pride for "passing the night on the watch" still exists and added that modern technology and the increasing pressure to which students are subjected meant that sleep deprivation was a growing problem.
Sleeping long enough and a good quality sleep should be students’ “secret weapon” to combat stress, fatigue and anxiety; even to avoid gaining weight, as sleep deprivation causes the brain to generate a feeling of hunger, so they want to eat all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemistry and physics biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after attending one of his classes the previous year during his first year at Harvard.
He noted that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to expand it throughout the campus.
It hopes the next step is to ask all graduate students to complete a similar study program before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler’s recommendation is that students think about putting an alarm to go to bed and another to wake up, and be aware of the harmful effects of the “blue light” emitted by the screens of electrical appliances and LEDs, which can alter circadian rhythms, so they would end up having trouble falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - Rangers 0: Menga's goal grabs Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another episode of depression outside the home, when Dolly Menga's attack banished Steven Gerrard's disarticulated team to a 1-0 defeat at Livingston.
The Ibrox wanted to get their first win away from home since the February 4–1 win at St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt’s team defeated Gerrard’s for the second time in 18 games as a coach, leaving their team eight points behind of the Hearts, unsuccessful leaders of the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga's attack occurred seven minutes before halftime and the Rangers' uninspired alignment was not up to date at any time.
Now, the Rangers are down to sixth position, Livingston is up to third, behind the Hibernian for the goal difference.
The Rangers may face more problems, as line judge Calum Spence had to receive medical attention for a head injury after someone allegedly threw an object from the visiting background.
Gerrard changed eight of the headers who won the match against Ayr, entering the semi-finals of the Scottish League Cup.
For his part, Holt pulled out the 11 Livingston players who scored a point to the Hearts last week and would have been delighted by the way his highly organized team drowned opponents at all times.
The Rangers may have had more possession, but Livingston took better advantage of the ball when they had it.
They should have scored two minutes from the start, when Menga made a space pass for Scott Pittman who passed between the defense, leaving him alone in front of Allan McGregor, but the midfielder sent her out.
Keaghan Jacobs pulled a deep draw for Captain Craig Halket, but his teammate in defense, Alan Lithgow, was only able to send it out for the long stick.
The Rangers regained control, but there seemed to be more hope than conviction about their game in the final third.
There is no doubt that Alfredo Morelos felt he had penalties in the 15th minute of the game, when he and Steven Lawless collided, but referee Steven Thomson made deaf ears at the Colombian's request.
The Rangers scored two goal shots in the first half, but Ibrox's former goalkeeper, Liam Kelly, barely saw himself in trouble to deal with Lassana Coulibaly's head and Ovie Ejaria's boring throw.
Although the goal scored in the 34th minute by Livingston came against all odds, no one can deny that they deserved it for the dedicated effort.
Again, the Rangers failed to cope with Jacobs's deep, still-ball play.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher fit the ball for Scott Robinson, who kept calm and passed it to Menga to score the goal.
In the break, Gerrard replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, which had an almost immediate impact as the steering wheel passed over to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly stepped out of his line to block him.
Still, Livingston continued to lead visitors exactly to the type of game they liked, with Lithgow and Halkett clearing one long pass after another.
Holt's could have taken more advantage in the final stages, but McGregor stood firm to reject Jacobs before Lithgow finished a header corner that didn't get in.
Rangers substitute Glen Middleton claimed a penalty kick towards the end of the game after an encounter with Jacobs, but, again, Thomson looked elsewhere.
Almanac: The Inventor of the Geiger Counter
And now, a page of the Almanac section of the "Sunday Morning": September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago, and CONTANDO... was born in Germany the future physical Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that culminated with the device known as the Geiger counter.
The Geiger accountant, who has since been a pillar of science, also became a pillar of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "The Crown Bells", with actors Roy Rogers and Dale Evans in the seemingly incompatible roles of jeans scientists:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, it's used to locate radioactive minerals, like uranium.
By putting on the headphones, you can hear the effect of the waves emitted by the radioactivity of the minerals.”
Evans: "It's like a radio!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, when he was about to turn 63.
But the invention that bears his name is still alive.
A New Cancer Vaccine May Teach the Immune System to “See” Malignant Cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” malignant cells and kill them.
As part of the treatment, the vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells.
The method requires the extraction of immune cells from a patient and altering them in the laboratory.
Thus, they can “see” a protein common to many cancers and re-inject them.
A vaccine trial is generating promising results in patients with different cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method requires extracting immune cells from a patient and altering them in the lab so that they can “see” a protein common to many cancers, called HER2, and then re-injecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results suggest we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “promotes the growth of different types of cancer,” such as breast, ovarian, lung or colorectal cancer, Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach to taking patients' immune cells and "teaching" them to attack cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West embarked on a pro-Trump diatribe with a MAGA cap after his appearance on SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was bullied in the Saturday Night Live studio after an erratic performance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump, and said he would run for office in 2020.
After the third song of the night, called Ghost Town, during which he wore the cap with the message Make America Great Again, he began to despotize against Democrats and reiterate his support for Trump.
“I often talk to someone white and ask me how I can like Trump if he’s racist.
“Well, if I were concerned about racism, I would have left the United States a long time ago,” he said.
SNL began Matt Damon’s sketch show in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh’s statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding allegations of sexual assault made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not retransmitted, comedian Chris Rock uploaded the recording of West's broncho to social media.
It is unclear if Rock was trying to ridicule West with the publication.
In addition, West told the public that he had had a bad time behind the scenes for wearing that cap.
“They messed with me.
I was told not to come out with the cap on.
They messed with me!
And then they tell me I’m asleep,” he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see how sleepy I am?" and added that he was "going to put on his superman coat, because that meant no one could tell him what he had to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try it with love.”
His comments received abuse from the public on at least two occasions and SNL members appeared to be embarrassed, according to Variety. One person told the magazine: "The study was completely silent."
West had been invited to replace singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days ago.
West baffled many when he went on stage to sing I Love It dressed like a bottle of Perrier.
West received support from the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: “To one of the bravest spirits: THANK YOU FOR RESISTING BEFORE THE WOMAN.”
Karen Hunter, host of an interview program, tweeted that West was simply “being himself and that’s absolutely wonderful.”
“But I decide NOT to reward someone (by buying their music or their clothes, or supporting their art) who I consider to be embracing and spreading a dangerous ideology for my community.
He's free.
We too," he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that the name had been changed, saying he was now "the person formerly known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name, following in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His colleague, Snoop Dogg, has also been called Snoop Lion, not to mention the missing music legend, Prince, who changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist formerly known as Prince.
Attempted murder charge for stabbed to death at Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, according to police.
The defendant is expected to appear at the Belfast Court of First Instance on Monday.
The prosecution will review the charges.
Kit Harington, Game of Thrones star, attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is famous for his role as Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
The 31-year-old actor has attacked the male hero’s stereotype, saying those screenplays often conveyed to young boys that they had to be tough to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit commented that he believes "something has gone wrong" and questioned how to address the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones co-star, Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that she finds it "quite important" to address this issue.
"Personally, it seems pretty important to me at this point, where have we been wrong about masculinity?" he said.
“What have we been teaching men as they grew up, thinking about the problems you see now?”
Kit believes television may have part of the responsibility for the growing toxic masculinity due to its so masculine characters.
He continued, “What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught on television, and on the street, that makes young people feel that they have to be this particular form of man?
I think that's one of the big questions of our time. How do we change it?
Because it is clear that something has gone wrong in the education of young people.”
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not participate in any prequel or sequel to Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, stating he is "tired of battlefields and horses."
Starting in November, Kit will star in True West, Sam Shepard’s play that tells the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
Recently, the actor revealed that he believes getting to know his wife Rose is the best he's ever gotten from Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife on the show, so in that sense, she has given me my future family and my life from now on.”
Rose portrayed Ygritte, the love interest of Kit's character, Jon Snow, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple got married in June 2018 on a Leslie family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% more new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
There are more than 820,000 people affected in the country, according to the health authorities.
Around 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of these were sexually transmitted, which is a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly to parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who contract HIV in this way has been reduced in its entirety, Chinese health authorities said at a congress held in Yunnan province.
Every year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increases by about 100,000 people.
Sexually transmitted HIV is a serious problem in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but the LGBT collective suffers a lot of discrimination.
Because of the country’s conservative values, studies have estimated that between 70% and 90% of men who have sex with other men will end up marrying women.
Many of the transmissions of diseases are due to not using adequate protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicines as part of an attempt to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a member of her staff leaked data from Republican Party senators and claims that these are "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday criticized allegations that a member of her staff had published the personal data of three U.S. Republican senators on Wikipedia's pages about lawmakers.
The Los Angeles Democrat said those allegations were driven by “extreme-right” commentators and websites.
“Lies, lies, and more vile lies,” Waters said in a tweet.
The information allegedly included the addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch of Utah.
On Thursday, an unknown person from the Capitol posted the information on the Internet during a Senate panel session regarding allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak took place sometime after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address identifying the origin of the posts was associated with the Waters office and made public the data of a Waters staff member, according to the Capitol.
“This unfounded allegation is completely false and an absolute lie,” Waters continued.
“The member of my staff, whose identity, personal data and security have been affected as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations, was in no way responsible for the leak of this information.
This unfounded allegation is completely false and an absolute lie.”
Waters’ statement sparked immediate criticism on the Internet, including those of former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“Dismiss this information with anger,” Fleischer wrote.
"This suggests not the temperance necessary to be a Member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn’t do, they shouldn’t be angry.
He must not rebel.
You must not question the charges against the accused.
It must keep calm and serenity.”
It seems that Fleischer wanted to compare Waters’ reaction to Democrats’ criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, whom critics accused of appearing too angry during Thursday’s appearance.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate seeking to defeat Waters in the midterm elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
“If it’s true, it’s very serious,” he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said his office had alerted "the relevant authorities and law enforcement agencies of these fraudulent allegations."
“We will make sure that the perpetrators are discovered and that they are held legally responsible for all these destructive and dangerous actions for all members of my staff.”
Johnny English: Rowan Atkinson's spy parody is back in action
Now it has become a tradition to look for hints to Brexit in any new film with a British focus. It seems this is what it takes to do with this new installment of the parodic action and comedy franchise Johnny English, which started in 2003 with Johnny English and came back to life in 2011 with Johnny English Returns.
Is this ironic self-satisfied about how clearly nonsense we are the nation’s new export opportunity?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English, with his salty eyes and his inexpressive face, has renewed his license to get his leg in for a second time. Only his name already gives clues that, more than anything, it is a comic creation designed for non-English speaking cinematic territories.
Of course, he’s the ridiculous secret agent who, despite his odd glamorous pretensions, has a bit of Clouseau, a touch of Mr. Bean and a pinch of that kind that played a single note on the theme of Fire Cars that was played at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
In addition, he was originally based on the mysterious international traveller portrayed years ago by Atkinson in Barclaycard’s already forgotten TV commercials, sowing chaos behind him.
In this last installment, there are one or two good moments.
I loved watching Johnny English approach a helicopter dressed in medieval armor as the propellers collided with the helmet.
Atkinson’s gift for physical comedy jumps in the face, but the humor gets pretty short and is strangely superfluous, especially now that “serious” movie franchises like 007 and Mission Impossible add comic ingredients seamlessly.
Humor seems more to children than to adults, and to me, Johnny English’s absurd misfortunes are not as ingenious and right as Atkinson’s silent jokes in the role of Mr. Bean.
Now, the repeated current argument is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A hacker has infiltrated Britain’s top secret spy network, revealing the identities of all its active agents before the dismay of the agent in service, a sadly small role for Kevin Eldon.
It’s the drop that fills the glass for the prime minister, a pompous and tangled character who’s watching her political popularity sink: Emma Thompson gives her best in this character that’s almost like Theresa May, but the script doesn’t leave much room to work.
Your intelligence advisers inform you that, since all active spies are in danger, you will have to resort to someone who is retired.
That’s got to be the clumsy Johnny English, who now teaches at a lazy school, although he gives unofficial lessons on how to be a secret agent: there are some good jokes, as it’s a spy academy similar to that of Rock School.
English is transferred to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and meets with his afflicted former compinche Bough, again represented by Ben Miller.
Now, Bough is a man married to a submarine captain, a nice role for which Vicki Pepperdine is not exploited enough.
Thus, the Batman and Robin who do things terribly wrong in the Secret Service of Her Majesty return to action, with the beautiful fatal woman Ophelia Bulletova, represented by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is falling into the dangerous clutches of a charismatic billionaire from the tech world who claims he can solve Britain’s computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of absurd situations: they disguise themselves as waiters, set fire to an elegant French restaurant, unleash chaos by hiding in Volta’s luxurious yacht; in addition, English becomes pure anarchy as he tries to use a virtual reality helmet to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta’s house.
Definitely, they were used thoroughly in that last sequence, but, as funny and streptious as it may be, the ensemble continues to convey a somewhat childish feeling.
A fairly regular product.
As with the other Johnny English films, I couldn’t help but wonder if the British film industry couldn’t give Rowan Atkinson a role that would do real justice to his talent.
The Labour Party denies that it is drawing up a plan for the British to work four days a week, but they charge five
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party is going to think about a radical plan that the British would work four days a week, but charge five.
Supposedly, the party wants business owners to allocate the savings earned through the Artificial Intelligence (AI) revolution to workers, giving them an extra day off.
Employees would enjoy a three-day weekend for the same salary.
According to the sources, the idea "would fit" into the party's economic plans and agenda to lean the country in favor of the workers.
This shift to a four-day week has received support from the Trade Union Congress, as it is a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
As a senior Labour official told The Sunday Times: An announcement of a revision of the directive is expected before the end of the year.
“It will not be achieved from day to day, but the four-day working week is definitely a matter that the party hopes to incorporate to rebalance the economy in favor of the worker, as well as in the overall industrial strategy of the party.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to back such ideas, as the Green Party has already promised a four-day working week in its 2017 general election campaign.
However, at the moment, not all of the Labour Party supports this decision.
A Labour spokesman said: “The four-day working week is not part of the party’s policy and is not going to be discussed at this time.”
The shadow finance minister, John McDonnell, used the Labour Party conference held last week to expose his idea of making a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was willing to regain powers from "anonymous" and "tapped-up" directors in charge of utility companies.
The minister’s plans in the shadow also include the idea that current shareholders of water companies will not recover their full stake, since a Labour government could apply deductions that correspond to perceived irregularities.
It also confirmed its intention to include workers on the boards of directors of companies and to create inclusive equity funds in which 10% of private sector companies’ shares should be allocated to employees, which would result in annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy talk in "60 Minutes" about FBI investigation around Kavanaugh and if he could make them change their minds
The FBI’s investigation into the allegations made against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote for confirmation as Supreme Court magistrate for at least a week and further raises the question of whether the findings could influence any Republican senator who finally decides to withdraw his support.
In an interview to be aired on Sunday, 60 Minutes journalist Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham talk about whether the FBI could uncover information that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina counterpart.
“Of course,” Kennedy said.
"I was in favor of proceeding with the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after all this happened, that the allegation came out, and I asked him, 'Did you do it?'
He was firm, determined, tacit.”
Graham’s vote, however, seems unmovable.
“I already have a decision made around Brett Kavanaugh and would ignore the charge,” he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett sharply denied it," Graham said, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And none of the people she names have been able to confirm it.
36 years ago.
It’s always the same, I don’t see anything new in this case.”
What is the "Global Citizen Festival"? Has it managed to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music festival, where an impressive star poster gathers for an equally impressive mission: to end poverty in the world.
This year, in its seventh edition, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people moving to the Great Lawn of Central Park to enjoy performances like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness about the real goal of the event: ending extreme poverty in 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international awareness group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
If you want to receive a free ticket for the event (unless you can pay for a VIP ticket), concert attendees have had to complete a series of tasks or “actions”, such as volunteering, sending emails to a world leader, making a phone call or anything else that serves to raise awareness about their goal of ending poverty.
However, what has the Global Citizen achieved 12 years after reaching its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding with a free concert a genuine way of persuading people to take action or is it just a form of so-called “clitivism,” which is called the stance we take when we think we are doing something really useful when signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen claims to have registered more than 19 million “shares” from its supporters in favor of a large number of diverse goals.
Thanks to these actions, they claim to have managed to get world leaders to announce commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion, which will impact the lives of more than 2.250 million people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements that emerged from its shares, of which at least $10 billion has already been disbursed or raised.
The group estimates that guaranteed funds have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Among the most important commitments is "The Power of Nutrition", a UK-based association of investors and executives united with the common commitment to "help children grow and develop to their full potential". To this end, it has been proposed to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help end the country's malnutrition after receiving more than 4700 Global twos Citts
“Thanks to the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens collaborators like you, we can mark a small milestone in the history of social injustice of malnutrition,” said Tracey Ullman, “The Power of Nutrition” ambassador, to the crowd during a concert in April 2018 in London.
The group also said that after carrying out more than 5,000 actions to try to improve nutrition in the UK for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, Power of Nutrition, with which 5 million women and children will benefit from nutrition-related interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on your website about what we believe can be done to remedy extreme poverty,
A Global Citizen contributor responded: “It will be a long and hard road and on many occasions we will stumble and fall.
But, as the human rights and anti-apartheid movements have achieved in the past, we will achieve our goals, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe are some of the performances we will have at this year’s New York event, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. could use the Navy to carry out the blockade on energy exports from Russia - Secretary of the Interior
“If necessary,” Washington could turn to its Navy to prevent Russian energy from shaking markets, including the Middle East, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke revealed, as published in the Washington Examiner.
Zinke argued that Russia’s alliance with Syria, in particular where it operates at the behest of legitimate government, is nothing more than a pretext for expansion into new markets.
"I am convinced that they are in the Middle East to negotiate with energy, as they do with Eastern Europe, becoming the southernmost supplier in Europe," he said.
In addition, according to official information, there are ways and methods to address this issue.
“The United States, with its Navy, has the ability to ensure that sea lanes remain open and, if applicable, could even block them to ensure that energy does not end up in the market,” he said.
Zinke addressed people who attended an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group that defines itself as the “energy consumer voice” in the United States.
In it, he compared the approaches Washington maintains in its negotiations with Russia and Iran, and warned that they are, in fact, the same.
“The economic alternative in Iran and Russia is basically to harness and replace fuels,” he warned, while indicating that Russia only knows one thing to do, which is to base its economy on fossil fuels.
These claims are made when the Trump administration has been trying to boost the export of its liquefied natural gas to Europe and relieve Russia of any function, which is the cheapest option for European consumers.
For this, members of the Trump administration, including Donald Trump himself, try to persuade Germany to abandon the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which, according to Trump, will make Berlin a hostage to Moscow.
Moscow has insisted at all times that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which reaches a value of $11 billion and is intended to double the current capacity of the pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s fierce opposition to the project responds solely to economic motives and is a further show of unfair competition.
“I think we all share the idea that energy cannot become a tool of pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after meeting U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow last September.
The US position has, however, met with the rejection of Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The industry-leading organisation in Germany, the German Federation of Industries (BDI), has urged the US not to intervene in EU energy policy or in the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“It’s a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, director of the German Federation of Industries (BDI) after a meeting recently held between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will carefully consider the possibility of running for president in 2020, says Massachusetts senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would consider joining the presidential race after the midterm elections.
During a appearance at Holyoke City Hall, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that this challenge was being raised.
“It’s time for women to come to Washington to amend our fractured government and finally have women among the leaders,” she said.
“After November 6, I will seriously consider the possibility of running for president.”
Warren gave his opinion on President Donald Trump during a appearance at City Hall and stated that he was “leading the country the wrong way.”
“I’m really worried about the damage that Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” he said.
Warren spoke without hesitation about Trump and his Supreme Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet last Friday, Warren stated that “it is absolutely necessary for the FBI to investigate what happened before the vote.”
On Thursday, a poll was published in which, however, a majority of Warren’s own voters do not believe he should stand for the 2020 election.
58% of Massachusetts' "possible" voters said the senator should not appear, according to a survey by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
However, 32 per cent of respondents supported their candidacy.
The poll showed greater support for the former governor, Deval Patrick, with 38 percent support for a possible candidacy and 48 percent against.
Other recognized members of the Democratic Party spoke about the possible 2020 candidacy of former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide in January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin talks about Track Palin’s post-traumatic stress disorder at a Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September.
Last Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
“The situation that my son is going through, for everything that has happened since he returned, is well known to other families who suffer the effects of PTSD and other injuries that our soldiers come back with,” he told the audience who gathered at a rally in favor of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin referred to this arrest as the big taboo no one wants to talk about, and commented on his son and other war veterans who "return with different behavior, hardened, wondering if there really is that respect for what his fellow soldiers and airmen, as well as all other members of the army, have given to his country."
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, accused of an incident of domestic violence against a woman, interfering with a complaint of domestic violence and possession of weapons under the effects of drugs or alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla police department.
18 states, D.C. support the challenge of getting a new asylum policy
18 states and the District of Columbia support a judicial appeal to the new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence or gang violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and the district filed a "friendly" letter Friday in Washington to show their support for an asylum seeker facing the current directive, NBC News reported.
The plaintiff’s full name has not been revealed in the “Grace v. Sessions” case filed in August by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) against federal policy.
She said her partner “and her children, who are members of a violent gang,” abused her, but U.S. officials denied her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Lawyers representing these states defending Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which generate a large number of asylum applications to the U.S., as nations facing widespread problems related to domestic and gang violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy revoked a 2014 decision taken by the Immigration Appeals Board (BIA) that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum in the country.
Attorney General for the District of Columbia, Karl Racine, made statements Friday in which he said the new policy “ignores decades of international, federal and state law.”
“Under federal law, all applications for asylum must be dismissed on the basis of the particular facts and circumstances of the claim and, instead, this exception violates that principle,” the amicus curiae states.
Lawyers also indicated in the letter that the policy of denying entry to immigrants harms the U.S. economy by stating that they tend to become entrepreneurs more often and “imply a necessary workforce.”
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence in June.
“People who leave their countries of origin on the grounds of persecution or threats of race, religion, nationality or belonging to a particular social group or political opinion can apply for asylum,” Sessions said when he announced the directive on June 11.
Asylum was never created as a measure to alleviate all the problems, not even all the serious problems, that people around the world face on a daily basis.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as the death toll increases in a race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation was becoming more and more nefarious.
“The situation is very tense,” Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told us as she tried to comfort her feverish baby in an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
“Every minute ambulances arrive with more bodies.
And clean water is scarce.”
Some residents have returned to their destroyed homes to search among the few drowned belongings left in an effort to recover what they can.
There are hundreds of people injured and hospitals, also damaged by the magnitude 7.5 earthquake, are overflowing.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who has a broken back and shoulder, rested outside the Palu Army Hospital, where patients were treated outside the building due to the continuous replicas, also very strong.
He couldn’t help but cry when he told us about the violent earthquake he experienced while on the 5th floor of the hotel with his wife and daughter.
“We didn’t have time to get safe.
I was trapped in the remains of the collapsed wall, I think," Haris told the Associated Press. He and his family were in town to celebrate a wedding.
"I heard my wife ask for help and then a tremendous silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they're okay."
U.S. ambassador accuses China of “bullying” with “propaganda ads”
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in a U.S. newspaper promoting the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread its propaganda.
Last Wednesday, U.S. President Donald Trump referred to the China Daily’s payment supplement on the Des Moines Register, Iowa’s best-selling newspaper, after accusing China of wanting to interfere in the Nov. 6 U.S. Congressional elections, something China blatantly denies.
Trump’s accusation of Beijing’s attempt to influence the U.S. election marked what U.S. officials indicated to Reuters as a new phase in a growing campaign initiated by Washington to pressure China.
While it is common for foreign governments to publish ads to promote their trade activities, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in a growing trade war that has led them to raise tariff levels on imports by both sides.
China’s countervailing tariffs that applied at the beginning of the trade war were thought to fall on exporters from states like Iowa, which backed Trump’s Republican Party, Chinese and American experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, which is one of the main exporters of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had harmed U.S. workers, farmers and businessmen.
As Branstad wrote in an opinion article in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, China “is further intensifying that pressure with announcements in our free press.”
“To try to spread their propaganda, the Chinese government takes advantage of America’s precious tradition of free speech and free press by attempting to publish a payment announcement in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“In contrast, in the street kiosk where we are here in Beijing, there are only a few dissenting voices and no real reflection of the disparate opinions that people in China may have about the worrying trajectory that their country’s economy is taking, as the media is controlled by the firm pressure of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most relevant newspapers circumvented the offer to publish" his article, though it did not specify which newspaper it was.
Analysts note that Republicans are distancing themselves from women before the mid-term vote with Kavanaugh’s debacle
As many prominent Republicans are closing lines in favor of Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh in the face of various allegations of sexual assault, analysts have warned that a backlash, especially on the part of women, may occur in the upcoming mid-term votes.
The emotions surrounding this fact have been very intense and there are many Republicans who have expressed that they want to move forward with the vote.
"In this kind of affairs it is not possible to go back," Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School at the University of Syracuse, told The Hill in an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted that Senator Jeff Flake’s latest attempt to stand in favor of the FBI’s investigation would be enough to reassure voters displeased with the matter.
“Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday; they are not going to forget it tomorrow or in November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters gathered at the doorstep of the Senate chanted "November is coming!" (November is coming soon!) as the Republicans who controlled the Judiciary Committee decided to move forward with Kavanaugh's candidacy, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, according to Mic.
“The enthusiasm and motivation of Democrats goes out of their way,” Stu Rothenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst, told the news site.
“People say the impact is already very relevant and indeed it is.
But it could be even bigger, especially among indecisive women in the outskirts and younger voters, between 18 and 29, who don’t usually vote even if they don’t like the president.”
Even before Ford’s public testimony detailing his allegations of sexual abuse against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts indicated there could be a setback if Republicans went ahead with the confirmation.
“This matter has become a big mess for the Republican Party,” Michael Steele, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said earlier last week, according to NBC News.
“It’s no longer just a matter of the committee’s vote or the final vote, not even whether they sit on the bench to Kavanaugh; it’s also about how Republicans have handled all this and how they’ve treated her,” Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA (a group that helped in the election) told the news channel.
However, Americans seem to be divided; they do not know who to believe after the testimonies of Ford and Kavanaugh, although there are a few more who take sides with the latter.
According to a new YouGov survey, 41% of respondents believe Ford’s testimony definitively or likely, while 35% say they believe Kavanaugh definitively or likely.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh lied during his testimony, while 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following Flake’s push, the FBI is currently investigating Ford’s statements, as well as, at least, those of another whistleblower, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Ford testified under oath before the Senate Judiciary Commission last week and indicated that Kavanaugh raped her while drunk at the age of 17.
Ramirez claimed that the Supreme Court candidate showed him his genitals at a party when he was studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a new company that tries to rival Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt is the latest technology legend project. A company based on Berners-Lee’s Solid open source platform.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and which people will have access to which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt is to “dominate the world.”
“It has to be now,” he said of the startup.
“It’s a historic moment.”
The application uses Solid’s technology so that users can create their own “online personal data storage” or a POD.
It can contain lists, to-do lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in one browser and at the same time.
Something that is unique in the storage of personal online data is that the user is the one who completely decides who can access what kind of information.
The company calls it “personal training through data.”
Inrupt’s idea, according to the company’s CEO, John Bruce, is to incorporate the resources, processes, and skills needed for Solid to reach everyone.
At the moment, the company is made up of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform that IBM bought, some of the templated developers who were hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, tech developers from around the world could create their own decentralized apps with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking to “Facebook and Google about whether or not they are going to introduce a radical change where all of their business models are completely modified from day to day.
"We're not going to ask for permission."
In a publication in Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote about Inrupt that “its mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web created in Solid.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has played a very influential role in the debate about net neutrality.
Despite even launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m incredibly optimistic about this next era of the web,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: the clergyman who won a Victorian Cross in World War I
The only Church of England clergyman to win a Victorian Cross during World War I as a fighter has been honored in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann received this award on 29 September 1918 in the attack of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, a sniper killed him four days later and never knew that he had been awarded the highest British military honor.
On Saturday, his two grandchildren discovered a commemorative stone at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of them, Michael Vann, said it was "of a special symbolism" that the stone was discovered exactly 100 years after the battle that made him deserve the decoration of his grandfather.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion through the Saint-Quentin Canal "crossing a thick fog and under the intense fire of machine guns and cannons".
He then ran up to the line of fire and, with "greater courage", advanced the line before reaching a single-handed cannon and knocking down three of the detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a month after the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "so great that I will never be able to get to his height, but they were very instructive."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also deposited a crown of flowers after the parade, which featured the participation of the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that "it was a privilege for him to be part of the parade" and added that "the value of a true hero is evident when he is shown such a large backing".
MMA fans were up all night for the Bellator 206, but only saw Peppa Pig
Imagine staying up all night to see the entire Bellator 206 so that in the end they won’t let you see the main event.
The San Jose cartel had 13 fights, six included in the main card, and in the UK it was to be broadcast live at night on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face each other, UK viewers were astonished when the show switched to Peppa Pig.
Some weren’t surprised after having to stay awake until early morning just to watch the fight.
A Twitter follower described the switch to cartoons as “a heavy joke.”
“There is a government regulation that regulates content that is broadcast from 6 a.m. and this was not appropriate, so they had to switch to children’s programming,” said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president of marketing and communication, when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa la pigita, yes."
Bellator chairman Scott Coker said they would modify the program to include British viewers in the upcoming editions.
“When I think about the retransmission option, I think it can work,” Coker said.
"But it's 6 a.m. on Sunday, so we couldn't do it until Sunday at our time, which would already be Monday for them.
We're looking at how to do it.
Believe me, when the schedule changed, a lot of messages were received and not everyone was kind, precisely.
We tried to fix it, because at first we thought it was a technical problem.
But it was not so, it was a government problem.
I can promise you that next time it won't happen.
We will reduce it to five fights instead of six, which are the ones we normally have done. We try to offer more than usual so that the fans were happy and we had fun.
It is a very unfortunate situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley Feel Inferior to His Sexuality
Olympic jumper Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to the rest because of his sexuality, though this in turn motivated him to become a triumphant.
At the age of 24, he told us that he didn’t realize until he got to high school that “not everyone was like me.”
On Radio 4's first Desert Island Discs show, hosted by Lauren Laverne, he said his intention in talking about gay rights was to transmit "hope" to other people.
He also told us that becoming a father made him start to detract from the fact of winning the Olympics.
The usual presenter of this mythical show, Kirsty Young, will be absent for a few months due to illness.
In Laverne's first show, Daley, who showed himself as a marginalized, commented that he felt "inferior" to the rest during his childhood, because "you were not socially accepted to like boys and girls."
He said, “To this day, that feeling of inferiority and being different has been what really gave me the power and strength to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he was “something,” he said, so he didn’t disappoint when he finally discovered his sexuality.
The Olympic bronze medalist has become a prominent profile of the LGBT movement and his image has been used at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to demand that more countries decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he told it because he felt fortunate to live in freedom, without retaliation, and wanted to convey that “hope” to other people.
The three-time world champion declared that it was also a surprise for him to fall in love with a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married the 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, though he said the age difference had never been a problem.
"When you live so young" (it was his first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later), it is hard to find someone of the same age who has gone through the same highs and lows as you.
The couple had a son in June who they called Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said his "global outlook" had changed.
“If they had asked me last year, all the answers would have revolved around ‘I have to win a gold medal’,” he said.
“But you know what, there are things more important than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is, without a doubt, Robbie.”
His son is named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept that he was going to die and, in fact, one of the last things he asked is if they had the passes for London 2012, because he wanted to be in the front row.
“I wasn’t able to tell him I wasn’t going to be able to be in the front row,” he said.
“I had his hand in my hands when he stopped breathing and it wasn’t until that very moment when he stopped breathing and died that I realized he wasn’t invincible,” she said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
“At that moment I knew that was what I had dreamed of my whole life: competing in the pool in front of mine at an Olympics, there was nothing better,” he said.
This was also what inspired him when he chose his first song, Heather Small's Proud, which accompanied him in the preparation phase of the Olympics.
Desert Island Discs airs on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, in low form, stayed on the bench at the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but will have to reverse his form if he wants to prevent it from becoming a sad milestone.
Mickelson, who played at the event held every two years to set a record for the 12th time, was knocked out by Captain Furyk for Saturday’s fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as he has done so many times for the United States, the five-time major tournament champion had to settle for cheering at some moments and, at others, trying to perfect his game on the field and thus be able to rectify what afflicts him.
Never the most direct of drivers, not even at the highest moment of his career, the 48-year-old is not in his best shape for Le Golf National, where the long rough continually punishes with the wrong kicks.
And, if the field is no longer discouraging enough, Mickelson, in Sunday’s ninth game, faces brilliant British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has joined debutant Tommy Fleetwood to win the four games they have played this week.
If the Americans, who were four points below at the start of the 12 individual games, started in an impressive way, Mickelson’s game could have been decisive.
Furyk showed confidence in his partner, he could not say much more either.
"He perfectly understood the role I had today, gave me a slap in the back and, surrounding me with his arm, said he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
“He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is in the Hall of Fame and has contributed a lot to these teams before and this week.
I probably couldn’t imagine playing two games.
I thought they would be more, but that's how it came out and that's how we thought it had to be.
He wants to be there, like the rest of us.”
On Sunday, Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo's mark of most Ryder Cup games played.
It could be the last of an entire Ryder Cups career that has never so clearly matched the levels of its individual brand.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and 7 equals, although Furyk said his presence brought many more intangible values to the team.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, ingenious, he likes to make fun of others; it’s great to have him on the team,” he explained.
“I think the younger players loved having him as a supporter, also this week; it was fun.
It does a lot more than just play.”
The European captain, Thomas Bjorn, knows that leadership can disappear very soon.
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of Europe, knows very well that, although you enter with a substantial advantage in the last days of the Ryder Cup, it can easily turn into an awkward tournament.
The Dane made his debut in the 1997 game at Valderrama, where one side captained by Seve Ballesteros kept a five-point lead over the Americans, but in the end they only managed to finish off the others by stepping their heels by a minimum margin, winning 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“You don’t stop remembering that we did a great tournament at Valderrama; we did it at Brookline and we lost, we did it at Valderrama and we won, but for very little,” said Bjorn, portrayed, after seeing the 2018 generation win 5-3 on Friday and lead him with a 10-6 at Le Golf National.
History will teach me and everyone else that this team is not finished.
You have to give it all tomorrow.
Get out there and do what you have to do.
This does not end until the points are on the marker.
We have a goal to achieve, which is to win this trophy, and that’s all we have to think about.
I say it all the time, I focus on the 12 players on our team, but we are very aware of what is on the other side where they are, no more and no less, than the best players in the world."
Proud of what his players have done on a very tough golf course, Bjorn added: “I wouldn’t want to get ahead of myself.
Tomorrow is a different challenge.
What prevails tomorrow are the individual performances and this is different.
It’s great to share what happens with a partner when things go well, but when you’re out there alone, you put all your golfing skills to the test.
That’s the message you have to convey to the players, get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now it’s up to you to put your partner aside, go and get the best out of yourself.”
In front of Bjorn, his counterpart Jim Furyk will try to make his players do better individually than they did as couples, with the exceptions of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk himself has been on both extremes in the last days of those big tournaments and has been part of the team that won at Brookline and then ended up losing when Europe carried out the "Miracle of Medina".
“I remember every word,” he told us when we asked him how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, managed to motivate his players on the last day.
“We have 12 super important games tomorrow, but we have to start as well as we did in Brookline, as you saw in Medinah.
When we all move in one direction, all the pressure falls on those intermediate parties.
We defined our strategy and got them out with the feeling that we were going to try to do something magical tomorrow.”
Thomas is assigned the task of trying to lead the fight and facing Rory McIlroy in the main game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans in the second half of the list.
“I went with this group of guys in this order because I think they cover the whole tour,” Bjorn said of his individual selections.
The new German warship, postponed again
The new German Navy frigate should have been commissioned in 2014 to replace old Cold War-era ships, but it won’t be done until at least next year due to faulty systems and progressive cost increases, local media reported.
The delivery of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the ship that heads the new frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to statements by a military spokesman.
The ship should have joined the Navy in 2014, but the problems that arose after the delivery bothered the conclusion of the ambitious project.
The four ships of the Baden-Württemberg class that the Navy requested in 2007 will replace the old frigates of the Bremen class.
We know that they will include a powerful cannon, a set of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some invisibility technologies, such as radar, infrared and very low acoustic signals.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods, so that they can be deployed for up to two years away from the ports of origin.
However, the continued delays have caused the innovative ships (which were supposed to allow Germany to project its power overseas) to be outdated when they begin to serve, says Die Zeit.
The unlucky frigate F125 took the lead last year, when the German Navy officially refused to put the ship into operation and returned it to the shipyard Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to a shipyard after its delivery.
Little was known about the reasons behind the return, but the German media cited a number of crucial "software and hardware flaws" that left the ship virtually useless if it was sent on a combat mission.
Software deficiencies were particularly important, as the ships of the Baden-Württemberg class will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors: half of the personnel that were on the former Bremen-class frigates.
It was also found that the ship is overweight, which reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
The 7000-ton "Rheinland-Pfalz" is believed to be twice as heavy as other similar-class ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project, including the training of the crew, has also posed a problem.
It is believed to have reached <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion ($3.6 billion), rather than the initial <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The problems attributed to the new frigates are of particular relevance in the light of recent warnings about the reduction of Germany's naval power.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defence committee, acknowledged that the Navy is "lacking ships capable of deploying".
The officer said the problem has gotten worse over time, because the old ships were dropped, but they have not been replaced with others.
He regretted that none of the frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class had been able to join the Navy.
The National Trust spies on the secret life of bats
This new research, which has been conducted in a state of the Scottish Highlands, tries to discover how bats use the landscape in their search for food.
Everything we find out is expected to shed more light on the behavior of the only flying mammals and help guide upcoming conservation activities.
The study, conducted by the National Trust for Scotland, will follow the common bats and sopranos, as well as the Daubenton riparian bats and long-eared browns of the Inverewe gardens at Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at strategic locations of the property to track bat activities during the season.
The NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile research with portable detectors.
Experts will analyze the sounds collected in the recordings to discover the frequency of calls from bats and what species do.
A report and a map of the habitat will then be produced to create a detailed picture of the environment and its behavior.
Rob Dewar, Nature Conservation Advisor for NTS, expects the results to reveal which habitat areas are most important to bats and how each species uses them.
This information will determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as the creation of meadows and how forests should be maintained for bats and other associated species.
Flea populations in Scotland and the United Kingdom have declined considerably in the last century.
They are under threat from the construction and development that affects their nests and the loss of their habitat.
Wind turbines and electrical wiring can also pose a risk to them, as can insecticide papers and other chemical treatments of building materials or attacks from domestic cats.
The bats are not really blind,
Because of their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes to achieve their goal.
They use a sophisticated ecolocation technique that locates ants and obstacles on their flight route.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes the issue of bats very seriously.
It has ten experts trained in the field, who are dedicated to conducting regular surveys, nest inspections and sometimes rescues.
The organization has even opened Scotland’s first and only bat reserve in Threave State in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland’s ten bat species.
The property manager, David Thompson, says it is the ideal territory for them.
"Here, at Threave, we have a fantastic area for bats," he said.
“We have old buildings, lots of old trees and all the right habitat.
However, there are still many unknown things about bats, so the work we do here and on other properties will help us better understand what they need to develop.”
It emphasizes the importance of checking for bats before carrying out maintenance tasks within the properties, as a breeding colony can be involuntarily destroyed and 400 females and young could be killed, which would annihilate an entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass or disturb them, as well as destroy their colonies.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish officer in charge of the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to collaborate.
He said, “We still have a lot to learn about bats and many other species that we don’t know how their populations evolve.”
Ronaldo denies allegations of rape while his lawyers prosecute German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has categorized rape allegations as “fake news,” and says people “want to make themselves known” at the expense of his name.
His lawyers have been instructed to report to the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which was where the statements were published.
The Portuguese and Juventus forward is accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, at a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
He is accused of paying him $375,000 to conceal the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
With an Instagram Live video that has already garnered 142 million followers a few hours after the news was posted, Ronaldo, 33, tagged the report as “fake news”.
"No, no, no, no, no, no.
What they have said today is false,” says the five-time Golden Ball winner looking at the camera.
“They only want advertising at the expense of my name.
It's the same story as always.
They want to get famous by just mentioning me, but it's so, I can't help it.
I’m a happy man and everything is fine,” the player added, smiling.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing a lawsuit against Der Spiegel for the accusations appearing in what they have called “an inadmissible report of privacy suspicions,” according to Reuters.
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player will try to get compensation for “moral damages for an amount corresponding to the severity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of his personal rights in recent years.”
The alleged incident apparently took place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went to the player's room and there he allegedly anally raped her, according to documents recorded at Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga said Ronaldo knelt down after the alleged incident and told him that he was in a "99 percent" a "good guy" and that he had defrauded him of that "one percent" remaining.
The documents state that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that he was consenting.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that they took pictures of the wounds in the hospital, but later agreed to an extrajudicial settlement because she had "terror of retaliation" and was concerned "being humiliated in public".
The 34-year-old woman says she is trying to cancel the deal, as she remains traumatized by the facts.
When the alleged aggression occurred, Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United and this summer he has switched to Juve, a major of Italian football for a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million contract.
Brexit: Britain would always regret losing car manufacturers
The UK would "repent a lifetime" if it lost its position as a world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, Industry Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it was "worrisome" that Toyota UK would tell the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, production would be temporarily halted at its Burnaston plant near Derby.
"We need a deal," Mr. Clark said.
The Japanese manufacturer said the repercussions of delays in customs in the event of a no-deal Brexit could result in job losses.
The Burnaston plant, which manufactures Toyota’s Auris and Avensis models, produced some 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“My opinion is that if Britain breaks with the EU by the end of March, there will be production stoppages at our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s CEO at Burnaston.
Other UK automakers have shown their fears about leaving the EU without an agreement, especially in relation to cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its Mini plant in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concerns that automakers are concerned with revolve around the problems that could arise in assembly lines in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line is based on the “just in time” production mode, where the parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and the EU to make cars on-demand.
If the UK leaves the European Union without a deal on 29 March, there could be an interruption at the border that, according to the sector, could lead to delays and depletion of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to host the amount of material equivalent to more than a day of inventory at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, and in such a case production would be stopped.
Clark said Theresa May’s Chequers plan, which establishes future relations with the EU, is “precisely calibrated to avoid those checks at border crossings.”
"We need an agreement. We want to have the best deal that not only allows us to get out of the way right now but we have to take the opportunity," he said on BBC Radio 4's Today program.
“Toyota’s evidence, among many other manufacturers, is that we have to be able to continue with what, so far, has been a tremendously successful set of supply chains.”
Toyota has not been able to say how long production would stop, but warned that, in the long run, the added costs would reduce the plant’s competitiveness and ultimately the costs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is in charge of the Unite union at the plant, said his members are increasingly concerned: “In my experience, once those jobs are lost, they never recover.”
A government spokesman said: “We have put in place a precise and convincing plan defining our future relations with the EU.”
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, according to the White House
Donald Trump’s high-risk meeting with deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein could be “postponed another week,” as the dispute over Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special adviser Robert Mueller, who is investigating interference in the Russian election, links between Trump’s aid and Russia, and a possible obstruction of justice by the president.
Expectations as to whether or not Trump decides to fire the deputy attorney general and thereby compromise Mueller’s independence have fueled Washington’s clutches for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein recorded conversations he had with Trump with a microphone he himself wore to try to relegate the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied it was true.
However, last Monday he went to the White House, amid news reports that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump (who was at the UN at the time in New York) was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he would "prefer not" to fire Rosenstein but the meeting had to be postponed to avoid a conflict with the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual assault, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump asked the FBI to investigate the allegations against Kavanaugh for a week, though this would delay the vote in the Senate.
Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
Asked about Rosenstein’s meeting, he said: “No date has been defined, it could be this week or another could be postponed, considering everything that is happening with the Supreme Court.
We will decide on the march and I will inform the press, as I usually do."
Some journalists would refute that claim: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since September 10.
Presenter Chris Wallace asked what the reasons were.
Sanders said the shortage of press briefings was not due to an aversion to grandiloquent TV journalists, although he said, "I did not disagree with the fact that they are fanfare."
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press is going to increase.
“The president conducts more question-and-answer sessions than any other president before him,” he said, while quoting without evidence: “We have contrasted those numbers.”
The press conferences will continue to take place, Sanders said, but "if the press has the option to ask directly to the president of the United States, I think it's much better than doing them to me.
We’ve tried to do it many times and you’ve seen us do it many times in the last few weeks, so this would replace a press conference when you can talk to the president of the United States.”
Trump usually answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends public sessions or press conferences with dignitaries visiting him.
Press conferences with him only take place on very rare occasions.
In fact, this week, in New York, the president demonstrated why it was so, where he made an outrageous and sometimes bizarre appearance to the journalists gathered there.
The Secretary of State for Health writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland about their fears of Brexit
The Secretary of State for Health has written to the EU staff working at Scotland’s HHS to express the country’s gratitude and its desire to continue with them after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter just six months before the UK withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish government has already pledged to cover the cost of citizenship applications for EU members working in public services not dependent on central power.
In her letter, Mrs Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the European Union on the exit have followed, in which it was chosen to make the decisions expected this fall.
However, the UK government has also stepped up preparations around a possible scenario where there would be no agreement.
I know all this must be very confusing for you.
That is why I would like to reiterate the value of each staff member's contribution, irrespective of their nationality.
Professionals from across the EU and other countries provide valuable experience and many skills that strengthen and improve the work of the healthcare service, benefiting patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is undoubtedly your home and we would love to continue to count on you.”
Christion Abercrombie is undergoing emergency surgery after suffering a head injury
Christion Abercrombie, a Tennessee State Tigers player, was surgically intervened in an emergency after suffering a head injury last Saturday when they lost 31-27 against Vanderbilt Commodores, Tennessee's Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee State coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before the break.
“He came into the band and collapsed right there,” Reed said.
Both coaches and medical staff administered oxygen to Abercrombie on the band line before placing him on a stretcher and taking him to be examined in depth.
A Tennessee State staff member told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had left the operation at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there were no details on the type of injury yet or the damage caused" and the Tennessee State is trying to figure out when it happened.
Abercrombie, redshirt sophomore, is playing in his first season with Tennessee State after being transferred from Illinois.
He made five tackles on Saturday before leaving the field, with which he added a total of 18 throughout the season.
Foreigners will be subject to a higher property transfer tax when they purchase a property in the United Kingdom
Foreigners will be subject to a higher property transfer tax when they buy a property in the UK and the extra money raised with this measure will be used to shelter the "homeless", according to the new plans of the Conservatives.
The change will neutralize the success of the Corbyn offensive to attract younger voters
The increase in the transfer tax will be imposed on those people who are not paying taxes in the UK
The Treasury expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year that will go to the "homeless"
The additional money raised with the increase in the transfer tax from estates to foreign property buyers in the UK will go to aid to the "homeless", Theresa May announced today.
The move is understood as an attempt to neutralize the success Jeremy Corbyn is reaping with his promises to provide more affordable housing to attract younger and harassing voters to those with higher incomes.
The increase in the transmission tax will be levied on people and businesses who do not pay taxes in the UK and that money will be used to encourage the government’s policy to combat the problem of begging on the streets.
The surcharge, which is a supplement to the current transmission tax, including the increase in levels that was introduced two years ago on second-hand homes and the buy-to-let system, could reach up to 3%.
The Treasury expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year with this change.
It is estimated that 13% of London’s newly built properties are bought by people who do not reside in the UK, which causes rising prices and makes it difficult for first-time buyers to access affordable housing.
Many of the country’s wealthiest areas (especially in the capital) have become “ghost cities” due to the large number of foreign buyers spending most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just a few weeks after Boris Johnson claimed a reduction in the broadcast tax in order to help young people buy their first home.
He accused the major builders of maintaining very high prices on the properties by eagerly buying land without any intention to use it, and urged Mrs May to remove the quotas that apply to affordable housing to solve the "shameful housing problem" in Britain.
Mr. Corbyn has announced a series of very attractive housing reforms, including rental controls and the end of unreasonable evictions.
It also proposes to give local authorities more power to build new homes.
Ms May said: “Last year I said that I would dedicate my office as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream of improving the lives of each new generation.
And that involves solving the housing market, which is so devastated.
Britain will always be open to those who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it cannot be that people who do not live in the UK, as well as foreign companies, can buy homes more easily than the British working class.
“The dream of having a house has become too difficult for many people to achieve and the humiliation of having to sleep on the street is still too real.”
Jack Ross: "My primary goal is to lead Scotland"
The Sunderland coach says his “primary goal” is to become a Scottish coach at some point.
The 42-year-old Scottish is excited to revitalize the northeastern club, which currently occupies third place in the League One (the third league division of England), three points from the first.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after taking St. Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League last season.
“I wanted to play for my country when I was a player.
But I only got a B cap," Ross told Sportssound on BBC Scotland.
“But I grew up seeing Scotland in Hampden with my father when I was a kid and it’s something that has always made me want to come back.
That opportunity will only become a reality, however, if I manage a successful club."
Ross's predecessors as Sunderland's leader include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic manager says he felt no fear when he switched to such established names in such a large club, after rejecting proposals from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“Right now, success for me is measured by whether I can return this club to the Premier League.
because the structure and facilities of this club are, without a doubt, those of the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to get it, but I could only consider that I've achieved my goal here when I can get the club back to where it should be."
Ross has only been a coach for three years, after a time as an assistant at Dumbarton and a period of 15 months in the Hearts coaching staff.
He then helped the Alloa recover from the descent to the third division and made St. Mirren move from being on the edge of the descent to winning the championship the following season.
In fact, Ross says he feels more comfortable now than ever before during his career as a player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably a real crossroads," he recalled in reference to when he took over the Alloa.
“I always thought the direction was what was best for me, much more than playing.
It may sound strange, because it was good, I was able to make a living very well with it and I enjoyed some epic moments.
But playing can be very hard.
You have to face a lot of things every week.
I still suffer from the stress and pressure of that work; however, in the direction I feel good.
I’ve always wanted to train and now I’ve managed to do it, it’s the time of my adult life when I’ve felt better, no doubt.”

According to a survey, the perfect time for a drink is 5:30 p.m. on Saturday.
The summer heatwave has boosted earnings in British pubs struggling to survive, but it has concentrated all the pressure on restaurant chains.
Pub and bar groups saw their sales increase by 2.7% in July, while restaurant earnings fell by 4.8%, the figures revealed.
Peter Martin, of CGA’s corporate consultancy, who compiled the figures, commented: “The heat of these days and the fact that England remains at the World Cup have still kept the July pattern of the month before June, in which the ads increased their profits by 2.8%, although the restaurants have fallen even slightly more.
The 1.8% drop in restaurant business activity in June was even worse in July.
Pubs and bars serving mainly drinks had their strongest month, compared to most restaurants, where they reduced profits.
Pubs serving mainly meals also suffered from the heat, though not as drastically as restaurant operators.
Looks like people just want to go out for a drink.
In managed bars and pubs, beverage sales rose by up to 6.6% during the month, while meals fell by 3%.
Paul Newman, RSM’s hospitality and leisure analysts, said: “These results follow the trend we’ve seen since the end of April.
Time and the impact of very important social or sporting events remain the most relevant factors when it comes to sales in the market of activities outside the home.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to struggle, although a 4.8% drop in sales compared to last year is going to be particularly painful in view of continued cost pressures.
The long and hot summer could not have come at a worse time for gastronomic operators and the weather will tell if the more moderate temperatures we have had in August will provide the relief they need.
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including new ones that have opened, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slow decline in brand deployments.

One in five children have secret accounts on social media behind their parents
One in five children (some even 11 years old) have secret social media accounts behind their parents and teachers, according to a survey.
The survey, conducted on 20,000 high school students, revealed a growth in fake Instagram pages
The news has exacerbated fears that sexual content will be published.
20% of students said they have a “main” account that they show their parents
One in five children (some even 11 years old) create social media accounts that hide adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed the rapid growth that has been experienced on fake Instagram accounts, a benchmark for sharing photos.
The news has exacerbated fears that sexual content may be published.
20% of students said they had a sanitized “main” account that they showed their parents, while they had other private ones.
A mother who accidentally encountered the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter saw how a teenager encouraged others to “rape me.”
The research, conducted by the Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmasters' Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40% of children between the ages of 11 and 18 had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, director of HMC, said: “It’s alarming that so many teenagers are tempted to create spaces on the Internet where their parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" in the directive of the Scottish athletics federation
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to be part of the board of the Scottish Athletics Federation as non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland’s most award-winning track and field athlete, and his president, Ian Beattie, described the change as a great opportunity for those who want the sport to benefit from its great international experience over the past decade.
“Eilidh is recognized and respected throughout the athletics community in Scotland, the UK and around the world, and we are confident that athletics in Scotland will benefit enormously by having her on board,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I like to be the spokesperson for the athletes and I hope to be able to contribute things and help develop the sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200m and 400m at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta among the four golds he won and is now a regular expert at the BBC, suffered a transient ischemic attack that left him unable to walk.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago, I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
According to doctors, only time would determine whether I would recover or to what extent.
It’s been exhausting, but I managed to fully recover, I had to learn to walk again and I’m currently doing agility exercises.
Thank you for the messages and words of encouragement!"
The ad of the sacaleches where it compares mothers with cows divides opinion on the Internet
A bakery company has divided the public opinion on the Internet with an ad comparing it to breastfeeding mothers with cows they milk.
To mark the launch of what is theoretically the world’s “first silent drawer,” consumer tech company Elvie posted an announcement inspired by a somewhat ironic music video showing mothers telling them the freedom the new milk extractor gives them.
Four royal women dance in a barn full of hay like a dance floor, along with cows, with letters like, "Yes, I grind myself alone, but I don't have a queue" and "If you haven't noticed, they're not open, they're my breasts."
The choir goes on to say, "Ordn them, ordn them, I'm feeding their babies, ordn them, ordn them, I'm ordning my wives."
However, the announcement, which was posted on the company’s Facebook page, has created a huge controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received reactions from all kinds of people who have seen it, where many say it manages to focus on the "horrors" of the dairy sector.
"A very unfortunate decision to put cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant before they give birth to be able to produce milk, with the exception that they are taken away from their babies days after giving birth,” one person wrote.
The Elvie milk extractor fits discreetly in a breastfeeding bra (Elvie/Mother).
Another person commented: "Traumatic for the mother and for the baby.
But, yes, why not use them to advertise a milk extractor for mothers who do stay with their babies?”
Another comment was: "Wow, that's a more reckless ad."
However, others defended the ad, like a woman who admitted that the song was "disgusting."
“I think it’s a great idea.
If I was still breastfeeding, I'm sure I'd have one.
By using the bomb, I felt totally like a cow.
The ad is a bit allotted, but I don't give it any more turns.
It’s a product genius,” a woman told us.
Another person commented: “It’s a funny ad aimed at mothers who use a breast pump (sometimes at work or in public toilets), which makes them feel like cows.
In the announcement neither the dairy sector is praised nor judged."
At the end of the video, the group of women show that they have been dancing with the discreet bombs placed inside the bra.
The concept of the campaign is based on the perception that many women who take out milk with the pump say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie Pump is totally silent, has no cables or tubes, and is discreetly coupled inside the breastfeeding bra, which allows its users to move, hold their babies and even go out on the street with the pump running.
Ana Balarin, Mother’s partner and ECD, commented: “The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative launch.
In showing the parallelism between expressive women and dairy cows, what we intended was to draw attention to the use of breast pumps and their challenges, while demonstrating in an entertaining and up-to-date way the incredible sense of freedom offered by the new pump.
This is not the first time the Elvie bomb has appeared in the headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two paraded down the aisle for designer Marta Jakubowski while wearing the product.
Hundreds of immigrant children discreetly displaced to a camp on the Texas border
The number of detained minor immigrants has experienced a considerable increase, despite the fact that the monthly influx at the border has virtually remained at its usual levels. In part, this is because the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration are complicate the possibility of sponsoring these children.
Traditionally, most godparents, who were also undocumented immigrants at the time, feared that proposing to host a child would jeopardize their own stay in the country.
This risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential godparents and other adult members of their families should submit their fingerprints and that the data would be shared with government immigration entities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at the Immigration and Customs Office, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who applied to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no criminal record.
“Around 80% of sponsors or their relatives are in the country illegally, and a large part of them are criminal immigrants.
Therefore, we continue to chase these people,” Albence said.
In their effort to prosecute minors more quickly, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within a maximum of one month of detention, rather than 60 days, which was the previous rule, according to workers at the reception centers.
Many of them will testify by videoconferencing, rather than in person, to defend their legal status before an immigration judge.
Those who are not considered fit for amparo will be deported as soon as possible.
According to host workers and system reports that have emerged in recent months, the longer they remain in custody, the more likely they are to suffer from anxiety or depression, which could lead to violent abductions or escape attempts.
According to the defenders, these concerns increase even more in larger facilities, such as Tornillo, where, due to their size, signs of discomfort in these children are more likely to be overlooked.
Also, moving to the camp without giving them enough time to prepare them emotionally or to say goodbye to their friends could cause them a trauma that many are already suffering.
Syria calls on "occupation forces" of U.S., France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return to their homes, despite the country’s war being in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also the deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were illegally on Syrian territory under the pretext of fighting terrorism and that the issue "will be dealt with accordingly".
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the “war on terrorism has practically ended” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and several million have been uprooted from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to “fight in this sacred battle until we purge all Syrian territories” from both terrorist groups and “any illegal foreign presence.”
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly providing training and advice to Syrian Kurdish and Arab forces opposing President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 ground troops in this war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said conditions were being given for them to return and blamed "some Western countries" for "seeding irrational fears" that caused refugees to decide to stay out of the country.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns,” he said.
“They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian problem.”
The United States and the European Union have already warned that they will not help with the reconstruction of Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a containment zone in Idlib’s last major rebel stronghold has created an opportunity to force political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey prevented a large-scale assault by Syrian and Russian forces in the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem has made it clear that the deal had “clear deadlines” and has expressed hope that military action will focus on the jihadists, including fighters of the Nusra Front (linked to Al Qaeda), who “will be eradicated.”
Staffan de Mistura, a UN special envoy, hopes to soon convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of members of the government and the opposition to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set the conditions for the Syrian government’s participation in the committee, arguing that the panel’s work should be restricted “to review the articles of the current constitution” and warned against any interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to that logic, Trump would win the re-election in 2020, unless, as many liberal spectators will surely expect, a impeachment or scandal prematurely ends his presidency.
This would undoubtedly be “The most dramatic end of a presidency ever seen!”
At the moment, there are no signs of fatigue in the audience.
Since 2014, peak hourly rates have doubled to 1.05 million for CNN and virtually tripled to 1.6 million for MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at peak audience hours, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC’s “The Rachel Maddow Show” has surpassed cable channels’ indices with 3.5 million viewers for major nighttime news programs.
“It’s a strange attraction we haven’t yet been able to understand,” says Neal Baer, author-producer of “Designated Survivor,” an ABC drama series about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroyed the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club," has another theory.
Remember a taxi ride he made in Boston before the 2016 election.
The taxi driver told him he would vote for Trump.
Why? he asked.
“Because it makes me laugh,” was Scovell’s response.
Chaos is always on the rise in the entertainment world.
Obviously, and unlike anything else on TV, the arguments coming out of Washington could determine the future of the Roe v. Wade case, the possibility of immigrant families reuniting, or the health of the global economy.
Disconnecting is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
However, the information goes beyond the limits when you realize that you’ve been watching a panel of experts for six hours discussing the use of “deep background” sources that Bob Woodward used for his book “Fear,” Paul Manafort’s $15,000 ostrich leather hunter (“Stortoms the oversized pride garment”).
As far as I’m concerned, I’ll never see Super Mario the same way again.
“By offering something new every night, it’s partly what makes everything look like a reality show,” says Brent Montgomery, executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of “Pawn Stars,” as he tells us about the alternating cast of Trump’s show and his daily spins of the plot (whether entering into a fight against the NFL or praising Kim Jong).
You can’t afford to miss an episode if you don’t want to stay behind.
When I went to talk to Mr. Fleiss this week, it was a sunny 27-degree day on the north coast of Kauai, but he was a refugee inside watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He couldn’t get off the TV, not with Brett Kavanaugh ready to face the Senate Judiciary Commission and the future of the Supreme Court hanging from a thread.
“I remember when in those days we were doing all those programs crazy and people were telling us that that was the beginning of the end of Western civilization,” Fleiss told me.
“I thought it was all a joke, but in the end it turned out they were right.”

Foreign money flows in tighter midterm elections to the House of Representatives
It’s no surprise that the influx of money is reaching Pennsylvania’s 17th district, thanks to the restructuring of a congressional district with two candidates seeking re-election for the same seat.
This residential district of Pittsburgh, whose structure has recently been redesigned, has Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb faces another re-election candidate, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the former 12th district of Pennsylvania, a district that largely overlaps with the new 17.
The maps were redesigned after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the former districts had been unconstitutionally manipulated in favor of Republicans.
The race for the new 17 has sparked a funding contest for campaigns between the main financial arms of the parties, the National Democratic Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the Republican National Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb’s name became very familiar in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a special election held in March for Pennsylvania’s 18th Congressional District.
That seat had been occupied by a Republican for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts have given the Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States considered penalizing El Salvador for its support for China, although after throwing back
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with a slight rejection by Washington.
Trump had an affable meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and occupied a hotel in Panama until the partners evicted the Trump Organization’s management team.
State Department officials decided to bring back the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama due to “recent decisions to stop recognizing Taiwan,” Department of State spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement this month.
But it was only decided to sanction El Salvador, which had already received aid of around US$140 million in 2017 for, among other matters, drug trafficking control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts to financial assistance and restrictions on certain visas, would have been very painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and crime rates.
As the internal meetings progressed, U.S. and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity as a follow-up to a similar meeting held last year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent emigration to the United States.
But in mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear that their intention was to keep the conference going, ending any consideration of sanctions for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is scheduled to speak at the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October and which, according to diplomats, is seen as a sign of the importance the administration has given to the meeting.
The three U.S. envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without further threats or punishment from Washington.
A Bolton White House spokesman declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to deal with the internal deliberations on condition of anonymity.
His explanations were corroborated by an external analyst close to the administration, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
The study of history
The next step could be Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report on Trump’s possible obstruction of justice, of which there is already considerable evidence in the public record.
It is thought that Mueller is also leading this investigation to the possibility that the Trump campaign would work in parallel with Russia in its attack on our elections.
If Congress changes hands, Trump will be held accountable to that chamber, just as he prepares to stand again before voters, and perhaps finally before a jury of his peers.
This is a lot of conditionality, and with that I do not suggest that Trump’s fall is inevitable, nor that of his counterparts in Europe.
We will all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will have an effect on the duration of the fight.
In 1938, the German officers were ready to carry out a coup d'état against Hitler; it was only necessary for the West to resist him and to support the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of slaughter that followed.
The course of history revolves around these turning points, and the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Americans are now facing several of these turning points.
What will we do if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has seen himself in good shape since this newspaper reported that last year he had suggested recording the president in secret and had speculated about his inability to take office.
Rosenstein says The Times’ explanation is not accurate.
“How will we respond if the FBI’s new investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if his position in the Supreme Court is confirmed despite credible allegations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
In addition to all this, will we vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that will account for Trump?
If we fail these exams, we will find a long winter for democracy.
But, thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague, I think we will not fail.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that had once occupied my ambassador’s house.
He managed to survive, emigrated to the United States and, 60 years later, sent me to light the Sabbath candles on the same table adorned with a swastika.
With that legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?”

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers, optimistic about the match against Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will play home against Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a victory over the Austrians, after the impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will put them in a strong position to qualify for Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance of the season until the 2-2 draw against Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use that result as a springboard for bigger things.
"We managed to get a good point, as Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old.
“We started the game thinking we could get something and we went out with a point.
Perhaps we could have achieved the victory in the end, but overall, the tie was perhaps a fair result.
They were better in the first half, but after the break we went out for all and we were the best team.
This Thursday we will have another great European night.
I hope that we can achieve all three points, but it will be a difficult game because they have already achieved a good result in the previous game, but with all the public supporting us, I am sure that we will be able to move forward and get a positive result.
Last year was definitely tough with my injuries and the changes at the club itself, but now you notice an overall environment that everything will be fine.
The team is fine, the guys are enjoying a lot and we are having a good training.
I hope we can move forward, leave the past season behind and achieve success.”
Fear of Retirement Savings Is Making Some Women Lose Sleep
Despite the fact that survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be treated, few people talk about this with their relatives.
About half of the people who participated in the Nationwide study said they did talk to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
“People want a family member to look after them, but they’re not taking the steps to have this conversation,” says Holly Snyder, vice president of the nationwide life insurance company.
This is the way to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: you can’t prepare your family to take care of you if you don’t express your wishes in advance.
Work with your counselor and family to talk about where and how to receive care, as those options can be a cost-determining factor.
Incorporate in the conversion to your financial advisor, as it can also help you find a way to pay those expenses.
Your long-term care financing options may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a cash-valued hybrid life insurance policy to help you cover expenses or insure yourself with your own savings, as long as you have the money.
Negotiate your legal documents: get ahead of legal battles.
Be sure to get a health care authority to appoint a trusted person to oversee your health care and make sure that professionals fulfill their own wishes in case they can’t communicate.
You can also prepare a notarial power for your finances.
Select a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and make sure your bills are paid if you are incapacitated.
Don’t forget the little details: Imagine your old father has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
Describe all of these details in a written plan so you’re always ready.
“It’s not just the finances that are at stake: what doctors are to be treated with?” asks Martin.
“What medications are you taking?
Who will take care of the dog?
We have to have everything planned.”

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died as a result of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu last Friday, authorities said. The death toll is expected to increase.
With communications blocked, assistance officials have been unable to obtain any information from the regency of Donggala, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here you can see some important details about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a regency that extends along more than 300 km (180 miles) of coastline in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The regency, which is a hierarchically lower administrative region than the province, had an estimated population of 299.200 people in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the pillars of the economy of Central Sulawesi province, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but they are mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been affected by tsunamis several times over the past 100 years, according to Indonesia’s Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck western Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Fire Belt, an area of high seismic activity, and often suffers from frequent earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province, in northern Sumatra, triggered a tsunami on December 26 that affected 14 countries and killed 226,000 people on the coast of the Indian Ocean. More than half of the victims occurred in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
There were hundreds of fatalities on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake devastated southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, and caused a tsunami that hit the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck near the city of Padang, capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck one of the Mentawai islands near Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck Pidie Jaya's regency in Aceh, causing destruction and panic as it recalled the devastation of the 2004 deadly earthquake and tsunami.
This time it did not cause any tsunami, but the collapse of buildings caused the deaths of more than 100 people.
2018: The tourist island of Lombok (Indonesia) suffered a series of large-scale earthquakes that caused the deaths of more than 500 people, most on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake devastated thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily evicted.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on charges of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and candidate for vice president Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of aggression.
Palin, a 29-year-old citizen of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with a report of domestic violence and resisting arrest, according to a report released Saturday by Alaska State Police.
According to that police report, when an acquaintance of his tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took away his phone.
Palin has been decreed pretrial detention at the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and is detained with an unsecured bail of $500, KTUU reported.
He appeared before the court on Saturday, where he declared himself "definitely innocent" when asked for his statement, the chain reported.
Palin faces three Class A minor offenses, meaning he could spend up to a year in prison and receive a $250,000 fine.
He has also been charged with a Class B felony, with a one-day prison sentence and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic aggression, interfering in the denunciation of a crime of domestic violence and possessing a weapon in a state of drunkenness, in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend had claimed to have punched him in the face.
Several groups of veterans criticized Sarah Palin in 2016 for linking her son’s violent behavior to the post-traumatic stress disorder derived from her service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds of dead
At least 384 people died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi last Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have fallen and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred right next to the center of Sulawesi, which is located northeast of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
There are several videos circulating on social media that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal Prosecutors Exceptionally Search for Death Penalty for Terrorist Attack Suspect in New York
New York federal prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City terrorist attack that killed eight people, an exceptional punishment that has not been executed in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a Home Depot rental van to carry out an attack last October on a bike lane on the West Side highway in Lower Manhattan, knocking down the pedestrians and cyclists he encountered on his way.
To justify a death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and caused "intentionally" serious bodily injury, according to the notice of intent to apply for the death penalty, filed in the Southern District of New York.
The two charges entail a possible death penalty, according to the court document.
Several weeks after the attack, a grand federal jury filed a 22-charge indictment against Saipov, which included eight charges of organized crime murder, commonly used by federal prosecutors in these cases, and one charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required “substantial planning and premeditation,” according to prosecutors, who described the way Saipov conducted it as “atrocious, cruel and depraved.”
Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been a decade since the last time the Southern District of New York prosecuted a case of the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug traffickers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time a death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York was in 1953, after Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after they were convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The two Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, an immigrant from Uzbekistan, demonstrated his lack of remorse during the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
According to police, he told investigators he felt good about what he had done.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities that for his attack he was inspired by watching videos of ISIS on his phone.
He also requested that the ISIS flag be hoisted in his hospital room, police said.
He has pleaded not guilty to 22 counts.
David Patton, one of Saipov's attorneys, said he was "obviously disappointed" with the prosecutor's decision.
“We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty rather than accept a conviction with a life sentence with no possibility of release will only prolong the trauma of these events for all people involved,” Patton said.
Saipov’s defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to apply for the death penalty.
MEP Tory says NIGEL FARAGE should be in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the popular army" today during a protest at the Tory conference.
The former UKIP leader said politicians had to "feel the warmth" of Eurosceptics, while one of May's MPs suggested he should take over negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone said at the Birmingham rally that the UK would have "already left" if Farage had been Brexit Secretary.
But Prime Minister May’s challenge to reconcile her divided ranks has been further highlighted when a group of Tories in favor of staying have joined an opposing protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is struggling to keep up with the compromise plan that was signed in Chequers amid attacks by Brexit supporters, their opponents and the EU.
The allies insisted that it will continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels, despite the violent reaction, and will force Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to choose between their package and “chaos.”
Deputy Bone said at the Leave Means Leave concentration in Solihull that he wanted to reject the Chequers plan.
He suggested that Farage should have been given a position of responsibility in the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he had been in charge, we would have left already,” he said.
This Member of Parliament for Wellingborough added: "I'm going to defend Brexit, but we have to get rid of Chequers."
In his statement of opposition to the EU, he said: “We have not fought in world wars to be servile.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Bone dismissed suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British have changed our minds and want to remain in the European Union is completely false.”
The pro-Brexit Tory Andrea Jenkyns was also at the concentration, where he told reporters: “I’m just saying one thing: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The general public does not like the Chequers plan, the opposition is not going to vote in favor and is not popular among our party and our activists, who are actually the ones who take to the streets and vote for us in the first place.
Forget about Chequers and start listening.”
In a message to May, he added: “Prime Ministers keep their offices when they keep their promises.”
Farage told concentrates that politicians would have to “feel the heat” if they were to be seen betraying the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
“Now it’s a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class,” he said.
“They are trying to betray Brexit and today we are here to tell them that we will not let them get away with theirs.”
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make our political class, which is about to betray Brexit, feel the heat.
“We are going to mobilize the popular army of this country that gave us the victory with Brexit and we will never rest until we have become an independent, autonomous and proud United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, those in favour of staying toured the streets of Birmingham before the two-hour rally in the city center.
Some activists waved banners from Tories Against Brexit after the group’s presentation this weekend.
Labour's Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives for the security issues they had with a party app during the conference's inauguration.
“These are the same people who tell us they can implement computer systems and all the technology for Canada Plus Plus, for borders in harmony, for free trade without borders in Ireland.”
“This is a total farce.
There is nothing that can be considered a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren Considers All Possibilities of Applying for President
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will "consider all possibilities of running for president" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future during a municipal meeting held on Saturday in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a regular critic of President Donald Trump, will run for re-election in November against Geoff Diehl, the Republican state representative, who was co-chair of Trump’s Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
There has been considerable speculation about the possibility that Warren will face Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon’s event in Holyoke was its thirty-sixth meeting with voters using the municipal format since Trump took office.
An assistant asked him if he was planning to run for president.
Warren responded that the time has come for “women to go to Washington to fix our irregular government, and that includes having a woman at the top.”
One arrested for the murder of the LSU Sims player with a gun
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, announced on Saturday that a suspect in the shooting death of Wayde Sims, the LSU basketball player, has been arrested on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at a news conference at 11 a.m.
They had posted a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help identifying a man seen in the video.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot dead near the Southern University campus early on Friday.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head that eventually caused his death," police chief Murphy J. Paul told 247sports on Saturday.
Wayde went to defend a friend and received a shot from Simpson.
During the interrogation, Simpson admitted to being at the scene of the crime, holding a gun and shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and detained at the East Baton Rouge Parish police station.
Sims, a 1.98-metre-high Baton Rouge player, played 32 games last season, holding 10 of them, and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points, and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Grand Prix of Russia: Lewis Hamilton approaches world title after team orders handed him victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that Mercedes team orders would have an important role in the race.
From the pole, Bottas had a good start and almost threw Hamilton into oblivion by defending his position in the first two laps and inviting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was the first to enter the boxes and let Hamilton run in the group’s queue, something that should have been decisive.
The Mercedes pulled out a lap later and stood behind Vettel, but Hamilton got ahead after an action with the wheels almost glued that made the Ferrari driver unwilling to leave the free interior at the risk of resisting after a double move to defend himself in the third corner.
Max Verstappen, who turned 21 that day, started from the last row of the grid and placed seventh at the end of the first lap.
He then led a large part of the race as he clung to his tyres to reach a quick finish and beat Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
Finally, he entered boxing in lap 44, but could not increase his pace in the remaining eight laps by regaining Raikkonen's fourth position.
It’s been a tough day because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and he was a real gentleman by letting me pass.
The team has done an exceptional job of getting a perfect couple," Hamilton said.
That's been a really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday for insisting she did not leak Christine Blasey Ford’s letter accusing Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court nominee, of sexual assault.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention Ford’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but commented that what was happening in the Senate showed that there are people who are “bad, disgusting and false.”
“The only thing that could happen and the good that is happening these last few days in the Senate is when you see anger, when you see people who are bad, disgusting and false,” he said.
“When you read the posts and the leaks, and then they say, ‘But if I didn’t.
I didn't."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you filter it?
Remember his answer... did you filter the document? - "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no, no, no.
I didn’t filter it.”
Well, wait a minute.
No, we didn’t filter it,” she added while mimicking the senator.
Feinstein was sent a letter detailing Ford's allegations against Kavanaugh in July and leaked in early September, but Feinstein denied the leak came from his office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s allegations, I didn’t filter her story,” Feinstein told the committee.
"She asked me to keep it confidential and so I did."
But his refusal didn’t seem to sit well with the president, who during Saturday night’s rally commented: “I’ll tell you one thing: that’s been a really bad body language.”
Maybe he didn’t, but that’s the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court nominee, who has been accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president suggested Democrats were using the allegations for their own purposes.
“They are determined to regain power by any means possible.
You see evil and disgust, they don’t care who they hurt, who they have to overwhelm in order to gain power and control,” the president said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars repaired the Elite League defeat on Friday to the Belfast Giants by winning the back game on Saturday by 5-3 at Dundee.
The Giants achieved an initial two-goal lead thanks to the attacks of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie got the local tie before Dwyer restored Giants leadership.
Francois Bouchard tied for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen's two goals secured his victory.
This was the third loss of the season in the Elite League for Adam Keefe’s men, who had just beaten Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth match of the season between the two teams, of which the Giants won the previous three games.
Dwyer's first goal came in the fourth minute (3:35) thanks to Kendall McFaull's assistance, while David Rutherford provided the assistance for Beauvillier to double the lead four minutes later.
In what can be considered a very lively starting period, Sullivan again put the local team eager to play in the 13:10 minute before Matt Marquardt attended Cownie to tie the game in the 15:16 minute.
Dwyer made sure the Giants would take advantage before the first break when he scored his second night's goal at the end of the first half.
The local team regrouped and Bouchard once again tied the game with a goal in the 27:37 minute.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time in the game as he reached the end of the second half and secured the victory with his team's fifth goal as the final approached.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, play at home against Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
An air traffic controller dies so hundreds of people can escape on the plane of the earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller is being hailed as a hero after he died after making sure a plane carrying hundreds of people managed to take off safely.
More than 800 people were killed and many are missing after a large-scale earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Strong replicas continue to hit the area and many find themselves trapped among the debris in the city of Palu.
Despite his comrades fleeing to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his position at the control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu, which was being hit by a strong swing.
He stood firm to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could safely take off.
Then he jumped out of the traffic control tower when he thought it was crashing down.
He later died in the hospital.
Indonesian Air Navigation spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, Australian broadcaster ABC News reported.
We had prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived at Palu.
“Our hearts are broken when we hear this,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the death toll could reach several thousand people. The national disaster mitigation agency says access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"It is believed that the number of victims will continue to increase, as there were still many bodies under the ruins and not many people could be contacted," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
Waves reaching up to six meters have devastated Palu, which will hold a massive burial on Sunday.
Aid and supplies are being brought on military and commercial aircraft.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute an ambulance arrives with more bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
Mini-markets are being looted everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is trying to help the survivors as much as possible, but we don’t know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy in itself, but it could have been much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country’s military: “I ask everyone to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?”, CNN reported.
Indonesia had already been hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Air Accident in Micronesia: Air Niugini Now Says Man Has Disappeared After Air Crash in Lagoon
The airline, which operates a flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, now says a man has disappeared after saying the 47 passengers and crew had evacuated safely the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday afternoon a male passenger could not be identified.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats were used to help rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island airport.
Authorities said on Friday that seven people had been transferred to a hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday and all were in stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events are still unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon ahead of the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane had crossed the runway.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane arrived very low.
“That’s something extremely good,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes comments that he and other travelers managed to advance through water that reached their waist to the emergency exits of the plane that was beginning to sink.
He said the flight attendants panicked and screamed, and that he suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors carrying out near a dock improvement work also helped in the rescue by using an inflatable boat to transport people to land before the plane sank about 30 meters (100 feet) underwater.
The data from the aviation safety network indicates that 111 people have died in accidents of airlines registered in Papua New Guinea in the last two decades, but none with Air Niugini.
Analyst presents the chronology of the night a woman was burned alive
The prosecution ended the filing of their arguments on Saturday in the new trial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He exposed to the jury how he used mobile phone records to chain up the movements of 29-year-old Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old Jessica Chambers on the night she died.
Rowlett said he received location data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers on the night of his death, thus contradicting his earlier statements, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his cell phone had been with Chambers’s during the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford went up to the stand on Saturday and testified that he had not been in the city that day.
When prosecutors asked Tellis if he was telling the truth when he said he was in the Sanford van that night, Sanford said he was "lies, because my van was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he had met Chambers about two weeks before his death.
The mobile records indicated that they had only met a week before.
Rowlett said at some point after Chambers’ death, Tellis deleted Chambers’ messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"He erased her from her life," Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its final allegations on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be held by the jury on the same day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip hop?
A hip hop trio wants to fill their music with positive messages to challenge the negative image of the genre.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claims that hip hop drifted away from its origins of political messages and dealing with social issues.
They want to get back to their roots and make conscious hip hop popular again.
Performers such as The Fugees and Common have seen a recent resurgence in the UK thanks to artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?
A New York babysitter sues a couple for firing her after a "racist" text
A New York babysitter is going to sue a couple for discriminatory dismissal after wrongly receiving a text message from the mother complaining that she was “another black person.”
The couple denies being racist and compares the lawsuit to a case of "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed her consternation when she discovered that the new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, was black on her first day of work in 2016.
"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Maurice twice.
After realizing her leg meddling, an "uncomfortable" Plasco-Flaxman fired Maurice claiming that her former nanny, who was African-American, had done a bad job and was instead expecting a Filipina, according to the New York Post.
Maurice got paid for the one-day job and sent it home on Uber.
Maurice is now suing the couple for compensation for the dismissal with the intention of receiving compensation of $350 a day for the six-month domestic work position for which he had been hired, albeit without a contract.
“I want to show you that things don’t get done that way,” he told The Post on Friday, adding that “I know it’s a case of discrimination.”
The couple responded to claims that they are racist by saying that terminating Maurice's job was the most reasonable, as they feared they could not trust her after offending her.
"My wife had sent him something he didn't want to say.
She's not racist.
We are not racists,” husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
“But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you have been rude to, even if it was by mistake?
To your newborn?
Come on!"
Comparing the lawsuit as an "extortion," Plasco said his wife had given birth to the baby two months earlier and was in a "very difficult situation."
“Are you going for someone like that?
That’s not that it’s a very decent thing,” added the investment banker.
Although the legal case is still pending, the public opinion court has rushed to denounce the couple on social media, criticizing them for their behavior and logic.
Paddington’s editors feared readers wouldn’t identify with a talking bear, reveals new letter
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said about the letter: "It was hard to put yourself in the place of someone who first read it before it was published.
It’s very funny to know now what we know about Paddington’s great success.”
After saying that his father, who had previously worked on BBC camera and was inspired by a toy bear to write the children's book, trusted that his work would be rejected, he added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books was something "sweet" after his death last year.
From Paddington, whom she describes as "a very important member of our family," she added that her father was very proud of her final success.
“He was a very quiet man and he didn’t like to brag,” he said.
But as Paddington had been so real to him, it was almost as if you had a son who accomplished something important: you’re proud of him, even if it’s not really your merit.
I think he saw Paddington's success that way.
Although it was his creation and the product of his imagination, he always gave credit to Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on the phone
Upon landing, her daughter was urgently transferred to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
“Nad called regularly to say that the situation was really bad, that he wasn’t expected to achieve it,” said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then I got Nad’s call telling me he was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And so I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs doctors had given him to keep his heart pumping were slowly running out and leaving his system.
She had died early and everything was turning out.
I could just sit there and wait, knowing all this was happening.
I couldn’t scream, scream or cry because I was in a situation surrounded by families and people.
I really had to stay strong.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now suffering from the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, alien to the terrible experience that was going on.
"Nobody knew," he said.
"I nodded my head and the tears fell all the time.
It’s hard to explain, but it was on the flight that I felt this overwhelming feeling of sympathy for Nad.
I needed all my love and understanding.
I knew how much I loved her.”
Women in mourning put cards to prevent suicide is a bridge
Two women who lost loved ones due to suicide are working to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been putting cards on a Welsh bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for help.
Tyler, Ms. Davis’s son, was 13 when he began suffering from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel what I feel every day,” he said.
Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said his son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
"Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said that their smile illuminated anywhere.”
However, he left the job before dying, as he was “in a really dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 at the time, was the one who found him after taking his own life.
Ms. Davis said: "I am continually concerned that it may have repercussions."
Davis created the cards “to let people know that there are people you can go to and talk to, even if it’s a friend.
Don’t be silent, you have to talk about it.”
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been Davies’ friend for years, lost Mark, her partner with whom she had been with for 15 years, shortly after her mother’s death.
“He didn’t say he felt depressed or anything like that,” he tells us.
"A couple of days before Christmas we noticed his change of attitude.
Christmas day reached its lowest point: when the children opened their gifts, he didn’t even look at them.”
He said his death was a great trauma for them, but they have to overcome it: “It leaves a void in the whole family.
It's ruined us.
But we all have to keep fighting.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance as FBI investigates
“I thought if we could really get something like what I was requesting (a limited-time, limited-range investigation), maybe we could bring some unity,” Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was “going to a picket” amid a partisan paralysis.
Why did Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI investigation to take place?
Its rejection is entirely due to the chronology.
If, as expected, the Republicans have poor results, their attempts to achieve the election of the man they want for the country's highest court will be severely weakened.
George W. Bush has been calling the senators, pressuring them to support Kavanaugh, who worked for him in the White House. Thanks to Bush, Kavanaugh met his wife Ashley, who was the President's personal secretary.
What happens once the FBI releases your report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh will be able to get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break the tie and confirm it to the Supreme Court.
North Korea's Deserters 'Caen' with Kim
The number of defectors from North Korea to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Southern Unification Ministry, said there were 1,127 desertions last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park said tighter border controls between North Korea and China, and the high tariffs that human traffickers charge, have been key factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments on the matter.
The vast majority of North Korean defectors are finally offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers deserters to be illegal immigrants rather than refugees and are often repatriated.
North-South relations, which are still technically at war, have improved markedly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to hold talks that focused on denuclearization negotiations.
This came after the historic June meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, which agreed in general terms to work for a nuclear-weapon-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed U.S. sanctions for the lack of progress.
"Without U.S. confidence, there will be no confidence in our national security and under these circumstances we will in no way be the first to disarm unilaterally," Ri said in a speech to the U.N. General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he's not fit to serve in Supreme Court
Nancy Pelosi, the minority leader in the House of Representatives, said Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh was a "hysterical" and unfit to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I can’t help but think that if a woman had acted that way, they would have said it was hysterical,” Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh used the emotion to deny accusations that he had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when the two were teenagers.
During his initial statement, Kavanaugh was very excited, sometimes almost screaming and choking as he talked about his family and his high school years.
In the committee, he also explicitly condemned Democrats, calling the accusations against him “grotesque and clearly coordinated defamations” organized by liberals angry because Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that, in his opinion, Kavanaugh’s testimony proved that he could not serve in the Supreme Court, because he showed his bias against the Democrats.
“I think he disqualifies himself with those statements and the way he has persecuted the Clintons and the Democrats,” he said.
Pelosi objected when asked whether he would challenge Kavanaugh if he was confirmed in office and the Democrats obtained a majority in the House of Representatives.
“I’ll just say one thing: if he’s not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, he won’t be fit not only to be in the Supreme Court, he won’t even be fit to be in the court he’s in right now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Circuit Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, he was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible sentences against the Affordable Health Care Act or the Roe v. Wade case, as he is considered a conservative judge.
At his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would override certain Supreme Court decisions.
“This is not the time for a hysterical, impartial person to go to court and expect us to think that everything is okay,” Pelosi said.
And women have to handle it.
It’s a justified diatribe, it’s months and years of fury overflowing, and she can’t let it go without crying.
“We cry when we get angry,” Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's that weird, do I?"
“A woman who was an executive at some company helped me a lot and who told me that she also cried when she was angry, but that she had developed a technique by which when she was angry and started crying, she said to the person she was talking to, ‘Maybe you think I’m sad because I’m crying.
No, I'm angry."
And then he went on with what he was doing.
I thought it was great.”
Tears are allowed as a way out for anger in part because they are basically misunderstood.
One of the clearest memories I have of one of my first jobs, in a male-dominated office, was once when I found myself crying with an inexpressible rage. An elderly woman, a serious manager of whom I had always had a slight fear, grabbed me by the cockroach and dragged me up a staircase.
"Don't let them ever see you cry," he told me.
"They have no idea that you're angry.
They think you’re sad and they’ll be happy because they think they’ve cornered you.”
Patricia Schroeder, who was then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his presidential career.
In 1987, when Hart was caught on an extramarital adventure aboard a ship called Monkey Business for which she had to retire from the presidential race, Schroeder, deeply frustrated, thought there was no reason not to explore the idea that she herself would run for the presidency.
“It wasn’t a well-meaning decision,” he told me in laughter 30 years later.
“There were already seven candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was one more candidate.
“Someone referred to us as Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.”
As the campaign was already very advanced, it lagged behind in fundraising, so it was promised that it would not re-enter the race unless it had raised $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She found out that some of her supporters who gave men $1,000 gave her only $250.
"Do you think I have a discount?" he asked.
When she gave her speech to announce that she would not have a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by emotions (gratitude for the people who had supported her, frustration with a system that made it difficult to raise funds and that focused on attracting voters rather than delegates, and anger at sexism), that she lurked.
"The logical thing would have been to think he had a nervous breakdown," Schroeder said, recalling the press reaction.
“You might have thought Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what are they going to put on my grave?
“Did you cry?”
U.S.-China trade war could benefit Beijing
The first rescues from the U.S.-China trade war were deafening, and while there is still a long way to go before the battle ends, a break between the countries could benefit Beijing, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump issued the first warning earlier this year by imposing tariffs on major Chinese exports, such as solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation took place this week with new tariffs affecting $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion) in products, charging taxes on half of products entering the United States from China.
On all occasions, Beijing has taken equivalent retaliation, recently applying tariffs of about five to ten percent on US products worth $60 billion.
China has committed to equating U.S. attacks, and it is unlikely that the world’s second-most powerful economy will soon loosen up.
Getting Washington to back down would mean yielding to the demands, but submitting publicly to the United States would be too embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Still, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards well, pressures from the U.S. trade war could positively help China in the long run by reducing interdependence between the two economies.
“The fact that a swift political decision in Washington or Beijing can make the conditions to initiate a slump in the economy in either of the two countries is actually much more dangerous than viewers have acknowledged so far,” said Abigail Grace, an Asia-focused associate researcher at the Center for New American Security.
Syria Ready for Refugees to Return, Foreign Minister Says
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help to rebuild a country devastated by a war that has been going on for more than seven years.
In a speech earlier at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the country’s conditions were improving.
“The situation on the ground is more stable and safe today thanks to the progress that has been made in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists to try to restore normality.
All the conditions for the voluntary return to the country of refugees who had to leave the country due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and livelihoods are already in place.
The UN estimates that since the war began in 2011, more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country.
There are another six million people still living in the country who need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem acknowledged that the Syrian regime would appreciate the help to rebuild the devastated country.
But he also stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or aid from the countries that promoted the insurgency.
Europe is made with the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team has won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the American team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National, just outside Paris (France).
The United States has now suffered six consecutive defeats on European soil since the last time it won a Ryder Cup in Europe in 1993.
Europe regained the crown when the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn scored the 14.5 points needed to defeat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who had to fight for most of the tournament, threw his starting point into the water in hole 16 par 3, thus admitting his defeat to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari stood out in all his rounds, becoming one of four players who have never achieved a 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth lost 5 and 4 to the lowest-ranked player of the European team, Danish Thorbjorn Olesen.
The world's number one player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 to Englishman Ian Poulter, who could have played his last Ryder Cup.
Spanish Sergio García, a veteran who already holds eight Ryder Cups, became the European with the most tournament wins of all time, with 25.5 points in his career.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a very tough year.
I am thankful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I am very, very happy to have been able to get the cup back.
It’s an achievement of the whole team and I’m very happy to have been able to help,” said a thrilled Garcia after the European team’s victory.
Now the torch passes to his compatriot John Rahm, who already defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods by 2 and 1 in an individual game on Sunday.
"I'm incredibly proud to have beaten Tiger Woods, as I grew up seeing this man," said 23-year-old John Rahm.
Woods lost all four games in France and now has a 13-21-3 record in his Ryder Cup career.
This is a strange statistic for one of the best players of all time, who has won 14 great titles, leaving just behind Jack Nicklaus.
The American team had to struggle throughout the weekend to find the streets, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-level golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk spoke after his team’s disappointing performance: “I’m so proud of these guys, they’ve never stopped fighting.
There was a moment this morning when we warmed the situation in Europe.
But we're gonna lose it.
I want to congratulate Thomas.
He's a great captain.
His 12 players have played a very good game.
We’ll regroup, I’ll meet with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee, and we’ll move on.
I love these 12 guys very much and I feel proud to be their captain.
Now it is our turn to bow our heads.
They have surpassed us.”
