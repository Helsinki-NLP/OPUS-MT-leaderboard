Screaming to the world
The Looks Like You Need Iceland marketing campaign has gone well and the screams and calls out in the wild are starting to attract people wide and wide around the world.
“You own the street, I need Iceland,” says a woman outside the big world in a commentary on an ad from the YouTube campaign “Looks Like You Need Iceland.”
Another viewer says goodbye to Iceland will keep Iceland in her heart forever, and a young woman says she has to get to Iceland as soon as possible after her boyfriend settles there.
Unfortunately, she is in the United States, and it is expected that she will have to wait a few more months.
Another viewer asks if the hiking route to Iceland is possible, because there are no planes.
It doesn’t matter if it comes from another time zone.
Egill Thord<0xC3><0xA5>rson of advertising firm Peel, who made the ads together with international advertising firm M&C Saatchi, says receptions have been hopeful for the future.
“I’ve come across many Inspired By Iceland campaigns that have gone very well, but this new campaign is already starting to hit the mark.
Basically, this is about creating PR value, that is, getting foreign media to discuss the campaign, and it has gone incredibly well.
In a relatively short period of time, we have received coverage in about seven hundred media outlets around the world, reaching a total of more than two billion people.
The value of the report is estimated at CZK 1.8 billion.
It's not awful."
The main market is still the United States, and the campaign has gone very well, even though the United States is not on its way to the country in a hurry.
According to Egils, well-known market areas such as Denmark, Britain and Germany have also been well-received, such as Russia, which is conveniently surprising.
Then there have been reactions from foreign regions, such as India, which was not specifically addressed.
“These ads have traveled farther than we expected,” Egill says, but it could be that over four million people have watched the content on YouTube.
“We couldn’t have asked for a better start.”
The pictures here at the opening were taken by <0xC3><0x81>rni S<0xC3><0xA6>berg, photographer of the Morning Newspaper, when we were taking ads with the headline “Let It Out” in the middle of last month.
The demonstrations took place in Reykjavík, Reynisfjör<0xC3><0xB0>ur, Skógarfoss, Sólheimajökli and in a cave near Hjörleifsköp<0xC3><0xB0>.
The film was directed by Samuel Bjarki Pétursson and Gunnar Páll <0xC3><0x93>lafsson at Skoti productions and directed by <0xC3><0x93>ttar Gu<0xC3><0xB0>nason.
In the early stages were the Icelandic Anna Jia and Murphy Cardenas, who are from Cuba and Hungary.
Dozens of Icelanders came to make the advertisements, but at the same time as the recordings took place in Su<0xC3><0xB0>urland, there was another group in Westfjords and Westfjords.
According to Egils, "Let It Out" is only the first part of the Looks Like You Need Iceland campaign, but is aimed at a winter campaign in partnership with M&C Saatchi.
“This is just the first fascia in this work for Iceland’s agency,” says Egill, adding that the collaboration with M&C Saatchi has gone extremely well.
“It’s great to work with them.
In such projects, it is very important to have foreign partners with knowledge of the markets with which we are talking."
Explosives: Discuss the position on the labor market, pension fund and much more
<0xC3><0x81>smundur Einar Dadason, Minister of Social Affairs and Children Affairs, will meet in Sprengisand, which starts at 10 a.m. on Wave today.
He is also the Minister of Labour and discusses the status of the labour market as such, the Icelandair case and more.
He also discusses rural and relocation activities in a country that has gone badly and has been controversial in recent years and decades.
Ragnar <0xC3><0x9E>ór Ingólfsson, Chairman of VR, will also be present on the show, but he will discuss his criticism of the investment of pension funds and presents ideas that the labour movement and employers should withdraw from the management of the funds in order to reduce the risk of risk of interest.
Then, <0xC3><0x8D>var Ingimarsson, the tourism service provider in the East, and <0xC3><0x81>rnhei<0xC3><0xB0>i Jóhannsdóttir, the manager of the Nordic Market Authority, will discuss the situation in tourism in the countryside.
They will look forward to the autumn and wonder if the success of the summer is a misleading prediction of what is to come.
You can listen to the show below, but it starts at 10 a.m.
This is what it looks like 25 years later.
Actress Elisa Donovan has had a successful career in adolescent shows of all kinds.
She was best known for her role as Amber in the film Clueless 25 years ago.
She also starred in Sabrina: The Teenage Witch along with Melissa Joan Hart, A Night at the Roxbury, and Beverly Hills 90210.
Donovan is now 49 years old, married with one child.
Little has been done to her lately, but she got to look over the road and talk about Clueless on Australian television in the daytime.
She speaks beautifully about Brittany Murphy, who died unexpectedly in 2009 and says she has been a great person.
“I have to admit that I built my personality mostly on girls I met in school who were not good to me.
As soon as I read the script, I knew who this character was," Donovan said of his play in Clueless.
He didn’t want to leave the police station after a night out.
Approximately 50 cases were reported to the police in the capital area today, and the police diary says that the cases have been varied.
The day at the police station on Hverfisg<0xC3><0xA5>ta began with the need for police to have an exchange of a man who had recently been released from a prison cell after staying there due to an alcohol attack.
The man did not want to leave after he was released and did not obey the orders of the police who told him to leave.
The man continued to stay in the police station because of his progress.
In the morning, a man was arrested on suspicion of burglary in a company in Kopavogi.
Police also had to intercept two men in Brei<0xC3><0xB0>holt due to reports of a body attack.
It also happened that a woman who was sitting at a snowmobile in a shopping mall in Kópavogi could not pay for the bill at the end of the meal and was called to the police.
A car was also reportedly stolen in the city this morning.
A driver of a white Renault van looked at her for a while and she was then taken by an unfree hand.
The car has not been found.
The Curse of the Joy Team - The Terrible Destiny of the Gleeststars
This theory has reached the Internet of the curse rests on the series about the Joy Force, but actress Naya Rivera drowned in California in the days, thus becoming the third main protagonist of the episodes to leave life far ahead of ages.
The Glee series is a popular series about singing, dancing and joy.
The episodes focused on the joy of so-called elementary school teens, their love and destiny.
It wasn’t always the joy of being in the joy band, but through singing and dancing, the characters of the actors seemed to overcome every situation that came up in their lives.
But outside the scene, great calamities have come upon the actors and the staff of the episodes, so much so that the doctrines have awakened that the curse rests on the episodes.
Naya Marie Rivera played the role of Santana Lopez in the episodes, a clapper who didn't call all her grandmother.
After the series ended, Rivera became the owner of actor Ryan Dorsey and had his first and only child, Josey.
In 2017, Rivera was arrested for domestic violence against her husband and subsequently divorced.
Dorsey, however, refused to file a complaint and the domestic violence case was dropped.
On July 8, it was announced that Rivera had been missing after her four-year-old son was found alone on a boat on Lake Piru, California.
The boy was found sleeping in a life jacket on board the boat and was able to report to the police that he and his mother had jumped into a pool and that Rivera had brought him back into the boat but had never returned there on his own.
A thorough search for Rivera began.
The day after the search began, the police chief in the area informed us that we had presumed that Rivera had drowned.
Five days later, Rivera was found and was officially sentenced to death.
She is believed to have landed in a heavy stream in the water and used her last claim to save her son.
The cause of death was reported to have been drunk by accidents.
Cory Allan Michael Monteith played the role of Finn Hudson in the series, the American footballer with the angelic voice playing a key role in bringing the Joy Team to glory and respect.
Outside of the show, however, Moneith struggled with personal demons.
From the age of 13, he had struggled with addiction and found it difficult to escape from it.
In 2013, his co-stars in the episodes were satisfied, intervened and encouraged him to seek help.
Moneith then went into treatment and everything seemed to look better.
Just two months after finishing treatment, Moneith was found dead in a hotel room after going out to have fun with friends.
Banamein proved to be a deadly mixture of drugs and alcohol.
I didn’t think it was a matter of willpower.
Moneith had undergone treatment and his tolerance to poisoning had decreased so much that the dose he had previously tolerated well turned out to be lethal.
He was only 31 years old when he died.
His death weighed heavily on his colleagues, but on the basis of his opponent, Lea Michele, it was decided to continue the participation of the cast and they consecrated the whole part to the memory of Moneith and his character Finns.
Mark Wayne Salling played the role of Noah "Puck" Puckerman in the series, Puck was an American footballer, like Finn, and had little respect for his fellow cheerleaders, or even until he gained the courage to admit that he enjoyed dancing and dancing.
Two years later, Salling was arrested at his Los Angeles home on suspicion of child pornography.
While searching his home, a huge amount of child pornography was found and the matter soon became public.
It was clear that Salling had already been there.
He was convicted and convicted of his crimes.
He was sentenced to four to seven years in prison, in addition to having to be on a sex offenders list and seek treatment for child avarice.
Before the judge had decided the sentence, Salling, who was then free from insurance, was found dead near his home.
The cause of death was suicide.
It wasn’t just the actors who fell from far into the past.
Jim Fuller was the assistant director of the show.
He fell asleep in 2013 at the age of 41.
The show also featured a woman named Nancy Motes.
She was the younger sister of the big star Julia Roberts and did not bring her sister beautiful stories, but she blamed Roberts for great control and disrespectful behavior.
Motes took her own life in 2014, but she struggled with severe depression.
She left a letter to her fiancé in which she made her mother and sister, among other things, responsible for how things happened to her.
“My mother and so-called siblings get nothing from me except the memory that they were the ones that caused my worst depression.”
Lea Michel was the star of the show.
She has recently been accused of harassing and overtaking her co-stars and having an obsolete star.
Jesse Luken starred in the series in 2012.
He was arrested and charged with beer abuse in 2019, which was deeply disturbing.
Actress Heather Morris played a major role in the series.
It happened in 2010 that unpublished computer hacks came into nude pictures of her and published on the Internet.
Actors Melissa Benoist and Blake Jenner both played in the episodes and had a love affair outside the episodes.
Benoist later reported that Jenner had abused her in the relationship.
You can put flowers on almost anything.
It increases the development of children when they get to play in the garden with their parents to grow flowers and get to watch them grow and mature.
It is also infinitely possible to do with flowers as the Swedish photographer Anna Kubel points out.
Just having time with the kids in the garden is something that will never be forgotten.
They will remember the flowers, the fragrance and, of course, the precious time they had with their parents.
Purchased a boat after 10th grade
“I don’t think we are many seafarers who work in the country’s nursery schools,” says Axel <0xC3><0x96>rn Gu<0xC3><0xB0>mundsson, who spends the summer hunting on the beach but teaches psychology at the University of Iceland during the winter season.
Beach hunting is a very comfortable summer job when you are studying.
If you fish well, you can have a good income and I feel great to be able to skip taking a study loan.
The income is also good for me in the winter,” says Axel <0xC3><0x96>rn Gu<0xC3><0xB0>mundsson, a 25-year-old psychologist who is doing beach hunting in the summer like last summer.
Axel was the youngest at a brewery in Tálknafjör<0xC3><0xB0>ur when a reporter got a talk of him late in the evening at the beginning of the week."
“The winter I was in tenth grade, I took command of boats that are less than twelve meters long and I bought my boat in the summer after I finished elementary school.
I’ve been fishing on my boat since the summer.
I bought the boat used by my acquaintance, Hartmanni Jónsson, and I gave the boat its name.
Hartmann had become an adult when I bought the boat and stopped being at sea and he was very happy when he saw that the boat carried his name.
Hartmann died a few years after I took the boat," says Axel, adding that he bought the boat for three million.
“I made a deal with Hartmann to pay half, one and a half million, at the beginning of the summer and the other half at the end of the summer when I had finished fishing.
I had the boat clean at the end of my first summer on it.”
But how could a boy have gotten a million and a half to pay off on a boat when he had just graduated from primary school?
“I had already submitted and collected money, I had been working with my dad at sea when I was a boy, I was all summer fishing with him and got my share.
I also put my farm money in my boat treasury.”
Axel was born in <0xC3><0x8D>safir<0xC3><0xB0>, where all his mothers are, but he has lived in Kópavogi since he was a boy.
“I can fish here in the west because I have a legal residence with my grandmother in <0xC3><0x8D>safir.
I learned in this area here to the west of rowing with my dad.
I move between the distances depending on how I feel, because this fishing area covers the entire West Bank.
Although I feel best to be in the west, I have also provided around Sn<0xC3><0xA6>fellsnes and beyond.
I have also provided for the south, but preferably for the grasslands," says Axel, who always catches one early in the morning and sometimes says to talk to the waves and sing for the sky, for the lonely hours together on the seashore.
“The networking at sea is good, so I can call, listen to radio shows and music.
I don’t feel like being alone on a boat.
Of course, I try to avoid landing at high altitudes, but certainly occasionally something has been in the weather, but never a big risk," says Axel, who is fortunate that he is never sea sick.
He says the length of the day depends on how the hunt goes.
“I’ve never been fishing more than 14 hours at a time in beach fishing, but I’ve also been fishing in other systems, for example in the rental quota, but then I’ve been out fishing for a day and a half at sea.”
The beachside arrangement says he can catch 770 kilograms a day, which he finds hampering.
“Other hurdles are that I am not allowed to fish on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, and I am only allowed to fish twelve days a month, in these four months that beach fishing lasts, in May, June, July and August.
In my opinion, seafarers should choose their fishing days according to the weather and nothing else.
This unnecessary pressure is on people to calm down instead of having 48 days throughout the summer and can choose according to their head.
So the division of the area could also be due to me and the sea area that is well located with the fishing should be able to enjoy it," says Axel, who draws the bulk of cod from the salt sea on its shorelines, but also only oak and some other species float with it.
Axel works during winter time with his university degree at the school Núpi in Kópavogi.
“I don’t think we are a lot of seafarers working in the country’s kindergartens,” says Axel proudly, adding that he only intended to work temporarily in the kindergarten.
“I’m here because I think it’s a wonderful job.
I hope that my psychology studies will benefit me in the kindergarten stage in the future," says Axel, who also has a long way to go in business studies.
An error in registration prevented the return gate
An error in the registration form that people fill out when it comes to the country caused a person, residing here in the country, not to be recalled for sampling.
There is no requirement to register an identity number if the person fills out the form in English, as it is when it is done in Icelandic.
“This will be reviewed this week,” says a specialist in the field of contraception from a rural doctor.
Three domestic infections were detected in the Virology Department of the National Hospital yesterday.
One of those who turned out to be positive arrived in the country on July 15, two days after the rules on so-called return arrangements came into force.
Those who were residing in Iceland are then screened upon arrival in the country and again announced in sampling four to five days later.
It turned out in the R<0xC3><0x9A>V news that the person had, however, gone according to the old system.
The border sample was negative and it was not recalled in the screening for the virus.
Kamilla Rut Sigfúsdóttir, a specialist in the field of prevention, says in a conversation with a news agency that this may be due to an error in the electronic registration magazine.
Fill out the registration form in English is not a requirement to insert an ID number as it is in the Icelandic version.
First and foremost, it is intended for foreign tourists.
Therefore, the person concerned has not been automatically invited to come to the sampling.
However, Kamilla says many have followed the rules on the return way even though they have filled out the registration form in English and in some cases employers have also been vigilant about sending people back for sampling after it arrived in the country.
“This week we will look at how to make it easier for people to get their attention in the process.”
The man is in solitary confinement and six have been placed in custody.
They all went for a sampling, but two had started showing symptoms.
Infection is currently underway with the three infections detected yesterday, but it is largely completed due to two infections reported on Friday.
In both cases, the sequence analysis of Icelandic genetic analysis has revealed that there are variants of the coronavirus that have not been found here before.
In the second case, the ties have pointed out that Israel, although it is known that the person who carried the virus to the country had also traveled to other Europeans.
Kamilla says there should be tomorrow where the other virus would come from.
There are currently 15 in isolation according to the website COVID.is.
There are 135 in total.
Four out of five outbreaks unrelated
Five domestic infections have been detected here in the country in recent days.
Four of them are completely unconnected and the origin of the infection that came up at the Rey Cup athletic event yesterday has not yet been found.
Infection is still present.
Initially, the third dozen were sent exclusively to prison, but they were reduced to sixteen.
A total of 34 are in custody due to these new infections detected yesterday.
This is the second time in a short time that infection has been detected at a sporting event and has raised questions about whether to hold such an event.
Jóhann K. Jóhannsson, head of communications at the national police department, says it slowly, as long as people follow the criteria and rules.
“We are constantly urging everyone who lives here that it is necessary to uphold the individual antibiotics.
We also need to make it clear to people who are holding events that there are certain rules in place that need to be followed.
“You can have an event,” John said.
He says that it is possible to prevent infection by holding in the air personalized antibodies.
In addition, the rules and standards are in constant review.
“What needs to be done, and what the Department of Human Rights and the Department of Rural Medicine are constantly pressing for people, is to think about these individually contagious antibodies.
Both for home and so on with the service companies.
People wash their hands and drink alcohol.
It prevents the infection from continuing," says Johann.
“We need to urge people to continue on the good path we have been on in order to be able to sustain the success we have achieved so far.”
40% of COVID-19 victims had diabetes mellitus 2
Devon Brumfield heard on the phone how difficult it was for her father to catch his breath.
Her father had diabetes, and she urged him to seek medical attention.
The next day he was dead.
Death was attributed to sudden breathing difficulties due to coronavirus infection.
Diabetes was listed on the death certificate as the underlying problem, and Brumfield, who also has diabetes, is terrified of dying as soon as possible.
The Reuters news agency says Brumfield's fears are not without reason.
According to a new study by the U.S. government, nearly 40 percent of those who died had diabetes as an underlying disease.
When the percentage of those who had not reached the age of 65 is examined, the proportion increases by half.
The U.S. Surveillance Agency (CDC) surveyed more than 10,000 people in 15 states who died from the coronavirus between February and May.
Jonathan Wortham, a CDC infectious disease expert, says the findings are striking, not least for those diagnosed with diabetes 2 and their loved ones.
Hidden in the slow growth rate, Reuters conducted a survey and pointed out the responses from the 12 states that responded to similar proportions.
10 states, including California, Arizona and Colombia, have not yet begun to report on the underlying diseases.
“Diabetes was already a slow-growing epidemic.
Now COVID-19 has broken through as powerful a century," said Elbert Huang, director of the Center for Chronic Disease Research and Policy at the University of Chicago.
Diabetes mellitus is more common among blacks and people of South American origin, which has also been worse off from the coronavirus.
One of the best protections for those with diabetes mellitus 2 is to keep the disease in check with fitness, a healthy diet and the help of health professionals.
The coronavirus era, however, has made it difficult for many to keep up with routines.
At that time, high insulin prices have led some to continue attending work and thus to stop being exposed to the virus.
According to Reuters, the U.S. authorities may have been aware of the risk that those with diabetes 2 could be caused by the virus.
When the SARS coronavirus spread in 2003, more than 20% of them had the disease, and in the swine flu epidemic in 2009, this group was three times more likely to have to be hospitalized.
When MERS was observed in 2012, one study found that 60% of those who died or were hospitalized had diabetes.
Charles S. Dela Cruz, a scientist at Yale University, says that because of the effects of the COVID-19 virus, the epidemic may have stripped the cover of a number of previously unknown complications.
“I’m afraid we’ll see a flood of problems when this is over,” said Andrew Bolton, president of the International Diabetes Association.
Physicians have warned that the coronavirus age could indirectly lead to an increase in diabetes-related complications, including kidney disease and renal dialysis.
Similarly, new research is directing the coronavirus to lead to an increase in diabetes cases.
Reuters says scientists are trying to understand the link between the coronavirus and diabetes mellitus 2.
The virus attacks the heart, lungs and kidneys, organs that are already weak in many people with diabetes.
Then, a high glucose and lipid ratio in diabetics can induce a true “cell message storm,” as it is called when the immune system reacts too hard and attacks the body.
Damaged inguinal cells can also lead to inflammation, which in turn can lead to lethal blood clots.
“It’s all a big puzzle,” says Dela Cruz.
“It’s all interconnected.”
The news has been corrected.
“We were offered champagne, so they left the room.”
The couple <0xC3><0x81>srún Magnúsdóttir and Atli Bollason had the unusual pleasure of having sex in front of a camera for a work that the artist was installing in Paris.
“We loved each other so it wasn’t difficult.”
Atli Bollason never forgets this when he meets his wife and midwife, Asruna Magnúsdóttir, for the first time.
“I was very impressed with her.
Of course, it was just the radiation, but I also found it incredibly cute.
And it still sucks,” he says.
It’s also important to remember that your husband is the first person you meet regularly.
“I’ve always heard this story.
Last weekend only," she says, who was also attracted to her husband at the first acquaintance.
“I felt and feel so much excitement around Atla, which I love.
There’s a lot going on and a lot going on and I’m excited about it.”
Atli says the couple have emphasized in their relationship to go their own way.
“We don’t tie our bags to the same knots as passengers.
“We’re going to get rid of the ruts we’re going to get around.”
That’s probably why they took the idea from Ragnari Kjartansson’s artist just cheerfully, though it would be, to put it mildly, unusual.
“Kristín Anna, our shared friend, contacts us and asks if we can come and have a dessert with her, Ragga and Ingibjörg Ragnar’s wife, at Snaps.”
They accepted the invitation, met the trio at Snaps, and got their own dessert wine and their own dessert.
They listened to Ragnar who guided them through his plans for an art exhibition he planned to set up at the Palais de Tokyo in Paris in the fall.
“He had a multi-directional video work called Scenes from Western Culture.
He described it in a simple way.”
Asrun says that he described the work as a banal and decadent episode of the everyday life of Westerners.
“He had sketches of all the tendons he was going to shoot, and the last time he told us he wanted to know if we were interested in participating.”
The senan that Ragnar asked the couple to join was supposed to show young internship couples making love in a minimal room.
“It’s a relationship with the beginning and the end,” says Atli.
The couple didn’t know Ragnar much, though they knew about him and he knew about them, “but they knew us and found us fit into this.
They said they didn’t want to advertise to people.
Maybe they thought they wouldn’t get the right people, but people who get the sexual affinity from performing for others.”
They nodded to Ragnar and agreed to think about it, but it didn’t take long.
“When we ran out of Snaps, we said, ‘Aren’t we just in this?
It was just like that.
I trust Ragnari as an artist and his entire team," says Asrún and Atli.
“It’s about love and closeness.”
Senan was recorded in a fine apartment on M<0xC3><0xBD>rarg<0xC3><0xAB>tn.
There was a very small film team; a cameraman, Ragnar and a speaker and the couple.
After the recording was turned on, everyone left the room to wait outside in the car except Atli and Asrun.
“We haven’t decided what we should be like.
We got some instructions but we tried to forget the time and place.
To be unsure of what we would be doing and for whom.
It wasn’t a game, we just loved each other so it wasn’t complicated,” says Asrun.
But was it romantic?
“Yes, it was a little romantic,” Atli and Asrun agree.
“We were offered champagne before they left the room.
It was a little like being on vacation in a nice hotel in Paris."
The team was satisfied with the performance of the couple in the work that moved with them.
“When Tommi’s assistant saw this, he was crying, he thought it was so beautiful,” Atli says.
“It’s just as much about love and closeness as it is about relationships,” says Asrun.
The couple’s parents have seen the work and tell Atli that his mother heard the voice of his son at the Reykjavík Art Museum and then realized that he was part of the work.
“Then she turns around and starts poking around,” Atli says.
“Mom and Dad saw it in Paris.
We hadn’t told anyone this way, but then my dad just sent me a message and said, “It’s nice to meet the little family at the Palais de Tokyo.”
Is it possible that the relationship between Atlantis and Atlantis has deepened?
“At least we’re still together, so maybe this deepened something.
This at least deepened my relationship with my cousin's family," says <0xC3><0x81>srún and laughs.
Asrun himself saw the work in Copenhagen with his colleague.
“I found it a little difficult not to be with you, but with someone else,” she says, turning to her husband.
“But it was fun to see this because it’s just a late in a much bigger work and when you see it with the other works, it’s really cool.
I could get away with it and I was just proud.
And there was a little bean in my stomach," says Asrun, who was unborn by the second child of the couple when the show was recorded.
“It was just beautiful.”
Anna Marsibil Clausen talks to Asrun and Atla in Love Stories on Rás 1.
Swansea wins the previous season
Swansea won 1–0 at Brentford in a dramatic game.
This was the first game of the teams in the previous round to make it to the English Premier League.
The game took place in Swansea, Wales.
The half-time position was 0-0.
Swansea's homers were knocked out in the 64th minute, but Andre Ayew was knocked out and defended.
Only two minutes later, Brentford player Rico Henry received the red card.
Brentford therefore played the rest of the game less and in the 82nd minute Swansea players took advantage of the team.
Andre Ayew then added a great goal and secured Swansea 1–0 victory.
Swansea leads 1–0 in the innings, with the second match taking place next Wednesday at home Brentford.
Presidential Decree of 5 years since 2009
Jeffrey Gunter Ross, the U.S. ambassador to Iceland, is in the spotlight after CBS reported this morning that he wanted an armed bodyguard as he feared for his life.
However, it has not been easy for the President of the United States to appoint an ambassador here in the country.
Since Carol Van Voorst stepped down as U.S. ambassador in April 2009, she has been without a U.S. ambassador for 62 months, more than five years.
Van Voorst was relieved of her duties under strange circumstances, but Kastljós reported in 2009 that she should have been awarded the Vocabulary.
On the way to a farewell meeting with the President of Iceland, she received a phone call from the office of the President saying that she would not be worthy of the word.
After she disappeared from Iceland, she taught international relations at Army War College.
It took sixteen months for Van Voorst's successor to take office in September 2010.
Robert S. Connan may have been appointed as an ambassador, but he resigned.
At the end of the job, Loius Ariega had worked in the foreign service for about a decade.
He then resigned in the fall of 2013 and assumed the post of ambassador to Guatemala.
Then came a second period of unprecedented success.
Robert Barber received approval from the U.S. Congress in January 2015 and came into office shortly after, but then no ambassador had been on the site for 13 months.
Barber was politically appointed, not a diplomat, but had worked as a lawyer and short-term trustee of Barack Obama.
He resigned as soon as Donald Trump took office on January 20, 2017, as is customary with a politically appointed ambassador.
The Trump administration was unusually long to appoint both ambassadors and high-ranking officials to the Washington administration.
So it took two years for the U.S. Congress to invite Jeffrey Ross Gunter to his meeting to question the spies and confirm the ending as an ambassador to Iceland.
In his testimony at the congress, he said he had never come to Iceland but often to Western Europe, but his wife, who died, had been broken by a Dutch rock.
Gunter is a former dermatologist in California and has been prominent in the Republican Jewish Coalition, the Republican Jewish Coalition.
Casino owner Sheldon Adelson founded the organization, but Adelson is a staunch supporter of Donald Trump.
Gunter came to Iceland in May 2019, but then no ambassador had been in the country since early 2017, for two years and four months, which is the longest case in the country.
The reason is both how long Trump’s administration was nominating people in key positions and that in recent years the work of the U.S. Congress has been greatly curtailed in the long run, including confirming an ambassador in office.
Since 2009, the number of ambassadors to Iceland has increased for more than five years.
However, it has not prevented the construction of the embassy, which opened its new headquarters at Engjateig.
The constructions are believed to have cost about 6.5 billion, but thick security walls surround the building and fired glass is in all windows.
However, it does not seem to have enough to fill the current ambassador with a sense of security because he is said to be afraid for his life and has wanted to get armed bodyguards.
Former IBV player became racist in Iceland - "It was a mistake to come to Iceland"
Tonny Mawejje, a former IBV player, says he has become racist when he was in Iceland and that he is looking forward to coming to the country.
This is revealed in an interview with Tonny, who appeared on Ugandan media Daily Monitor.
Tonny recently joined Uganda Police FC as a player in the top division of Uganda.
In the interview with the Daily Monitor, Tonny talks about a lot, including his time here in Iceland, but he played with <0xC3><0x8D>BV, Val and <0xC3><0x9E>rótti in Iceland.
“When I came to Iceland, I didn’t play in the middle as I used to play.
The team’s team was in that position, but he also had the shirt number I wanted, so I didn’t get any of what I wanted,” says Tonny while playing on the right side of the playoffs with IBV.
Among the things that Tonny talks about is racism that he experienced in Iceland.
He says this is a problem that many black players face when they play in Europe.
“It happened to me once, but since I didn’t understand the language, I just ignored what was said to me.
Later, I learned about the matter and then I asked my friend what the matter was about.
He then told me that my opponent had made racist remarks about me after I covered him.”
In 2014, Tonny moved from Iceland to Norway where he joined Haugesund.
He says he has made the mistakes he sees the most.
Tonny had not managed to get into the starting team at Haugesund but he wanted to play more to get into the national team.
Then he asked to go back to Iceland on a loan, but he joined Val.
“It was a mistake to come back to Iceland on loan.
I think if I had been in Norway longer, I would have gotten the chance I wanted to have," says Tonny, but he hoped that if he played well in Norway, he would probably go further.
He wants to mean that the loan to Iceland has made his dreams of getting to the big one in Europe come true.
Find worms in a woman's throat
Doctors at St. Luke's International Hospital in Tokyo found a 3.8-inch long black worm in the neck of a woman who was looking for it.
The doctors managed to pull the worm out with a tongue.
A study found that there were parasites involved in the study.
CNN reported on this.
The woman had a few days before eaten sashimi, which are thinly sliced meat.
The woman recovered soon after the worm was removed, but parasites such as this are often found in raw meat or fish.
After sushi rumbled to bed in the West, cases of parasites have spread to people, according to CNN.
Fear that another wave is about to start in Europe
Spain is now on the cusp of a second wave of coronavirus outbreaks in Europe, but governments have taken action to halt the spread of the coronavirus era again.
In Catalonia, all entertainment has been put on ice for two weeks, but there are more cities than Barcelona where infections are on the rise.
Other European countries have also taken action due to the increase of infections in Spain, but in the UK everyone has to go into crisis on arrival from Spain, as in Norway, and the French have been warned of trips to Spain.
Smitum is also on the rise again in France and Germany, where governments are trying to find a balance between stopping the spread of the virus and restoring the economy.
However, the situation in Europe is good compared to elsewhere in the world, but the incidence of infections worldwide approaches 300,000 per day, with the most infections in America and South Asia.
There are 16 million confirmed infections worldwide, according to the Johns Hopkins University census, and there are 644,000 confirmed deaths associated with the virus.
Mosaic Artwork Made Finally Gets to Enjoy Its Pleasure
In front of the Tollhouse in Reykjavík is a large and deep hole.
On top of it are men with orange helmets.
There is also a grave.
And more smaller working machines.
The road is closed to traffic.
But the pedestal is capable, and many people are now standing there, honoring works of art from millions of mosaic tiles —as if they had never seen it before.
Maybe they’ve never seen it before.
At least he didn’t respect it.
The work has so far been quite concealed, right in front there were parking lots that were always covered.
People lay there, locked the car in a hurry, and then jumped off to do their jobs in the city centre.
“Living and varied public spaces” and “attractive urban spaces” are the guiding lights for the reconstruction of the Tryggvaga street that is currently being rebuilt.
The aim is to beautify the area and to allow the mosaic paintings of Helgadóttir at the Customs House to enjoy the view better.
In front of the work will be a square and since the area is well located in front of the sun, it is considered to be well suited as a residential area for road users.
The artwork will be illuminated and now the material can enjoy itself better than before on this 142 square meter surface.
There will also be small “fog setters” in the area, some kind of water sculptures, which offer play and provide the area with certain hidden spaces.
In this way, the improvements are described by Reykjavík City, which is in progress along with Veitum.
Water supply, heat supply and power supply will be renewed.
Many of them have come to their ages, but the sewage and cold water drains date from 1925 and have therefore served residents and businesses in the city centre for almost a century.
When the street is reopened after completion, cars can drive around it again.
But it will become a one-way street and, as soon as possible, a quieter and more accessible space will be created for the walker.
In an interview about the Customs House on the website of the customs officer, he says that the house was put into use in 1971, but its architect was Gísli Halldórsson.
Because harbour damage reached through the house, 250 square meters of windowless wall surfaces were formed out to the street.
The building committee and the architect agreed that such surfaces would have a bad effect on the overall street view, if special measures were not taken to decorate the appearance of the house.
Members therefore agreed to calculate by having permanent works of art set up there.
At this time, a lot of words were made by Ger<0xC3><0xB0>ir Helgadóttir, an artist, says in the summary.
She had worked extensively on mosaic artworks in Germany and beyond.
The conclusion was to first contact her before deciding whether to compete for the work.
It had often been said that the work had to reflect life at the port, since the port had been the lifeblood of Reykjavík since it was made.
When she spoke to the artist, she became anxious about such a work.
It was agreed that she would receive drawings and other assistance before she left the country, where she would work on the proposals abroad.
Gerd was given the time she decided she needed, and when she returned home, she made some suggestions for discussion.
It was immediately agreed to ask her to do the work.
At the same time, it was desired to make a general agreement with her and the famous art company in Germany, the Oidtmann Brothers, but Gerdur had long worked with them on the installation of famous works of art throughout Europe.
Contracts were made and Ger<0xC3><0xB0>ur worked the artwork under installation at the workshop of the brothers, who then saw the installation at the Customs House.
The whole work was exceptionally well done, both on behalf of Ger<0xC3><0xB0>ar Helgadóttir and the Oidtmann brothers, says the summary.
Since then, it has continued to suffer unprecedented Icelandic weather.
It took Ger<0xC3><0xB0>i about two years to complete the work, which was completed and set up in 1972 and 1973.
The artist died two years after the customs work was completed, only 47 years old.
Preparing for the relocation of more institutions to land
<0xC3><0x81>smundur Einar Dadason, Minister of Social Affairs, announces that more public institutions will be moved to the country in the near future.
This was stated by the Minister in the episode Exploding the Wave at noon.
Recently, it was announced that the fire department of the Housing and Construction Agency will be moved north to Sau<0xC3><0xB0>árkrók in the autumn.
Six experts in the field of firefighting work for the organization, but none of them intends to follow the organization to the north, and the National Association of Fire and Medical Transportation Organizations has criticized the transportation of livestock.
“I think we need to take more steps in this direction.
I am preparing for a further step in this process.
"Further transport," said Asmundur.
He says he is convinced that the vast majority of the nation wants to see a greater distribution of public institutions throughout the country.
“I think it is necessary to make further policy decisions on the transfer of public services to the country, as I was doing with the Housing and Construction Agency,” said <0xC3><0x81>smundur, but he also took examples of other agencies that have been transferred to the country, as well as the transfer of public services to the country and the exchange of large amounts of money.
All the best from the second day of the tournament
94. Iceland's freestyle championships ended in Thorsvell on Akureyri today.
There were a few contests held on the second day of the competition.
There was an exciting competition in the women's sledgehammer in Thorsvell, but Vigdís Jónsdóttir from FH put <0xC3><0x8D>slandsmet in the sledgehammer in 2014, which lasted until Elísabet Rut Rúnarsdóttir from Ireland improved in May last year.
Vigdís won <0xC3><0x8D>slandsmeti<0xC3><0xB0> back earlier this summer and has been in fantasy form lately, but she has tripled <0xC3><0x8D>slandsmeti<0xC3><0xB0> what is summer.
Elizabeth Ruth has been struggling with injuries and has not been able to catch up today.
She had only one valid throw out of five, throwing 25.69 meters, which is far from her best.
Vigdís threw the longest of all today, or 60.08 meters in her last attempt and immediately set off.
Her Icelandic height she set earlier in July is 62.69 meters and she was therefore somewhat away from that.
Gu<0xC3><0xB0>rún Karítas Hallgrímsdóttir from Ireland had the second best throw of the day, but she improved her best performance by throwing up to 50.18 meters.
In the men's team, FH-only Hilmar <0xC3><0x96>rn Jónsson, Iceland's goalkeeper in the sledgehammer, won a secure victory but he threw 73.84 meters in his next last throw and set the torch.
The size of the island in this article is 75.26 meters.
Gu<0xC3><0xB0>ni Valur Gu<0xC3><0xB0>nason, an Olympian and Icelandic goalkeeper, won a ballistic competition in Thorsvelli yesterday, but today he competed in a ballistic competition that is his main field.
<0xC3><0x8D>slandsmet Gu<0xC3><0xB0>na Vals is 65.53 meters but he threw the longest 59.13 meters today and secured his victory.
Valdimar Hjalti Erlendsson threw the second longest today but he had one valid throw that was enough in the 2nd place, 49.43 meters.
Hafdís Sigur<0xC3><0xB0>ardóttir, Iceland’s long jump owner, won the long jump with superiority, while Hafdís jumped a maximum of 6.25 meters today, which is just 40 cm from her Icelandic team.
In the women's 200-meter race, it was the Irish-only Gu<0xC3><0xB0>björg Jóna Bjarnadóttir who jumped but she scored in 24.04 seconds, while her Icelandic score in the article is 23.45 seconds.
Gu<0xC3><0xB0>björg Jóna was a winner in Akureyri, but she won two gold prizes yesterday, in the 100-meter race and in the 4 x 100-meter betting race and then also in the 4 x 400-meter betting race today.
In the men's category, Kolbeinn Hö<0xC3><0xB0>ur Gunnarsson from FH was the first to score in the 200-meter race in 21.57 seconds, 0.3 seconds ahead of <0xC3><0x93>liver Mána Samuelsson from <0xC3><0x81>rmanni.
Like Gu<0xC3><0xB0>björg Jóna, Kolbeinn Hö<0xC3><0xB0>ur won gold in the 100 metres yesterday as well as in the 400 metres race.
Don’t get a penalty for a $27 million Bitcoin crop
The Overtax Committee has rejected the claim of a tax investigator who demanded a fine on a person for misrepresenting his or her financial income generated by the sale of the electric coin Bitcoin.
The Committee concludes that the Director of the Tax Investigation had not provided a clear justification for why it was necessary to punish the man.
In the decision of the committee, it is stated that the director of the tax investigation considered that the person has materially incorrect tax estimates for the income years 2016 and 2017.
He had misrepresented his financial income that was due to the sale of the e-money Bitcoin up to 27 million, either voluntarily or by great carelessness.
A fine would carry the man for his decency.
The man refused in a letter to the committee.
In 2016, he sold $27 million worth of e-money.
She would have been buried in 2009 and 2010 when it would have been both easy and costly with a normal home theft.
He then pointed out that when he sold the e-money, taxation for such a sale had been significantly uncertain and unpredictable.
It could hardly have been expected that the general public would have been aware of such measures in the field of taxation.
He would not have avoided paying the harvest tax and would have reported his assets on the estate as a deposit on the currency account.
He would have asked both the experts and the tax authorities how this would have been done, but without success.
Then he thought it was necessary to take into account that he was neither born nor raised in Iceland and had only lived here for a few years when he began digging for Bitcoin.
He would therefore have been in a worse position than others to familiarise himself with complex rules on which the tax authorities would not have formed a clear view.
The man therefore rightly believed that his taxes for these two years of income would be permanently determined and charged but otherwise not punished.
He then reiterated that he was a miner in Iceland and had paid taxes here in the country since 2012.
He would never have intended to dodge his responsibilities in a disobedient way.
The demand for a fine would be out of proportion and would throw him into debt.
Brynjólfur: “This man understands what football is about”
Brynjólfur Andersen Willumsson has been very popular among people, but he has also been impressed by the progress he has made in playing with Brei<0xC3><0xB0>ablik in the Pepsi Max division.
The fans will be in the line of fire tonight when they receive <0xC3><0x8D>A in live broadcast on Station 2 Sport.
Brynjólfur then takes a ban for four reminders at the playground and therefore does not come to play with a new cut as in the summer games so far.
He had written "bla, bla, bla" on his head before the game against HK last Thursday, which HK won 1-0.
“I don’t know who exactly he was responding to with the payment, but speaking of character, he was rather trying in the game.
He did not hide.
He wants to get the ball every time and if there was someone going to level this game then I thought he would do it or create it," said Gu<0xC3><0xB0>mundur Benediktsson of the Pepsi Max team.
“I’m here for the people.”
“Sometimes it’s hard to know where he is.
He looks a little out on the left side when it starts to feel at the games, but he has a very free roll in the team," said Hjörvar Hafli<0xC3><0xB0>ason.
<0xC3><0x9E>orkell Máni Pétursson says Brynjólf has real fun and is delighted to have such a colorful person in the class: “No one agrees that this is a character.
This is a fun guy and I love this with my hair, and always be ready to attend and respond in interviews.
There are a lot of people who are interested in him, who tell me that this man understands what football is.
“I’m an entertainer.
I have to be here for the people and enjoy it.”
People are reading the interviews with Brynjólf, people are paying for themselves and watching what happens next on his hair.
“He’s just a genius,” he said.
KR player says he wants to leave the club - "I have been in contact with some teams in the B-division"
Tobias Thomsen, a KR player in the Pepsi Max division, appears to be leaving the team.
According to the Danish media Bold, Tobias is ready to return home to Denmark.
Football.net also reported on the matter.
Tobias wants to reach the beginning of the period in his home country, but to do so, he must first terminate his contract with KR, where the Danish division begins before that of Iceland.
The company knows that I miss Denmark and has shown me a great deal of understanding," Tobias said in a conversation with Bold.
“I’ve been in contact with a few teams in Division B and will probably switch before the Icelandic season ends.
There aren’t many teams in Denmark that can afford to pay my contract with KR.”
He also said that he would have to make a salary cut in Denmark.
“Societies in Denmark have probably felt more about the economic impact of the virus than in Iceland.”
Bicycle rider Bjartmar has recovered a bike for millions - Now responds to DV review
For over a year, Bjartmar Leósson has had his own hobbies unlike most others.
He hurries up and rescues lost and stolen bicycles, electric bikes and scooters.
He has earned the name of the “bicycle rider” for the ride.
Yesterday, there was a great deal of confusion when a man published a story of his relationship with Bjartmar.
DV referred to them in a discussion on Facebook group West Villages where it was stated that Bjartmar took the man to speak in East Village and said the wesp could have been stolen.
It was not possible to read from the original letters of the electrician but that Bjartmar had robbed him.
Those texts have now been changed on Facebook and the headline of the original news DV updated accordingly.
Bjartmar says the initial news of the case does not explain at all what really happened yesterday in Easterwell.
Bjartmar said he had received information from the victims of the electrocution that these were indeed his electrocutions.
This information was obtained by the alleged owner from another, but the information proved to be incorrect, says Bjartmar.
“I looked at the guy and I explored the shuttle, ending with information that there was an electric shuttle that had been missing for a very long time and had been looking for.
I hesitated at first, of course, but when I saw him getting ready to go on the shuttle, I decided to talk to the man.
The owner was certain of his fault and so I decided to have a conversation with the man.
In general, I do very well in such matters, but before I could finish what I had to say, the man had taken away the word from me.”
Bjartmar says the man on the electric shuttle also invited him to show him the receipt for the bike and called the police himself.
"Yes, great," said Bjartmar, "let's get this straight."
Then the owner of the electric shuttle proved ownership of his electric shuttle and started.
Later, the rightful owner of the electric scooter told his story on Facebook, as reported in the previous news.
In this year that Bjartmar has given a moment to this exercise, he says he can count the changes he made to people on the other hand.
“I have had peaceful contacts with the toughest people in Reykjavík,” Bjartmar said, pointing out that bike thieves are mostly the smallest brothers and sisters in the community, drug addicts, mentally handicapped people and other people who are on the street for some reason.
“The crime is a hard master and somehow the next dose needs to be funded, unfortunately, stealing such ransoms is an easy way to achieve that goal,” says Bjartmar.
“My relationship with these people is so good that I’ve brought a lot of the good people with me into the team.
Examples are that people have gone into treatment and taken on and then looked for me and helped me with what I'm doing," he says.
In general, Bjartmar’s communication with cyclists is on courteous notes.
Some know about him and what he’s doing and offer peacefully to show him receipts, star numbers of bicycles and so on.
Bicycle theft is a big problem that has been little discussed.
In addition, Bjartmar says that the police are starting to point people to talk to him out of stolen bicycles.
Bjartmar is dissatisfied with previous DV news reports and claims not to be some kind of automated police in a personal search for justice.
Asked if he has not yet come to the ice with his activity, and if this is not primarily the role of the police, Bjartmar says so certainly be.
“Of course the police are supposed to do this, but the fact is that the police are not doing this.
I have to film watching policemen driving away from a large pile of stolen wheels.
“She’s completely powerless in these matters.”
“When the police aren’t doing anything about this, and this is just in front of your nose, and experience has shown that I can succeed in this category, then why not?” asks Bjartmar.
He says he has achieved so much success in having stolen wheels, that sometimes he runs into his “shoe-mates” on the street that then they just got the Bjartmari wheels they had previously gotten.
The time she called for help from the police was when she didn’t show up.
“It’s just not working with the police, and it’s not my fault, and it’s not the owners of the bikes’ fault,” Bjartmar said, regretting that the victims of bicycle theft have to suffer the lack of police in this case.
The success of Bjartmar is not shared.
You can find stories of people thanking Bjartmari for bringing their possessions back to them.
Bjartmar himself says he has long lost the number of bikes he has returned, but the amounts run in the millions, if not millions.
There are electric scooters, electric bikes and electric scooters on the road heavy, but electric bikes can cost up to half a million.
Bjartmar works every day in kindergarten and every other weekend he works in a co-worker’s home.
His bicycle journey is therefore an unpaid job that he does in his spare time.
Life Insurance Funds and Long Shadows
2019 was a great year in the history of pension funds in Iceland.
Officials had, of course, received a pension from the King of Denmark in all the streets from the 19th century, but in 1919 a pension fund was established for officials, which eventually became a pension fund for all public employees.
The basis for the current pension funds of general employees was then laid by general contracts on the labour market in 1969, which provided for an occupational pension fund with an obligatory membership and a full fundraising from the beginning of 1970.
In 1974, legislation was introduced on the basis of these agreements, and the pension system continued to expand thereafter.
The wage system of wage earners was not the only radical change that the labour movement of the 20th century brought about by its cravings.
Unemployment insurance had been obtained in a similar way in the course of the historic prosecutions in 1955, and also the organization gradually progressed its demands for sickness rights and health insurance, substantial leave rights, shortening of working time, such as improvements in housing and housing.
All these rights cost a great and rigorous struggle, but proved, to be considered, a much greater and more lasting change than the increase in the auras of wages, which disappeared equally hard in the heat of the price inflation that characterized the period after the war and until 1990, as many remember.
The appeal for the establishment of general pension funds in 1969 was both lengthy and complex.
Although the people eventually came to the conclusion that the funds would become the real property of fund societies, the labour movement had to fall on the fact that their boards were to be appointed by representatives of the employers and fund societies on an equal footing.
In the years following the foundation of the Funds, the demand for the majority of employees in the management of the Funds was often discussed in the organisations of employees, but it never succeeded, and therefore we still sit up with the abnormal arrangement that the representatives of the fund companies are not in the majority.
Article 36 of the Law No. 129/1997 on the obligatory insurance of pension rights and activities of pension funds deals with the investment policy of the funds.
It states in paragraph 1 that "the pension fund shall have the interests of the fund's partners in the spotlight."
It also states in Figure 5: “A pension fund shall set itself a moral standard in investments.”
The policy of the Life Insurance Fund of merchants includes, inter alia, the following provisions, in addition to the aforementioned legal provisions:
The Fund is a party to the United Nations Regulations on Responsible Investment (UN PRI), along with many of the largest pension funds and professional investors in the West Sea and in Europe.
The rules discuss how focusing on environmental and societal issues, as well as good corporate governance, can contribute to improving the investment performance of securities collections.
In this way, the interests of investors and the objectives of the society are combined in a broader context.
LV believes it is important that companies, especially those listed on the stock market, set themselves a public policy on: adopting good governance practices in terms of social responsibility and environmental issues.
The Valdi pension fund, which has the largest funds in the country, has set itself a “responsible investment policy” and there are provisions of a similar nature.
This is all summarized here as the introduction to Iceland’s newest fashion word, “shadow management”.
Since the word is new in the case, it is not hoped that it has been defined to respect, but it seems to me that the following definition is now "most taken": Shadow management is when a head of a political society says in the media that he intends to send a delegation to the representatives of the society.
If they do not comply with the recommendations, they will be dismissed at the first opportunity.
If the leader does not report this in the media and does not talk about resignation, then it is not “shadow management”, however, because such communication between people is of course always in the financial world as elsewhere.
I want the reader to think about what he thinks is the best way to do it.
In particular, there are two people who have tried to formulate this definition when this is written, on the morning of Saturday, July 25, 2020.
They are the Hardy <0xC3><0x86>gisson journalist at the Newspaper and <0xC3><0x81>sgeir Jónsson the Governor of the Central Bank.
The reason for both was that Bogi Nils Bogason, the CEO of Icelandair, had told the company's board of directors about his intention not to break the company's contracts with airline companies and airline operators (cancell them), and Ragnar <0xC3><0x9E>ór Ingólfsson, the chairman of the company's board of directors, sent them to Reykjavík.
Some time later Bogi Nils withdrew his decision and Ragnar Thor followed the same path with his recommendations, which were, of course, based on the decision of Boga.
Nevertheless, they saw Hard and <0xC3><0x81>sgeir as a reason to discuss the issue in the newspaper Newspaper on Friday with big words about shadow management, violations of the law and a rich need for changes to the laws.
There, indeed, a small duvet had to roll a heavy thrust even though the blessed duvet had been in a reconnection mode and had also been dried out soon.
As the matter is important, let us consider the matter itself in the end.
I have already mentioned in the previous section of the Law on Pension Funds that are relevant to this issue.
These include that the fund managers must take care of the interests of fund companies and have ethical standards in investing, and these items are implemented in more detail in the approved by both the Validity and the Life Insurance Fund of the merchants as I mentioned.
However, pension funds should NOT only look at short-term returns on their investments, but should also look at short-term returns on their investments.
Such a strategy would be very dangerous, and it is not necessary to look for examples of this in the past, where large loans from banks and funders have flowed to the immoral adventurers and environmentalists, with disastrous consequences.
Icelandair’s CEO was obviously on the brink of ice when he planned to wipe out a whole group of employees, significantly reducing the company’s well-being in the Icelandic market and weakening its position vis-à-vis investors.
Fortunately, he saw it and pulled it back.
Time reveals whether it is sufficient for the investment of pension funds in the company to be held accountable to fund companies when it is established.
The author is a former professor of physics and science history.
One of the victims did not have a home visitor.
One of the three who were diagnosed with Covid-19 in the country yesterday arrived in the country from the Baltic States on July 15 last, about a week and a half ago.
He is an Icelander who, however, is not residing here at all and therefore did not receive clear instructions on taking the so-called return procedure after arriving in the country and going for another sampling a few days after arrival.
He got negative from crossing the border.
“But he is in an Icelandic community and really should go to that resort,” says Kamilla Jósepsdóttir, a specialist in the field of antibiotics at Landsk<0xC3><0xA6>rk and a substitute antibiotics doctor while he is on summer vacation, in a conversation with Fr<0xC3><0xA6>ttabla<0xC3><0xB0>i<0xC3><0xB0> today.
“He used the English registration form and there is no obligation to register the ID number and if the ID number is not registered then you are not automatically invited to the second sample.”
She says that the man could have used the English registration form because he is actually a resident abroad but because of his connection to the country as an Icelander he would rather have used it in Icelandic.
But he didn’t realize this.
“When the tutorial is not registered, you need to apply for it yourself to come to the second sample.
Neither he nor his employer seem to have realized that that was the right way," Kamilla says.
“So it is clear that we need to improve the provision of information about this while we find some way to make an automated preaching system even if Icelanders do not register their ID number.
Or to make it somehow more obvious who are the participants in the Icelandic community in the registration system," she explains.
Fortunately, however, the person concerned is allowed to arrive in the country even though he is defined as a participant in an Icelandic society, a resident of Iceland.
Only six have been sent to the hospital since he was detected yesterday and these six were all in contact with him.
They are about to take a sample, but two of them are starting to show symptoms of Covid-19 infection.
The man received a negative from his sampling at the border on July 15.
Kamilla probably says that he was the one recently infected by the virus that she was not yet able to detect when the sample was taken at the border.
However, she does not want to exclude that the man has been infected here in Iceland but did not carry the virus with him to the country.
“It’s not entirely possible to claim that this is certainly an imported infection because it’s been a long time since he came to the country that he could have been exposed here like these two who have caused a bit of a stir in connection with the sporting events.”
She says it’s very unlikely because of how many people are around here.
“It’s actually very unlikely,” Kamilla says, noting that it cannot be ruled out until Icelandic genetic analysis has already sorted out the virus in humans.
"If we get a type of virus that hasn't been seen here before, it's almost certain that he brought it to the country."
Pepper sprays and bombs used against protesters
A riot broke out between police and protesters in Seattle last night.
The police used pepper spray and explosive handguns, but the protesters broke the windows and lit them.
Fifty-five protesters were arrested and 21 police officers were injured.
Police violence and racial prejudice were widely protested in the United States last night, but the protests in Seattle were in support of protesters in Portland, Oregon.
In Austin, Texas, one protester was shot to death.
As reported by the BBC, the attacker has been arrested.
Thousands of people gathered in Seattle for peaceful protests.
A group of people then set fire to a building area and broke windows in the city's courtyard.
Subsequently, the police said the protests were disturbing and clashes broke out between groups of protesters and the police.
In Aurora, Colorado, Elijah McClain, a 23-year-old black man who was murdered by police last August, was mentioned by protesters.
A car also passed through a group of protesters in the city but no one was injured.
In Louisville, Kentucky, hundreds of black national team members gathered to demand justice for Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old black woman who was murdered by police at her home last March.
The group carried firearms and marched in the counties to closed street meetings where police disassociated the group from a group of people who protested the protests and also carried firearms.
There were 75 arrests in Omaha, Nebraska, where protesters commemorate James Scurlock, a 22-year-old black man who was murdered by a white boss in May.
Sunshine: Not the game that defines our period
Ole Gunnar Solskj<0xC3><0xA6>r, Manchester United's head of football, doesn't want to do too much of the importance of the game against Leicester today in the final of the English Premier League.
If United loses the game, and Chelsea does not lose to the Wolves, Sunshine and his men end up in 5th place and thus lose the Champions League seat.
However, they should still hope to get into the Champions League by winning the European Cup next month.
“We’re not at the end.
If we reach a level against Leicester I think people will say that we have not had a bad time right now," Solskj<0xC3><0xA6>r said.
"But whatever happens then, this is not the end of our journey because we still have a lot of ground to reach the two teams above us," Solskj<0xC3><0xA6>r said.
It is clear that the nerves of the people will be tightened at 3 p.m. today, but Solskj<0xC3><0xA6>r tried to pretend as if there were any other game.
“If you want to be part of Manchester United, you have to get used to being under pressure in the last game of the season.
It’s nothing new, and that’s what the company is all about.
We’ve created a great opportunity to end the season well and now it’s ours to take advantage of it,” Solskj<0xC3><0xA6>r said.
“This is not the most important game of the season, it’s just the next game.
You can ask who is in the football, the next game is always the most important.
The results do not define our period, we have already had many times to define this period."
“Come Bruno Fernandes changed a lot for us and I think we are in a better shape and much stronger mentally than in the last period,” said Solskj<0xC3><0xA6>r.
65,000 infections per day
65,490 new coronavirus infections were detected in the United States yesterday, according to Johns Hopkins University.
A total of 4,178,021 infections have been confirmed in the west sea since the beginning of the epidemic in the country.
900 people died from the virus yesterday, but in the last four days, more than 1,000 died from the virus every day.
A total of 146,460 deaths from the virus have been confirmed in the United States.
According to CNN, the number of deaths due to the virus will be 175,000 on August 15, according to a prediction by the U.S. Anti-Counterfeiting Authority.
Fear of the Second Wave
The government of Spain is now trying to stop the increase in the prevalence of COVID-19 in the country.
The Spanish health authorities reported more than 920 new cases of COVID-19, both on Thursday and Friday.
There have not been any more detected in a day since the beginning of May, and the news comes at the same time as the Spaniards are beginning to ease one of the toughest exit bans in Europe.
As a result, the British authorities are now forcing passengers arriving from Spain to take shelter on their return.
A week ago, Spain was on Britain’s list of safe states.
The situation is worst in Catalonia in northeastern Spain, where governments have stepped up broader restrictions to try to keep pace with growth.
In the capital of Barcelona, entertainment venues will be closed for the next two weeks and golf clubs will be closed at midnight.
The ban is currently in force for 200,000 people in the county of Segria in western Catalonia.
It is believed that the decision of the UK will have a negative impact on the Spanish economy, which relies heavily on the arrival of foreign tourists and is a bad game after the pandemic.
Tui, the UK’s largest travel agency, cancelled all scheduled flights to Spain and the Canary Islands.
Governments around the world are said to be preparing for the second wave of the epidemic, but little interest seems to be in grasping back the scale of the exit ban that has largely ruined the economy.
Boris Johnson, the prime minister of the United Kingdom, has taken a very bad look at such and similar nuclear weapons that he does not want to use.
French Prime Minister Jean Castex has said that the nation "would not survive, economically or socially," if it were once again to be banned at the national level.
Hopefully many officials to that local resource that reaches to the inhabitants of individual towns, cities or regions will suffice to keep the virus back in the next round if it comes to it.
Five new infections in Iceland - Three domestic ones
Three domestic infections were detected yesterday as well as two more at the border.
This is how five people were diagnosed with positive Covid-19 infection yesterday in Iceland.
A statement from the public says one infection is related to the contagion reported yesterday at the ReyCUP football tournament.
He has been sent to isolation and sixteen who were in close contact with him in a prison.
The infected person was a participant in the social work of the Reykjavík Sports Association and is, according to the announcement, “only a part of the sport” in the competition.
Others who were sent to the hospital relate to the man in a different way.
The origin of this infection is unknown and transmission is in full swing with the contagion team of the State Police Director.
The organizers of the ReyCUP event have followed the guidelines and rules of the contraceptive and general practitioner that are still in force and have taken appropriate measures.
However, pictures of yesterday’s event aroused attention where one could see in very close cooperation to celebrate the good progress of his team outside the court.
Just before 11 a.m. today, the protesters posted the following announcement on their Facebook page.
“ATH: Parents, please respect the rules for competitors to pick up their own stuff at school.
Parents are not allowed to do this.
“Thank you for your understanding.”
A second infection was detected yesterday but related to the infection reported the previous day.
According to the report, “Icelandic genetic analysis has classified the infection and has revealed a new type of virus that has not been detected here before.”
Infection in this case is also being worked out and the person infected in isolation and 12 in contagion due to the infection.
The third infection in question is from a man who came to Iceland 11 days ago, July 15.
It is located in the southwest corner of the country.
He is now in solitary confinement and six who were in close contact with him in distress.
Two of them are already beginning to show symptoms of the virus.
In addition, two were identified at the border and the result of further research is awaited, such as a cross-border screening procedure.
Finally, the announcement states: The Department of Human Rights of the Head of State Police and the office of a rural doctor make it imperative for people to be careful and take good care of the individual anti-infectious agents.
The least doubt about the presence of symptoms of the Covid-19 virus is that the same person is asked to take a sample at the nearest health center.
Patreksfjör<0xC3><0xB0>ur says camp site booked on shop holiday - Direct guests
The campsite at Patreksfjör<0xC3><0xB0>ur is fully booked during the weekend, according to the announcement of Vesturbyg<0xC3><0xB0>ar.
Guests are advised to check out other accommodation options.
Names Vesturbyg<0xC3><0xB0> Bildudal, Tálknafjör<0xC3><0xB0>ur, Melanes na Ra<0xC3><0xB0>asandi, Hotel Flókalund and Hotel Brei<0xC3><0xB0>avík as other options in the position.
It is enough to be at Patreksfjör<0xC3><0xB0>ur this weekend, because, like last year, Skjaldborg, the festival of Icelandic documentaries will be held in the city.
It has been held since 2007 and therefore has become a stronger tradition in the city.
From the application in the camp area to be judged can expect a good meeting this year, if the weather does not put stringent in account, but DV said earlier today from the derivation of the prediction.
The worst weather can be expected, however, and hope for the Patreksfirds.
The website bb.is first reported, saying that all other accommodations in the city were already booked.
Fully urban house caves down to the best place in the city
Romanian workers live free in Dunhaga 18–20.
While the owners are applying for a building permit for renovation, their business has been improving in the system for the third year.
In one of the oldest, greenest and most expensive districts of Reykjavík, there is a large townhouse on three floors.
On the ground floor of the house is about 600 square meters of shopping space.
At the back of the house is a two-storey door, each of which houses four rather attractive apartments.
They are in the range of 93–130 square meters, but most are over 100.
The house has a long history to keep.
It was built in 1959 and has hosted, among others, video rentals, the Shoe Shop, the Dairy Store, the Jóa gunsmi<0xC3><0xB0>, a fish shop and now the University of Applied Sciences.
The house has, as far as words go, remembered its dumbest beauty.
The house is now undergoing serious damage, as can be seen in the accompanying pictures.
The owner of the house is D18 ehf.
The owners of D18 ehf. are according to the company register, among others, Magnús Magnússon and Gu<0xC3><0xB0>rún Helga Lárusdóttir.
Magnus joined the Borguna Owners' Group and was a defender of the Borguna Owners' Association.
In the group of owners of the ownership company Borgunar at St<0xC3><0xA5>lskip ehf.
Stalskip ehf. is the investment association of Gu<0xC3><0xB0>rúna Helgu Lárusdóttir and her children.
Gu<0xC3><0xB0>rún is also the third-party owner of D18 ehf.
Gu<0xC3><0xB0>rún and her husband, <0xC3><0x81>gust Gu<0xC3><0xB0>mundur Sigur<0xC3><0xB0>sson, once ran the type Steel Ship.
D18 ehf. bought the house in the summer of 2009 and has therefore little or nothing been kept since then.
Neighbors say the condition of the house has deteriorated steadily since then, but mostly in recent years.
On the Facebook page of residents in the neighborhood, one resident says that the house "has not been particularly lively in the last year".
There can be a game in which the owners have spent several years trying to change the house and the plot.
Other neighbors say the house hasn’t been in order for a long time.
“It’s a long time to do something decent with this spot, and it’s boring that it’s gotten that way.”
He also says that he is disgusted with the owners of the house for not drifting into finishing this, finding some common ground with the neighbors of the house and stopping this “legislative waste”.
“Just do this in consultation with the community around you so you can drift into this and finish it.”
The “legal waste” referred to by the resident is the organizational process of the field that has been underway at least since 2017.
The owners of Dunhaga 18 and 20 searched for permission to build a floor above the existing mansion and behind the house, a new elevator and a single-storey building as well as a basement.
The construction permit granted for that implementation was appealed to the Committee on the Environment and Resources and the Committee repealed it as the implementation was not supported by a divisional arrangement and the declaration of proximity was not sufficient.
Reykjavík City then started with the divisional team work and ended it with an advertisement in St<0xC3><0xB8>rnirtidnings in July last year.
That arrangement was also appealed and the committee repealed it in March 2020.
At this point, almost three years had passed since the initial application for a building permit and the owners of the house at the start.
At that time, the house had suffered greatly and the neighbors began to get tired.
When the DV asked the neighbors about the situation and the neighbors’ reactions, they were answered in various ways.
Some had an understanding of the intentions of the owners of the house, others not at all.
Others were angry with the city, others weren’t.
Others were just angry, but nothing necessarily out of the way.
Others said the parking lot was a hassle, but the neighbors have used the unused Dunhaga 18-20 parking lot under their vehicles.
One of the plaintiffs in the case said tired of the administration:
“The fact that we have to go through the process in three stages is quite incredible.
It’s like the city of Reykjavík can’t read.”
Today the house is empty, abandoned and neglected.
A memorial to the city's administration and the noble intentions of the owner and the many years of their work that is now at the starting point.
When a reporter walked to a garden on Dunhaga 18, we opened a galloping door and rubbish piles.
Playstation computers and a recent TV were within another rubbish on the earth — the victims of Icelandic summer blight.
It was opened in the old office of the University of Applied Sciences and there a lot of cats from the smell to judge.
It’s clear that someone has squatted around in one corner, but no one is visible.
Stacks of sofas and beds and a few trays of geology magazines, which were probably to become a book, exploded.
The hallways of the apartment were open as well as life in both of them.
The reporter was so lucky to hit the residents of the other.
There, the Romanians cooked a potato dish for dinner and invited a reporter in.
The Romanians work for the employee rental company Ztrongforce ehf.
They have been there for some time and have documented that the company has paid nothing for the house except heat and electricity.
Due to the condition of the house, it is not advisable to charge rent.
From the post office in the lobby of the house to be judged, it is clear that there has been a lot of foreign workers in recent miser.
The operation of employee hires has not gone through part of the Covid-19 situation, as contraction in tourism has led to contraction in the construction sector and these two industries have been the most efficient to take advantage of employee hire services.
Nonetheless, the residents of Dunhaga 18 seemed to have enough to do, and the work and the pilgrims in the community hung up after a long day of work in the rain.
It should be noted that despite the miserable condition of the house, the apartment that the boys shared seemed to be well maintained.
When a reporter gave the boys Romanian, the cold weather suddenly became clear to him: In the best place in Reykjavík, 1,500 square meters of real estate are ripped down.
Owners want to change the house for improvement and neighbors want to improve the condition while sharing the definition of “recovery”.
In between, the city’s organisational scope sits on the starting line, the victim of endless appeals and the possibility of appeals in the organisational process, and the phasing out of the decision of the Committee on the Environment and Resources.
In the house live such Romanian workers, perhaps even those who go to improve the situation, when the Icelanders stop fighting.
The article was originally published in the weekly newspaper DV on July 17.
In the fight against obesity after the coronavirus era
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson will donate <0xC2><0xA3>10m to a campaign against overweight, which will include banning fast-food ads, after he became seriously ill, partly because of his weight.
Johnson is due to present the campaign, which has been called Better Health, tomorrow, Monday, but with the campaign, doctors will be encouraged to prescribe cyclists for their overweight survivors and will also be attacked in an effort to increase the number of cyclists.
Advertisements of fast-food restaurants will be banned before 9 p.m. in the evening, according to British media sources.
“COVID-19 has awakened us to the short- and long-term risks of being overweight, and the Prime Minister is determined that we must use the time to become healthier, more active and eat healthier foods,” a government spokesman said.
Johnson himself has struggled with weight problems, but he was placed in surgical care when he contracted the coronavirus this spring, and that is partly due to his weight because of which he is believed to have been so seriously weakened.
Women are more likely to lead the change.
She said that the new government would be the biggest step that the nation could take towards greater power distribution, transparency, and the fight against corruption and the interests of the whole.
“We need to change gears a little bit now, and who is better at leading such changes than the group of society that should be easier to be in these values.
“There are women,” Helga said.
“Women in Iceland are famous for their women’s team.
Standing together and being together to bring about change.
So now it’s time for us to make these changes.”
She said she was a bit obsessed with the emphasis on Iceland as the “best in the world” in both gender equality and human rights.
“We’re not prepared to see what needs to be done.
Like Germans are very aware of their history and view everything that needs to be done.
That's a lot.
We need to know where we are coming from and know the story and listen.
Listen to the voices of distracted groups.
We don’t all live by the same rules here,” Helga said.
Asked, she said that women are in many ways in good hands in Iceland, but added that, as elsewhere, Icelanders are living with grossly masculine values.
She said that politics turned to forming its own interests, domination and power as the forces that sustained injustice in all societies.
“Women have now formed this group and come together and are just getting a little bit annoyed that the Althingi is going to move in to watch over this 2012 national vote,” she said.
“It’s these feminine values that we’re thinking about.
On the basis of human rights and nature protection, cooperation and that we are all really on the same board," she said, adding that the aforementioned values were the basic values of the new governance.
“We are a very rich country of natural resources and it is ridiculous that there are people living in poverty here.
It's ridiculous, we can switch differently," Helga said.
“It’s ridiculous that it’s a natural law that women’s jobs are always paid less.
It’s ridiculous that aviators and nurses have to constantly be in the car race just to get a humane salary.”

Trying to kidnap a pedestrian in the city center
A man was arrested in the city centre the night after he threatened pedestrians and tried to get money from him.
The police also stopped the production of drugs in <0xC3><0x81>rb<0xC3><0xA6>, where two were arrested for the case.
The police then stopped the driver of a motorcycle in Hlí<0xC3><0xB0>ur, where the driver was at a speed of 146 km with a maximum speed of 60 km/h.
In addition, he had previously been deprived of his driving rights.
Police in the capital area had enough to turn around last night and more than 80 cases were recorded in the police diary from five yesterday to five this morning.
There were a lot of rumors about the event.
On Saturday night, eleven noise noises were reported, and the police had a lot of them in their diary.
Last night, however, 22 police spokespersons rushed to the scene.
Six of them were put in jail last night.
In the city, the police were called to the night when the parties fired at the air.
However, they had already escaped when the policemen came to the garden.
At that time, nine drivers were arrested for drunkenness and/or drug addiction.
Four were arrested for fighting in the city centre last night, but one of them was kept in a prison cell.
Then two were taken to an emergency room after they fell on their faces, one in the city centre and the other in the city west.
One was transported to an accident station after he was injured while jumping on a trampoline in Kopavogi.
In addition, police stopped the driver who pulled a caravan in Kjalarnesi yesterday.
According to the police's diary, the bike equipment in the caravan was in "very bad condition" and was stationary.
Can stay in Monet's house for the weekend
The house, in which Impressionist Claude Monet spent the last forty years of his practice, is now available for rent on the Airbnb site.
The next free nights in the house are about the weekend of the shopkeepers.
The house is small and cute, located in the town of Givenry in Normandy, France.
The famous painter lived in the house from 1883 until his death in 1926.
The house has three bedrooms, two living rooms and three bathrooms.
Monet was first inspired to paint his famous gardens in this house.
If you want to rent a house, you must rent it for at least two nights.
According to Airbnb’s website, it’s next week, on Sunday, the shopkeeper’s weekend, and so it might be ideal for some shoppers on vacation to rush into booking the painter’s house.
The two nights over a shopping weekend will cost no less than US$964 or the right amount of ISK 130,000, depending on the next issue of the newspaper.
Dozens in epidemic and some of them begin to show symptoms of the disease caused by the coronavirus
Five have been diagnosed with the coronavirus domestically in the last three days and most of the infected are unrelated.
Dozens have been infected because of this, and some of them have begun to show the symptoms of the disease caused by the virus.
Three were detected with the coronavirus inland yesterday and two at the border screening.
An expert at the office of a rural practitioner says that the growing number of domestic infections does not necessarily mean that the virus is spreading widely in the community.
“There has already been a sequencing from the previous domestic outbreak and there is a virus that has not been seen here before, so we have no particular reason to believe that it has been hidden in the community for some time.
This is probably something new to the country, but of course we need to be very careful right now," said Kamilla Sigrí<0xC3><0xB0>ur Jósefsdóttir, an expert in the field of antipsychotics.
Most of the infected have been in contact with individuals who came from abroad.
More samples are taking place in the near future than a few that were in contact with the infected have begun to show the symptoms of the coronavirus.
“Now there is no influenza in progress, let alone other respiratory infections, so we can be quite free to do these tests on individuals who, at the time of the influenza, would have found a reason to do something else first,” Kamilla said.
Infection is mostly complete, but it is not excluded that more need to go to the clinic.
Two of the infected were detected after attending a sporting event.
It raises the question of whether it is appropriate to hold such an event.
As long as people follow the guidelines and rules, the general public will be able to say it well.
Kamilla says it is almost impossible for the infected to get infected at the sports events.
“If there is no more isolation from these individuals after they have been involved in these sporting events, then we can claim that our preventions at the events have worked.
But it hasn’t been revealed,” said Kamilla.
The work of the Civil Protection Division shall be subject to a continuous review.
“We need to be prepared to intervene with further advice or restrictions if there seems to be a reason,” Kamilla said.
After a week, the number limits will be extended to a thousand people.
This new position could have an impact on the aspirations.
"Definite Meditation to Cook" - See Elisa Vidar's Menu
Elísa Vi<0xC3><0xB0>arsdóttir is an accomplished footballer and plays with Val.
She is also a master's degree in nutrition, mother, and works as a food scientist.
It requires a lot of energy for the duration of the day and usually gives itself time to cook good and nutritious food.
My usual day at work starts at eight," says Elisa.
“After work, I go to the store to prepare dinner before I take my girl to school at three o’clock.”
Elisa feels very nourishing to get her daughter to school early.
“It’s good to have time with her before I go to practice for the second time.
After the exercise, it is good to come home and just have to warm up the food.
In the evening, when the girl is asleep, we feel good to watch one episode to empty our mind.”
Eliza does not follow any specific diet.
She is laying hands on a master’s degree in nutrition and therefore knows well what she should eat to have enough energy to do work, school, family and exercise.
“What suits me is eating a variety of foods that are well-combined with protein, carbohydrates and fat.
However, I find it most important to have a healthy relationship with food and not to categorize food into bad or good, rather nutritious or nutritious.
It’s okay to eat everything, just not all at once and not always.”
Eliza is very interested in cooking.
“I feel a certain contemplation in standing in the kitchen to cook and bring it very much into it.
I have to say that I have the confidence in the kitchen and I really believe that I’m a good cook.”
Breakfast: Oats, chia seeds, hemp seeds, salt, a little lemon juice, put in almond milk overnight.
Top this meal with what is available each time.
Most often it is a banana and spicy muslim & CAFFI.
I'm a big coffee drinker.
Intermediates: Incredibly uneven, but fruits or vegetables, flat cakes, clean shrimp with bananas and muslins, bread with layers and so I could eat hummus with spoons out of the box if appropriate.
Lunch: I often make all kinds of culinary salads from what is in the fridge, quinoa or barley, falafel bowls, rock salad, baked vegetables with good dressing is something that I am working with.
If the organization goes completely out of the way (which happens often) then the egg machines at work have come to my rescue quite often and then there are 2 slices of bread with butter, cheese and roasted eggs, do not put on more.
Intermediate: Get me something carbohydrate-rich for workouts, bread with beans, breakfast cereal or fruit.
Dinner: Fish will be very often for the choice in my home, otherwise some delicious vegetable dishes.
Clashes between police and protesters in Seattle
City authorities in Seattle, Washington, have declared an uprising following crowds protesting in the city centre.
Police yesterday seized blasts and pepper sprays to tempt them to rust a large area that protesters subdued and stretched over many houses in the vicinity of the city’s parliament building.
Police said on Twitter that at least eleven protesters had been arrested and that an investigation was underway into a crime committed at a police station in the city yesterday, possibly with some kind of bomb.
Civil and police authorities say protesters stoned police with stones, bottles, mortars and other loose bombs, and one police officer was taken to a hospital where he was injured.
The protests in Seattle, however, were peaceful for a long time ahead.
The blow was for them to show protesters in Portland, Oregon, where there has been repeated fierce clashes between protesters and heavily armed local state police.
Where, as in many cities in the United States, people gather under the banner of Black Lives Matter, Georges Floyds, who was killed by a Minneapolis police officer on May 25, protests systemic racism in American society and demands improvement.
Not revoked until after the vote has been cast
It is not yet known whether Icelandair’s resignations, which are due to take effect next month, will be revoked.
Icelandair’s electronic ballot for the Icelandic Airline Association’s contract on behalf of Icelandair’s airlines will end in the afternoon.
Gu<0xC3><0xB0>laug Líney Jóhannsdóttir, chairman of the company, assures that Icelandair will not take a decision on the resignations until the result of the vote is available.
“It’s all very well,” says Lynn.
“There have been no cancellations, this has to be done so that the machines can be humanized.
So, of course, people are eager to know if there will be work after the meeting.”
The vote is for a contract that was signed a week ago, on the night of July 19.
It is expected to be valid until the end of September 2025 and is based on an agreement that aircraft had previously entered into a vote.
On July 17, the Board of Directors and the Board of Trustees of the Icelandic Air Freight Association agreed to announce an all-power station with Icelandair, and members agreed to it in a ballot.
It never came to her, but this was decided following Icelandair’s decision to terminate talks with the airline, terminate all its aircraft and seek contracts with another airline.
In this case, the pilots of the company must temporarily take on the job of a security team on board.
Asked how she thinks the vote will go, Gu<0xC3><0xB0>laug Líney says it is hard to say.
“People are in pain after Icelandair’s arrival, when all of the airline’s freighters were dismissed and notified that they would sign an agreement with another airline.
“We’ll see if it has an effect,” she said.
Icelandair had 940 aircraft in operation at the end of April, but 900 of them, about 95%, were dismissed.
Their notice period is incomplete, with those with the shortest working life being three months and ending at the July-August meeting.
About 90% of Icelandair’s airlines are in this group.
What happens if the agreement is not approved?
“We are looking forward to continuing discussions with our colleagues.
With this agreement, we are meeting the requirements of Icelandair.
If he is rejected, it is clear that the flight crews have gone too far.”
Icelandair announces the end of the second quarter of the second quarter of the year and Icelandair announces the end of the second quarter of the year
The airline's vote on a new contract will end at 12 noon tomorrow.
Icelandair’s settlement for the second quarter will also be published tomorrow, but emergency results indicate that the company’s earnings have fallen by 85 percent from the same period last year.
The electronic voting process for the Icelandic Aviation Association and the Icelandair Business Association’s contract for Icelandair started on Wednesday, 22 July, and ends tomorrow, Monday, 27 July, at 12 noon.
Those who can vote for the contract are Icelandair employees who pay social security fees to the airline.
Icelandair and FF<0xC3><0x8D> signed a new contract on Sunday night, July 19, but on Friday, Icelandair had negotiated with the airline after the airline broke the previous contract in a ballot in early July.
Icelandair had cancelled all of the airline’s flights and flights on Friday, but they were withdrawn after a new contract was signed.
According to the new agreement, aircraft will need to fly five more hours a month before the same basic salary.
The contract is valid until the year 2025, but it has already integrated the provisions of pilots and aircraft carriers on how long it is possible to fly on one guard.
The deal was announced to FF<0xC3><0x8D> members at a meeting at the Hilton Nordica hotel last Monday, describing many of the airliners that the news agency discussed with them about their dissatisfaction with the deal.
However, most seemed to agree that it would be necessary to approve the agreement in order to keep FF<0xC3><0x8D> alive.
Icelandair’s settlement for the second quarter will be announced tomorrow, but the company’s EBIT, its operating income for finance teams and taxes, will be negative by US$100 to US$110 million, or about ISK15 billion, according to the emergency foreign exchange results.
Icelandair sent a briefing to the Norwegian Stock Exchange on Wednesday, saying the company's revenues had risen by $60 million in the quarter, or about DKK 8.3 billion.
Cash and its equivalent amounted to about US$154 million at the end of the quarter, amounting to around CZK 21 billion.
Icelandair is also aiming to offer a share of the company in August.
Icelandair aims to conclude contracts with fifteen lenders, the government and Boeing’s aircraft manufacturer before the end of the month before it goes on a share auction.
A new variant rather than a new type of virus
“A new virus just means that this has been a person who came from abroad.
This is not something that has been conceived here in the country," says Már Kristjánsson, general practitioner at the Department of Infectious Diseases of the National Hospital, about the news that "a new type of virus" has been detected here in the country.
Yesterday, three domestic infections were detected and two at the border.
One who was diagnosed had participated in the club's social work at the football game Rey Cup but the origin of the infection is unknown and contagion is ongoing.
An individual who arrived in the country on July 15 was also diagnosed and two people who were in contact with him began to show symptoms of COVID-19.
Yesterday, infection was detected related to the infection that was reported the previous day and after a sequencing of the Icelandic genetic analysis, a “new type of virus that has not been detected here before” was revealed.
Infection is completed in connection with that infection.
Már notes that this is not a new virus, but the same virus and has spread worldwide, i.e. the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.
It is more appropriate to talk about a new variant of that virus than about a new type of virus.
Asked what it meant and if it could say anything about the beginning of another wave of the pandemic, Már says that as it is, there is a single case and it could go so far as to say nothing more.
“However, if there are cases at home that are not related from abroad and have the same genotype as this particular variant, then the conclusion [of the second wave] could be drawn, but it is premature to support it,” explains Már.
Happy in the hot pot
Is the secret of Icelandic happiness hidden in the hot pots?
The BBC’s daily reporters appear in a fun video that sheds light on the country’s swimming pool and hot tub culture.
Icelandic bathing culture is unique worldwide and it is claimed that nowhere in the world there are as many bathing establishments per inhabitant.
The natural geothermal climate is the basis, but also the tradition of swimming that prevails here.
Health education for children was legal in 1940, but older citizens are no less efficient at using hot water for health benefits.
Swimming is described as an integral part of the country’s general well-being.
In the pot, everyone is equal, regardless of stature and position.
Free with mobile phones, people talk on personal notes about home and space or enjoy the soothing power of water: meditating and charging the batteries of soul and body.
The steep slope to take a hundred days in elections
There are 100 days until the U.S. goes to the polls and elects a four-year-old president.
Donald Trump wants re-election, but he has to go to the polls.
Joe Biden, a prospective Democratic nominee, has a strong national lead over Trump, according to polls.
According to a recent survey by the AP, the number of Americans believe that the nation is on the wrong path.
Trump’s response to the global pandemic of the new coronavirus is also very unpopular, and more Americans than before believe that the president has had a bad hold on economic affairs.
More specifically, only two out of ten Americans say that the United States is on the right track.
32 percent say they support Trump’s response to the epidemic and 48 percent say he has kept up with the economy.
In March it was 56 percent and in January it was 67 percent.
According to the average FiveThirtyEight, Biden is 49.9 percent nationally, while Trump is 41.9 percent.
Trump himself has tried to draw attention from his performance against the epidemic to Biden, pushing for so-called cultural divisions and announcing policies that should turn to law and order.
Biden’s supply, however, puts a lot of effort into keeping Trump’s attention and counts a lot of chances of winning if the election really revolves around how Trump has stood in office over the past four years.
Trump’s unpopularity also seems to be coming down on Republican senators and fearing Democrats might even reach a majority in the U.S. Senate senate, which has so far been very hefty.
Politico said in the days to keep following the categories and the candidate comparable to what is now, the Republican Party would receive its biggest defeat in decades.
<0xC3><0x9A>thvirki has proved particularly bad for the category in the 2016 general election and it is now expected that this development will continue.
In recent days, Trump has tried to scare out-of-town residents to follow suit, including by saying he will become Biden’s president, destroying U.S. out-of-towns and pushing for racial divisions.
Among other things, Trump has overthrown the Obama-era White House regulation that was intended to increase the diversity of suburbs.
He then urged U.S. suburban "housewives" to read an article by the former New York Assistant Secretary of State, in which she said Biden would destroy U.S. suburbs and took Trump under it.
“The bid will ruin your neighborhoods and the American dream.
I’ll keep it, and even make it even better!” said the president.
The population of the U.S. suburbs is an ever-growing group of voters.
According to the NPR, they are about half of all voters in the United States.
Since George W. Bush was re-elected in 2004, the candidate who has won the majority of the group’s vote has become president.
In 2012, Mitt Romney won the majority of the vote, but lost to Barack Obama.
Surveys have shown that even though Trump secured a narrow majority in the suburbs in 2016, his followers there have been drastically drawn together.
Although it differs between the polls, Biden has recommended a 15 percent lead on Trump in broadcasts recently.

Will the Olympics be the light at the end of the hallways?
After a final decision had been made to postpone the Olympic Games, an event that only World Wars have succeeded to date, the President of the International Olympic Committee said that the Olympic Games would become "the light at the end of the corridors," and pointed out the world's uncertainty.
The workers have an extra year to prepare and the authorities in Japan are adding to their costs due to the delay.
Everyone ends up in a lot of trouble.
When it was announced that Tokyo, Japan, would be the venue of the Olympics this year, the cheers of Japanese representatives were genuine.
They cried and laughed in turn, after Tokyo had applied to hold the 2016 Games but turned it down in the lower half for Rio in Brazil.
This time, Tokyo and Japan were to bathe in the attention of the world.
The Games are scheduled to take place from 24 July to 9 August, but have been postponed for a year and will begin on 23 July 2021 and end on 8 August.
If they fail to hold the games, if the coronavirus continues to be too much a threat, the games will be stopped.
No one wants to think about it until the end.
The Olympics are not an ordinary sporting event.
Nothing is to be saved, the show is always to be great and strives to top the last game.
The selection of a city for the Olympics is based on the evaluation of the nomination committee of the cities.
The more magnificent the presentation —the more likely you are to get the snout.
Tokyo spent $150 million trying to hold the 2016 Olympics, or roughly <0xC2><0xA3>20 billion.
For the second time, when applying for the 2020 Games, 75 million dollars, about ten billion crowns, were put into the presentation.
In 2013, when it was decided that Tokyo would receive the Games this year, the Japanese authorities had already pledged 30 billion kronor for the project.
However, this amount is only a drop in the sea considering the cost of building an Olympic village, a stadium and, in general, strengthening the country's infrastructure to host such tournaments, prepare them and hold the games themselves.
The Tokyo Olympics, which were supposed to be taking place today but have been postponed for a year due to the coronavirus, would have cost $12.6 billion.
However, a report released by the Japanese Superintendent of Finance at the end of last year found that the cost was almost double that figure.
It is unlikely that the cost of postponing the games will not be fully estimated, but it has been estimated that it could cost between two and six billion dollars in addition to the initial cost.
The total cost for the Japanese Olympic Committee and Japanese taxpayers could therefore be in the range of $15 to $30 billion.
There are such high figures that all the tax revenues of the Icelandic state amounted to only about half of the Olympics, based on the lowest possible cost.
Olympics are events of such magnitude that they have liked to have become the subject of discussion of economists, who try to examine the numbers and examine the benefits and benefits of the games.
In short, it seems that many have come to the conclusion that the impact of the Olympics is less than positive for the economy of the cities that hold them.
There are some short-term effects, for example, jobs increase very much in the short term, but in the longer term, cities tend to sit up with debtors and high operating costs of low-used structures.
Rio, Brazil, is in serious debt as a result of the 2016 Games and has been struggling to maintain all the major sports venues built for the Games.
There have been robberies in figures since the 2012 London Games, but it has been revealed that only 10 percent of those who got a job related to the Olympic Games in the city were previously unemployed.
This means that we are not talking about a new job, except to a small extent.
In general, cities have not been particularly successful in holding the Olympics financially because of the similar costs associated with the structures built for the Games.
However, the benefit is thought to be the increased turnover of tourists who want to visit the Olympic cities after the Games, which is still very uncertain about the 2021 Games.
It is also unclear whether it will be possible to accommodate all the number of spectators who usually download the games.
The main thing, however, is the honor that cities are likely to be elected, but it is difficult to value for money.
Despite the enormous cost, it can also be said that the joy that the players bring is not such that it can be valued.
But even if the show is huge and there is no savings, of course, this is not just about money.
It’s the sportsmen who are in the foreground.
Surprisingly, for some fans, it’s time to postpone the game.
For example, the Australian five-footer and gold medalist in her article on the page of the Olympics, Chloe Esposito, is a chauvinist and would have been far from a good joke this summer but hopes to be in a competitive form for the 2021 Olympics.
She is therefore among those athletes who are just quite happy with the delay, for understandable reasons.
For those athletes who were going to quit after the games this year, they would have been held at the right time, delaying the games in some cases means they will quit the race before the games take place.
Do not rely on your body to go through years of rigorous workouts.
Few athletes were as enthusiastic at the 2016 Rio Olympics as the star of the film, Simone Biles.
She came home with four gold rings around her neck and one bronze.
Biles has met in several interviews in his home country the United States recently to discuss the Olympics.
She is going to the 2021 Games, but she is not necessarily sure that she will still be at the top of the games next year, after which she will become 24 years old.
Although it is generally not considered to be a high age, it is in the highest order for a five-star actress.
“This is a delicate issue,” Biles says, but smiles out in another interview posted on the Olympic Committee’s Instagram page asking if she intends to achieve the same level of success in the 2021 Olympics as she did in Rio 2016.
“I don’t really know if I’ll still be at the top after a whole year of extra workouts,” Biles says.
She has previously said that her body can’t withstand the stress that accompanies five-length training much longer.
However, she is still practicing for the 2021 Olympics.
Biles admits that it was an uncomfortable feeling to have to suddenly stop practicing when the World War II was at its highest and the five-room hall was closed.
There were no exceptions for Biles rather than others while all sports facilities were closed for seven weeks.
All of her Olympic wrestlers could not buy any access beyond the others, she had to find various ways to stay in shape like everyone else.
The basic form is certainly a lot better than most people.
“We have a tight schedule right now.
It was hard to start practicing again first after the five-piece room opened.
We started slowly, but we’re back to full speed and I’ll be increasing my workouts evenly and steadily as the year progresses.
Of course, we don’t quite know how these games will be or whether they will be held, but we still practice considering that they will be, we can’t do anything else.
I’ve been putting too much effort into leaving the sport now,” Biles says.
With it, like many others, the blind doubt or perhaps rather the awareness that this position can come up that the games will not be held at all in 2021.
Predicting this is hopeless.
No one can know what the status of the coronavirus pandemic will be in July 2021 and nothing else to do but prepare for the Olympics given that they will be held every year.
Maybe the Olympics will be the light at the end of the Covid pandemic.
Delayed wedding due to epidemic
Modern Family actress Sarah Hyland has decided to postpone her wedding due to the coronavirus.
She was supposed to marry former Bachelorette contestant Wells Adams this summer.
“I think there are other more important things to think about right now,” the actress told People.
“We’ll definitely want to get married someday and have the dream wedding and have all the people who are dear to us.
But we decided to put it on hold and focus on what’s important right now and that’s to help share information about the importance of wearing a mask and staying at home.
I’m more interested in weddings than I am in weddings these days.
There’s a lot going on and we need to focus our attention on what’s happening in the world.”
