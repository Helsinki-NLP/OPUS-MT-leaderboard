The Civil Rights Movement has issued a travel warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has issued a warning for colored people traveling to Missouri based on discriminatory state principles and racist attacks.
“NAACP’s Travel Recommendation for the State of Missouri, effective August 28, 2017, calls on African-American travelers, visitors and residents of Missouri to pay greater attention when traveling across the state as a result of a series of controversial racially motivated incidents,” the association said in a statement.
The NAACP said it took this step on the basis of current Missouri laws that make it difficult to defend racist-motivated acts before the courts, as well as as a result of the actions of criminal prosecution authorities that disproportionately target minorities.
“Civil rights are being violated.
People are stopped by police just because of the color of their skin, they are attacked or killed," said the president of the NAACP for Missouri, Rod Chapel, to the Kansas City Star.
“We have the largest number of complaints so far.”
This is the first warning of its kind issued by the organization for the U.S. state.
Among the incidents the organization cited were racially motivated insults directed at black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in disputed circumstances earlier this year after running out of gas while traveling across the country and being detained by police without charge.
The travel recommendation also draws attention to a recent statement by the Missouri State Supreme Prosecutor's Office that black drivers are 75% more likely to be stopped by police.
“The purpose of the travel recommendation is to warn people and warn their families, friends and colleagues of what could happen in Missouri,” Chapel said.
“People need to be prepared – they should take the money with them for a possible bailout or tell their relatives that they are going to travel through the state.”
According to current figures from the FBI’s hate crime program, there were a hundred hateful behavior cases in Missouri in 2015, bringing the state to 16th place among all states.
The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that makes it difficult for a company to sue for discrimination in providing accommodation or employment.
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has issued travel recommendations for Texas and Arizona after states approved an immigration law that allows state officials to detain people based on violations of that law, which the ACLU believes should improve racial profiling.
Travel recommendations are usually issued by the Department of State for Foreign Affairs, but recently advocacy groups have resorted to these measures in response to specific laws and trends within the US.
The model was killed by the chef.
Even after 12 years, her family is not at rest!
Model Sally Anne Bowman was murdered.
The Croydon-born girl was murdered in 2005 by chef Mark Dix at the restaurant where she worked, who stabbed her.
The victim and the killer were supposed to have sex together and smoke marijuana, and then he killed her.
The killer was then sitting in a nearby cafe watching the careful criminal investigation of the crime scene.
Dixie, a former chef, was sentenced in 2008 to 34 years in prison for the murder and rape of model Sally.
He only confessed to the juvenile's assault in court and the lawyer claimed that his client had already found the girl lying dead on the street.
Three years later, the police convicted him.
Dixie claimed that Sally and her ex-boyfriend Lewis Sprotson were arguing on the fateful night.
The killer said, "He was really upset, and after his attack, the girl started screaming."
"It even attracted the attention of taxi drivers," he said lyingly.
According to his testimony, the girl was to defend herself, as much as she could, but in vain.
Lewis was supposed to stab her in the street.
Dixie's version was proven to be a lie and she accused him.
After confessing to Dixie, he talked about his hotness and taste for the girl.
When he dressed her after sex, he felt satisfied and had to burn marijuana.
Before the incident, Sally was with her ex-girlfriend, drinking alcohol and taking cocaine, Dexie himself told police.
He said he felt the adrenaline.
Sally started screaming for help, so he attacked her from behind and put his hand over her mouth,” Linda added.
Twelve years later, the family faces further attacks by vandals destroying her grave.
He has been injured four times in the past six months.
There are so cruel people out there who dig these graves.
"So our daughter is no longer there," Linda's mother told the Mirror about the disappearance of an ash urn.
Linda was waiting for the attackers, but they always had to attack when she left the cemetery.
Design vibrators cost tens of thousands.
"The Czechs are neither conservative nor conservative," says Martin Rá<0xC5><0xBE>, who runs the Prague boutique Intimity.
In it you will find design and luxury erotic accessories.
Including those from Czech designer Anna Mare<0xC5><0xA1>ová.
It started inconspicuously, about twelve years ago.
Martin Rá<0xC5><0xBE> and his friends went on a cycling trip through Moravia.
One of them brought not only a bicycle, but also a box full of unusually looking vibrators.
"A variety of moles and dolphins and it was all green and yellow and just completely different," he tells me about lunch.
His friend and another partner decided to work with a German manufacturer of design erotic aids Fun Factory, which fascinated Martin, so he offered to help with marketing.
When the companion left to pursue another profession, he replaced him.
Today, in the Benedictine street in Prague, she operates a boutique Intimacy, where she sells erotic accessories in the way luxury handbags or shoes are usually offered.
And why shouldn't he?
These are also design items.
Wait a minute, that's what you're talking about at lunch, you think?
Oh, come on, don't be such a puritan!
It was the Berlin store Fun Factory, designed by renowned designer Karim Rashid, that served as inspiration for the Intimacy boutique.
They opened it in 2010 and it was a completely different concept of erotic trade than everyone is used to here.
No covered displays, all done in a beautiful, decent style, products exhibited more like in a perfumery.
Martin and his business partner Zden<0xC4><0x9B>k <0xC5><0xA0>ebelká began to think about how to take the Prague trade, where it should be and what it should be called.
The name Intimacy appealed to both of them.
"It has something to do with intimacy, and it's even, you might say, tender," he says.
This was followed by the purchase of an Internet domain and the search for a suitable space, which went in parallel with various interior visualizations.
Eventually, the variant won, which divided the shop into a garden of delight and a bedroom to which the bed leads.
It was prepared by Dagmar <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>pán from FormaFatal.
We found the space in 2013.
At first, he didn’t seem perfect because he wasn’t on the main street, but it made him sit by the name of Intimacy.
It's intimate.
It’s in the alley next to the main one, so no one is looking for customers,” Martin Rá<0xC5><0xBE> praises.
We wanted to be first.
We wanted to make a business that would be different, with branded nice goods, in an environment where women, who are mostly our customers, feel good.
And not to be ashamed that they entered into such a trade at all.
When I walked into the Intimacy boutique half an hour ago, the street was empty.
Plus, I didn't even feel like I was going to the erotic aid shop.
Right at the door I was surprised by the pure elegance of the interior, which I know from boutiques with fashion.
Even though there is only a female handler in the store, that women do not dare to ask for help does not mean that the male leg would not come here.
Most of the time, men come here to buy gifts for their girlfriends.
"Men usually don't know how to estimate the right size and choose larger," Martin smiles at the frequent mistake.
These are the prejudices, the clichés, that women need some great help, and that's not true.
So a man in good faith may choose an unnecessarily large vibrator.
Likewise, men prefer mostly black lingerie, while women tend to prefer pink.
The absolute bestseller is currently a product appropriately called Satisfyer.
From the expression on my face, it must be clear that I don’t know who’s beating, because Martin immediately explains how it works.
It's such a touchless clitoral stimulator.
There is a teenage urge to look with admiration at the serious tone with which the interpretation is given to me.
It's like it's not buzzing.
And it doesn't really make sense.
It is at a good price and has perfect user references.
We didn't think he'd be so well received.
This is the latest revolutionary news.
The first revolution was caused by a vibrator in the form of a seahorse.
He made sure that women began to be more interested in the design of such products.
The second was a vibrator for We-Vibe pairs.
He completely overthrew the taboo that some men can endure, and the fact that they see competition in erotic gadgets.
“There are different options,” he continues.
With one engine, with two engines, with remote control.
This is a favorite category.
In a love affair, a woman can have a controller in her hand and determine the intensity of the vibrations.
On the contrary, a certain failure is the category of attachment vibrators.
At least with us.
Czech women seem to prefer multi-purpose devices and buy classic vibrators, even though they may use it only externally.
However, in Western Europe, especially for younger customers, it is very popular.
What about men?
It's hard to say if a similar concept would work exclusively for men.
I think it would have to be taken a little differently.
The question is what to offer men," Martin thinks.
"We also have tools for them, but to a limited extent." The most sold masturbator, in this case from the manufacturer Tenga.
It does not look like an anatomical imitation of the vagina, but rather like a shower gel or like an egg or a futuristic object.
It focuses a lot on functionality and user experience.
In Japan, it is completely different.
It amazes me.
I thought that the Japanese would suffer a lot for erotic aids, I object.
“That’s the reality of the internet,” he explained.
The everyday one is completely different.
Here in Europe, erotic aids are more associated with being used by women.
In Japan, they are absolutely normal for men, and vice versa, they are taboo for women." Just for the sake of curiosity - what the Japanese brand Tenga, which is represented in the Intimacy boutique, sells worldwide, still makes up about half of what is sold only in Japan.
In our waters
The Czechs and the Czechs are not very good.
On the contrary, we are a friendly nation.
Definitely unlike countries such as Catholic Poland or Italy.
A typical shop client is between 35 and 50 years old and "has already had some experience both with sexual life and with some aids.
She will come for something nice, better quality, which would complement her partner's life, or herself." Martin Rá<0xC5><0xBE> and his business partner Zden<0xC4><0x9B>k <0xC5><0xA0>ebelka take care to make sure that each product is perfectly functional.
We also do not want to go into bondage and latex specialties, because we do not have room for it, but it does not fit here.
Such things could discourage those we are trying to target.
Which are the people who have always had the guts to go to the sex shop because they were afraid that something like that would look at them.
A lot of the products displayed on the shelves are really nice.
It is also given by the selection of represented reputable brands.
Some of them even won design awards, including the Red Dot Design Award.
The first ever to be awarded was the aforementioned seahorse "and it triggered a change in the entire industry.
It began to abandon cheap materials and, on the contrary, to work with health-friendly ones, it began to produce different designs, different colors...
The pleasant thing is that behind the design of some is the Czech Republic, namely the popular designer Anna Mare<0xC5><0xA1>ová.
I must say, I was quite surprised how many people buy the Whoop.de.doo design items from Anna Mare<0xC5><0xA1>ová, even though they are relatively expensive.
There are customers who go directly for the Venus balls from Anna Mare<0xC5><0xA1>ová.
She did a really huge piece of work by presenting exactly what we are trying to present within the Czech Republic and abroad - that erotic aids can be done differently, nicely, with a story.
Anna's story began as a school work.
Now it is a finished product, which is also produced by us.
I wanted to have the production process under control and also wanted to know what materials and how Whoop.de.doo products are made.
Since it is not a large production, but a small series, it is certainly more expensive than a large series.
I may be going a bit against the current, but it seems important to me to keep developments with us in the Czech Republic.
It may well be that in a few years we will not be able to produce anything," Anna later describes the situation to me, who agrees with Martin that our company is becoming more and more open.
He does not have a negative or negative attitude.
People are most likely to be embarrassed.
Anna Mare<0xC5><0xA1>ová currently has a vibrator on which you can have a personal message written, and this year she is also planning her own lubricating gel.
In the following year, there should be more vibrating eggs and more news.
The Limits of Healthy Sex
I wonder where the limits of what's right lie.
Is there anything Martin Razh wouldn't sell anymore?
It's awfully hard to define.
What seems normal to one person may seem completely abnormal to another, so we are rather defined by the range of brand manufacturers.
None of them go to extremes.
Before we say goodbye, I have a final question: What was the most crazy demand they got?
Just this week, an e-mail came in, in which a lady asked for a masturbation aid for her boyfriend with a twenty-eight-centimeter-long birth.
So we had to write to her that unfortunately we don't have anything like that.
There’s still the question of whether any of us were joking,” Martin takes a suspicious look at me.
And that happens from time to time...
Injury for Karl Gott.
After two Alzheimer's cancers!
His friend Karel <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>dr<0xC3><0xBD> is struggling with a serious illness.
Karl Gott's best friend struggles with a disease that steals people's memories.
"Yes, unfortunately it's true," the singer himself confirmed to Blitz.
I know about my illness and I can handle it quite well, given the circumstances.
"I'm taking medications that are supposed to slow down the accompanying symptoms of the disease," he added, thanking loved ones for their support.
The whole family decided to make Karl's life easier.
Wife Eva tries to be at home as much as possible, and the daughters of the first marriage of Zuzana and Theresa, the elder son of Karel Karlas, arrive at her father's house on the White Mountain.
Christmas fought cancer twice and gave his experience to Slavík to support him in his demanding treatment.
He's had 60 chemotherapy sessions.
After them, he was able to return to work on a tennis court and on the ski slopes.
"I've been predicted by an astrologer that I'll be here in the 90's," said Karel Blesku.
He's a warrior.
She still wants to sing.
"I keep repeating the words of the songs so that I don't forget them," Karel admitted.
Actress Kv<0xC4><0x9B>ta Fialová is currently struggling with the same disease.
Do you have an Alzheimer’s patient in your family?
Look at how you behave to him.
The Chilean parliament has lifted the ban on interruptions, the law will assess the US.
In Chile, there is still an absolute ban on artificial abortion, so it must not be done for health reasons.
“I am sorry that the legislators have filed a complaint with the Constitutional Court and that now ten people will decide on what we have been arguing in parliament for more than two years,” Sen. Isabel Allende said.
The Constitutional Court in Chile has ten members and is expected to have a new president by the end of August, which, according to AFP, is close to the opposition.
The law that abolishes the absolute ban on interruptions, initiated by current President Michelle Bachelet, was passed by the Senate on July 19.
The right-wing opposition then announced that the law would be challenged in court because it violated the unborn child’s right to life.
MEPs postponed the vote on the bill last month until it was analysed by a mixed parliamentary committee.
On Wednesday, the House of Representatives approved the proposal, and the Senate did so again.
Under the new legislation, artificial abortion should cease to be a criminal offence in three cases: if the life of a woman is at risk, if the fetus has no hope of survival, or if the pregnancy arises from rape.
Similar exceptions have existed in Chile since 1931, before women were granted the right to vote in 1949, according to the Spanish newspaper El País.
The absolute ban on interruptions was introduced in 1989 by right-wing dictator Augusto Pinochet, just months before he left the presidency.
Chile is one of the few countries in the world where there is an absolute ban on interruptions.
Others include Nicaragua, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Haiti, Malta and Honduras.
In El Salvador, for example, there are now about 20 women in prison who are serving up to 30 years in prison for interrupting a pregnancy.
In many cases, according to human rights defenders, it was a spontaneous abortion, which the court called a murder.
Is there anything else sacred?
Trump’s White House is now the Statue of Liberty.
An undeniable sign of regime change is the criticism of statues.
Americans could talk about it as well as everyone else – see the carefully staged overthrow of the statue of Saddam Hussein in Baghdad’s Firdos Square in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the Trump regime’s key proponents, certainly knew what he was inclined to do when, during a passionate debate with CNN reporter Jim Acosta on presidential proposals to drastically restrict legal immigrants, he clashed with a symbolic axe on the Statue of Liberty.
It's nice to add that Miller didn't attack the statue as such.
In return, he would be lynched by a crowd of cruise ship owners and imitators of the Statue of Liberty.
However, he attacked its significance, namely the fact that in 1903 a plaque with the famous poem Emma Lazarus was placed on the pedestal, 17 years after the monument was completed.
Miller rebuked Acosta by saying, “I don’t want to go into history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that sheds light on the whole world.
A poem that has been placed on the pedestal additionally, and to which you refer, is not part of it."
Miller is actually right, but as he said, this is not history.
The words of Emma Lazarus, not only to the immigrants, but also to the poorest of the poor, are astonishing: “Let those who fall to me come, those who are poor, those who can hardly breathe freely, those who are poor with worms in the midst of crowded cities.”
And it is in modern times that we can better than ever watch these “poor worms” on our screens.
Miller did not try to criticize poetry - he wanted to clarify that these people are not welcome in the United States.
This conflict over the significance of the statue is part of a vast political and cultural war: it is essentially a conflict about the significance of America.
Emma Lazarus, as well as her friends, who after her death sought to place a plaque with poems on the pedestal of the statue, knew quite well that she was embarking on a high political game.
The statue was supposed to express the union of the French and American Republican governments by representing the classic theme, that is, the female embodiment of freedom.
Emma Lazarus has changed this meaning: in her poem, the female figure is not abstract, but has its own voice.
She also has a very different name: Mother of the Exiles.
Combining the poem with the idea of a woman is a brilliant feminist move and a devastating attack on American nativism.
And in the same way that Emma Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, right-wingers have long sought to distort that meaning.
Famous commentator Rush Limbaugh – John the Baptist on Trump’s rise to power – in 2010 argued that the Statue of Liberty actually does not bring anyone to the country, but represents early neoconstructivism, bringing American flame to the backward world: “The Statue of Liberty is moving forward.
He lifts the torch of freedom from the United States and offers it to the rest of the world.
The torch is not meant to illuminate the way to the United States.”
Limbaugh strangely encounters an important thing.
The significance of the statue depends on the angle of view.
Emma Lazarus describes a statue from the point of view of an exhausted and damned traveler who often, after a long and frightening voyage across the ocean, arrives with hope in his heart to a new land.
It is literally a view of the world through the eyes of people seeking refuge and a chance for a better life.
From this point of view, the statue expresses hope and listens to their needs.
And that is of course a perspective that neither Miller nor Trump will certainly recognize.
Their torch is not meant to illuminate the way, but to incite hatred, which is their only source of power.
2017 World Athletics Championships: Neil Black sings praises to Scottish team members
Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when the British team had only two Scottish members
Neil Black, director of the UK Athletics Federation, said a strong squad of 16 Scots in the World Cup would be a “huge contribution to the team.”
A record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for the 2017 World Cup in London, which begins on Friday.
Black believes that something special is happening in Scotland, and British athletics could learn from the Scots.
"We're trying to understand and adapt - we're going to work on that," Black said.
“I’ve spoken to people at the Scottish Sports Institute and they think it has to do with what they’ve done.
The Scottish athlete thinks it has something to do with what they have done.
British athletics: it has to do with what they did.
People on the streets think so too.
Whatever it is, it’s absolutely amazing.”
Several Scottish athletes will seek the medal, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart – who will compete with Sir Mo Farrah in the 5,000 m race, while Eilidh Doyle was chosen as the team’s captain.
"Eilidh is modest.
Her opening speech was amazing,” Black said.
“Several athletes, whether Scots or athletes of other nationalities, came out of the room with a sense of immense pride and motivation.
The passion and unconcealed feelings with which Eilidh spoke were unrepeatable."
The Commonwealth silver medalist, who will compete in the 400m hurdles at her fifth World Championship, said it was "incredible" that there were 16 Scottish athletes in the British team.
The previous record from 1983 and 2015 is seven.
A runner on the middle track, Muir set five British and two European records in the last year alone.
He will participate in the 1500 m and 5000 m races.
Another great Scotsman is Chris O’Hare, who will run the 1500m track. He won the British Team Races and the Annual Games this season.
Doyle recalls her first championship, in which she was the only other Scottish member of the Lee McConnell team.
The team captain said she was "very proud" of the fact that not only a large number of her colleagues have joined the team, but in many cases they will also attack participation in the final and medal.
“What’s unusual about being a team captain is that I was elected by other team members. It was a great honor for me, but the fact that I was elected by team members is very gratifying,” she added.
“I’m obviously very proud of all the Scotties who have joined the team.
That proves where we've moved.
They are the athletes who will think of the front seats on the stage.
What about my opening speech?
Yes, I think she did.
I only pointed out that we can be proud of this year’s championship because it takes place at home.
It is important to take advantage of the support of domestic fans and rejoice in the fact that we are back at the Olympic Stadium.
I got a second chance at the race and I’m going to enjoy the incredible atmosphere.”
Facebook Critics Blocking: Don’t Apply for a Public Function If You Can’t Stand Voter Criticism
The father of our country knew of his criticism.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn’t take long for the newspapers to start criticizing him for anything, from domestic politics to his political views.
This criticism didn’t keep her cold.
He did not try to silence the critics.
Because in 1783 Washington said, “Freedom of speech can be taken away from us – and stupid and mute we will be led like sheep to the slaughter.”
That brings me to Maryland is Governor Larry Hogan, who needs to work on getting him to behave like Washington.
Hogan's employees blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people who freely expressed their views on his official Facebook page.
This week, he was sued by the American Civil Liberties Union.
The governor’s staff rejected the lawsuit as unfounded, and there were many “who cares” views in the comments on the internet.
“It’s just Facebook,” many users said.
It does matter, though.
Especially when it comes to people like Hogan.
In an absolutely democratic state, this is an extremely popular Republican governor.
It boasts the second highest popularity of all 50 governors.
Hogan's not upset.
As can be seen, he manages his state with certainty and adheres strictly to principles.
He also turned out to be adept at using Facebook as a primary means of connecting with his constituents – the exception is not even publishing the first bare-headed photo after completing chemotherapy.
Blocking people visiting the governor’s site – which is a public forum labeled as official and managed by his employees paid from taxpayers’ money – is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with the Washington Post, Hogan’s spokeswoman, Amelia Chasse, said the governor blocked comments from moderating posts.
However, using the image of Internet trolls, spammers or angry people is too easy.
The Washington Post confessed to several real people who had their posts deleted.
And that’s exactly what they are – real people who talk to their chosen leaders; a teacher, an entrepreneur, and a pastor, no trolls.
As everyone said, their comments were polite and considerate, not blasphemous.
In his commentary, the pastor quoted the Bible, citing Hogan’s Catholic faith.
Bowie Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani, Md. asked about hate crimes, but her comment was not hateful.
“I politely noted that I was disappointed by his inadequate response to hate crimes and other current reports,” she wrote in a comment section of the Washington Post.
“I don’t like the idea that once a certain number of people comment on the same topic, some people are labeled as promoting the so-called collective effort, rather than being recognized as a larger group of interested citizens.”
What the governor’s employees called “focused spam interest” would probably be called “defense.”
The modern Facebook era allows us to easily manage posts by blocking criticism or deleting negative comments.
It is much more convenient than in the past, when the same procedure would require sending employees to the streets where they would collect and burn all copies with criticism or arrest or silence Protestants.
And that’s exactly what’s happening, only in digital form.
Hogan is not the last public figure to be criticized for slandering Facebook and other social media outlets.
President Trump faces a lawsuit from Twitter users who have been denied access to his account.
One of the first important regulations was born last week in Virginia.
Loudoun County Board of Supervisors has violated the first amendment in Alexandria, according to District Judge James C. Cacheris, where she prevented one of the voters from accessing her Facebook page.
Governor Matt Bevin (R) of Kentucky also received visits from the ACLU due to his use of Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be that difficult.
In the days of Washington, the low cost of postage had practically the same impact as the Internet.
Between 1776 and 1800, the number of daily newspapers quadrupled, and his position as leader was questioned by many anonymous writers.
And even in those days, Washington had to deal with anonymous trolls.
People writing under pseudonyms like “Juricola”, “Valerius”, “Belisarius” and “Portius” wrote letters to newspapers and questioned Washington’s decision.
According to historical documents gathered by people as part of the online Papers of George Washington Project, petitions have piled up in his office criticizing his position on the Treaty of Amity, Commerce, and Navigation agreement with Britain.
But he did not silence them.
Freedom of speech, disagreement and intimidation lie at the very heart of our nation.
And the real leader has to accept it.
The Czechs quickly took advantage of free roaming, they consume more data abroad than at home.
Abroad, Czechs consume more of their tariff than at home.
Most often they move in Austria, but the consumption of data in the summer season is dominated by Croatia.
On holidays, they have more time to browse the web, and under the umbrella, they usually do not have the ability to connect to Wi-Fi.
Beach, bathing and smart phone in hand.
This is what a typical Czech holiday in Croatia looks like after customers can take advantage of the services of the operators there at domestic prices.
This is according to recent O2 statistics.
Thanks to the new roaming rules, most Czech travellers abroad have more data available within the package than at home.
It is therefore not surprising that in Croatia, where the minimum number of our customers travels through the winter, the consumption of data has increased even fiftyfold this summer season.
In the second place in the list of consumed data, Italy was then placed.
The Czechs spend the most minutes from Germany, where many go to work during the summer.
Croatia according to the data of the Association of Czech Travel Agencies visits 800,000 Czechs annually, so it is our most popular holiday destination.
However, people here have exchanged the book for sharing experiences using a mobile phone.
This year’s record was July 7.
"Tens of millions of photos would be included in the transmitted data," said Silvia Cieslar, director of the mobile segment at O2.
Although Croatia leads in data volume, the highest number of Czech users moves to neighboring countries.
Austria comes first, followed by Germany and Slovakia.
Croatia is fourth and Italy is sixth.
We go to Austria for hiking and active holidays, for which we do not have so much time to surf the Internet.
"In addition to Austria, the Czechs are heading towards the Adriatic," Cieslar explained.
While for data, the operator has recorded high inter-annual growths after roaming charges were released, for phone calls, the growth is much lower.
The number of minutes spent on roaming has doubled compared to last year.
With a huge advantage over other countries, Germany dominates here.
"Calls in roaming are more used by corporate customers on business trips," Cieslar added.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for home atmosphere at Renaissance Club
Former golfer Ronan Rafferty will be hoping for a relaxing atmosphere at the Renaissance Club in the Scottish East Lothian administrative district, which hosts the 25th Scottish Senior Open.
Ronan Rafferty, who comes from Northern Ireland, gave in to Paul Eales last year on the nearby Archerfield Links golf course on his way to the final. This year, he will play the role of tournament ambassador on behalf of the club’s founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
“I’ve watched the Renaissance Club grow up in front of my eyes and this year’s tournament will show the world its beauty,” Rafferty said.
“Players will be able to love the first-class quality of the field.
Jerry did a great job.
He is an ardent defender of this game and is proud of his achievements.
This year’s tournament is in the right hands.”
The Englishman Eales will defend the championship for the first time, despite having won the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour during his 32-year career.
"I feel good about it," said the Southport golfer.
“I didn’t have the opportunity to defend my victory at the Extremadura Open because the tournament was cancelled a year after my victory.
Returning to this part of the country is magical.
It is a beautiful place for golf.
I remember last year when Sharon meant a lot to me and my wife to win.
It was a beautiful time that I will never forget.”
Gary Orr, who joined the European Senior Tour after celebrating 50 years from the region this year, returns home.
This event will be his first participation since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"I always like to play at home," Orr said of Helensburgh.
“You want to be successful and feel a lot of pressure.
I really enjoyed playing again and I think I’m doing well.
I am happy with the result so far.”
Former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and senior tournament winners Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty will also join the three players.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among six Scottish players on the court; the others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Entrance to the tournament is free. Parking is <0xC2><0xA3>5 per car with one passenger and <0xC2><0xA3>10 per car with two or more passengers.
All proceeds will be donated to Prostate Cancer UK.
Poverty and Death in Indonesian Gold Country
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she doesn't use the stove.
In fact, he rarely uses a pan.
In her wooden cottage, which is located in the capital of Paniai Enarotali in the Indonesian province of Papua, a woman usually simply throws a sweet potato - in the language of the local "notes" - directly into the fire.
After half an hour, remove the potato and taste it with unwashed hands.
Bardina sits on muddy ground - the cottage is not equipped with furniture - where she also performs her daily tasks, such as washing clothes in cloudy water from a nearby swamp.
A bucket in a room without a roof complements the toilet.
As the youngest of her husband’s four wives, she was not assigned any fields to cultivate.
Polygamy is common here.
Working until late at night poses a danger: most of the men in the village are unemployed and often drink alcohol. In addition, there are soldiers in the village.
“After five o’clock in the afternoon, no one is allowed to wander around the village,” says Bardina.
It is a rare glimpse into everyday life on the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was declared a part of Indonesia in 1969 after a controversial referendum when only 1026 seniors were forced to vote in the form of a public raise of hands before the occupying army.
The current movement of protesters against Dutch rules quickly turned its anger against the Jakarta government, which controlled the entire region with the exception of foreign journalists or civil rights monitors.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua - independent Papua New Guinea occupied the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is such a remote and desolate city that you get to after a 90-minute flight from the capital of Jayapura province to Nabire, and then a five-hour tummy crawling by ride.
There is no public transport at this place.
The city of 19,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences, roofs made of woolen sheets in shades of gray and rust.
Very few Indonesians, let alone journalists, and virtually no foreigners, looked at this place.
Before the arrival of Christians, the locals worshipped a god named Uga Tamee.
And that's not all.
“We weren’t used to wearing these dresses,” Bardina says, pointing to her colorful, hand-knit turban, dark shirt and glowing skirt.
"We used to wear only leaves."
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia, with 28% of the population living below the poverty line, and child mortality and literacy is one of the worst in all of Asia.
At the same time, however, it is the Indonesian country of gold.
The world’s largest and most lucrative gold mine, Grasberg, which owns Freeport McMoran from U.S. Phoeenix, is located just 60 miles from Paniai – a rocky province about the size of New Jersey that is home to about 153,000 residents.
In 2015 alone, Freeport mined $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper.
In addition, Papua supports the mining of wood for an estimated $78 billion.
This wealth, however, is a source of suffering for the Papuans and a guarantee of oppression by the powerful Indonesian army.
According to a 2005 New York Times investigation, Freeport paid local military officials and units about $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including $150,000 per officer.
Papuans calling for self-government threaten this golden goose and are therefore severely oppressed.
According to human rights activists, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed since 1969 and thousands more have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian army.
The mass murders in the tribal area of Papua during the 1970s amounted to genocide, according to the Asian Human Rights Commission.
Last year alone, Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters in the region.
We Will Lose Everything, a 2016 report by the Brisbane Archdiocese, describes the atrocities that occurred last year, such as extrajudicial executions, torture – according to another report, rape and electric executions are particularly popular – and the brutal suppression of peaceful protesters.
“It’s hard to count the number of casualties because incidents happen every week,” said Andreas Harsono, an Indonesian researcher at Human Rights Watch.
The whole situation was aggravated by the fact that Papuan resources attracted settlers to Indonesia.
Of the 3.5 million inhabitants of the province, 83% are converting to Christianity, but demographics are changing with the influx of Muslim immigrants from the Indonesian islands of Java, Bornea, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese canteens sell fried chicken and gado-gado, or a mixture of vegetables with peanut sauce.
The locals are fighting for survival.
“Immigrants started selling chicken and vegetables in traditional markets at lower prices than local Papuans,” explains Abeth You, 24, who was born in Paniai and moved to work in the capital of Jayapura province.
"The natives of Papua - mom-mom (women) - have lost their jobs."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, nicknamed Jokowi, pledged to address injustice and rights violations in his 2014 presidential campaign.
The former carpenter secured his way to the presidential palace in Jakarta in 27 of 29 districts of Papua, including Paniai.
But in Papua, very little has changed and the local people feel betrayed.
“Our heart was broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokpwi in the hope that he would hear our call for justice,” You said.
The fact is that just two months after Jakowi’s inauguration in October, Paniai experienced a great shock.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children sang Christmas songs at a campfire in the city of Enarotali, when two Indonesian soldiers emerged from the darkness of the night on motorcycles.
Two of the surprised children told them they should turn on the lights.
One of the soldiers was touched by the exclamation and tone she was told to, and later returned with four other soldiers, said local parish priest Yavedt Tebai.
Two of the soldiers in the underwater condition chased a group of children and beat them with their arms, victims and witnesses said.
One of the soldiers then fired at a group of children.
One of the children, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so badly that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later someone set fire to a nearby election commission building, and the next day things were still escalating.
About 1,000 young Papuan men and women gathered at the football field in front of the local police station and army headquarters to demand justice.
They came with ceremonial hunting bows and performed a waita dance - in which it runs in a circle and mimics the singing of birds - the Papuan tribe Mee Pago.
Several protesters began throwing stones at the buildings.
With increasing tensions, soldiers were given an order over the radio: “If the crowd tries to resist at least three times, you are allowed to shoot,” according to the TIME weekly in an official document, the content of which was never published in the local media.
Jeremias Kayame, 56, the head of the Enarotali district of Kego Koto, recognized the imminent danger and urged the residents to flee to their homes.
But no one paid attention to his words.
“When I turned around, someone shot me in the left wrist,” he told TIME on the porch of his manor-painted wooden house.
Kayame does not yet know who the shooter was, but he said the bullet belonged to one of the soldiers present.
"There were a lot of people around and a lot of shooting," he added.
One of the locals, Alfius Youw, said his cousin, who witnessed the shooting, was hit three times.
"I ran to the body to make sure it was really him," Yohanes told TIME in a sour voice, which, like many Indonesians, uses only one name.
"I saw that he was dead...I kissed him."
Papua Police Inspector General Yotje Mende told reporters that his officers were only “securing” the station under attack.
“We have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us,” Pudjo Sulistiya, a spokesman for the Papuan police, said in 2015.
“It’s a matter of life and death.”
According to Human Rights Watch, five protesters were killed and many escaped with injuries.
The report of the murders was leaked to the Jakarta media the next day.
Three weeks later, he delivered a passionate speech to Jokowi in Jayapura, expressing his sympathy for the families of the victims and promising to deal with the violence in Papua.
"I demand an immediate solution to this problem, so that it can never be repeated," he said.
In October 2016, National Security Minister Wiranto announced that he would introduce an out-of-court mechanism to address the violent acts that have occurred in the past.
Almost immediately, however, an apology began to be heard.
“Most acts of violence have taken place a long time ago.
Some of them occurred in the 1990s and some in the early 21st century.
I mean, we're determined to punish these violent acts, but it's not going to be an easy task," he said.
In a June 5 interview with TIME in Jakarta, however, Wiranto said he had no plans to impose any measures in Papua.
Instead, he said that “all cases will be brought before the court.”
Wiranto, who has been accused by the UN of "crimes against humanity" on the basis of more than one thousand deaths during the 1999 independent elections in East Timor, said 11 cases of human rights violations have been settled in Papua, including the Paniai incident.
The families of the victims of the shooting in Paniai welcomed his allegations with distrust.
“In the last three years, I’ve been questioned four times in total, but I haven’t seen anything so far,” Yohanes said.
"I'm tired."
A few years later, he still lives in fear.
"I'm afraid," he says.
"I'm afraid I'm going to be arrested by the army or someone will shoot me."
His brother Yacobus confirmed the view of many residents of Paniai who are afraid to speak about the incident.
According to him, he was beaten by members of the army after he helped bury four of the victims.
"After the body was buried, the army started looking for me," he said.
And the shooting hasn't stopped yet.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police fired at villagers in neighboring Deiyai.
The clash, in which one person died and another 17 were injured, occurred between the villagers and the manager of the construction company, who refused to provide assistance in transporting the man unconscious to the hospital.
Ravianus Douw, 24, who drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died on his way to the hospital.
Angry villagers protested in front of the company building.
According to police, the villagers were throwing stones at the members and the responses were warning shots.
However, locals claim that a mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) began shooting at the crowd and killed one person.
"There was a panic, we were afraid of retaliation," Domingu Badii, 29, who lives near the hospital and witnessed the arrival of the wounded, told TIME.
“I haven’t left the house in two days.”
The Deiyai parliament demanded the punishment of the police officers involved and the withdrawal of the mobile brigade from the area.
Paniai has always been a thorn in the eye for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development only deepens the separation of the indigenous peoples of the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal tribes, who live in the central highlands.
Many of them have joined the Papuai Liberation Movement (OPM), an army of rebels that protects the rights of Papuans by attacking and abducting Indonesian police officers.
Some of the leaders of the OPM come from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
As a result of the attacks, the army has arrested and arbitrarily detained thousands of residents of Paniai in recent years, all under the pretext of “securing national sovereignty”.
Some of them will never be seen again.
Paniai is known as a "tragic and forgotten place" among the people of Papua.
Oil in the fire brings poverty.
The little rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for the locals.
And the bread is just as inaccessible.
The locals grow their food: mainly sweet potatoes, fruits and leafy vegetables.
Women work in the fields; each of them cultivates four or five fields of sweet potatoes.
Most of the harvest is intended for the needs of the family, the rest are sold on the local market.
Ten pieces of sweet potatoes cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Since Nabire Airport opened more air routes and new immigrants began flowing into the country, there has been an increase in economic inequality between native Papuans and immigrants.
So few jobs are usually filled by more educated and wealthier immigrants.
Papuans rarely have the capital and education they need to get into business.
“Young people are moving out of villages because of the lack of jobs and money,” said John Gobai, chairman of the Paniai Tribal Council.
Thanks to isolation, the province of Papua is hidden from the world.
Strict rules for foreign journalists also contribute to this.
Earlier this year, two French journalists - Franck Escudie and Basile Longchamp - were expelled from Papua because of "lack of cooperation with the authorities", despite the fact that they were given such a rare permission to film.
Phelim Kine, deputy director of the Asian branch of Human Rights Watch, promised Jokowi in his election campaign to abolish strict rules for journalists and achieve transparency and development, but this has never happened.
“Foreign journalists working in the rebellious easternmost regions of Papua and Western Papua are at great risk: not recognising visas and being blacklisted,” he said in a statement.
The lack of news from foreign journalists means that international pressure on Indonesian in the case of Papua is largely limited.
In March, six Pacific nations - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands - urged the UN Human Rights Council to investigate "various and widespread acts of violence" in Papua, including the shooting in Paniai.
These countries have also supported the OPM in the past.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir shook up the accusations when he told reporters in Jakarta: “In Indonesia, the democratic system is still in place and the media is free, so it is difficult to disguise evidence of human rights violations.”
Local people are calling for the participation of foreign governments.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, led by human rights envoy Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapurau on May 4, local people were calling for a source who also attended the meeting but wanted to remain anonymous, the motto “we want freedom”.
Further elections are planned for 2019 in Indonesia, but the Papuans say they will not elect Jokowi.
“Jokowi is a man who has good intentions but is surrounded by people associated with the shooting in Paniai,” said Gobau, chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Jokowi to know that the inhabitants of Paniai – in addition to living in constant fear of a robbing army – are rolling in poverty, miserable education and the health system.
Gobai claims that the inhabitants of Paniai, like the other Papuans, regard their vote as a "debt" to be paid back to Jokow.
“They don’t want money, they want justice,” he added.
Despite the threats and intimidation of the families of the victims of the Paniai shooting, the last symbolic act of defiance continues: they bury the bodies of the victims on the ground opposite the police and army station.
Knowing that justice will never be done enough, at least it will not allow those responsible to forget their crimes.
"A member of our family was killed," Yacobus said with his head bowed.
"What can we do?"
The French Navy has seized a huge shipment of cocaine to Australia.
The French navy seized a yacht carrying 1.46 tons of cocaine worth about $256 million in the Pacific.
The shipment was heading to Australia.
In the course of the intervention, a four-man crew of the ship, made up of people from Lithuania and Latvia, was arrested.
The yacht, named Afalina, sailed from South America and was pulled by police to a port in the city of Nouméa, the metropolis of the French overseas territory of New Caledonia in the Pacific Ocean.
The Australian intelligence agency said it would work with its international partners to determine exactly where and where the drugs were coming from, and to uncover the "Lithuanian syndicate".
“We are grateful to the French authorities for the measures they have taken to stop large quantities of drugs heading to Australia,” said Col Blanch, its executive director.
Drugs were destroyed in Nouméa this week.
Due to the high street prices of drugs, Australia is an attractive destination for its smugglers.
The country is also facing the problem of an increasing number of people suffering from drug addiction.
The current strike is not the first in recent years.
Last month, three men were charged with transporting large quantities of drugs from the United States to Australia, which attempted to smuggle across the Pacific Ocean on a small plane.
Seniors do not feel thirsty, they need to be reminded of drinking.
The problem may be in homes for the elderly, the solution according to the doctor from the Geriatric Clinic of the General Faculty Hospital in Prague Pavly Mádlová could be infusions of a physiological solution, which are injected with a thin needle under the skin.
However, they are only used in medical facilities.
The older a person is, the more water in his body decreases.
"In addition, it loses the feeling of thirst, so seniors generally take less fluids and dehydrate very quickly," Mádlová said.
Two liters should definitely drink.
"But getting so much fluid into the old man is a big problem," she added.
In nursing homes, it is often not taken care of by a doctor.
In hospitals, dehydration is usually treated with infusions.
"I think it should be introduced gradually there too so that they can receive subcutaneous infusions," she said.
For a day, she says, the elderly can be supplied with up to two half-liter bottles of physiological solution.
A lack of fluids can cause dysfunction, headaches and reduced performance.
Dehydration is a complete loss of self-sufficiency.
"One day the old man will say he can't get out of bed, he's talking confused," she added.
In case of negligence, it can lead to a stroke.
Blood thickens and blocks the blood vessels in the brain, and there is also a risk of kidney failure.
Reclining patients should not be covered with a diaper, maximally a cotton sheet.
Disposable diapers can also be a problem.
"It's more nursingly demanding, but the ideal would be to uncover the patient occasionally and let the skin vent," she said.
The Torch is burning in Dubai for the second time.
One of the world's largest residential skyscrapers was on fire in Dubai on Friday, with firefighters evacuating all 337-metre-high and 79-storey buildings.
In the last two years, this is the second fire of this high-rise building, which bears the appropriate name The Torch.
All residents of the building were evacuated and there were no injuries. The cause of the fire is unknown.
“We slept and the alarm woke us up. We heard a scream.
It took us ten minutes to run down from the 50th floor," Geroge, a resident of the skyscraper, told Reuters.
Dubai Civil Defense said the firefighters managed to get the fire under control around 4 a.m. (00 GMT) and then continued to cool the building.
Government officials added that they are providing alternative accommodation for the disadvantaged residents.
The incident could once again spark a debate on the safety of materials used to line high-rise buildings around the world.
The results of an investigation initiated by the management of Torch after the 2015 fire revealed that the cladding and external panels used to decorate or insulate were the most damaged.
British police said the system of insulation and cladding of London’s Grenfell Tower could have contributed to the rapid spread of the June fire, which killed nearly 80 people.
Survey results show that more than one in five passengers to the U.S. carry prohibited items on board aircraft
A survey of passengers showed that more than twenty percent of them deliberately or unwittingly passed prohibited items through the U.S. Transportation Security Administration control station on board the aircraft. At least six percent of passengers boarded the aircraft with a knife or other sharp object.
Less than one percent of passengers say they have found out late that they were travelling with firearms, ammunition or explosives.
The results of a survey conducted by Stratos Jet Charters Inc. - which answered more than 1,000 questionnaires - showed that younger passengers were more likely to break the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted to having deliberately attempted to travel with an item that was banned by the TSA, 19.7 percent were passengers with several thousand flying hours compared to less than 15 percent of Generation X members.
Among the most common items that have escaped the attention of TSA are food and alcohol.
More than three per cent of respondents deliberately spoke through surveillance, while 2.2 per cent of women and 3.7 per cent of men also admitted that they deliberately put banned drugs on board the plane.
The company said it was conducting research among travelers around the world to find out how many of them accidentally passed unauthorized items through airport control and how many did so intentionally.
It is not surprising that most people who have carried unauthorized items - whether consciously or unconsciously - travel by plane very often.
As the company stressed, the TSA directives are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People often do not know what liquids and how much they can carry into the plane.
It is not surprising that the TSA seized the largest amount of the currently banned liquid.
For some time, people thought that the TSA would treat books the same way as smuggled goods.
Transportation of liquids is allowed within domestic flights, not international ones.
EPA chief Scott Pruitt postpones planned directives to reduce Obama administration’s emissions
After the Environmental Protection Agency was sued by fifteen states, its chief Scott Pruitt revoked his earlier decision to postpone the implementation of the former Obama administration’s plan to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
Pruitt introduced the changes in his plan, responding more quickly than previous governments to the needs of state environmental regulators.
However, he did not mention the legal challenge brought against his previous position in the Federal Court of Appeal.
This refers to the last date set for 1 October, when countries should begin to comply with the 2015 regulation to reduce ground-level ozone.
Pruitt announced in June that he would delay the deal by one year and order a more detailed study of the plan to avoid “interference with local decisions or threatening economic growth.”
Pruitt, who held the position of Oklahoma’s Attorney General before taking over as EPA chief by President Donald Trump, has long served as a reliable opponent of more stringent environmental regulations.
Since settling in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly moved or postponed the regulations proposed by the chemical and fossil industry.
Wednesday’s sudden turnaround is the biggest legal failure for Pruitt’s regulatory agenda.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled that an EPA executive exceeded its authority in an effort to delay the Obama administration’s plan, which required oil and gas companies to reduce methane leaks.
In a statement released Wednesday evening, Pruitt proposed his version of ozone standards and strengthened the EPA’s commitment to working with states through complex processes and meeting new standards within a given timeframe.
“During the previous administration, the EPA often failed to meet deadlines and waited for it to be prosecuted by activist groups and others, agreeing to settlement and further scheduling,” said Pruitt, who filed more than a dozen lawsuits with the EPA in his previous position.
“We don’t believe in regulation through litigation and we take deadlines seriously.
We never joke about our status and the authority that comes from it.”
However, the EPA’s statement states that Pruitt may at some point use “the option of delay and all other legally available authorities” to ensure that regulations “will be based on sound policies and the most available information.”
Republicans in Congress are pushing for a broader overhaul of the ozone rules.
The White House budget approved last month aims to postpone the implementation of the 2015 rules for at least eight years.
The measure was still not passed by the Senate.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who headed a coalition of states that sued the EPA this week, said the group would not allow legal pressure.
“Turning the EPA’s views – following our judicial review – is an important victory for the health and safety of the 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by air pollution,” Schneiderman said.
New York was joined by California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and Washington, D.C.
Ground-level ozone occurs when common harmful substances emitted by cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical power plants and other sources react in an atmosphere with sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause serious breathing problems in sensitive people and thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health advocates and environmentalists welcome Pruitt’s sudden change with gratitude.
“It’s worrying how much pressure we need to develop to change the mindset of those responsible and protect the air we breathe,” said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.
“We must continue to fight the ideological pull of the Trump administration, which is trying to help polluters and special interests.”
He spilled acid on the man, but he's not dangerous, according to the court.
You never know what can happen to you.
At one moment you are at home with your family and you laugh, at the second you suddenly change your whole life from scratch.
And the worst part is that you can't do anything about it.
A similar fate was met by Andreas Christopheros of Great Britain, whose face was acidified by an unknown attacker who was eventually acquitted.
This was reported by the Reuters website.
In December 2014, someone knocked on the door of Christopheros.
Andreas got up and said he was going to open.
He thought there was probably a courier at the door who was supposed to deliver Christmas presents to the family that day.
Instead, a cruel surprise awaited him.
The man he had never seen in his life, immediately after opening it without warning, poured acid with the words: "This is for you, my friend."
The pain was indescribable.
The clothes fell apart on me like nothing, and I just felt an incredible pain on my skin,” Andreas said.
His family rushed him to the hospital, but his relatives learned a terrible news - according to doctors, he had no chance of surviving.
Weeks after the incident, doctors were constantly worried that their patient would succumb to an infection that threatened to penetrate his wounds.
His injury was very serious.
Ninety percent were affected by a face that doctors tried to put together using skin from other parts of the patient’s body.
The loss of the eyelids became a major complication for Christopherose.
It's probably the most annoying thing I've ever experienced.
"You can't hide from the unexpected light, you can't close your eyes," he described his anguish.
Today, Christopheros has 12 operations that are far from the last.
Injuries suffered by victims of acid attacks may require hundreds of surgical procedures and years of treatment, according to plastic surgeons.
Even after difficult and long-term treatment, the victims have tissue scarring for the rest of their lives.
"Sometimes people don't heal and fight deformation and deformation throughout their lives," said Professor Peter Dziewulski, a spokesman for the British Association of Plastic and Aesthetic Surgeons.
The attacker was wrong.
As for the attack, Christopher is sure that an unknown man must have mistaken him for someone.
The perpetrator believed in revenge for a man who sexually abused his loved one.
The police thoroughly investigated the case, and the attacker was later identified.
The man was originally sentenced to at least eight years in prison.
However, later, the verdict to the astonishment of the Christopher family changed radically.
"Three judges eventually concluded that the sentence should be abolished because the man is not considered a threat to the public," Christopheros said.
In the last few years, the number of infestations with corrosive substances has increased significantly.
The Ministry of the Interior said that it plans to lay down new guidelines for state prosecutors regarding the classification of fertilizers.
They should be included among the dangerous weapons.
Victims of such attacks, however, do not intend to give up.
They demand that the UK government impose stricter and longer prison sentences on people who attack their surroundings with acid or other corrosive substances.
They also demand tighter controls on the sale of hazardous substances, which are often available in different stores, as they are different cleaning agents.
In the largest city of the United Arab Emirates, Dubai burned at night the famous skyscraper The Torch, which is one of the largest residential buildings in the world.
According to Dubai Civil Defence, the residents of the eighty-five-floor building managed to evacuate in time and no one was injured.
According to a spokesman for Dubai Police, a fire broke out on the ninth floor and spread upward.
However, according to several residents of the house, it was the opposite.
"It started on the 67th floor, that's what they told us," one of the tenants said.
Another tenant, cited by Reuters, said the fire broke out on the top floors and spread downward with falling hot debris.
We slept.
We were alarmed, people were screaming.
"We were running down the stairs, it took us about ten minutes from the 50th floor," the tenant George said.
Another witness for CNN estimated that the flames seized about 40 apartments.
The fire destroyed at least two cars on the ground when they were hit by burning parts of the building.
After about two hours, according to the civil defense report, the fire managed to get under control.
The cause of its occurrence is not yet known.
According to witnesses, there was a power outage in the surrounding buildings.
A massive fire damaged the Dubai skyscraper The Torch in February 2015, destroying over a hundred apartments.
There are about 680 apartments in the entire building.
At the time, nothing happened to anyone, because the residents were evacuated in time.
The Torch was built in 2011 and then became the tallest residential building in the world with its 352 meters.
The following year, another Dubai skyscraper set a new record.
The bodybuilder had 14 incredible doping substances in his body.
He didn't win anyway.
According to Corriere della Serra, a sample of Ippolito, 23, contained a diverse collection of illicit drugs – from steroids to diuretics to Parkinson’s disease or anorexia.
Paradoxically, even this wild mix did not help him to the title, he finished fourth.
Now the bodybuilder is threatened with four years of distance and prosecution.
The record was 11.
Last year, Italian rugby player Davide Vasta tested positive for 11 doping substances, which was a record amount of hit athletes.
A tri-liga player began taking steroids a year before he dropped bodybuilding.
Lucka Vondrá<0xC4><0x8D>ková in Czech Republic.
She hugged her ex-lover passionately!
Lucka Vondrá<0xC4><0x8D>ková has barely stepped into the territory of the Czech Republic, she is in one lap.
And it also draws attention wherever it goes.
The last time she fell in her arms was her ex-lover Michal Dlouh<0xC3><0xBD>, with whom she lived for three years.
The actor was 12 years older at the time and already wanted a family.
Lucia was only 19 years old at the time and definitely did not want to hang her career on a nail.
They went away, but the friends remained until this day.
They also did so at a TV Prima press conference, where they met after a long time.
Coincidentally, they both blended into blue.
At first they didn't notice each other, but then they got closer, and Lucie laughed at Michael's jokes as she grabbed her belly.
Then they hugged and posed willingly for the photographers.
Their encounter, however, was not a coincidence, because they will play together the lovers in the new series Prima Captain Exner.
Islamists have been sentenced to life in preparation for an assassination in the UK.
A British court on Thursday sentenced four members of an Islamist cell calling itself the Three Musketeers to life imprisonment and, according to prosecutors, planning a terrorist attack against the police and the army.
Four men, two of whom took part in a training camp in Pakistan and had previously been convicted of similar crimes, were arrested last August.
At the time, the authorities believed that he was going to attack immediately.
In the car of one of the men, security agents found a partially finished tube bomb, knives with inscriptions in Arabic meaning "infidels", and a model of a gun.
This happened when a MI5 intelligence agent placed an eavesdropping device in the car.
"Recent assassinations have shown what horror the defendants could have caused if they hadn't been arrested," prosecutor's deputy Sue Hemming said.
Three sentences at the ages of 28, 25 and 33 can apply for release after twenty years.
A fourth convict, 38, can do that after 15 years behind bars.
The men during the trial in London claimed to be innocent and that the weapons found in the car were placed there by MI5 agent.
The court also questioned him, but then rejected the defendants’ allegations.
Thursday was the warmest day of the year.
In Hodoninsk they measured 38.3 °C.
Tuesday's record temperature of 37.3 degrees Celsius remained at its peak for just two days.
With 38.3 degrees Celsius recorded in The Watchtower, Hodoninskaya, it was surpassed by Thursday, which thus became the warmest day yet this year.
This was confirmed by the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
On Tuesday, however, there were not many temperature records.
On Tuesday, records were broken or leveled at 35 of the 145 weather stations measuring over 30 years.
Only nine long-term measuring stations recorded record temperatures on Thursday.
For example, in Strá<0xC5><0xBE>nice, Thursday’s temperature was the same as the previous record from 2013.
In Lednice, B<0xC5><0x99>eclav, it surpassed the original maximum by four tenths of a degree on Thursday, and in Poho<0xC5><0x99>elice, Brno, it surpassed the current record by three tenths of a degree.
Both records, as with The Watchtower, date back to 2013.
In the west it was ten degrees less.
High temperatures appeared on Thursday mainly in the south and east of Moravia.
After Strá<0xC5><0xBE>nice there was the biggest heat in Dyjakovice on Znojemsk and Broda nad Dyjí on B<0xC5><0x99>eclavsk, where mercury climbed to 37.8 degrees, but did not break the record.
On the other hand, for example in the western and northwestern Bohemia, according to the website <0xC4><0x8C>HM<0xC3><0x9A>, Thursday’s highest temperatures were only around 22 degrees Celsius.
"Temperatures started to rise there just this late in the afternoon," the meteorologists said.
According to the <0xC4><0x8C>HMU, the current heat in the Czech Republic will gradually fade and more heavy rains could come on Sunday.
In most places in Moravia, however, the high temperatures will remain on Friday and in the southeastern part of Moravia on Saturday.
China is lacking tourists.
Beijing is losing billions of dollars due to its visa policy.
China has been trying for decades to exert its influence without the use of force.
It will spend $10 billion a year to support language schools and build universities abroad, push its entertainment industry to foreign markets, and try to attract Western tourists.
Beijing is not doing that.
The state media are talking about a plan to make tourism the driving force of economic transformation and modernization.
However, the number of arrivals increased by only 3.8 percent last year, and about 80 percent of tourists to China came from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan.
This is due, among other things, to the fact that despite all of its global aspirations, China does not welcome foreigners with open arms, assessing the situation in the world’s most populous country Professor of Economics from the University of Beijing Christopher Balding in an article for the Bloomberg agency.
An example that speaks for everything is the Chinese visa policy.
Only 13 countries have visa-free contact with China, the citizens of the other countries must obtain a visa in advance.
The Chinese authorities in the U.S. are therefore crowds comparable to the celebrations of the Chinese New Year.
The visa costs $140, but if you don’t want to wait in line for long hours, you have to pay $100 or more for additional services.
Such constraints create significant economic barriers.
A study in the Journal of Economics and Finance showed that the need for a visa reduces the number of visitors to a country by 70 percent.
In 2015, only two million Americans visited mainland China, while Hong Kong, which accounts for less than three percent of China's gross domestic product and lives there less than one percent of the total population, was visited by 1.8 million Americans.
China often exacerbates this problem itself when tourism uses it to achieve its political goals, for example in disputes with Taiwan and South Korea.
When China restricted shipments to South Korea in the spring as part of a crackdown around the South Korean missile system, the South Koreans retaliated and China avoided it.
In May, the number of visits fell by 42 percent year-on-year, while Japan saw an 85 percent increase.
All this affects macroeconomic stability.
According to a recently published report by the US central bank, China could leave as much as $190 billion as a result of Chinese foreign travel, while China will earn about $35 billion a year as part of the currency sales to incoming tourists.
According to official figures on the development of the balance of payments, China had a deficit of $217 billion in tourism last year, which is equal to 44 percent of China's total surplus in trade in goods.
Thus, a small number of tourists to the country, which is anxiously preventing the outflow of capital, is laying a very painful wound.
However, the above-mentioned factors are only one manifestation of more general restraint towards foreigners.
In many places in China, virtually no one has heard of immigrants.
In 2013, there were less than one million foreigners living in China.
There are more of them in the United States and some individual cities.
Even Japan, which is not exactly a crossroads of immigration, has doubled.
A number of scientific papers show that immigrants usually revive economic growth, entrepreneurship and innovation.
You will not find them in China.
Solving these problems will be politically challenging, but the step that is offered is to simplify the visa apparatus.
Other Asian countries, notably India and Vietnam, have recently made great efforts to simplify and reduce visa procedures.
If China wants more foreign tourists and their hard currencies, it should be easier for them to get there.
In the Pilsen Zoo, deadly poisonous reptiles were reproduced.
The Kingdom of Poison of Pilsen can enjoy the offspring of three rare, deadly poisonous reptiles.
In the exhibition, visitors will see only all nine freshly born Turkish snakes.
This species lives in northern Anatolia, even at an altitude of 2,000 meters.
"Meter lengths are also growing," said zoo spokesman Martin Vobruba.
The young of the other two species, the mortals and the red cobras, will in the meantime gain strength in the breeding grounds of the garden.
We still can't tell when people will see them.
"We would not like to lose them," said the nurse Miroslav Dohnal, saying it could take a year or two.
Australian deadly snakes have come into the world eight, they are the offspring of a breeding pair originating from a population around Sydney.
"The individual that visitors can see in the exhibition belongs to the lethals around Perth," Vobruba said, adding that in human care, the lethals need to winter for 6-8 weeks at a temperature of 13 degrees Celsius.
One hundred percent success accompanied the meeting of African spitting red cobras.
A couple in the Pilsen Zoo hatched a total of four cubs from four eggs.
"The incubation lasted 65 days," Vobruba added.
This species in nature sprays poison on its victims, up to a distance of four meters.
It aims at the eyes, can cause permanent blindness.
The young of all three species feed on mice in the zoo.
Within 40 days in the garden still expect the laying of the young from the nest of black mammoths, the eggs are stored in the incubator.
According to an unauthentic transcript of the phone conversation, Trump is creating pressure on Mexico to pay for the border wall
The Washington Post published a transcript of President Trump’s phone calls with leaders of Mexico and Australia.
In a January 27 telephone conversation with Mexican President Enrique Peño Nieto, Trump urged him to stop publicly announcing that he would not pay for the proposed wall.
The U.S. president accused him of publicly denouncing the construction of the wall, allegedly saying, “You can’t talk like that in the press.”
As part of his campaign, Trump promised to build a wall along the southern border and announced that Mexico would pay for it.
He also escaped the transcript of his first conversation with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, revealing a tense exchange of views.
President Trump told Turnbull that the U.S. oversight deal on refugees heading to Australia was “ridden” and “stupid” and insisted that if he agreed to such a deal – which came under President Obama’s administration – it would look like a “drug-drug” deal after the U.S. proposed.
Trump ended the call after explaining to Turnbull that “this is my most unpleasant call of the day.”
Tusk testified again at the prosecutor's office about Smolensk.
"He has something to fear," Tusk's brother Jaroslaw Kaczy<0xC5><0x84>ski, the leader of PiS's Law and Justice party, said in a statement.
"I have nothing to fear, Kaczy<0xC5><0x84>ski will not frighten me," Tusk replied, reading to the country's current leadership that he was trying to abuse the justice system against political opponents.
On leaving the prosecutor’s office, he was waiting for Tusk, according to TVN, 24 crowds chanting Donald Tusk! and wishing the politician a hundred years!.
Tusk thanked him for his support and assured him that he had a clear conscience: "I have nothing to fear and Kaczy<0xC5><0x84>ski will not frighten me."
According to him, he does not blame the prosecutors, but he has no doubt that justice is to serve the current Polish rulers as an instrument against opponents, the opposition or people they do not like, and I am afraid that I belong to this group.
He was in question for the second time.
The former prime minister was questioned at the prosecutor’s office for the second time, this time regarding the miscarriage of alcohol by the victims of the Smolensk disaster.
In addition, there was a change of bodies in the coffins.
Families were forbidden to open coffins, and there must be some reason for that.
And the reason was that they were afraid of the scandal, because it would burden Polish-Russian relations.
“Maintaining good relations at all costs, despite such a terrible event, should have served to make Donald Tusk a very important person in the EU,” Kaczy<0xC5><0x84>ski told Catholic TV.
He added that a possible conflict with Russia would hamper Tusk's chances of getting the most important chair in the union, from which Poland has absolutely nothing.
At the same time, Kaczy<0xC5><0x84>ski said he had warned German Chancellor Angela Merkel that Donald Tusk could be affected differently, but she did not take note.
Tusk had been interrogated for eight hours at the prosecutor’s office on April 19.
He did not speak as a suspect, only as a witness.
However, many considered his summons to be part of the apparent effort of the Polish government and the head of PiS Kaczy<0xC5><0x84>ski to discredit Tusk as a political rival by linking him to various scandals.
In Poland, the Prosecutor’s Office is subordinate to the Minister of Justice, who acts as the Attorney General.
The call for questioning came shortly after the election of Tusk as head of the European Council, which Kaczy<0xC5><0x84>ski tried hard but in vain to prevent, among other things, during a visit to Merkel in Warsaw.
At the EU summit against the extension of Tusk’s mandate, only Polish Prime Minister Beata Szydlová protested on her own.
In this case, the Hungarian Prime Minister, Viktor Orbán, left Warsaw behind.
Burma and Senegal.
Where can the Czechs vote?
In the autumn parliamentary elections, registered voters will be able to vote again on the composition of the parliament from Burma, Senegal or Luxembourg.
In these and several other countries, the Czech Republic has opened its representative offices since the last parliamentary elections held in 2013.
It follows from the decree that regulates the delivery of ballots abroad.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has prepared its update, it is currently under commentary procedure.
Four years ago, 10 thousand Czech citizens voted for members of parliament abroad.
"Since the last amendment to the decree in 2013, there have been some changes that need to be taken into account in these lists," the ministry said.
"In some countries, new representative offices have been created, some offices have been closed, or there has been a change in the level of representation," the report said.
The decree shall contain two annexes, the first of which shall list the representative offices to which paper ballots shall be delivered.
This group of offices includes the representation of the Czech Republic in neighbouring countries, i.e. Germany, Poland, Austria and Slovakia.
More than a hundred other Czech authorities will receive a voting card in the press release.
It is their list that changes by decree.
Four years ago, for example, the Czechs could vote in the Czech embassy in Libya or in Zimbabwe.
Both embassies are closed today.
The Czech Republic has also cancelled its representation in Bamako, Malaysia, and Kyoto, Japan.
There will be no elections at the consulate-general in Donetsk.
The Czech Republic closed in 2014 because of the war in eastern Ukraine.
New embassies are on the list in Nairobi, the Senegalese capital Dakar and Zambian Lusace.
In Asia, since the last parliamentary elections, the Czech Republic has expanded its representation to include a general consulate in Iraq's Irbil and Cheng-tu, the capital of China's S'<0xC4><0x8C>chuan province.
Voting cards will also be available for registered voters at the Czech embassies in Burma and Cambodia.
The Czechs abroad had the opportunity to elect deputies in the electoral chambers of the representative offices or consulates so far four times.
Before each election, the State Electoral Commission determines by chance the region for which the candidates are voted abroad.
This was the first time in 2002 that South Moravian candidates were elected.
In the next two elections, the Czechs voted abroad among the South Bohemian candidates.
The Central Bohemian Region was chosen in 2013 as well as this year.
The number of Czechs voting abroad is steadily increasing.
At the premiere 15 years ago, about 3,800 people came to vote, in 2006 there were about 6,700, four years later, 8,222.
Four years ago, 10,571 voters came to the embassies for early parliamentary elections.
Moore's Ford Bridge Massacre: Activists Remember Racism Lynching
The 1948 Ford Mercury passed by the spectators in Monroe, Georgia, and crawled towards Moore's Ford Bridge.
But before the car with four black-skinned passengers and a white driver was enough to reach the bridge, a group of white men with guns paved the way for him.
The leader of the group – a middle-aged man in a striped suit – pulled out of a cigarette and looked at the windshield of the car.
Inside, the passengers trembled with fear.
"We want that n--and Roger!" cried the man.
"Bring him to me!"
Silently interrupts the cry of a young black man who is pulled from the passenger seat.
Fortunately, this scene is a mere reconstruction of the events that took place on July 22.
But when one of the men throws a slap over "Roger's" neck, the audience sighs with excitement.
Since 2005, a group of activists have regularly returned to the Moore's Ford Bridge to reconstruct the fateful night of 1946, when two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murra Dorsey - were killed by members of the Kukluxklan.
No one has yet been tried for murder.
"It's surprising that not a single person has been arrested in all these years - even though we still see them in our community; even though we know their identities," Tyrone Brooks, who helps organize the reconstruction, said in a statement.
“It is a stain on our history and a burden on our souls.”
Brooks is a 71-year-old former Georgia congressman and lifelong civil rights activist.
In his eyes, the reconstruction of the event is a dramatic call to action, reminding the Monroe community every year that justice has not been done enough.
"We demand prosecution and the closure of the case, we want peace of mind and reconciliation, but justice above all," Brooks said.
“Until then, the process of healing and reconciliation cannot begin.”
On July 27, 1946, the coroner covered one of the bodies of the victims of the lynching at Moore's Ford.
According to FBI files obtained by NBC News, up to 50 men from Monroe and surrounding counties were expected to participate in the lynch mob.
However, no one has yet been prosecuted.
Despite the fact that the suspects have been at liberty for decades, civil rights advocates claim that both the reasons for lynchpins – politics and sex – were known to all residents of the city.
In April 1946, on the basis of the Supreme Court’s ruling, blacks in the state of Georgia were granted the right to participate in the elections, which were scheduled for the summer.
And it was during the summer election season, according to the FBI, a black-skinned farmer, Roger Malcolm, was stabbed by a white-skinned landowner, Barnett Hester, during a fight — allegedly for his wife.
According to Brooks, in the city, it was rumored that Hester was hanging out with Malcolm's wife, Dorothy, and brought her into a different state.
On July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, then a prominent landowner, filed a $600 bail for Malcom.
Dorothy and her cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey accompanied him to the prison.
On their return from prison, just before entering Moore's Ford Bridge, a group of suspects paved their way.
"As it turns out, Harrison planned and organized the murders," the FBI said.
“It is also clear that there was a secret agreement between state and local law enforcement officers who not only participated in the lynchpin, but also got rid of the evidence and denied the identity of the witnesses.”
Brooks spoke briefly about the whole thing.
“It was a massacre for the right to vote,” he said.
"The murders had a clear backdrop for all black locals: 'This is how you'll end up if you register and go to vote.'"
The annual reconstruction of the event at Moore's Ford Bridge is organized by Cassandra Greene for almost a decade.
Its performance is figurative, appealing and accurate, showing a deeply rooted racism that many would like to consider extinct in modern America.
Watching this reconstruction isn't easy, and it's even harder to turn a blind eye, but Greene says it makes sense.
“No one wants to talk about lynching because we have to face the unpleasant feelings that are hiding in each of us,” Greene said.
“But there can be no relationship between us if you don’t listen to what I’ve been through.”
The main rehearsals for this year’s reconstruction began in June, and on the first day, about 30 actors – a dozen whites, the rest of the blacks – entered the room, where Greene introduced them to a very carefully planned performance.
Wade Marbaugh is an assistant director.
For many years he played the leader of the Kukluxklan, but according to him the role is exhausting.
"I feel bad about it because it's contrary to who I am," Marbaugh said.
“I think it’s very important to remember this part of history regularly, because we never want to go back to that time.”
Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play the role of Roger Malcom, then Barnett Hester, are exercising their roles.
The show starts with a fight - Malcolm argues with Hester and blames him for having slept with his wife.
"Get out of my land n---e!"
Rascona won't give up.
There's a fight.
At that moment, everyone (at least every black actor) explodes in laughter.
Greene laughs the most.
"What happened?" asked Rascona.
He's confused.
Was I too rude?
"No," said Greene cheerfully.
"I just don't think the whites said 'n--r' in that tone back then."
"Exactly," said one of the black-skinned actors.
"You have to put more emphasis on R."
The energy in the room is suddenly better; enmity will replace the feeling of closeness.
Everyone wants the show to be authentic, just to make it happen with enough of the four victims of the massacre.
The actors repeat the scene.
This time Rascona emphasizes the correct pronunciation of the word in N.
No one's laughing now.
The show ends violently and quickly.
Screams, shots... and silence.
A woman dressed in black stands over the actors’ bodies and sings Billie Holiday’s sad song “Strange Fruit”.
With every word there is sadness in the room.
In the background of all this, about a dozen spectators wipe sweat and tears from their eyes.
There is almost the same number of blacks and whites in the audience.
One couple came from Ithaca, New York, and many of the spectators were from nearby towns.
Each of them endures a local humid climate for almost eight hours, and Brooks leads them in crowds to the tombs of Malcolm and Dorsey.
Until now, the murders could have been viewed at a distance, but now, standing in the same place where the lynchpins took place, the atmosphere is spooky.
With the last words of the song, Greene will challenge the crowd to inspect the bodies.
Children kneel to the victims' heads, watch fake blood and immobile bodies, and whisper something in their ears.
"They're not dead," the little boy whispered.
It'll be a few minutes, and Greene will thank the audience.
The actors clean the rope and wipe their tears.
Bradshaw embraces Marbaugh, the man in the suit who played the leader of the Kukluxklan.
Nick Rascona embraces his two actor-friends and weeps in their arms; in the end, he is overwhelmed by emotions.
"It's all right," whispered one of the women.
“We know you’re playing that role.
But you had a reason for that."
Later that day, the audience meets with the actors for dinner.
At one table, a young white couple talks passionately about a performance with a black couple they met today.
Denise Duplinski could hardly find words to express her feelings from today’s performance.
“It’s hard to listen to those ugly words and look at those ugly deeds... people who look like you and do it because they look like you,” she said.
“It makes me realize that lynching is still a topical issue,” she added, “it’s just called police brawls.”
On the other side of the room, Tyrone Brooks sits in the courtroom, enjoying dinner and talking about civil rights.
According to his own words, he has already started planning a performance for the next year.
“The reconstruction of these events is inspiring as it describes the fear we had to experience – but it’s also a moment to think about,” he said.
“If we don’t learn from it, who knows... it could happen again.
People who do not know and study the history of their country are doomed to repeat it.”
I love the instructions for use.
One of my friends says he only reads the manuals.
I disagree, on the contrary.
It is one of the modern forms of art, often pure surrealism.
With nostalgia, I remember the days long ago, when the instruction for using anything was rather a rare occurrence.
For example, my first gramophone contained only one paper, on which were hieroglyphs showing the involvement of some components, all had some secret markings.
When something went wrong inside me after years, I offered that card to a shaman who wasn’t afraid to screw the back plate off.
With a smile he advised me, for what that paper with a labyrinth of lines is suitable.
Yes, it was a common aid in chronic depletion of toilet paper.
He found a disconnected wire and allowed me to listen to expensive vinyl cookies again.
The new era has brought new directions.
Even a relatively simple fruit juicer, where he simply clung to the overcut grep, required about ten pictures.
Particularly successful was a sketch describing how to insert one part into another.
The set was two-piece, and another procedure was simply not possible.
Giving it back required considerable effort with the need to break down certain plastic parts.
My contempt for the manual ended with my self-driving Seat Leon.
The 2003 production year still had such a booklet with instructions for minor repairs, which included, among other things, the replacement of the flashlight bulb.
It was easy.
A total of three steps and the work was to be completed.
Unfortunately, the author of the instruction forgot to mention that while the bulb on the right was to be replaced really only in three steps.
1. Separate the cover.
2. Unplug the cracked bulb and screw a new one.
3. Insert the cover.
The bulb on the left had a problem in the form of the placement of the battery cover.
Initially, I thought that by inserting the right upper limb into the belly of the car, I would make some spring, a bolt, with which the cover can be easily removed, and then I would follow the points 1-3 of the sparing author of the service book.
Probably a bridge.
The cover had no place, no room, not even for the slender hand of Cinderella, let alone the obese Slezan.
I lost half an hour of my life, with no success at all.
The condition was further strengthened by my wife’s entry into the garage, which was summoned by the roar and the words she hears from my mouth quite exceptionally.
"What are you doing here?" she asked unkindly.
My answer took about 90 seconds, however, if I omit vulgar terms, there were only two publishable words left.
I'm changing the light bulb.
"And why does it take so long?" she risked a sentence that might be her last in a long-lasting relationship.
I slowly explained the problem to her, putting the main emphasis on the torture process of the author of the instruction, where the blessing of the burning iron on the hand that wrote the instruction, after its seal, so that he could never write anything again, was just an introduction to a wide range of instructions including the Hammer on the Witch.
"How about dismantling the box?" said the woman of dismantling the battery.
In clear desperation, this happened and then step 1-3 was as easy and fast as the right side.
I thought nothing could surprise me.
And that was until the day I got a call from a colleague who was just discussing a state of collapse after checking two of the State Drug Control Officers.
I know him as a balanced colleague who has experienced the possible and the impossible in the field and who is able to interpret even wild stories with an unexcited voice.
"Imagine that I was fined for not having a handwashing manual," he told me in a weak voice.
Gradually, I extracted from it the whole problem, which consisted in the fact that above the washbasin in the patient's toilet there is no picture instruction on how to wash your hands.
His argument to the commissioner that adults usually know how to wash their hands and that the need for pictograms to handle the usual activity of decent people did not have a healing effect and cost him a lot of money.
"It's not just that," she told him.
He understood that the simple rinsing of swollen hands with running water is a primitive act at the level of the chromanion, that modern man, Homo sapiens sapiens, performs this ceremony in ten steps.
So, for example, it is necessary to say that it is necessary to release water from the tap.
The whole process has a total of eleven points, but in the end it is a joyful finding that a person washed his hands exactly as the hosudar from S<0xC3><0x9A>KL commands him.
Finally, I must point out that I have been inspired and I am preparing a detailed plan for the activity in the toilet.
In the matter of defecation, the procedure is uniform, there will not be a problem, in the case of urination, due to certain differences between the two sexes, it will be necessary to hang the instructions two.
The problem remains those pictograms, because to create the perfect procedure also means an accurate drawing of all the anatomical details, which could arouse a certain indignation in a diligent visitor to the toilet, despite the fact that he can finally learn that during the entire period of his life he has been making mistakes.
Pearson to lay off another 3,000 employees and cut dividends in bid to revive business
British education group Pearson said on Friday it would lay off another 3,000 employees and cut the temporary dividend by 72 percent in response to another restructuring program aimed at changing the business model.
The next wave of redundancies, which, according to CEO John Fallon, will occur at the end of 2018 and from the beginning of 2019, follows the company’s previous decision to lay off 4,000 employees as part of the previous restructuring.
Pearson announced a plan to cut costs by another <0xC2><0xA3>300 million ($394 million) in May as part of a third cost-cutting program in an effort to revive declining business as a result of the rapid development of digital education.
The company, which last month agreed to sell its stake in Bertelsmann’s Penguin Random House, said the outlook for this year remained unchanged after announcing a one-percent increase in core sales in the first half of the year to <0xC2><0xA3>2.05 billion.
Attack on a convoy in Kabul: NATO soldiers killed in suicide bombing
A suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital of Kabul, killing one NATO soldier and wounding several others, officials said.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were injured, NATO said in a statement.
According to unofficial reports, three civilians were also killed in the attack in Qarabagh district.
This month, Afghanistan bombed - on Tuesday, more than 30 people were killed in an explosion in a hereditary mosque.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
NATO said in a statement Tuesday that the blast occurred after the patrol, along with members of the Afghan army, was attacked by a "local person with a sub-home-made explosive device".
The statement also said that all wounded soldiers are out of danger and are in a U.S. military hospital at Bagram Air Force Base.
According to reporters, the growing power of the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State (IS) in the Qarabagh area is a significant source of concern for NATO allies in nearby Baghram.
According to the UN, at least 1,662 civilians died in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, of which 20% died in the capital.
At the end of July, a car bomb killed at least 30 people in Kabul’s Shia district.
The Taliban have signed up for the attack.
On May 31, a major explosion in the city centre killed more than 150 people, the deadliest militant attack in the country since U.S. troops overthrew the Taliban government in 2001.
The violence is undermining the already dubious situation in Afghanistan, and US President Donald Trump is considering increasing the number of U.S. soldiers who should help military units and police in the country.
According to reporters, the suicide attacks, to which he has gained in recent weeks public confidence in the government, its regulations and especially in the reputation of President Ashraf Ghanin.
The EPA reassessed its decision to delay smoking rules in response to the lawsuit
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has revoked its decision to postpone the Obama administration’s bill, which ordered states to reduce emissions, just a day after 15 states sued the agency.
On Wednesday night, the EPA announced its decision to relinquish “Ozone Standards 2015” with the words that it is presenting the agency’s commitment to cooperation with states.
"We believe in dialogue with our state partners and will hear their views," EPA Director Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
In June, Pruitt announced the EPA’s effort to delay ozone standards – which measure actual air pollution in specific areas of the country and, based on measurements, determine limits to be met by October 2018.
A group of fifteen from most democratic states, along with Washington, D.C., filed a lawsuit on Tuesday on the grounds that the EPA's actions are illegal.
The administration of President Donald Trump is striving to circumvent the many environmental regulations proposed by former President Barack Obama - in Trump's words in an effort to boost economic growth.
However, the new government’s efforts have launched countermeasures by Democrats and conservative groups who fear the impact of emissions on public health.
On its website, the EPA states that breathing ozone-containing air “can reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms”, such as asthma.
Singer Ladislav Bubnár was wounded and blood was flowing!
This, a fairly new singer, you may have already registered in June of this year, when this almost unknown singer organized a monstrous event in the Czech Republic, which was hosted by such leading personalities as master Karel Gott, Lucie Bílá, Simona Krainíková, and many others.
The purpose was simple, to show off to the public and present his music video for the song Sara, whose baptism was hosted by the just named personalities.
But few people know that the filming of the video, which took place in Russia, did not go without problems and the singer Ladislav Bubnár himself had to be treated.
It was his first big shoot with the stars of the Russian national ballet and it didn’t go without a lot of embarrassment.
The song is very emotional and is based on the unhappy love of two lovers.
For the dramaticity of the scene, in the video clip, the singer's juice had to hint at a punch.
At one point, however, it hit him so hard and straight into the nose that the young singer had to be treated by doctors.
"It was morning, I didn't expect it, blood immediately came out of my nose," Ladislav commented on the situation.
Colleagues and producers on the pitch said that it was an unfortunate accident and Ladislav did not react in time.
Fortunately, the injury was not so serious as to affect the continuation of the next filming.
The aforementioned video clip of the young artist is now brought to you, you can also record the scene with the punch.
The unreleased version with blood, however, was not preferred to be used.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko talk at a meeting about the possibilities of a mutual duel
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, two boxers who could stage the most thrilling lightweight boxing match, met for the first time at a meeting on Tuesday.
Each was in a separate room at ESPN's Los Angeles offices until Garcia, the undefeated World Boxing Council lightweight champion, walked down to the hall to welcome Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization's featherweight champion.
Following Garcia’s unanimous victory against former four-time world champion Adrien Broner in Saturday’s Showtime match, both boxers made it to the list of the top five lightweight boxers.
Garcia pulled out his right hand and said, "How are you, champion?
Good luck with that."
Lomachenko defends his title against Miguel Marriaga at ESPN on Saturday at 19: 00.
The boxers pose for photographers and manager Lomachenka Egis Klimas adds that a potential boxer match would be a “perfect test”.
“I’m a former featherweight champion,” Garcia adds.
“Because of the match with Broner (67 kg) I had to grow up, but I’m not that big.
I'm small at 63 kg.
I would like to return to the lightweight category.
Lomachenko has to grow again to get a light weight... then we can fight.
That's what the fans want.
Why not do it to them."
Lomachenko agrees.
"Boxing would be good for this game."
Klimas has raised a request for payment for the viewing - which is part of his strategy. Lomachenko should make his debut in the lightweight at the end of this year and next year to compete with Garcio (37-0, 30 knockouts), who also expressed interest in the match of the duo vs the win.
“The match should be in the style of pay-per-view, that’s what fans are asking for,” said Garcia, who later commented that he was open to broadcasting the match via a TV station that would come with the best offer.
“We are the main attraction.
No one else will attract such attention to themselves.
We'll wait for the right opportunity..."
Garcia said he recognizes Lomachenko as an "awesome boxer" and could attend his match on Saturday.
However, Lomachenko did not dare to flatter Garcia when he said that the three-division champion from Riverside looked "very slow... sorry Mike, but you're talking about knockout."
Garcia said his goal was to show strength and only then box.
The two boxers said they were feeling rising tensions in front of each other.
“You won’t forget this game.
No other game attracts so much attention.
And I will gladly put it on the fire," Garcia said.
Lomachenko said, “I’ve been waiting for the best boxers and this is Mikey.”
It's going to be a great game."
The young couple disappeared without a trace 12 years ago.
Their car has now been found at the bottom of the Volga.
Two young Russians, Ilya <0xC5><0xBD>irnov and Kira <0xC4><0x8C>erkasov, have been missing since December 2005.
There was a long search for them, but without success.
The police eventually closed the investigation due to lack of evidence.
The families of the lost couple were living in an uncertainty that they would not know what had happened to the couple.
Twelve years later, the whole story came to a sad end.
The wreckage of their car was found by a lay divers at the bottom of the Volhy River in the town of Cheboksary in Chuvash.
It was only thanks to the documents left in the car that the police managed to identify a few.
The documents survived a decade underwater, without them, it would have taken the police much longer to find out the identities of the found.
The couple was last seen when <0xC5><0xBD>irnov borrowed a car from his father to pick up his girlfriend from work.
The diver who discovered the car remains anonymous.
He reported his findings to the Cheboksary police, who pulled the car to the beach the next day.
Investigators believe the young couple’s death was caused by an accident caused by a frozen road leading around the river.
However, the investigation is continuing and further details will be disclosed once it is completed.
Latest test results for determining the age limit of asylum applications in Sweden
The latest test results of asylum seekers in Sweden who were subjected to a new method of assessing their age show that over 80 percent of people were questioned as over the age of 18, but not everyone believes their accuracy.
The Swedish Forensic Medical Agency (R<0xC3><0x83><0xC2><0xA4>ttsmedicinalverket) began conducting new tests earlier this year.
The aim of the method is to more accurately assess applicants in the context of the assessment of asylum applications. The measure was taken after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticised for failing to determine the correct age of some refugees who lied about their age.
To date, the Swedish Migration Agency has submitted 6,880 cases for investigation and the Forensic Medical Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,481 tests conducted from mid-March to 31 July 2017.
80 percent (2002) were judged to be older than 18 years, while in another 25 cases the Forensic Medical Agency ruled that the respondent was "possibly older than 18 years".
In another 423 cases, it was decided that the respondent was “possibly under the age of 18”.
Tests shall be taken only if the age of the respondent is contested.
According to Johan G<0xC3><0x83><0xC2><0xB6>ransson of the Forensic Medical Agency, the results correspond to the previous month.
“Compared to last month, the statistics are kept in busy tracks and the numbers are very similar,” he told The Local.
The higher number of applicants whose age has been estimated to be over 18 does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers are lying about their age.
In May, the agency published the results of 581 tests and said that in 442 cases it was found that “the respondent is 18 years of age or older”.
The newspaper Svenska Dagbladet investigated 581 published cases and found that in 243 cases the respondent stated that he would be 18 this year.
The medical method of determining age, which includes wisdom teeth X-rays and MRI scans of the knee joints, has also been criticized, which are then assessed by dentists and radiologists.
One of the skeptics is Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, which, among other things, deals with assessing the biological maturity of humans to determine the age at which the person underwent puberty.
“I had reason to think about this issue and I don’t think these types of age-assessment measurements are right.
The assessment of biological age is, in a sense, very uncertain.
If we can’t determine the age with accuracy, we shouldn’t pretend otherwise,” he told Metro.
Forensic medical agency Agency's G<0xC3><0x83><0xC2><0xB6>ransson defended the decision by saying: "In general, the risk of misjudging a child as an adult is small.
The highest risk is the fact that the respondent is just under the age of 18, which in this case corresponds to 10 percent of all respondents."
Trump threatened the president of Mexico by phone.
In a January phone call to Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto, U.S. President Donald Trump threatened not to meet him if he publicly said his country would not pay to build a wall between the U.S. and Mexico.
Trump said in an interview that funding would somehow be arranged, even though he admitted that it would have to be secured from other sources.
Trump also spoke frankly to Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.
This is according to transcripts of interviews published Thursday by the Washington Post.
Trump has made building a wall on the southern border for Mexican money one of the main promises in his election campaign last year.
In his first interview with the Mexican president shortly after Trump took office, Peña Nieto reluctantly reprimanded him for criticizing his plan to build the wall.
He portrayed the southern neighbor as a growing political problem and pushed the Mexican president not to publicly say his government would never pay for the wall.
“You can’t say this to the press,” Trump repeatedly said in a January 27 interview, threatening to cut off contacts with the Mexican president if he continues to issue defiant statements.
The funding is going to come up somehow and eventually it will work out well.
“But if you say Mexico won’t pay for the wall, then I don’t want to talk to you guys anymore, because that’s unacceptable to me,” Trump said.
The wall is the least important thing we are talking about, but politically it is perhaps the most important.
Trump issued an executive order to build the wall shortly after taking power.
Mexico refuses to build and finance a 3,200-kilometre wall, which is why relations between the two countries have won.
At the end of March, Trump said the project would be paid for by the United States.
Trump finally met his Mexican counterpart for the first time at the July G20 summit in Hamburg.
The Washington Post also reported on Trump’s phone conversation with Australian Prime Minister Turnbull on January 28.
The White House chief called the conversation ridiculous.
This conclusion was prompted by an exchange of views on an agreement under which Australia would grant asylum to Central American refugees in exchange for the United States accepting persons from internment facilities in the Pacific island states.
Trump initially considered the deal stupid, but later agreed to it.
“You can certainly say this is not the deal you made, but you will have to stick to it,” Turnbull told Trump.
In some passages, the telephone conversation with Turnbull was almost humorous, for example, when Trump praised Australia’s refusal to accept refugees floating in boats as a good idea.
"You're worse than me," Trump joked.
Suddenly, however, the tone of the conversation sharpened.
“I hate accepting these people,” Trump said.
I assure you, they're bad.
That's why they're in jail now.
"They won't be great people going to work for local dairymen," he said.
In the interview, he also pointed out that the refugee could become a Boston bomber in five years.
Trump held telephone conversations with a number of world statesmen at the end of January, about a week after arriving at the White House, often several in one day.
Turnbull's conversation ended up being the least enjoyable of the day.
Before finishing, he pointed out that he had previously had a pleasant conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
They executed Rana's killer in front of the crowd.
Her father looked at her as well.
The execution took place in the capital of Yemen, Sanaa.
Muhammad al-Maghrabi chose Rana Almatari, who lived in his neighborhood, as his victim.
Al Maghrabi abducted the girl, took her to her father’s house, raped her, and strangled her with his bare hands.
He then raped her body and threw it near the mosque.
The violent death of a little girl has affected the entire country, which faces the threat of civil war.
Yahya Almatari stood in the front row of a thousand-strong crowd who gathered to witness the execution.
Muhammad al-Maghrabi was convicted under Sharia law.
The victim's father told the media about his feelings after the execution.
I feel like I'm being reborn.
I'm relieved.
It's a new day in my life.
The other members of the family were also present, shouting together with the crowd the slogan "Long live justice".
The rapist was brought to the square by a police van from which he was pulled out.
Officers tied him to his stomach.
One of the men turned his gun against him and fired fire from the immediate vicinity.
The crowd was celebrating every wound that had been burned.
Mr. al Almatari told MailOnline that justice was carried out in accordance with the country’s legal system.
"Justice, Allah and the law of Sharia have prevailed," he added.
I was standing on the Liberation Square in Sana'a waiting for the execution of my daughter's killer.
Then my family and I went to the morgue.
We took Rana's little body and buried it in a nearby cemetery.
My wife, Jamileh, and I are grateful that justice has been done.
The police feared that the crowd gathered in the square would succumb to hateful madness, catching the killer and lynching him.
The execution was ordered by a court governed by the Shiite Houthis.
Originally, however, Maghrabi was sentenced to 100 lashes with a whip shortly after his arrest, but his act provoked such outrage that the judge decided to sentence him to death.
Al Maghrabi was arrested two days after the girl’s disappearance on June 27.
Rana's family knew him well.
When police searched the basement of his house, they found evidence that the man was planning his act.
Mr. Almatari described him as a monster.
What could have been his motive?
Even the animal would be more merciful to the wound.
"Our family has no enemies, and the injuries that were carrying Rana's body were terrible," he told reporters.
"The wound disappeared in the afternoon, we reported it to the police that day, we told the newspapers and all our TV stations, posters with her photo were hanging everywhere," he continued.
Everyone believes that the police got a tip from the murderer's parents, who suspected their son of a terrible act.
The girl’s mother, Jamileh, had to be hospitalized after learning that her daughter’s body had been found.
In the morning, she went out to play with the other kids in the neighborhood.
After 10-15 minutes I went out to see where he was.
We looked everywhere, but Rana was gone.
We walked around our block, our friends took cars and drove around the area, but we searched in vain.
The people of Yemen were disgusted by the crime and began to gather in front of the police station where al-Maghrabi was detained, demanding an immediate punishment.
A Justice Department deputy read a record of the investigation to the crowd to reassure them.
Apparently, the accused did not show any remorse for his actions.
Shortly before his sentence, the police read him the verdict, but the convicted man only stared at his executioner.
The whole event was filmed for national television, but there were many recordings on the internet that were made by the crowd.
Governor of West Virginia Announces Political Party Change
West Virginia Democratic Governor Jim Justice announced at a meeting of President Trump on Thursday night that he is moving to another party.
"Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have turned their backs on me," Justice said.
“Today, after long prayers and reflections, I am announcing to you, as a West Virginian, that I can no longer support you as a democratic governor.”
The crowd of spectators exploded in joy.
“Tomorrow I’ll go to the Republicans,” Justice added.
"As a coach, I can tell you it's time to jump into another game."
Trump has previously promised people at a meeting in West Virginia an important announcement.
Trump won West Virginia with 42 points and Justice did not support Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, the only billionaire in the country according to Forbes magazine, was elected in 2016.
Forbes adds that Justice inherited a large estate from his father and is the owner of several coal mines.
The value of his property is estimated at $1.59 billion.
The Republican National Committee, meanwhile, issued a statement Thursday night stating: “The passing of the Governor of Justice is another wound to the Democratic Party, which is putting obstacles in our way, rather than causing our country to rise.”
“For a Democratic party that has only 15 governors and controls the least lawmakers in history, the announcement by the Governor of Justice is the last drop for the already depleted party without a leader who is vainly striving to find positive and unifying news,” said Ronna McD.
Sebastian Coe praises Russia's "sincere" apology for doping scandal
Former top athlete Sebastian Coe praised Russia on Thursday for a sincere apology for the doping scandal, but reiterated that it was not yet the right time for Russia to return to the sporting world.
Russian athletics chief Dmitry Shylakhtin said on the occasion of the IAAF congress - which took place on the eve of the World Championships in Athletics - that the expulsion of his country from the world of sport was correct and that he is determined to fight doping.
He apologised to “all the athletes who lost gold and silver medals in this way.”
Despite his comments, members of the IAAF Congress voted in favour of maintaining a ban that came into effect in November 2015 after a World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report revealed that Russia was supporting doping of its athletes.
“I think today we witnessed a very honest response and presentation,” IAAF President Sebastian Coe told reporters.
“All members of the council and congress were pleasantly surprised that Russia has admitted its mistake and is working hard to correct and restore the proper functioning of the entire federation.”
Coe said he was also “delighted” that Russia had accepted the criteria for its reintroduction.
“I think today has been a very successful day and we have moved on to the next level, but Congress supports the crisis staff’s recommendation to preserve the sentence that was imposed on Russia,” Coe said.
“In the coming months, we need to do everything we can to stabilize the situation.
“Our goal has always been to separate honest athletes from dishonest ones,” he said.
At the World Athletics Championships, which starts on Friday in London, 19 Russian athletes will compete under a neutral flag who have complied with the strict rules of the IAAF.
IAAF chief of staff Rune Andersen said on Monday that Russia still had to meet several criteria before it could be admitted back.
Tests for the presence of drugs are still inadequate and exclusion coaches continue to operate, he told reporters in London after the IAAF board's presentation.
CzechTrade was awarded by Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ka Savova, whose state is prosecuting.
The public procurement of the state-owned pro-export agency CzechTrade was obtained by the publishing house Mladá fronta Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek Savov.
Officials awarded him one hundred percent points in all qualitative criteria.
They did not mind that the Czech state is prosecuting Savov for tax fraud and requesting his extradition to the Czech Republic.
CzechTrade, a pro-export agency of the Ministry of Industry and Trade, issued a four-year public contract for the provision of editorial content for the BusinessInfo portal in April.
The order of a total value of 30.8 million crowns was awarded to the publishing house Mladá Fronta by the entrepreneur Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek Savov.
The Czech police accused him of tax evasion in 2014 and are pursuing him on the run.
Savov has fled to the UK and the Czech Republic is requesting his extradition.
The case was pointed out by the server Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz.
According to the original criteria, CzechTrade was to decide on the award of the contract from 60 percent of the price offered and from the remaining 40 beauty competitions, i.e. the quality of the project.
The second criterion was of great help to Savov’s company.
According to the information, Totyk.cz received one hundred points in all sub-quality criteria.
It was this that moved her to another candidate, Vltava Labe Media VLM, who offered a better price.
While Mladá Fronta operated with an amount of 404,900 kronor per month, VLM offered 324,350 kronor.
Unlike Mladé Fronty, however, it received an under-average score of 62 points from reviewers in all qualitative criteria.
The tender was also attended by the consulting firm BDO Advisory and the digital agency R-Media, which as well as the server Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz under the publishing house Economia.
VLM has raised several objections to the tender result, which it considers to be unfair and insufficiently justified.
After their rejection, it was decided to challenge the competition with the Office for the Protection of Competition of the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS.
He believes that CzechTrade has acted in contravention of the law.
"The tenderer is convinced that the contracting authority has reached a decision on the selection of the contractor on the basis of a purely subjective assessment, which clearly favours the participant Mladá fronta, a.s., at the expense of the tenderer and other suppliers," reads in the proposal for the initiation of the procedure submitted to the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS server.
According to the Director General and Chairman of the Board of Directors of VLM Michal Klima, the scoring of the selection committee seems unreliable and the 100% evaluation of the Young Front project among all its members is extremely suspicious.
"Any independent observer must consider such a miraculous achievement of one of the competitors as unlikely and suspicious," he said.
CzechTrade has not yet commented on the situation.
In principle, CzechTrade does not comment on public contracts before they are concluded.
All information about the contract mentioned by you is published in accordance with the law in the Contracting Authority Profile and in the Public Procurement Gazette.
"After the end of the contract, a full written report will be published, but during the duration of the contract, we cannot comment on its course," <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>pán Dlouh<0xC3><0xBD>, the agency's media representative, told Dotyk.cz.
The Young Front reacted with a statement, according to which it considers it extremely problematic that the publishing house Economia has interfered with the competition with an article in Aktualná.cz, where it has its own business interests.
However, this fact was mentioned in the aforementioned article.
The fact that she has been providing editorial services to the BusinessInfo portal in the previous four years may have helped her in the tender.
The contract was first awarded in 2013, when the Ministry of Industry and Trade was headed by Martim Cuba ODS.
Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ka Savova blames the police for tax evasion in connection with excessive deductions of VAT for his companies, which caused the Czech state an alleged damage of up to 770 million crowns.
The Czech Republic has been asking the UK to issue it since 2014.
According to Savov, his criminalization is the head of the ANO movement Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1>, under whose influence Mafra publishing house falls.
A London court last year rejected Savov’s appeal against the extradition, but the businessman appealed.
"From our point of view, the case has not moved anywhere since last year, we have not received any understanding from the United Kingdom in the matter of acquiring the legal power of the verdict to date," spokeswoman for the Prague City Prosecutor's Office <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>pánka Zenklová told Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz.
In addition to the ownership of Mladá Fronta, Savov was a member of the Cyprus-based Harvestor Limited, which controlled the Czech-Buddhist brewery Samson, and of the Cyprus-based Maraflex, which profiles itself as an investment fund, purchasing endangered assets.
It will also control the bankrupt company Heavy Machinery Services, formerly Legios, which owes more than three billion crowns.
In the past, Savov was also associated with the withdrawal of property from the former Socialist Youth Union.
The motorcyclist drove along the sidewalks and the park, ending up in the cockpits.
The motorcyclist drew attention to himself by ruthlessly driving through the streets, sidewalks and park paths in <0xC3><0x9A><0xC5><0xA1>ovice.
When the patrol started chasing him, he decided to run in the direction of the Station.
"Policemen were chasing the city with great caution when he failed to drive on one of the side roads behind the Mariánské Lázn<0xC4><0x9B> and entered the field where he crashed with a motorcycle," police spokesman Daniel Dvo<0xC5><0x99>ák said.
Eventually, a rescue helicopter flew in, transporting the injured motorcyclist to the Pilsen hospital.
Later, police found out that the motorcyclist did not own a driver's license, registration plates on the motorcycle were stolen, his production number was erased and the production label itself was removed.
It is possible that the machine was stolen.
The origin of the motorcycle is the subject of further investigation.
"A breath test was performed on the spot to rule out the presence of alcohol in the driver, but the test found a positive result on the substance methamphetamine," the police spokesman added.
How Football’s Financial Rules Will Affect Neymar’s Move to Paris
The rules restricting the financing of European football clubs do not in any way disrupt Neymar’s record move from Spanish Barcelona to French Paris-Saint Germain.
Any penalties for Paris Saint-Germain will be implemented by the EUFA, which oversees European football teams and has the power to ban teams from participating in the prestigious Champions League.
The Financial Fair Play (FFP) rules introduced by UEFA in 2011 stipulate that PSG will have to prove that Neymar's move was not funded without major losses.
Barcelona paid <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>222 million just to buy Neymar from his contract and Neymar will demand a salary of several tens of millions of dollars a year.
Neymar's move to France is followed by several financial conditions.
Given that PSG is funded by a wealthy Qatari family that has become rich in energy sales, he can afford to bring Neymar into the already star-studded football family.
Clubs can spend huge amounts on buying players, but on the other hand, they must prove legal sources of income, allowing them to cover the overhead of business activities related to football.
The FFP was introduced by Michel Platini after he took over as UEFA Director in 2007.
The former French player believed that clubs that are indebted in the pursuit of new reinforcements would ultimately be cheated and risk bankruptcy if banks or owners refused to secure them.
In 2011, FFP’s rules shifted its attention from club debt to monitoring their losses.
This change meant that the business model used by Roman Abramovich with Chelsea in 2003 - to buy a club with potential and spend mounting sums for players y to build a global brand - was suddenly not so advantageous.
As part of the current three-year trial period ending in 2018, clubs can report a loss of up to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>30 million.
And despite Platini having to leave his post in 2015, his successor Alexander <0xC4><0x8C>eferin is determined to defend the prohibition of excessive spending.
“The FFP rules are still in place and we are determined to strengthen them in the future,” Andrea Traverso, who oversees FFP rules, told the Associated Press last week.
Although PSG has paid the amount for the redemption of Neymar in a one-off payment, it may, for accounting purposes, split the amount over the entire duration of the contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so the transfer can be written to 44.4 million euros annually for five years.
The first wave of FFP sanctions hit PSG in 2014 along with Manchester City, which is owned by Abu Dhabi.
PSG has lifted a fine of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>60 million ($82 million) – which was later reduced to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>20 million – and the order to reduce the Champions League team to 21 players in the 2014-2015 season, instead of 25 players.
UEFA is wary of teams that can try to circumvent financial regulators by increasing their revenues through companies affiliated with club owners.
Thus, although the Qatari company sponsors PSG, once the funding exceeds the standard market rate, UEFA has the right to prohibit the billing of the amount.
The same measure was adopted by UEFA in 2014 after deciding that the amount of funding provided by the Qatar Tourism Authority to PSG was too high.
Neymar's share of PSG's earnings could, according to some reports, be reimbursed by the 2022 FIFA World Cup organizing committee in Qatar.
However, PSG and the representatives of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar denied the fate that Neymat should become the ambassador of the World Cup in football and that such a maneuver would easily be revealed by the officials of the UEFA.
The previous sanctions imposed on PSG mean that UEFA will closely monitor any attempt to circumvent the rules.
On Tuesday, UEFA said it had not initiated any investigation into Neymar's transfer to PSG.
The source of the report wished to remain anonymous as he was not entitled to comment on the situation with PSG, The Associated Press said.
The most recent published financial statements show that PSG closed 2015-2016 with a net profit of EUR 10 million and a turnover of EUR 542.4 million.
The financial statements for the current financial year have not yet been published.
PSG expects the arrival of Neymar to be a huge opportunity for sponsors, merchandising and sales of jerseys.
The club promises to increase its turnover by up to 30 percent from the signing of the contract.
Spanish league officials, apparently worried about the departure of one of the biggest stars, sought to frustrate Neymar’s departure, arguing that PSG would violate FFP rules.
"This is a clear case of 'financial doping' of the club and the state," La Liga president Javier Teba told the Spanish newspaper AS, referring to the ownership of PSG by the Qatari syndicate.
Arsene Wenger, Arsenal manager, whose club is owned by an American sports tycoon, shares the same La Liga stance on funding the club.
"It's a consequence of ownership that has fundamentally changed the football world over the last 15 years," Wenger said.
“Once you become the owner of the club, anything is possible.
Complying with the rules of financial fair play is very difficult because the state may have different interests in the participation of such players in its club."
Spartan defender Rosick<0xC3><0xBD>: Changes are painful, but we have to believe.
Sixteen thousand applauding fans on their feet.
Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Rosick<0xC3><0xBD> goes to the square.
Same scene as in Sunday's game against the Bohemians.
The Spartan defender moved the game against the Red Star, invented several goals, but his team-mates did not turn black.
The flight team, pumped up with new multimillion-dollar reinforcements, ends after the opening match in the European Cups.
Was it difficult to do anything more with the match after the goal of Belgrade?
After the goal was scored, it took four shots, which was difficult for us.
At least we didn’t want to lose, to raise our confidence so we had to bounce back in the next games.
We had some chances.
We have to work together as a team and move our game forward.
Why didn't Sparta get into the game for so long?
The game is terribly elaborate.
The combination of the rivals was much better than ours.
We didn't get anything, we shot it once in a while.
Of course, that’s very little when you have to win by two or three goals.
The second half was much better, in the final third we managed to play with them.
But you have to push the opponent more often into such positions.
Is the problem a large number of changes in the compilation?
Of course, it is one of the pains when a new team is formed.
We’ve only played three games and the team is constantly changing.
The goal is for the coach to find the ideal eleven to sit on.
Is it encouraging to you that you have already played parts of two games in a row?
They're still just part of the game.
I don’t know how my condition will develop and when I could finally play from the beginning.
Are you still optimistic about the changes that have taken place in Sparta?
We have to be, or we can't.
It's the same as an injury.
If you don't believe, you can't go back.
Sparta has made a decision, we have to be optimistic, otherwise the situation will be even worse.
The fans came in large numbers, but they left in dismay.
What can you tell them?
There was a wonderful visit here again, just like with Bohemian.
I'm terribly sorry we can't make their joy a better performance.
Show something they'll come for next time.
We can thank them for arriving.
I don't remember that kind of visit when I played here 15 years ago.
Can a season without cups at least be an advantage for the league?
So far, we're fighting each other, playing each other, so that's not such an advantage for us.
For extreme tax evasion, an entrepreneur is required to settle for ten years.
The Constitutional Court rejected the complaint of businessman Ji<0xC5><0x99>í Toman, who is expected to serve ten years in prison for reducing taxes to a considerable extent.
The estimated damage is 645 million crowns.
Toman claimed in the complaint that justice violated his fundamental rights, the factual findings of the courts in Zlín and Olomouc are said to be incomplete.
However, constitutional judges called the complaint unfounded, the <0xC4><0x8C>TK found out from the court’s database.
The U.S. is not another appeals court.
"It cannot assess as a fourth instance the factual or legal errors allegedly committed by the general courts, unless they constitute a violation of constitutionally protected rights and freedoms," the resolution states.
Toman was tried as a fugitive.
The verdict has been in force since November 2015, when it was confirmed by the Supreme Court in Olomouc.
At that time Toman was in extradition custody in Argentina, where, according to the resolution, he was also at the time of decision-making.
The penalty imposed is at the upper limit of the legal rate, which according to the verdict corresponds to the resulting damage.
The Supreme Court called the case an extreme tax evasion, which has a macroeconomic impact on the state budget.
He served as Chairman of the Board of Directors of World Servis from 2005 to 2008.
The damage of 645 million kronor occurred between January and July 2008, with the total leak exceeding one billion according to the expert.
However, for procedural reasons, it was no longer possible to judge Toman for the full amount.
According to the prosecution, World Servis did not include all invoices in its tax returns.
Instead of monthly VAT and excise duties in the order of at least tens of millions of crowns, taxes were paid in the order of only hundreds of thousands.
World Servis and some of the companies with which the company traded have a relationship with the businessman Radomir Vybíral, whom the justice has charged with VAT machining at fuel stores for 13 years in prison.
His complaint was also dismissed by the Constitutional Court.
The series "Summer to Not Survive" and "Comrade Detective" play on a nostalgic string
This iteration of the story is nostalgic for both the characters from the famous 80s; the dirty 90s (when the geniuses David Wain and Michael Showalter released the MTV comedy sketch "The State"); and of course also for the modern era, namely 2001, before stars like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Rozddler were projected to be bigger.
As a cultural artifact, it is a light parody and at the same time the embodiment of our modern Facebook era of permanent memories.
From the point of view of the franchise, however, it seems that someone is breathing.
The series “First Day of Camp” worked surprisingly well – not just because of the absurd humor (for example, the story of the emergence of a talking can of vegetables, spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).
The authors diverted from the main funny points - middle-aged actors playing horny teenage children - and couldn't make fun of previous events.
The sequel to “Ten Years Later,” in which adults play, doesn’t put much pressure on the emotional level and satire is sometimes even sporadic, including a parody of 1990s thrillers such as “The Hand on the Cradle.”
At one point, the character finds on a pile of heaps of Apple Powerbooks, roller skates, and “a plethora of other things from 1991.”
Many of the main storylines are repeated.
Good-natured Coop (Mr. Showalter), now a writer, still hasn't moved through his love for Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) is still a virgin.
Not to mention a crazy plot that involves Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter), inspired by George H. W. Bush (very well-occupied Michael Ian Black).
As always, the best part of the franchise are many side stories.
Particularly fun is to watch the eternally young Rudd with long hair alias the character of Matt Dillon from the film Youth, whose once respectable character Andy is now behind the old paprika.
The franchise could be triggered by moments of random madness, such as the return of the series "Seven Up", until it reaches what I assume will be a logical breakthrough: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," when in the last scene the entire group will premiere "Summer to Never See".
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon, meanwhile, appeals to a different type of nostalgia: the Cold War revivalism of the series "So Normal Americans", the movie "Atomic Blonde: Without Mercy" and even the series "GLOW", in which the icons of the Eastern and Western wrestling scenes collide.
The comedy by Brian Gatewood and Alessandr Tanak, directed by Rhys Thomas, is set to act as a television staging: a drama about two Bucharest police officers from Romania in the 1980s who fight for truth and atheism in the manner of Marxism-Leninism.
The main roles - the stubborn Gregor and the idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulica, who have awarded English to Channing Tatum (executive producer of the series) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's an amazing idea.
Unfortunately, it is not much more.
Some jokes make you laugh (such as police watching chess on TV - parody of American football).
The series was voiced by many famous actors, including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chlo<0xC3><0xAB> Sevigny.
But "Comrade Detective" focuses too much on the clumsy propaganda drama - which includes the Reagan masked killer - and accordingly, it also looks.
Six long episodes are too boring and comedic moments are not enough.
In the shorter run, the propaganda satire in "Comrade Detective" might work, like in a scene where Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the U.S. Embassy, in whose hall two fat guys swallow burgers stacked on a large pile.
A clear message to the imaginary communist audience is the fact that Western culture can turn everything into a bite and an orgy.
The Romanian creators were not wrong: we do so with our own culture, as well as with theirs.
Russian athletes did not wait for the IAAF to lift the ban on starts.
The International Athletic Federation (IAAF) confirmed at a congress in London the extension of the international ban on the start of Russian racers due to the state-supported doping program.
The vote in the history of the World Championship, which starts on Friday, was expected to be very clear.
166 delegates voted to extend the ban, with only 21 votes against.
The main reason for the rejection is primarily the fact that Russia is not able to meet all the requirements for the introduction of the anti-doping system, as stated before the congress by the head of the IAAF special investigation group Rune Andersen.
His group recommended that the ban continue.
Some older doping cases remain unresolved, a number of suspected athletes have not yet been heard and coaches with a disgraced reputation are still working in the country.
The Russian anti-doping agency RUSADA, which does not meet the standards of the World Anti-Doping Agency, is not fully operational yet.
However, RUSADA can already conduct testing under the supervision of foreign experts and the British Anti-Doping Agency.
“Even though progress has been made, there is still a lot of work to be done,” IAAF President Sebastian Coe said.
The Russian athletics federation was suspended in November 2015, and Russian athletes lost last year’s Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.
Despite the ban on the upcoming World Cup, 19 Russians will participate, who have previously demonstrated that they have been tested for a long time outside the Russian anti-doping system.
However, they will not be able to start the championship in national colors and, if they win, they will not be able to play the Russian anthem.
Bank of England to raise interest rate to 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce that the interest rate will remain unchanged, following insignificant economic growth and weakening inflation, which has stifled speculation about sharp growth.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will continue to remain “backward” in the context of maintaining interest rates – despite squeezing family budgets.
The Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted six to two in favour of maintaining an interest rate of 0.25%. The results of the vote in favour of an interest rate increase supported insignificant economic growth backed by weak growth.
In its annual inflation report, the bank forecast growth to 1.7% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018, warning that the reduction in family budgets would continue. The bank expects inflation to rise to 3% in the fall.
At the same time, the bank suggested that there should be growth over the next few years due to inflation caused by Brexit, and also said that mobile rentals in the financial markets should rise more than expected.
Members of the committee also voted to withdraw part of the mammoth package, which was designed to support the economy and which was put into practice a year ago in response to Brexit.
As a result of the above, the Fixed Financing Plan, which will offer cheap subsidies to banks, should come into effect from next February, although the Bank of England has stated that it will now offer <0xC2><0xA3>15 billion less than the planned <0xC2><0xA3>115 billion.
Shortly before the decision, the bank said: “The MPC predicts that gross domestic product (GDP) will stagnate in the short term, along with pressure on real household income and the burden on consumption.”
On the issue of interest rates, the bank said it would need to “pull the belts of monetary policy” to calm inflation, “to a greater extent” than markets expect.
Markets are currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and a further increase in 2020.
However, the bank stressed that any increase would be “slow” and “limited”.
The Bank has lowered its growth forecast for this year and next year compared to 1.9% and 1.7% forecast in May.
The projected growth of 1.8% in 2018 remained unchanged.
After the publication of estimates, the pound fell against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell by 0.5% to $1.31 and by 0.4% to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.11.
The decision to maintain the current state came after the disappointing increase buried hopes for further growth - GDP stopped at 0.3% in the second quarter from 0.2% in the previous three months.
The increase is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although it is expected to increase slightly by the end of the year, according to the bank.
The latest inflation report is a slight consolation for households affected by rising inflation and miserable wage hikes. The bank said the situation would worsen before the hike.
The report further states that monetary policy "cannot prevent" income declines in the coming years, but wages are expected to rise "significantly" towards the end of the three-year forecast.
The economy is also expected to grow due to a strong interest in British goods due to a weak pound, which offsets a lower percentage of consumer spending.
This decision came a year after rates were cut to 0.025 per cent in August last year in response to the shocking vote on the EU referendum, causing the pound to fall.
The Bank estimates that full unification of prices and the economy will take at least four years.
Prior to the bank’s decision on the latest rates, many called for an increase in rates along with rising inflation, which was exerting increasing pressure on households. Three political figures called for an increase to 0.5% in June.
Inflation fell back to 2.6% last month from June’s 2.9%, even though the bank said it expected such a change and expected inflation to rise again in the coming month.
The Bank stated that the exceedance of the 2% target was ‘completely’ due to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, CEO of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: “Given the recent drop in swap rates, it seems that competition in the mortgage market will only rise once creditors start competing for contracts with a good outlook for the end of the year.
The market looks particularly good for those who end up with existing contracts and re-hypotheques – there are free options on offer, as well as low rates that they gain in popularity.”
NHS to Prescribe Controversial HIV Drug to 10,000 Patients
Patients will gain access to ‘transformative’ HIV prevention treatment starting in September following the Supreme Court’s decision on funding the NHS drug.
The National Health Service (NSH) has announced that a pre-exposure prophylaxis pill (PrEP), which is taken before sex and reduces the risk of infection in high-risk patients by up to 86 percent, will be offered through a health service to approximately 10,000 patients as part of a three-year trial.
NSH agreed to fund the probation period after the appeals court backed last year’s Supreme Court ruling, stating that the NHS has the funds to pay for PrEP despite a statement that the drug should be funded by local authorities.
The decision, which was announced on Thursday, was accepted by NHS England from the mouth of CEO Simon Stevens as a “significant intervention,” while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described the decision as a “decisive moment.”
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to start accepting patients. Further clinics will join in October and will be fully implemented across England by April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an HIV medicine given before sex to reduce the risk of HIV disease.
Tests have shown that PrEP significantly reduces the risk of HIV transmission between at-risk patients.
The application of PrEP before sex means that there is a sufficient amount of specific drugs in the patient's body to prevent infection.
These medications can be taken every day or at least two hours before sex.
Patients tested include gay or bisexual men, transgender people, and people with HIV-positive partners who are not being treated successfully.
The clinics will identify eligible participants who sign consent to participate in the testing, including men, women, transgender people and individuals with a partner whose HIV status has not yet been controlled by the appropriate treatment.
People living and registered with the GP in the UK can also apply at their local sexual health clinic and apply for potential participation in testing.
The program will come to taxpayers at <0xC2><0xA3>10 million and NHS England signed a drug distribution contract this week after obtaining an international public procurement.
The trial period is designed to gather clinical evidence and assess the full potential of PrEP, its targeting, use and implementation on a large scale.
Simon Stevens added: ‘This important intervention should complement and fully leverage the ever-expanding and increasingly successful HIV prevention effort.
It’s another milestone in more than 30 years of trying to stop one of the biggest challenges to human health.”
Deborah Gold, executive director of the National Aids Trust (NAT), said: “We are witnessing a decisive moment in the fight against HIV.
If PrEP is administered correctly and patients at risk, it will offer the possibility of transforming the English HIV epidemic.
Since September, NSH will offer patients at high risk of HIV infection a powerful new tool that is individually controlled and not subject to the need to persuade a partner, which will lead to the improvement of the quality of many lives.
We welcome this statement with pleasure.'
Ian Green, CEO of Terrence Higgins Trust, said: ‘Priority number one must be the rapid deployment of tests across the country; we must ensure that it is available to every patient.
We now have a trial PrEP drug at our disposal and are well on our way to protecting more than 10,000 people at risk of HIV infection.”
Shadow Health Minister Sharon Hodgson said: “The beginning of the PrEP trial period is a welcome and long-awaited change after months of delays and delays by the government.
Evidence suggests how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to preventing HIV and ending transmission of this life-threatening infection.
Subsequent tests will lead us one step closer to a full understanding of the benefits of PrEP.
“It is now important that we start testing as soon as possible across the country to protect people who are exposed to HIV and together to stop the spread of HIV in society.”
Life on high feet: mezzanine and clever design turned this small apartment into Earls Court into a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, exchanged a large house in Knightsbridge for an apartment at Earls Cour in 2014.
Located on the first floor of the smart Queen Anne terrace - it is an eye-catching demonstration of modern design that makes the most of the available space.
“I used to live with my ex-husband in a much larger house in Knightsbridge,” Joanne said.
“I was looking for something for a more reasonable price.
I stumbled upon this apartment in Earls Court and had the same ceiling height.
I immediately fell in love with him, and that same day I nodded at him."
Since then, an apartment of 1000 square meters has undergone a complete renovation.
One-room apartment with a complicated layout - in order to get into the bedroom, you had to go through the kitchen - Joanne wanted to add storage space and mezzanine to take advantage of the high ceiling.
“I longed for a high ceiling, large windows and a lot of light.
Those were my demands," she said.
For this purpose, she hired Erfan Azadi from the design and design studio Duck & Shed, based in Notting Hill, and used a nearly four-meter ceiling to create a home that was not just a project but also a place to live.
The ceiling was not so high as to fill two gaps - the challenge for architects was to create a mezzanine that could be walked upright.
Erfan had to engage his creative thinking.
"The steel structure is quite complicated," he explained.
“We had to arrange both spaces so that we could walk upright.
It was not just about building a simple platform, but at the same time bending the steel structure so that at the right height above and below the ceiling."
This arrangement allowed Erfan to construct two full-fledged rooms on himself - and at the same time add to the dramaticity.
The mezzanine overlooks the beautiful living room with old copper window frames in Retrouvius design.
Mirror furniture in gold color, silver lines and retro chandelier Serge Mouille creates a unique style.
The use of mirrors plays an important role in drama, space and lighting.
The short hallway is equipped with mirrors on both sides and thus looks longer.
The mirror bar in the kitchen looks like a window to the next room.
At the front door there are storage rooms equipped with mirrors for storing utensils and glasses.
The advantage of the living room, which gives the whole apartment the impression of a significantly larger space, is the ability to separate it from the kitchen, if not used.
Folding kitchens are nothing new.
What is unique about this solution, however, is the tilting door.
“We had to solve the technical side,” Erfan says of the reinforced veneered doors.
"The door is equipped with counterweights to cover it very easily."
Thanks to the smart use of space and storage space, Joanne gained another 16 square meters, a second room and a better overall layout of the apartment.
"When it comes down to it, what you're selling is the living space - or the valuation of your property," Erfan said.
“A real estate broker basically calculates its price on the basis of the living area when entering the apartment.”
In this case, it was possible to increase the living area while preserving quality materials, which give the space a luxurious look.
“The material is very important because you touch it and create an emotional bond with the home,” Erfan added.
“You don’t like electricity in the walls.
Yes, they are important, but your heart won’t win.”
As it turned out, quality design and enhancement of living space can turn an ordinary apartment into an exceptional work.
And like Joanne, you may eventually decide to stay.
The United States is breaking up.
The cultural and political gap between the blue and red states is deepening.
California has banned its citizens from traveling to Tennessee and seven other states.
The state of Tennessee paid her back and declared a retaliatory ban on the travel of its citizens to California.
Of course, this is not a ban in the full sense of the word, U.S. citizens can travel freely across all fifty states.
California has banned spending state money on travel to eight other states, including Alabama, South Dakota, Kansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, Tennessee and Texas.
Who will stop this madness?
California is strongly for LGBT and considers any expression of disagreement with LGBT lifestyle to be discrimination.
Tennessee, however, has passed a conscientious objection law that states that a psychotherapist who has a moral problem with the therapy of LGBT patients is not obliged to provide them with it, but is obliged to provide these patients with another therapist who does not have such a problem.
Texas and other states have passed laws that state-owned religious charities that have adopted children from mothers after birth do not have an obligation to provide adoptions to same-sex couples.
Because of these conscientious objection laws, California has banned funding the travel of its citizens to eight states of the Union from its own resources.
In practice, this means that California professors are not allowed to have trips to scientific symposiums paid off from their universities in Texas, for example, because they are co-financed by the state of California.
Similarly, school sports teams cannot travel to tournaments or competitions, for example, to Tennessee with the financial support of their schools.
They must obtain federal grants for their travels, but it is absurd for the federal government to fund the travels of citizens from state A to state B, or private sponsorship.
The state of Tennessee has run out of patience and its parliament passed a law with a resolution that it also dislikes California's policy of high taxes, high state spending, high deficits and tolerance for illegal immigrants, but still does not impose a travel embargo on California for that reason.
He's imposing them in retaliation for the California travel embargo on Tennessee.
The same shall apply to any State of the Union which, for whatever reason, imposes a similar travel ban on another State.
At the same time, he called on the parliaments of all states to stop this madness.
That's the fact, now the comment.
The situation is toxic.
First of all, all of this is constitutional, nothing is unconstitutional.
States have the right to adopt laws on the reservation of conscience, as well as to decide what their money will go to and what they may not.
Secondly, what is wrong with the conscience?
If a butcher has a religious problem selling pork, why can’t he just offer beef, lamb, poultry and fish?
Why force him to sell pigs under penalty of perjury when there are enough butchers offering pigs?
In Colorado, one baker faces anti-discrimination lawsuits and a high fine for refusing to bake a cake for a gay wedding.
But he also refuses to bake cakes for Halloween or containing alcohol.
Why not punish him and leave him alone and order the cakes with hundreds of other bakers?
Third, the beauty of the federation system is that the constitutional rights of all federation citizens are guaranteed, but individual states can adjust domestic policy in powers that are not federal, according to their own preferences, i.e., according to the preferences of their citizens.
Then there is diversity, diversity, diversity.
California may be California and Texas may be Texas.
But California wants California to be California and Texas and seven other states to be California!
Fourth, members of the LGBT community once legitimately pursued tolerance for their lifestyles.
Today, many members of this community follow the rule of living and letting live, which should be followed by all reasonable people, but some activists strive not for tolerance towards themselves and others, but for extreme intolerance towards others.
According to them, no one should ever again express moral, religious or philosophical disapproval of the LGBT lifestyle, and if they do, they should be criminalized.
The mentality of these activists is totalitarian.
They are the modern enemies of freedom.
Fifthly, I do not know the situation in American history where states have done so on political grounds, except in one case.
Even in the era of the civil rights struggle for blacks, where the North and the West were on the integration side and the South on the segregation side, states did not impose sanctions on each other.
The only instance of this was the 1950s, the political cause was slavery, and a war of the North against the South.
Of course, nothing like this will happen now, but the situation is still toxic.
The cultural and political gap between the Blue Democratic and Red Republican states is deepening, and the United States is mentally disconnected.
Unauthorized agitation.
Putin's criticism received a heavy fine.
Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny received a fine of 300,000 rubles for violating the rules of the campaign ahead of the presidential election, which will take place next year.
He was fined by the court for inviting people to take part in unauthorized demonstrations.
Navalny has organized two major anti-government street protests in the last two months and announced that he wants to apply for the post of head of state in March next year.
Kremlin chief Vladimir Putin has not yet announced his candidacy, but he is generally expected to do so and win again.
Navalny said the police came to his house in the morning and took him to court.
He was fined for inciting people to take part in demonstrations through videos posted on YouTube.
The fine is three hundred thousand.
"We'll take them out of the judge's payroll later," Kremlin critics joked on Twitter.
The Russian election commission recently concluded that Navalny could not participate in the presidential election because he had previously been convicted of treason.
However, Navalny, who is considered a fighter against corruption, considers the verdict to be politically motivated.
Fines in the amount of 300,000 rubles, followed by 25,000 rubles, were also imposed on two members of the Naval Pre-election team, Leonid Volkov and Nikolai Lyaskin.
Navalny entered Russian politics as an anti-corruption blogger and gradually became a dominant figure on the fragmented opposition scene.
The authorities are trying to prevent Navalny from campaigning.
In February, he was sentenced to five years on parole for stealing the Kirovles forestry company.
The verdict was confirmed by the Court of Appeal in May.
The verdict is so valid, which prevents Navalny from running under Russian law.
Brothers fight for empire worth more than $500 million
Two brothers now, more than four decades after the founding of the empire by their Italian family, are dragging one of the most expensive Victorian properties worth more than $500 million.
Former Carlton Football Club director and developer Colin De Lutis resides at Toorak Manor, only three rooms from his younger brother Paul, who brought the dispute over joint property and commercial property to the Supreme Court.
Paul wanted to leave the family business as early as 2014, but the sharp dispute is constantly being swept up before the Supreme Court.
Together with his mother Anna, his brothers own a total of 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars. The first store was bought by the family in 1973 on Smith Street in Collingwood.
This is where the Westco Jeans family was founded, which has grown into a chain of 160 stone stores.
In 1999, the family sold the company for $85 million.
Other properties were purchased for the money and the De Lutis family’s portfolio now includes offices, construction sites in Brunswick and Sorrento, apartments on the Gold Coast and Mt Buller, and suburban shopping malls.
Paul owns about one-third of the company's assets, while his father, Colin, who, in Paul's words, is "a significant driving force and dominant personality" of the De Lutis family, owns less than two-thirds of the company's assets.
Court records say Colin owns $316 million worth of property, while Paul manages $176 million worth of property.
For Paul, it was the division of property and funds that became a problem.
“Colin’s proposal sounded in my eyes strongly in his favor,” Paul wrote in a substitute oath statement to the court in 2015.
Last Friday, after several unsuccessful attempts at reconciliation, the first session of the Supreme Court was held.
The brothers are now also competing over who will control the existing business – from which Paula, according to Colin, cut off.
Colin argues that this is not true and accuses Paul of mishandling some properties.
In a previous oath-taking statement, Colin said he believed in a sound solution to the conflict.
“My Italian background dictates to me that family is the most important thing,” he wrote.
Hundreds of pages of sworn statements, emails, and reports from companies including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners, and Charter Keck Cramer are flooding lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and lawyers from both sides.
Ms. De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated dairy bars and candy stores since the 1950s and bought a grocery store in Brunswick in the 1970s.
They bought a property in Collingwood, where Colin opened his first family-owned jeans business.
Colin said that when he founded Westco "in his last year of college, Paul was still a small, about 10-year-old boy."
Anna De Lutis said that together with Luigi, who died in 2012, they hoped that the transfer of property to his sons would go well.
“Luigi often said he never wanted his sons to end up in court,” she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis family's group of companies. Colin said Mark was compensated with $10 million at the time of his departure and Luke with $26 million.
According to Paul, Luke and Mark were “not satisfied with the terms of their financial compensation.”
Colin has been holding back ever since, despite the fact that he is a former board member of the AFL club, as stated in his 2015 autobiography Eddie McGuire, a famous television personality and Colin's best friend.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paula de Lutis and their lawyers on Friday.
Only Colin replied through a text message, stating that given the fact that the dispute is being resolved in court, “I have nothing to add.”
“It’s very sad that my brother Paul decided to take the whole matter to court,” he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin said in a court statement that he was trying to adapt to his brother’s demands.
“Our father would be very dissatisfied if he saw our current situation,” he said, adding that he “still hopes for a good solution.”
On Friday, all hope was out of sight.
“Our disputes will be resolved soon in court,” Colin wrote.
Bright in the Czech Republic.
Teachers shower the children.
Drivers of motorways pack water and summer clothes.
At Na Chodovci kindergarten in Prague 4, where there are now about 35 children, they go out only in the morning.
The school is after reconstruction and the planted trees do not yet provide a large shade.
There is no swimming pool, but the teachers have children showering in the fog.
In the afternoon, the children stay in the classrooms where the blinds and curtains are pulled out.
The air is trying to cool clean air, because they do not have air conditioning.
It is also difficult for teachers and cooks.
"The temperature, which is inside and outside, exceeds the hygienic limits for kindergartens, so during this period we should not even have open operation," said the director of the kindergarten, Miloslava Makovi<0xC4><0x8D>ková.
In the kindergarten there is a glazed corridor, where according to it the temperature moves around 40 degrees.
We ventilate in the morning after 6 o'clock, the windows close and we have blinds on the south sides that we protect ourselves with.
"But it won't help much," she added.
They have better conditions in the forest nursery Na Hrázi in Hostivice, where children spend most of their time outdoors.
We have trees on the ground, so we're under them.
"There's a nice walnut tree, there's a table underneath it, and we're doing different things there," said Barbora Kompanová, the kindergarten director.
Teachers try to walk with the children in the woods, where there is a cooler.
Children wear wet hats and have various games with water on the program.
"We have a hand-held pressure sprayer that is used to spray flowers, and we use it to shower children," Kompanová said.
Also, the director of the kindergarten in Novoborská street in Proseku, Prague, Jitka Vilimovská said that the teachers try to keep the children in the shade and sprinkle them with water.
"We have a fairly large garden, so they're under the trees," she said.
He goes out in the morning and then only after 3 p.m.
Every child should have a head covering.
Teachers also remind the children that they should have a drink.
They can choose, for example, little sweetened tea or diluted juice and have drinks with water in the garden.
Every day they also have a vegetable salad to eat and a snack always fresh fruits and vegetables, which sometimes even their parents bring them.
"Maybe today one mother brought here about a ten-kilo melon for the children," added Makovi<0xC4><0x8D>ková.
Drivers receive water or summer uniforms.
The Prague transport company DPP provides them with water, ion drinks or summer uniforms on hot days.
The cabs of the trams and buses are air-conditioned in most cases, said DPP spokeswoman Aneta <0xC5><0x98>ehková.
In addition to the cabins, some trams are also air-conditioned in the passenger compartment.
The high-temperature tramways have not been seriously damaged so far.
A minor damage occurred in a loop in Hostivara.
At the current high temperatures, we make sure that the driver has sufficient amounts of drinks available.
"Cooled drinking water is available in all loops, alternating points and roads," said <0xC5><0x98>ehková.
In the garages and in some alternating places, employees have available so-called so-called sodobars, which produce refrigerated soda.
Drivers also receive soluble protective ion beverages.
“They can also take advantage of the summer uniform, which increases the comfort of drivers in their daily shifts,” the spokeswoman added.
Hot and dry weather in recent days has resulted in an increased number of fires.
On Tuesday, firefighters across the Czech Republic eliminated 108 of them, double the long-term daily average.
On Tuesday, during the day when temperatures in the Czech Republic climbed above 35 degrees Celsius, firefighters mainly employed firefighters.
"Fire in the natural environment and also those associated with harvesting work are predominant," said firefighters spokeswoman Nicole Zaoral.
Even the evening weather change did not bring any relief to the firefighters, when the heat in a number of places was replaced by storms and tidal precipitation.
In connection with the storms, firefighters went out to 236 strikes.
It was mainly about the removal of fallen trees and branches.
"They were the most involved in the Central Bohemian Region," Zaoralová continues.
However, firefighters also needed help in Stvolínky, Czech Republic, where 60 people from the children’s camp were evacuated to safety due to the storm.
Tropical temperatures have also assigned work to the Prague rescuers.
On Tuesday and Wednesday night, the ambulances drove out for a dozen cases of carbon monoxide poisoning from karst.
Therefore, people should have their water heaters checked, rescuers warn.
Carbon monoxide is a colorless, odorless gas that is released during imperfect combustion.
Symptoms of poisoning include nausea, vomiting, headache and feeling faint.
In case of suspected poisoning, it is necessary to leave the infected room.
Trump's new chief of staff plans to curb president's media diet
Many have tried it before and have always failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can do it.
If so, it will be the first.
The Politico portal said the new White House chief of staff plans to curb President Trump’s flow of information — including reports in television news — in the hopes of keeping Trump on the surface.
Here's a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey's report:
“When the new White House Chief of Staff, John F. Kelly, met for the first day in a new position with the staff, he highlighted a key issue of Trump’s White House that he intends to rectify: the wrong information that gets into the President’s hands.
Kelly told employees he had to personally approve all information — whether on paper or in a speech — because the president can make better decisions on the basis of the right information.”
Kelly’s diagnosis actually makes sense, but many of his predecessors broke their teeth at Trump’s control and his media presentation.
Trump’s relationship with the media dates back several decades – and now, as he sits in the White House, his habit of watching TV news is even stronger.
“If Trump as a candidate was upset by honest reports, it was appropriate for him to show that he is being talked about in a positive light by a lot of other media, which was easier to convince,” Sam Nunberg, a former campaign adviser, told Politico in February.
Tara Palmeri, from Politico, wrote that “the key to keeping Trump’s tweets on hold — at least according to the words of six former campaign organizers — is to ensure that Trump regularly watches the media that praises him.”
All right. Okay.
But the idea that Trump’s tendency to post his views on Twitter has ever been “controlled” is ridiculous.
Perhaps these campaign organizers know something that others don’t know – that Trump’s tweets would be more outrageous if they weren’t checked.
We’ll probably never find out about tweets that Trump never sent.
If his employees managed to keep him on hold at least a few times, then their efforts did not go in vain.
But so far, no one has been able to regularly prevent Trump from spurring controversial topics.
Part of the problem lies in the fact that in the White House, which is made up of rival factions, people are regularly trying to bolster their agenda by subverting Trump’s materials – which may, but may not be reliable – that support their view of the world.
The Politico portal, which covered the issue from all sides, published a report in May on the willingness of advisers to submit dubious information to the head of state.
This is an example of such information from the pen of reporter Shane Goldmacher:
“Trump’s current and former officials claim that the president often reacts very angry to negative news from the media, especially news of information leaks, and seeks to find their origins.
This situation occurred at the end of February when someone filed a copy of an article from GotNews.com — the website of provocateur Charles C. Johnson — who accused Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of being the “source of many information leaks” from the White House.
Regardless of whether Johnson was permanently expelled from Twitter for harassment; or whether he did not substantiate his allegations with any evidence; or whether he had previously made false accusations and later dismissed them.
Trump read the article and began to ask Walsh.”
Goldmacher added that the then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and White House Secretary Rob Porter “tried to implement a system to manage and document the information President Trump will receive.”
Would that work?
Kelly is now, three months later, trying to enforce the same strategy.
He may turn out to be a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump’s impulsiveness just won’t go away and his aides are still competing for power.
These immutable factors certainly make Kelly's mission more difficult.
Tourists Negotiate Digging and Returning to ‘Millionaire Quarter’
Several of the finest homeowners in the English county of West Midland are once again indulging in over-determined tourists who are negotiating with local authorities about the right to reclaim the field behind their homes.
Tourists parked 20 caravans in a field off a thriving street in the city of Solihull, which is nicknamed the "Millionaire's Quarter."
Bringing horses, children and an army of caravans, tourists return after being deported in May. They were not even afraid of the ditch that was dug on the spot under the orders of the authorities to prevent their incursion.
Tactical group found a gap in the defense and penetrated the field with caravans unprotected gap, which served the way.
Angry locals attacked Solihull's board of directors, saying they were "not able to solve the problem".
One of the residents, who wished to remain anonymous, said: ‘They occupied the place on Monday night after being moved to Bentley Heath Street where they were throwing stones at other people.
The board should be ashamed of its inability to solve the problem.
All the tourists were moved to another place and now they are back.
There were more last night, and there will be more today.”
She added: “The Birmingham Board of Directors knows how to deal with this problem and uses court orders to protect the parks.
I live in Streetsbrook, and I'm not going to continue paying taxes until the board of directors deals with tourists.'
Another anonymous resident said: ‘It’s ridiculous. Recently we’ve been watching the last departing tourists and now they’re back.
And this time there are even more of them, and this time they have brought horses with them.'
Solihull City Council spokesman said: “We are aware of the unauthorized stay on the property near Streetsbrook Road and, in cooperation with the local police, are taking the necessary legal steps to successfully resolve the whole problem.
In order to collect as much evidence as possible, it is essential that as many local residents as possible report any anti-social or illegal behavior to the police at number 101.
This will give us a full picture of what we are going to do in court.”

Italians Claim to Fight NGO Rescue Ships with Immigrants on Board
Italy has announced that it will prevent the arrival of NGO rescue boats approaching the Italian coast with migrants from the Mediterranean unless the NGO signs new rules regulating their operations.
"If the NGOs do not sign the new rules of conduct, it will be hard for us to imagine that they could continue their operations," Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with Turin daily La Stampa.
Minniti's warning came a day after Italian authorities seized the German rescue ship Jugend Rettet on suspicion of human trafficking, greatly facilitating illegal immigration.
The rescue organization, which operates for the first year, refused to comment on the entire case on the charge of Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
"For us, it is and always will be the number one priority to save lives, so we are very sorry that we cannot currently operate in rescue zones," the organization said in a statement on social media.
“We can only comment on any current allegations after gathering all the information and evaluating the whole situation.”
Italian authorities have been monitoring the Iuventa vessel of Jugend Rettet since October.
Her crew is suspected of carrying migrants handed over to them by human traffickers on board the ship repeatedly.
At least one meeting took place, according to the plaintiff's file, allegedly only 1.3 miles from the coast of Libya. The course of the meeting was published by Italian media.
The ship's crew is suspected of breaking the law and circumventing the Italian coast guard, which oversees rescue operations in the area - out of humanitarian enthusiasm rather than anything else.
The Code of Conduct establishes the presence of an Italian police officer on board ships such as Iuventa to monitor activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in the rescue operations have agreed to abide by the code: Save The Children, the Maltese MOAS and the Spanish Pro-Activa Open Arms.
The organization said on Thursday that the new rules are not necessary, but acceptable, as they do not represent any "substantial change or obstacle" to rescue operations.
The adoption of the new code of conduct has also been rejected by Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), a Nobel laureate.
Minniti, meanwhile, said the sharp drop in migrants disembarking in Italy in recent weeks as part of rescue operations suggests efforts to strengthen patrols off the coast of Libya and cooperation with local mayors are bearing fruit.
“In recent days, we are beginning to see light at the end of the tunnel,” the minister said.
He also unveiled plans for further talks to be held this month with the mayors of Libya on the economic development initiative, as well as with representatives of Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in hopes of reaching Europe.
Unshamed Mesaro<0xC5><0xA1>ová: Silicone and cellulite came out of her overall!

Michelle Carter Convicted of Sending Text Messages Inviting Conrad Roy to Suicide
A Massachusetts woman has been sentenced to imprisonment for two years for inciting her boyfriend to commit suicide through text messages and phone calls.
Twenty-year-old Michelle Carter is sentenced to 15 months in prison and then five years on parole.
Carter was convicted in June of the unintentional murder of Conrad Roy, who took his own life on July 13, 2014.
Roy’s father testified in court on Thursday: “The whole family is crushed.
My son was my best friend.”
Carter was left at liberty until the decision was made.
She was threatened with up to 20 years' imprisonment, but her lawyers argued that she and Roy suffered from mental illness.
Dressed in red trousers and a cream blouse, Carter stood at the verdict with tears in her eyes, her hands held up, and her eyes on the ground.
"Her act killed Conrad Roy," the plaintiff told the judge.
“She ended her life to relieve herself.
She was unable to accept her own responsibility," she said.
"She didn't show any remorse."
Carter’s lawyer said it was an “unfortunate circumstance that he deeply regrets.”
Judge Lawrence Moniz added that “her age or level of maturity or even mental disorders do not have a significant impact on her conduct.”
The plaintiff read Roy’s mother Lynn Roy’s statement: “It will not be a single day that I will not grieve over the loss of my son.
I want him to be proud of me - I care for his sisters and together we will endure the immense pain that we will carry with us forever."
Roy's sister Camdyn Roy testified that she was being "stalked" by the knowledge that she would never attend her brother's wedding and would never be the aunt of his children.
“The loss of the person I’ve seen since birth is the pain I’ll bear for life,” she said.
The state of Massachusetts does not have any applicable law that would affect a person assisting in the suicide of another person, thus this case establishes a legal precedent.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found in a car seat in 2014 poisoned with carbon monoxide.
The case drew the attention of the entire nation after the publication of Carter's text messages that prompted suicide.
"I don't care if you hang yourself, jump out of a building or stab yourself," Carter wrote in text messages sent just two weeks before his death when Roy was on family vacation.
A few minutes before her suicide, she wrote to him, “You have to do it, Conrad,” and “Just throw the generator and you’ll be free and happy.”
Judge Moniz said Carter wanted attention through Roy's death and ordered her to refrain from any comments in the press.
The case raised many questions.
One of the people who stood up to Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted of the murder of her British roommate in Italy in 2007.
Ms. Knox, 30, published a statement in the Los Angeles Times: “Michelle Carter deserves understanding and help, not jail.”
Audi adjusts up to 850,000 diesel vehicles in response to sharp response
Just a day before the announcement, Audi automaker BMW said it would offer its customers a software update in more than 350,000 vehicles.
BMW said the company believes there are “more intelligent options than driving restrictions” in response to European cities – including Munich, which is BMW’s headquarters – considering banning or restricting diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will adjust three million Mercedes cars across Europe to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies referred to this decision as a withdrawal.
European car manufacturers have largely promoted the use of diesel atomobile in Europe and the United States to comply with the CO2 emissions regulations.
However, the nitrogen oxide emitted by diesel engines is considered carcinogenic and can cause asthma.
At the same time, there is an increase in the cost of car manufacturers installing equipment to neutralise the gases emitted by diesel engines, which makes it difficult for cars to compete.
While German automakers face careful scrutiny, Chancellor Angela Merkel faces accusations of tampering with powerful auto companies and ignoring their problems.
The companies are trying to avoid Volkswagen’s mistakes, which in an effort to meet the emission limits installed software in their cars, which during testing reduced the amount of emissions emitted, but under normal conditions the software was deactivated.
Several senior Volkswagen executives have been charged in the United States and others are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, a former head of thermodynamics in the engine development department at Audi was arrested in Germany.
Former manager Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is of Italian nationality and therefore not subject to extradition, so he may face trial in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was involved in a German police criminal investigation into Volkswagen after authorities accused Audi of installing a system that was supposed to circumvent European emission limits – and spread the accusations Audi faces in the US.
Audi’s inclusion in the investigation could have a disastrous impact on Volkswagen: luxury carmakers make up a disproportionate share of Volkswagen’s profits.
The plane landed on the beach.
A man and a girl died.
The accident occurred on the Praia de São João beach in the Costa da Caparica area, about 30 kilometers south of Lisbon.
One witness told SIC Noticias that the plane flew just above the people who were sunbathing on the beach before landing.
Some of the people on the beach reportedly ran away from the danger in the sea.
Unfortunately, two people failed to escape from the machine.
A 50-year-old man and an eight-year-old girl were killed on the beach.
"The plane crashed and they were dead on the spot," said local police chief Pedro Coelho Dias.
Their nationality is not yet known.
There were two people on board the plane, both of whom were rescued alive from the accident and taken to interrogation by police.
D11 or how not to build a highway.
Are the roads in the Czech Republic complete?
I'll give you a riddle.
It is unrealized, even though it began to be built in 1978.
Even though it's unrecognised, it's constantly being corrected.
And it must not be built further, even if it has a building permit.
What's that? What's that?
Yes, Castle Highway D11.
The construction of the next section of it was stopped by the Children of the Earth movement for at least a few months.
We Easterners get the highway in pieces, like when they cut salami.
The wheel will be cut and then we'll see when and if we get another one.
We don’t want anything miraculous.
We just want to shorten the driving time and we want to get trucks going to Poland or from Poland from villages and cities.
Infinite streams of trucks pass directly through the city of Jarom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99> or Náchod, which is not as reasonably the object.
But so far the last section of our dream highway was put into operation in 2008, that is, an incredible nine years ago.
Not a beat since then.
Therefore, when the remaining four kilometers of the unfinished section to Hradec Králové and other sections to Jarom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>i were recently started with an archaeological survey, with the construction beginning at the end of this year, you could hear the loud bangs in the eastern Bohemia.
No one believed it anymore.
Last week it turned out that there will be no construction this year.
Or maybe next year.
The Children of the Earth-Club movement for sustainable transport from Brno has broken down.
The Earth's children are repeating their tactics from D1.
They challenged the decision on the construction permit in full measure.
In the breakdown, they request a review of all the already issued binding opinions of all the authorities concerned.
For example, the Castle Magistrate, the Ministry of the Environment, but also the Ministry of Defense or the Railway Authority.
So far from the D11 we descend near the village with the eloquent name Poh<0xC5><0x99>eba<0xC4><0x8D>ka.
So we go down, we just go on the highway and suddenly we stand on the side road and we prefer to then line up in the column.
Worst of all, you can see similar stories all over the country.
A terrifying, constantly blocked road to Bene<0xC5><0xA1>ov, highway D1 or D8.
Everyone has their own cemetery.
What do the children of the earth want?
What is the nature of the problems of the construction of roads in the Czech Republic?
And why is the highway network practically incomplete in the current system?

Lavender from Provence is threatened by climate change
Lavender has become a symbol of Provence in the southeastern region of France, but is now threatened by climate change.
Lavender is decreasing due to the dry climate and harmful insects, causing horror on the faces of researchers and farmers looking for solutions.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at the CRIEPPAM Agricultural Research Institute in Provence, said: “The cultivation of lavender in Provence is at risk because in the last few years this plant has been exposed to climate change, which brings with it less rainfall in spring and autumn.
This affects the life of lavender.
It is also the fault of cicadas and sparrows carrying micro-bacteria that thrive in dry climates.”
There's a lot at stake.
Lavender attracts tourists and the oil produced from them is an important component of perfumes and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: “Instead of long and beautiful flowers, smaller, undeveloped and often weak plants grow.
The amount of oil obtained from these lavenders is, of course, less.”
A possible solution could be a more efficient water distribution and slowing down the evaporation of water from the soil, but also spraying lavender with a protective mixture of clay and water and breeding more species resistant to dry weather.
The murder of a journalist highlights the growing threats in Mexico
Employees of Riodoce meet regularly every Wednesday to discuss the news of the riots that are taking place in the Sinaloa area with the participation of organized criminals, corrupt officials and relentless drug wars.
Today, however, they are meeting under the pressure of recent events mainly for their own safety.
They learn that it is important to change their habits.
Two well-deserved journalists talk about what would be safer: taking their children with them to an office that was attacked by a grenade in 2009, or leaving them at home.
Security experts have written three simple words on the blackboard: opponents, neutrals and allies.
They ask journalists to give names to every word - no evidence is needed, just use imagination and foresight.
Picking them out of what - drug dealers, politicians, traders and journalists are suspected of taking money from the government or drug cartels - is a catalog of criminals whose task is to cover up criminal acts.
Violence does not stop and bodies are piled up across the country; journalists among them are constantly growing: according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, at least 25 of them have been under federal protection since President Enrique Pena Nieto came to power in December 2012; 589 journalists have been under federal protection and are under threat after the attacks.
Among them is the co-founder of Riodioce, editor and inspiration for colleagues, Javier Valdez Cardenas.
“The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and work as a journalist,” Valdez wrote in one of his many books on the violence associated with the drug trade.
His loss is palpable, even though his presence is omnipresent - a large photograph of Valdez with the inscription "Justice", to which the middleman points, hangs in the front of the building; two journalists - Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez - over 30 years old, have a t-shirt with a photo of Valdez on the nose with a smile on the face.
The meeting takes place less than two months after his death; journalists talk about mutual trauma, nightmares, insomnia and paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecutor’s office was set up in 2010 to deal with journalists’ cases, two suspects have been prosecuted so far, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists.
Most of the thousands of murders that occur every year are linked to drug trafficking and organized crime, so journalist killers are very exceptionally brought to justice.
Journalists from Riodoce insist that they will report on the violence that is taking place in Sinaloa; despite the fact that they are devastated by grief and the said territory is currently very treacherous.
Without information about the murders and without a view of justice, the security meeting is pointless, Ibarra says.
"It's foolish to waste time on such meetings," he adds.
"Unless we get more information, you can't trust anyone."
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left Riodoce headquarters in Culiacán, the capital of Sinaloa.
He managed to escape several blocks when his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men who pulled him out of the car and killed him with 12 bullets, apparently because of the title of the article - which can be translated as the Twelfth River.
The shooters then stepped into his car and assaulted him not far from the crime scene.
Valdez died at the age of 50.
He left behind a wife and two adult children.
In Culiacan, rumours seem to be spreading rapidly.
In Valdez’s case, however, there is only suspicious silence.
Since Guzmán’s arrest last year and his January extradition to the United States, Sinaloa has become one of the country’s bloodiest battlefields as rival factions try to fill the void.
Every day, several people are killed in the streets of Sinaloa and the cemeteries are filled with jeweled two-storey mausoleums for drug kings, many of which are larger than houses.
Forget for a moment that the word “ceasefire” means that one drug cartel controls a coastal state with precious ports and important routes that drug travels to the United States.
Despite this, as well as the fact that Valdez was intimately acquainted with the risks of his employment, Ismail Bojorquez, 60, co-founder and CEO of Riodoce, still blames him for failing to protect his friend.
He believes that two mistakes contributed to his death.
The first was the February issue of an interview with Damaso Lopez, the leader of one of the rival drug cartels that waged war with the sons of Joaquín Guzmán.
The peace might have pissed off the sons; the suspected gang members bought all copies of the newspaper as they landed on the counters.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after seizing other newspapers in which the same story was printed.
Valdez has become a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his death is seen as an important milestone in the fight of Mexican criminals against journalists.
He managed to survive for so long and all his friends and colleagues believed that it would never change.
In the magazine Noroeste, he was practically a veteran when in 2003 he decided to sell his $50 shares and found along with five colleagues Riodoce.
In Sinaloa, “it was impossible to run journalism without mentioning the drug trade,” Bojorquez said.
Riodoce eventually gained a good reputation for brave and truthful news; the newspapers began to thrive.
The journalists liked to search for problematic topics and publish texts without censorship - the readers were fascinated by stories that no one else dared to publish.
Eight years after its founding, Riodoce won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Award for reporting on Latin America.
That same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award from the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his brave reporting on the Mexican drug trade.
Valdez openly admitted that he was afraid.
"I was worried about my life," he said at the awards ceremony.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa is a “way of life,” Valdez said in October last year in an interview with Rompeviento TV.
“You have to take on the role of a journalist – or play stupid.
I don’t want anyone to ask me, ‘What did you do in the face of death... why didn’t you tell me what was going on?’”
Riodoce's employees miss Valdez. The man was known for his jokes and non-selective language. He was a good friend who liked to give advice and hugs - a teacher who knew how to survive.
Everyone relied on his day-to-day routine.
He always wore his hat.
He often went to the El Guayabo bar opposite the offices and sat at the same table.
Now they ask: did this routine cause his death?
His death in them also raised questions about his own assumptions - how to do his job as best as possible and stay alive?
“They don’t like it when you mess up with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their secret landing pads.”
"These things were forbidden," Bojorquez said.
As a result, there is a high level of self-censorship and self-preservation.
You have to trust your instincts.
If you feel that something is not playing out here, put your hands away.
The problem is, Riodoce editor Andres Villarreal said, “Silence is a sense that can be fooled... and then the thing with Javier happened.”
The old rules, according to him, as well as others, no longer apply in Sinaloa – just as in the states of Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states that are home to a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling trails, weak governments and corrupt politicians.
The country is constantly changing.
No mobile phones are allowed in the room where Riodoce employees meet, as spyware was discovered a few days ago, which was purchased by governments to monitor Mexican journalists and activists.
In front of the building, two police officers find relief from a forty-degree heat in the shadow of a nearby tree.
They were selected by the state to protect the offices of Riodoce, which are located in a four-storey building in the urban district of Culiacan.
Journalists are wondering if these policemen are among the 50 percent of the law enforcement officers who, according to the government, are corrupt.
It has been several months since journalists last went to the mountainous areas, which are essentially controlled by drug cartels.
There are three main stories on the agenda this week.
The first is the murder of the brother of former boxer Julio César Chávez in Sinaloa.
They are also aware of suspicious government spending that took place in the state's hometown of the governor.
Recently, there have also been several kidnappings in one of Culiacán’s most luxurious restaurants, just a block from the prosecutor’s office.
Officially, no one announced the identities of the abducted people or the circumstances of the kidnapping, so journalists were on guard when they were going to write about what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite destination for drug dealers and politicians.
One journalist read from public records that the restaurant was registered under a name that is associated with a certain politician who is a member of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), controlling all levels of the political scene for almost the last century.
Several PRI governors have recently been charged with corruption in high-ranking positions.
Villarreal asked reporters to write about earlier incidents that occurred in the restaurant, including an incident in which one of Joaquín "El Chapo" Guzmán's sons escaped an army intervention unit.
A month ago, readers would have read about it in Valdez’s column, which was the best source of information about the kidnappings.
"Valdez would certainly solve the case," said Villarreal, 46, who is nicknamed "El Flaco" for his slim figure.
"Now all the informants have turned their backs on us."
Valdez's office has turned into a warehouse of placards and stickers for protests against the killing of journalists. Employees certainly did not expect them to become activists in the press.
Journalist Miriam Ramirez grabbed several billboards and went out the next morning to demonstrate in front of the prosecutor’s office for another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared just three days after Valdez’s murder in the western state of Michoacán.
Only a burnt body was found, and authorities say it's Adame based on DNA analysis.
The activity of journalists is increasing all over the country. Many of them organize protests and whistle on the sidewalks and buildings "SOS Press".
Newspaper director Bojorquez is on a day visit to Washington, D.C., where he seeks international support and justice for Valdez’s death.
At a meeting with Governor Sinaloa the day after Valdez’s murder, Ramirez accused authorities of tracking journalists and their murders for telling the truth.
In the meantime, she requested transfer to another department for fear that her anger might jeopardize her impartiality.
Valdez has repeatedly said that Mexican journalists are “overwhelmed” by organized crime, corrupt officials and the indifferent public.
In his latest book, Narco-Journalism, he wrote that journalists are dying not only at the hands of drug cartels, but also at the behest of politicians and security forces who cooperate with organized crime.
The Articulo 19 media watchdog has accused more than half of all attacks on police journalists and public officials.
“You will die in Mexico because they want to silence you,” Ramirez added.
Murders seem to work.
No one will forget the death of the blogger Marie Elizabeth Macías, who died six years ago at the northern border of Tamaulipas.
Her body was found along with a message allegedly signed by the Zetas cartel: “This is how I ended up because of my messages.”
Next to the cut head lay the keyboard and the headphones.
Some branches have decided to close operations, such as the newspaper El Norte, which is based on the northern borders of the state of Chihuahua, in response to the March murder of reporter Miroslava Breach.
Others are still continuing, just as they did El Manana of Nuevo Laredo after killing its director in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed drug cartels with an article on the front page titled “What do you want from us”?
Some journalists have fled their homes or even across the border.
It's a difficult decision.
Finding a job in exile is difficult, as well as getting rid of the feeling that someone is constantly harassing you.
And journalists are being persecuted and killed, such as in the case of Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 along with four women in an apartment in Mexico City, three months after fleeing from Veracruz.
For those who choose to stay and not give up their work, every day presents a great risk.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that writing about drugs scares him.
“Mexico is going to hell, that’s why I became a journalist,” he said.
It's Friday midnight and Riodoce employees are sitting on the sidewalk in front of the office - the latest edition sent to the printer - drinking beer when the phone suddenly rings.
They learn that 19 people were killed in a shooting between gang members and policemen near a beach resort in the city of Mazatlan.
The war is escalating, just as the many messages left in this area by the members of the syndicate promised.
Journalists are publishing this news from a mobile phone on the Riodoce website.
Not a single day will pass and the initial title will change again.
The sounds of police sirens indicate another shooting.
Bojorquez takes a glance at the police to see if they are watching.
If they're afraid, they don't show it.
Under the huge portrait of the fallen co-founder of their magazine - whose middleman is an eloquent slogan for the entire Sinaloa - all Riodoce employees follow in his footsteps.
"How could we think of leaving," said Bojorquez, "when on the same day that Javier was killed, one intern asked me to send her to the streets?"
Dinosaurs used camouflage to avoid enemies
At first glance, it looks like a statue, however scary.
Researchers have now uncovered the first findings of an amazing rhino-sized creature whose perfectly preserved remains — which experts have dubbed the Mona Lisa of Dinosaurs — have been found by a Canadian miner.
The remains have been preserved to such an extent that experts have been able to determine the reddish-brown color of its scaly skin, saying the dinosaur had a "problem past."
An article in the journal Current Biology said it was “the most preserved armoured dinosaur ever found and one of the best dinosaur species in the world.”
The fossil is a new species of the family Nodosauridae. Dinosaur lived in the Cretaceous period, about 110 to 112 million years ago.
His perfectly preserved condition literally shocked the researchers, who described it with the words “really remarkable.”
According to National Geographic, the armored biologist is the best-preserved fossil of its kind.
The discovery was made by Shawn Funk, who discovered the fossil on March 21, 2011, while drilling in the Suncor Millenium mine near Alberta, Canada.
He stumbled upon something that looked like a foreign object and decided to examine it more closely.
The fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
The researchers spent the next six years uncovering an animal from a huge piece of land weighing 1,100 kg.
After the work is completed, the dinosaur is ready for detection.
“You just have to blink a little and you’ll believe that he’s sleeping,” said Caleb Brown, a researcher at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the animal is on display.
“It will certainly be recorded in history as one of the most beautiful and most well-preserved species of dinosaurs – the Mona Lisa dinosaurs.”
In a study of his skin, researchers found that this herbivore — despite being covered in armor and reminiscent of a walking tank — was most likely facing a serious threat from carnivorous dinosaurs.
The heavily armored dinosaur used red and white camouflage to protect against predators and used a masking system used by many animals today.
Experts claim that this allowed him to better merge with his surroundings and avoid enemies. The masking system suggests that he was a favorite food of larger dinosaurs.
Reports of a 110-million-year-old Nodosauridae dinosaur first appeared in the papers in May. Currently available for viewing at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
The researchers named it Borealopelta markmitchelli after museum technician Mark Mitchell, who spent more than 7,000 hours with the team carefully uncovering the fossil.
Thanks to the amazingly preserved state of the fossil, Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists were able to document the patterns and shape of scales and armor throughout the body.
They discovered a method of masking commonly used by today's animals in defense - the upper part of the animal was darker than its lower part.
Although this masking effect is common in nature, the researchers’ findings are surprising, as Borealopelta’s size far exceeds today’s animals using the same technique.
It is possible, therefore, that the dinosaur was such a predator that evolution gave preference to disguise over confrontation in survival.
Many present-day masquerade animals – such as deer, zebra, or beltworm – are much smaller and also more vulnerable than prey, suggesting that the nosodaurus had to fight for its survivors literally.
“The handover of a huge and heavily armoured dinosaur illustrates visually the danger posed by predators during the Cretaceous period,” Brown said.
A chemical analysis of the organic components contained in the scales also revealed that the skin of the dinosaurs was likely reddish-brown.
Researchers continue to study the animal and search for other insights about its life, including the preserved contents of the stomach, to find out its last meal.
He believes that the dinosaur fell into a river after his death and was taken to the sea, where it sank to the bottom.
At the time, Alberta had the same climate as present-day Florida, and the rivers and oceans stretched farther inland than they do today.
“This nodosaurus is truly remarkable in that it is completely covered in perfectly preserved scaly skin and at the same time it is preserved in three dimensions so that we can see its original size,” Brown said.
“For these reasons, the animal looks practically the same as it did at the time of the Cretaceous.
You don’t have to use your imagination to reconstruct it; you just have to blink a little and it seems like he’s just sleeping.”
During the Cretaceous period, huge theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs, were walking around the Earth, moving on two legs.
Although the king of all dinosaurs - Tyrannosaurus rex - lived several million years after Borealopelta, this armored dinosaur could have been a favorite prey of his equally terrifying ancestors.
These include the Acrocanthosaurus, an 11.5-meter-long monster weighing over 6 tons.
Researchers, whose latest findings were published in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelt’s body was washed into the sea after being mummified in mud.
The discovery was made by Shawn Funk, who discovered the fossil on March 21, 2011, while drilling in the Suncor Millenium mine near Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the best-preserved armored dinosaur in the world, including leather and armor, which is complete from the thigh to the hip.
The animal reached an average length of 5 meters and weighed up to 1,300 kg.
Two 50 cm blades protruded from his shoulders.
Researchers believe that this herbivore roamed the territory of what is now Canada until it ended up in a river that sailed it into the sea.
His underwater tomb kept the body in perfect condition.
Fossil remains of this species are also preserved to the extent that the armoured plates around the skull still cover the remains of the skin.
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, “Finding such a preserved individual can be compared to winning the lottery.
The longer I follow him, the more shocking the finding seems to me.
Fossil remains of this species are also preserved to the extent that the armoured plates around the skull still cover the remains of the skin.
His right forefoot is on his side with his fingers pointing upwards.
I can easily count the scales on his foot.'
How did one activist find out the answer to the question: ‘Whose Streets?’
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell shook her entire body.
The day after arriving in New York, a native of St. Louis sat down on a bed in an Airbnb room and browsed through Facebook posts on her phone.
She came across a contribution from a high school student.
“Police just shot an 18-year-old boy whose body is still lying on the street,” he said.
She was surprised that no one else wrote this post to her, so she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
<0x40>TheePharoah retweeted her wall posts.
A St. Louis rapper posted on Twitter his posts about the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old boy who was shot by a white-skinned police officer in the city of Ferguson, Missouri.
He posted a photo of Brown's body lying ungoverned on the street, where no one took him even after four hours.
"That's crazy," Ferrell thought.
Death was nothing new to her or her family.
She dropped the phone to go back to him the night she watched tweets about people gathering on Canfield Drive.
One of the men claimed to be the victim's father and had a sign in his hand that read, "The Ferguson police killed my unarmed son!"
She was watching live news - one of the policemen stood in front of a group of protesters, holding a leash in his hand and at the other end of it a barking dog.
In another video, another police officer, she said, held a gun in his hand pointing at the crowd and shouting, “I’ll kill you all...animals.”
"That's not normal," Ferrell said.
“This is not the kind of murder we’re used to, and we can call it normal.
I felt goose skin all over my body.
“I was angry and I was crying.”
She immediately booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After landing at 23:00, she picked up her six-year-old daughter from her father and decided to leave for Ferguson in the morning.
The story of what happened to Ferrell and the city of Ferguson over the next three years is described in the new documentary Whose Streets?, which will be released in theaters on August 11.
It is a story of survival and protest, love and resistance, strength and inviolability told from the perspective of people living in the community who take to the streets and demand answers.
On the way to Ferguson, Ferrell introduced dialogue with her daughter – dressed in a floral jersey and the same floral hems – on a topic they had discussed many times before – “about the experience with blacks”.
“Remember how I taught you how black people had to fight for what they believed in?” she recalls.
“We’re going to Ferguson right now because the police killed an 18-year-old and that’s not right.”
“It didn’t seem like I wouldn’t take her with me,” Ferrell later said.
“Today’s events are the culmination of what happened in the past.
She had to know it and see it with her own eyes and grow up in it.
She needed to develop not only in activism and organization, but she also needed to know the difference between different layers of experience with blacks and what we need to do in order to be free.
Although I am able to provide her with conditions in which she will not experience racism on her own, she is in no way different from another black child-woman.
I feel that if I protected her from this experience, I would only harm her.”
After arriving in Ferguson, the first stop was South Florissant Road across from the police department, which became the base of activists waiting for Darren Wilson's words about his possible involvement in the incident.
Here, Ferrell and her daughter met a local businessman who was preparing food for others.
Together they prepared food in sacks and helped spread it to the Protestants.
In Ferrell’s eyes, a new type of activism began to be born.
"My activism turned upside down after August 9th," Ferrell said, adding that while studying at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, she was president of the Minority Student Nurses Association of Assn. and was striving to introduce health care and food into black communities.
“I had no experience with the organization.
It was natural."
A few weeks later, during the evening demonstration, Ferrell became acquainted with the later co-director of the documentary, Sabaah Folayana.
Folayan said he and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to “only document” the events taking place.
But Ferrell thought, "Are you working on a documentary or are you trying to find a story that could be used?"
Such skepticism penetrated the community through many people, often whites, who wanted to make money on pain and determination.
As Folayana explained in an unpublished interview: “We have heard that the voices of people who are born and raised in Ferguson are very often overlooked and that is what we wanted to change.”
Folayana has already collaborated with co-director Damon Davis, a renowned local artist who deals with the theme of prisoners in the cell of death.
His participation in the project also involved Ferrell and six other locals who were followed by the Whose Streets team in the years following Brown's assassination.
“Nobody speaks for us in this document, but it’s our statement,” Davis said.
“It was important to me – how these people will be represented – because in the same way I will be represented.”
While the documentary's goal was not to focus on Ferrell's experiences - in an attempt to show that the movement "is not about the savior's leader, but about bringing the community closer together," Folayana said - it turned out that she was the most open to participating in the filming.
The documentary Whose Streets describes a very personal aspect of Ferrell’s life, such as how she fell in love with her wife.
"I felt naked," Ferrell said with a smile on her face, thinking of the first moment she looked at the final version of the documentary.
“But I understood that in order to do this job and protect the black people, I have to open up.”
Ferrell’s story also highlights the role of the eccentric black woman in the wider aspect of the Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement – who created a campaign under #BlackLivesMatter in response to the 2012 murder of teenager Trayvon Martin on social media – call themselves odds.
“Black eccentric women in leadership positions ultimately stand for the preservation of the movement,” Ferrell said, “because we are constantly fighting on multiple fronts.
Black eccentric women must bear the weight of these events."
Folayana agrees with this statement, adding that “the movement is actually supported by black women and a large number of eccentric black women.”
She insists, however, that "this is not a mere affirmative matter" and Ferrell is not the main hero of the document because of her views.
“She was the driving force and the source of energy,” she said.
“It is no coincidence that she was at the forefront, because life at these intersections in the skin of a black woman is dangerous.
You can feel the energy in front of the screen.”
Meanwhile, back in Ferguson, television cameras have cleared their positions, but heavy racial ties between the community and the police persist.
Ferrell faces a two-and-a-half-year parole for blocking the highway during demonstrations.
The socially political atmosphere in the area she calls home has been described as “disorder.”
Still, she does not stop at the effort she has committed to since she took to the streets of Ferguson three years ago.
“It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
The only thing we can lose is our chains.”
A field was burning in Cologne.
Dozens of firefighters came to the scene, including a helicopter.
Near <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xBD> Brod in Kolínsk, between the villages of Byany and Liblice, a field of about 15 hectares has been burning since 14:00.
The fire stopped spreading around 3:15 p.m., the firefighters declared a third-degree fire alarm out of four possible.
According to the spokesman of the firefighter Ladislav Holom<0xC4><0x8D>ík, the fire from the air also helped to extinguish the helicopter.
At 6 p.m., the firefighters managed to extinguish the fire, causing damage of 700,000 crowns.
Dozens of professional and volunteer firefighters fought the flames on the spot.
The fire was caused by a technical malfunction in the engine compartment of the combine.
Hasit was also helped by a helicopter, which carried out a total of six runs of water.
"Instead of the intervention, we handed it over to the owner, until tomorrow at 8:00 a.m. it will be guarded by a unit of volunteer firefighters," Holom<0xC4><0x8D>ík said today.
A Becoming Similarity: Artist Makes Portraits Using Chelsea Manning’s DNA
In the middle of one of the rooms of the New York Fridman Gallery are several faces of different shades of skin - white, black and brown - suspended from the ceiling on the wires, each of them as if out of the eye of the previous one.
All 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from wipes made of oral cavity and hair sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent her samples from Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former analyst is serving a 35-year sentence for unauthorized disclosure of secret cables on WikiLeaks.
The new exhibition, which was launched on August 2, is titled A Becoming Similarity.
It is the result of a two-year correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, who combines her experience in technology, computer science and the arts, and Manning, a transgender and pioneer dissident whose sentence was reduced by Obama three days before she stepped down as president of the United States.
Using an algorithmic analysis of Manning's DNA and using 30 portraits to depict what a person with this genotype would look like, Dewey-Hagborg created a sharp, if not intellectual commentary on the susceptibility of DNA - as well as on the many ways that DNA can be interpreted in the same way - and the indistinguishable identities.
Manning, born Bradley Edward Manning, has spoken out about being considered a woman since she was a teenager and was convicted in 2013 on twenty charges, including violation of six espionage laws, computer fraud and theft.
All of her photographs were held by prison staff, and only one black and white lower-quality photograph escaped the public, on which Manning, visibly worried, sits in the driver’s seat in a platinum blonde wig, with which she is now attached.
In 2015, they were still receiving positive reactions to the 2012 Stranger Visions project by Dewey-Hagborg.
As part of this project, Dewey-Hagborg used various forensic subjects - such as cigarette butts and chewing gum - to create an image of possible images of these people.
And it was at this time that she received an e-mail from Paper Magazine.
"They were planning an interview with Chelsea Manning in prison and wanted to add a portrait to the article," Dewey-Hagborg said.
However, visits and photography were not allowed, so they asked Chelsea if she would be interested in DNA portraits.
The artist and her imprisoned muse were scammed over the course of two years through correspondence.
They even created a comic book called Suppressed Images, illustrated by Shoili Kanung, which presented a vision of what would happen if Chelsea were favored and could attend the exhibition in person.
In fact, a few days after the release of the comic, President Obama asked for Manning’s release, which was a welcome change after several unbearable years spent in a Kansas military prison.
It’s really interesting that the exhibition is taking place at a time when Donald Trump is waging war with people seeking to release government information and transgender soldiers while trying to find new ways to incite resentment in areas he’s supposed to support with his tweets.
In response to a question about this particular timing, Dewey-Hagborg said that “everything is happening for some reason.”
Under the artist's statement on one of the gallery's walls, Manning calls with her huge signature (the letter "i" in the surname is pronounced with a heart) after the end of "self-made factionalism based on gender, race, sexuality and culture."
On the opposite side are the sequences of her mitochondrial DNA - the centipedes of the letters C, G and A recorded by the pencil.
By including 200 letters (or nucleotides, according to the artist’s sophisticated scientific dictionary), Dewey-Hagborg wanted to illustrate how surprisingly similar, at least biologically, we all are.
“I hope that people will learn that our genome doesn’t care who we are, and that genetic data is subjective and everyone can interpret it in their own way,” said Dewey-Hagborg, who is also featured in her 2007 work on video, Spurious Memories.
“DNA tells a lot of different stories, these are 30 of them.”
The last copy of the exhibition, located in a separate room, is the only page of the above-mentioned graphic novel.
It shows Manning emerging in the manner of King Kong from the United States Disciplinary Barracks with a megaphone in his hand.
“As soon as they stop you from speaking, they will win,” it says.
“Never let yourself be silenced.”
"It's a direct transcript of one of the letters," the Philadelphia artist said.
"When I think about it, my goose's skin bounces."
Manning has not yet personally visited the exhibition - as predicted in the comic book - but when it does, she will be greeted in the middle of the room with her masks, her own genome images, arranged like a crowd of Protestants.
This was also the purpose of the exhibition, including a nearly 160 cm tall statue of Maning on which her genetic haplogroups are recorded with a pencil.
“In the past, they were placed on the walls, but this time I wanted them to feel crowded,” Dewey-Hagborg said of the portraits.
“I wanted to give the impression of a mass movement that takes on the form of Chelsea and liberates it.”
A Northwestern University Professor and Oxford University Employee Searched for Murder
A nationwide search is underway these days for a Northwestern University professor and Oxford University staff who are being prosecuted on suspicion of the murder of a man found stabbed to death in a luxury Chicago apartment, police said.
On Monday, a first-degree murder warrant was issued for a man named Wyndham Lath (42) and Andrew Warren (56) for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, according to the Cook County court file.
The document says that Cornell-Duranleau (26) died from the consequences of several stab wounds.
Chicago police said the body of the man was found on July 27.
After arriving at the Grand Plaza Apartments, they found the victim in one of the apartments with several market wounds.
Cornell-Duranleau was pronounced dead on the spot and detectives are investigating the case as a murder. Meanwhile, police are looking for both suspects, authorities said.
Lathem has worked as a professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, the university’s vice president for public relations, said in an email statement that Lathem is now on administrative leave and was barred from entering the university’s school premises.
“The whole matter is now being investigated by the relevant authorities and the Northwestern University is fully cooperating with them,” Cubbage said.
Warren is an executive financial manager at Oxford University.
A spokesman for Somerville University and Somerville College said in an emailed statement: “We have been contacted by the British police and are ready to assist the US police as well.”
The statement also said Warren’s colleagues were shocked by the facts and wanted him to report to the police.
Anthony Guglielmi, head of public relations at the Chicago Police Department, said he is calling on suspects to surrender to the relevant authorities.
"Police have information about their whereabouts and efforts to locate suspects are increasing," Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi added that local, regional and national authorities are helping the police in the search for the suspects.
According to Guglielmi, the police received a phone call from the manager of the Grand Plaza building, who was notified of the events that were supposed to take place in the apartment No. 1008.
The police described the whole scene as very violent.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident occurred on July 27.
He added that Lathem and Warren were captured by security cameras.
"We believe Professor Latham knew his victim," Guglielmi said.
The Grand Plaza administration issued a statement to all residents: “Police are now working to compile a timeline and profile of the victim and are investigating various motives, including domestic violence.”
“We will complete the WADA plan in the near future” - Deputy Prime Minister of Russia Mutko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitali Mutko said it would not take long to implement the remaining World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) criteria and re-establish the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).
“A part of the criteria for the new plan has already been completed and RUSADA has already acquired the right to plan and test in cooperation with the UK Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD).
With this in mind, WADA’s plan has been updated,” Mutko said on Thursday.
The vice-president commented on the second part of WADA’s compliance plan – which outlines the criteria for the renewal of RUSADA – which was recently published on the WADA’s website.
According to Mutka, the code does not contain anything that should worry Russia.
“Everything has been announced and everything will be implemented.
The results will be made available to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future,” he added.
One of the criteria, however, calls for a public announcement of the results of the WADA investigation, which was investigated by Richard McLaren, about the alleged sponsorship of doping of Russian athletes by the government.
Mutko said: “We are investigating because our anti-doping system has obviously failed.
All measures have been taken in this regard.
However, there were no state programs in our country, and we cannot therefore admit to something that never existed.”
Mutkov’s words were confirmed by Vitaly Smirnov, the director of the Russian Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission.
In an interview with the Russian RSport, Smirnov acknowledged the problems of Russian anti-doping officials, but added: “On many occasions we have stated that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
No one plans to accept the report completely without reservation," Smirnov concluded.
WADA suspected RUSSIA of carrying out doping controls within Russia in November 2015 immediately before the doping scandal.
However, the organization allowed planning and unifying testing under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD) this June.
After a visit to the organization's Moscow headquarters in July, WADA Director General Olivier Niggli said that RUSADA is "on track" to renew its validity.
Police have charged three people, one is a juvenile.
Police have charged three men with setting up Wednesday's fire at a rare wooden church in Trinec-Gutech on Fr<0xC3><0xBD>decko-Místec.
One defendant is a juvenile, all three are of Czech nationality.
They are facing up to 15 years in prison for a general offense.
To journalists today said the Moravian Silesian police director Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Ku<0xC5><0xBE>el.
He said it was a deliberate crime.
"It's a very fresh matter and the police are currently working on the subject of the whole matter," Ku<0xC5><0xBE>el said.
He said the police will discuss the possible detention of the accused.
Further information, according to the director, cannot be disclosed.
"I can't say more yet, because the criminal police and investigators are actually working on the case, and the prosecutor who is overseeing the case," he said.
The wooden church of the body of God in Gutach dates back to the 16th century.
It was a valuable monument with many original equipment and paintings from the first half of the 16th century.
Material damage is estimated to be tens of millions of crowns, but the historical loss is incalculable.
Suddenly after the fire began to be considered for the restoration of the church.
Most of the costs should be covered by insurance, the additional costs are ready to be shared with the Ministry of Culture and the city, a public collection is also prepared and the contribution of the owner of the monument, i.e. the local parish, is calculated.
A similar wooden church of St. Catherine from the 16th century in Ostrava-Hrabová also destroyed a fire fifteen years ago.
This was caused by a fault in the electrical system.
An exact copy was created in his place.
The state is counting on the citizens to defend the state.
It will support their training.
With financial support for associations that can be used in the defense of the state, with voluntary shooting training or with a team of training trainers, the objective of the law on the readiness of citizens to defend the state counts.
The Ministry of Defense, which was given the task of processing it by the government, promises that it will be able to increase the physical ability of the Czechs and their abilities, which the state could then use in crisis situations.
This is the result of a proposal prepared by the Ministry.
If the law were passed in the future, the state would spend hundreds of millions of crowns on defense support.
According to its authors, the main objective of the proposal is to create an effective system that would help to increase the readiness of the people of the Czech Republic to defend the state, outside the exercise of the defensive duty and on the basis of volunteerism.
For example, the state would financially or materially support associations of radio amateurs, shooters or cynologists and allow them to increase the capabilities of their members.
In return, he would obtain data on people who are willing to come to the country for help in times of crisis, if necessary, and on their abilities or material equipment.
Accredited instructors could also be available to assist associations and other interested parties in training or training.
It also counts on organizing words with war veterans or people who behaved heroically.
One of the possible options is the creation of a new office, which will be responsible for the administration and coordination of the project.
The authors of the proposal stress that the participation of people should be voluntary and the state would only use their capabilities after the state of threat was declared.
"The whole concept must respect the gradual erasure of previously obvious boundaries between different types of threats," the statement said, referring to the dangers of so-called hybrid threats.
Ministerial officials noted that, therefore, it is necessary to focus on supporting as wide a range of capabilities as possible, not just military ones.
"The basic objective of the intention is to create a very broad basis that will enable every citizen to respond skillfully to situations threatening the sovereignty of the state or the lives, health and property of persons, to protect themselves, or to contribute to the protection of others, and to prevent improper behavior from hindering the fulfillment of tasks by republicans."
The adoption of the law would bring considerable financial demands.
According to the Ministry, their amount will depend on the chosen variant.
For example, the Office provides financial support for projects to prepare citizens for the defense of the state up to 100 million crowns.
If an administrative and coordination centre were established, its operation could cost around 60 million crowns a year.
More money would be spent on wages or building an information system.
The proposal also envisages that the scope of the regional military commands should be expanded to include a further 42 troops.
Officials of the Ministry have previously stated that the law should also help to resolve the disagreement of some Czech politicians with the introduction of the European Union directive on the possession of weapons.
Its adoption would allow shooters who will be part of the system to retain some of the weapons that the directive prohibits.
Startups That Will Help Your Company Not Become Another Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure the level of employee satisfaction of her e-commerce startup, but did not find the appropriate survey.
The answers were often inaccurate, useless, or even misleading.
And despite promising anonymity to the survey, some employees expressed their mistrust of the entire process.
“I was looking for consistency and objectivity,” said Errett, owner of the San Francisco-based e-commerce hair care company Madison Reed, which employs 75 people.
He asked for help from outside.
New HR startups are constantly appearing on the market, helping companies with employee satisfaction surveys.
By creating and licensing software with the specific purpose of measuring employee obligations, startups allow companies to conduct rapid voting, target specific teams and demographic groups, and offer complete anonymity to employees and a hotline for contacting the complainants and informing them.
“There are tools like Strava and Fitbit on the market that monitor your health, but where is Fitbit for your company?” said Jim Barnett, co-founder and CEO of Reedwood City-based startup Glint.
Errett said Glint made her more aware of what her employees were thinking and feeling in three years.
In addition to quick surveys and voting of specific teams, Glint offers a company temperature map and a seamless overview of the groups with the highest number of complaints, as well as an overview of managers with low ratings - allowing the user to work on the fix.
Companies are beginning to realize that it is necessary to take care of the culture of the work environment - in case they become another Uber - which is messed up in scandals after a former employee posted on his blog a post describing the corporate environment and harassment of employees who are open to taking action.
For startups like Glint, the demand for corporate culture surveys is a lucrative business opportunity.
According to the Let’s Talk Payments website, which deals with technical and financial progress, the value of the global control, regulation and compliance industry could exceed $118.8 billion by 2020.
Denver, Colorado-based Convercent, which helps companies prevent and detect inappropriate behavior, saw a slight increase in interest and activity earlier this year, just before the Uber scandal.
Among Convercent’s nearly 600 clients are Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Recently, Uber has also taken over its wings.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to send customizable “flash” surveys, collect confidential information in real time, and display temperature maps of problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous text hotline that allows employees to report inappropriate behavior.
If the Director-General is involved in the problem, the complaints are sent directly to the Board of Directors.
“The court of public opinion has authorized regulators,” said Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of Convercent.
If a company is convicted of mistreatment of its employees or unethical behavior – and if regulators do not intervene – it may face costly consequences as a result of customer boycotts, employee exhaustion or court proceedings, Quinlan added.
The Ruby Tuesday restaurant network, which employs over 25,000 people across 500 locations, has been using Convercent for over a year to raise employee awareness of corporate policies and procedures and provide an easy way to contact corporate management.
Previously, if an employee wanted to report any problem, he had to search for a phone number or e-mail to the management of the company, formally file a complaint and hope for a sound solution.
It was often a frightening and unpleasant experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesday’s chief executive, who said there had previously been no reliable way to track employee complaints.
Now that the company uses Convercent, it ensures quick detection and resolution of problems that have never before reached managers sitting in offices miles away from real complaints – such as discrimination, harassment or unfair treatment.
“It’s closer to a holistic, overall view of employee experience,” said Vitrano, who heads Ruby Tuesday’s risk management group.
“We also protect shareholders from legal disputes on the part of employees.”
The companies stopped taking employee ethics, values, and participation lightly in 2002 after accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed after Enron’s collapse over employee ethical rights abuses, Quinlan said.
But it wasn’t until “you lit up the whole thing on social media” that companies began to realize that in the online world they couldn’t just hide their bones in the closet.
“Before people started using technology to track ethics, they relied on faith,” Quinlan added.
Glint and Convercent offer their software in the form of a service for which the company pays regular fees.
It is a business model and an opportunity endorsed by bold capital investors who have supported both startups.
As part of its February campaign, Convercent selected a total of $10 million from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, and eventually took out capital of $47 million.
Glint earned $10 million from Bessemer Venture Partners in November and earned $60 million throughout the campaign.
These investments are hardly surprising given the reciprocal nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
The growing number of surveys clearly confirms that today’s employees expect more from their workplace than ever before.
And in competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high wages and interesting projects are not the main advantage.
Employees want to see that they are accepted and appreciated and that they devote their time to a company that strives for a positive mission.
“If people are happy in their work, they feel that their voice is heard and that their work is rewarding, they strive for the success of the company,” said Nina McQueen, vice president of global benefits and employee benefits at LinkedIn, which uses Convercent and Glint.
Investors make money if companies prosper and companies thrive if their employees are satisfied.
And when an analytical tool emerges in the market that ensures employee engagement and commitment to the company, it’s no wonder that there are a lot of investors who will support this effort.
According to experts on working culture, it is important to have data on employee satisfaction.
But the data itself is useless unless the company takes the necessary steps.
The fact is that once the company requests feedback from its employees, there can be big changes.
And if the change does not happen quickly - in the worst case of all - it can cause frustration and disinterest of employees.
“Once you ask for 4,000 opinions, you have to be ready for 4,000 conversations,” said Russell Raath, chief consulting officer at Kotter International, who witnessed many companies relying too much on the data itself.
“Because as soon as you don’t get things done, employees begin to ask themselves, ‘Did they hear me at all?
Are they interested in me?
And if not, why should I care?'"
Madison Reed, who now conducts monthly employee surveys on a regular basis, will be able to solve the problem in one day thanks to Glint, Errett said.
After gathering feedback from employees who were frustrated by slow decision making and quality of communication, Errett was able to reorganize several teams within the company and start training communication to successfully solve the problem.
Ruby Tuesday is gaining a very important view of its employees and hopes that in the long term it will achieve high employment in an industry that is known for frequent redundancies.
“Unless you strive to create a transparent work environment, employees won’t believe you,” Vitrano added.
“And once you start losing employees, you lose customers.
And with the outflow of customers, the whole company collapses.”
Thursday was the warmest day.
Thursday, with 38.3 degrees, is the warmest day of the year in the Czech Republic.
It surpassed Tuesday, which was originally the warmest day of the year with 37.3 degrees.
This was reported by the staff of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
As of Tuesday, however, there were not many temperature records.
Vedra hit mainly Moravia, in Bohemia it was mostly cloudy.
On Tuesday, records were broken or leveled at 35 of the 145 weather stations measuring over 30 years.
On Thursday, it recorded a record of only nine long-term measuring stations.
Today’s temperature was the same as the previous record in 2013.
In Lednice, B<0xC5><0x99>eclav today, 37.4 degrees surpassed the original maximum by four tenths of a degree, and in Poho<0xC5><0x99>elice, Brno, the current 37.1 degrees surpassed the record by three tenths.
Both records, as with The Watchtower, date back to 2013.
High temperatures have appeared today mainly in the south and east of Moravia.
After Strá<0xC5><0xBE>nice there was the biggest heat in Dyjakovice on Znojemsk and Broda nad Dyjí on B<0xC5><0x99>eclavsk, where mercury climbed to 37.8 degrees, but did not break the record.
On the other hand, for example in the western and northwestern Bohemia, according to the <0xC4><0x8C>HMU website, today’s highest temperatures were only about 22 degrees Celsius.
"Temperatures started to rise there just this late in the afternoon," the meteorologists said.
According to the <0xC4><0x8C>HMU, the current heat in the Czech Republic will gradually fade and more heavy rains could come on Sunday.
In most places in Moravia, however, the high temperatures will remain on Friday and in the southeastern part of Moravia on Saturday.
We've got such a mess in here.
Billionaires don’t get the same vote in the election as every single adult in the country.
They want to make decisions directly, and because not everyone is as bold as Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1>, who wants to own the state, they buy political parties.
The owner of Penta Marek Dospiva, along with other colleagues behind the water Martin Burda and Antonin Fry<0xC4><0x8D>, sponsors Robej<0xC5><0xA1>kovy Realisty.
The second life of the Civil Democratic Alliance is financed by the owner of the insurance company and the real estate entrepreneur Pavel Sehnal, who is also its chairman.
Convicted corrupter and king of Czech gambling Ivo Valente has acquired the Private Party.
The Agrofert political movement, as the mayor of Krom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>í<0xC5><0xBE> Jaroslav N<0xC4><0x9B>mec reluctantly named the project of Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1>, is a chapter in its own right.
The city’s billionaires have also recently been arrested.
He is Dalibor D<0xC4><0x9B>dek, owner of the Jablotron security facility.
In his own words, he enters politics in order to do good.
However, Grandpa’s entry into the mayor’s shirt was not very successful.
"I've never dreamed of small goals," he said at a press conference.
This means that my goal is for the YES movement, for the Mayor movement to win 20 percent in the elections.
Leckdo's laughing.
But the grandfather's rebuttal is more characteristic.
Billionaire Dalibor Grandfather is a man of strong opinions.
Although he intends to apply for the votes of the voters in the Mayor's shirt, he continues to support Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1>.
Grandfather Babi<0xC5><0xA1> supported him in the last parliamentary elections.
“Grandmother is not a sharp-edged speaker, and she does not rule the polite rhetoric of political snakes,” he wrote about him before the 2013 election.
But he definitely doesn’t go into politics because he wants to improve himself.
For me, Babi<0xC5><0xA1> will remain a hero.
He's willing to step out of his world he's in control and do something for all of us.
Shortly after the Mayors introduced him as a new reinforcement, he confessed his admiration for Babi<0xC5><0xA1> again.
And he said he wanted the Mayors to learn how to imagine a possible collaboration with the Grandmother.
Some may appreciate that the Grandfather does not change his opinions and is worth it no matter what kind of jersey he is wearing.
Others may speculate whether Grandmother is sending the Mayors to build her own jar of someone so awkward.
Others may ask whether Jablotron’s boss, perhaps with Agrofert’s boss, has gone bad in the store and is looking for another way to defend himself against his business rival.
But Grandpa’s first public performance didn’t just revolve around Grandma.
The grandfather promised to send ten million crowns to the mayors for the campaign.
And if they need more money, they'll send more.
A few years ago, it would be hard for anyone to pause over such a statement.
Zden<0xC4><0x9B>k Bakala, a court-approved gangster, threw millions on all sides before the 2010 elections.
The political division of the security agency Vít Bárta, the TOP 09 and the civil democrats came together to almost thirty million.
But today is a different time.
The law prohibits anyone from giving more than $3 million to a political party.
When the grandfather entered politics, he could at least study the rules of the game.
You may not have to ask yourself why we have such a bad reputation.
His first days in politics were crowned by a proposal for tax advantages for families with studied children.
People with higher education will come to us at about fifty thousand a month.
Those with base at less than twenty.
A man with fifty thousand is rich in the circumstances here.
The one with the twenties.
In Grandfather’s vision of society, the poor honestly pay taxes and the rich enjoy the benefits of the functioning of a welfare state in which they do not participate much.
The rich simply need to be helped not to deal with misery.
The mayors can congratulate each other on their new acquisition and Babi<0xC5><0xA1> can shake hands.
The rest of us, thanks to Grandpa, can confirm that billionaires are not good people.
The question is who to vote for.
For me, those who know the rules of the game and want to follow them.
Those who neither the members of their party nor the citizens and citizens of the state have as their employees and the country as their property.
And finally, those who want to live well in a rich country for all people, not just for some.
No one wanted Trump's paradise.
The villa complex had to be reduced by 234 million.
Selling real estate is sometimes not easy.
And often it doesn’t even help 11 bedrooms, a beautiful sea view, or the fact that the property is being sold by US President Donald Trump.
With the sale of the Le Chateau des Palmiers villa complex, the price went down by an incredible <0xC2><0xA3>8 million.
This was reported by Mirror.co.uk.
The brochure says about the land: "Hello, Donald J. Trump."
Escape to a place like no other.
But even the merger of a real estate company with the U.S. president did not defend an extreme price tag.
Donald Trump had to cut the price of his Caribbean home by an incredible <0xC2><0xA3>8 million.
The original price of the property was <0xC2><0xA3>21.5 million, the final price fell to <0xC2><0xA3>13 million.
Even after the discount, the villa complex stands at about 76 average apartments in the center of Prague.
And there's nothing to be surprised about.
The stunning 5 acre mansion on the Caribbean island of St. Martin has 12 full-fledged bathrooms, 11 bedrooms, many dining rooms, a gym and other rooms.
It consists of several buildings.
The property also has a swimming pool and a tennis court.
Dozens of palm trees are planted on the plot.
From the terrace there is a beautiful view of the sea.
According to real estate experts, the price has shown that the connection with the president is not enough to attract potential buyers.
Now the property is closer to the usual real estate prices on the island.
Trump bought the property in 2013.
According to speculation, he paid around <0xC2><0xA3>15 million.
The property was to be purchased for rental purposes.
Le Chateau des Palmiers was the most expensive property on the island of St. Martin.
With a new price, it ranks second.
The property in the neighborhood was valued at <0xC2><0xA3>13.5 million.
The NCAA has decided to end two workouts a day. For the Bruins, there are long days
Eleven o'clock in the morning, UCLA's American football players are swinging by the sidelines of the new school ground.
Some of them take off their jerseys and reveal their sweaty back, an undeniable sign of the first day of training camp.
For most team members, these few minutes of non-doing are supplemented by a noon break.
Players enrolled in the summer semester will leave for the rooms after a three-hour training session to study for the final exams before returning to the Wasserman Football Center for a meeting to be held next morning at 6:30 a.m.
"These guys will be a real monkey for the next three days," said Bruins coach Jim Mora shortly before Monday's blur on Tuesday.
By dropping two training sessions in one day, the NCAA wants to make it easier for players – paradoxically, the training days are even longer – at least until Friday, when the final exams end.
That’s why the first three UCLA training sessions are scheduled for 19:15 – to embed into the already overcrowded diaries of many students.
For the first time in six seasons that Mora has spent as a coach in Westwood, Bruins training camp starts a week earlier than last year and trainings are limited for the summer semester. It also has its influence on the decision to limit the number of trainings from two to one per day.
A total of eighteen training sessions are scheduled for August 20, after which formal preparations for the first game against the Texas A&M team, which will take place in September, will begin.
Mora was heard to support the NCAA’s decision, despite adding another item to the already loaded player diary.
"Three or four days are under a lot of stress and it's very exhausting for them," Mora said.
“But no one gave up, everyone is trying. They’re great.
I think that on Saturday, when we have more time, everything will calm down.”
UCLA will be closed after the end of the training camp, which will not be easy to see the clear lines of surrounding land from the adjoining parking lot and luxury hotel Luskin Center, which was occupied by players after picking up the protective net behind the goalpost.
The Bruins players are expected to occupy the hotel starting this week, but Mora admits that once the rooms are empty during the season, there could be a problem.
"The land will be guarded by the security service," Mora added.
“Safety is taken care of, but it’s not excluded that someone can rent a room and record our workouts.
Such material is well dealt with.
Fortunately, the hotel will be guarded by security, as well as the car park No. 8.
We will make the most of our resources.
I believe everything will be fine.
Everything is planned."
Facebook plans to check facts more closely to limit fake news
Facebook will send more potentially fake articles to third parties for review and display findings under the original posts in an effort to fight so-called “fake news,” the largest social network said on Thursday.
In a statement on its website, the Company writes that it will start using updated machine learning to detect possible hoaxes, which it will send to third parties for verification and potentially display the survey results below the original posts.
Facebook has been cited as one of the main sources of fake news, and many believe that these unconfirmed reports influenced last year’s election of the President of the United States.
In Europe, political debates are taking place on the whole issue. French voters are flooded with avalanche of fake news about the May presidential election, and Germany plans to impose a fine on social media in advance of the September elections if it does not quickly remove angry contributions.
Facebook said in a statement on Thursday that it plans to launch testing of a new fake news control feature in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
“In addition to displaying messages verified by third parties, people are asking for more content in order to be better informed and to be able to make the right decisions about what they can share,” Sara Su, Facebook’s product manager of news, said in a blog post.
She added that Facebook is continuing to test the “related articles” feature and is also working on other changes to reduce the number of fake messages.
Creating a Graphic Novel: The Story of A Castle in England
The small Scotney Castle recently starred in the Squeeze music video, and Margaret Thatcher also took refuge in it during the 1970s and 1980s.
Scotney, however, has witnessed 700 years of turbulent history from his cozy spot on the Bewl River in British Kent, which inspired the curly Jamie Rhodes of York County – known for his love of historical documents – to create a graphic novel.
“The look at the font of a man who is 300 years after death fascinates me,” Rhodes says with a serious face.
“When I hold a letter in my hand, I feel a personal connection.”
The graphic novel A Castle in England documents the lives of families who lived in Scotney Castle from the Middle Ages to the Edwardian period. Each story is illustrated by a different British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
However, this is not Rhodes' first archive-inspired book: he is also the author of Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories (2014), a collection inspired by the British Library documents - a project that was very emotional for him.
“I got a fingerprint on a letter written by a double agent in the 1970s who worked for the Jacobites,” he said.
“That’s his fingerprint.
And the letters always smell like smoke, because in those times you had to light a candle to read.
If I smell the letter now, 300 years later, it's like I'm back in time.
I love the archives!”
For someone so fascinated by the old papers, the support from the National Trust and the Arts Council England is the ability to spend nearly four months in the castle almost like a dream.
Rhodes spent his time exploring the Victorian “new” castle, browsing the archives and studying many treasures and curiosities, such as the head of the hyena on the wall and bottles that had been thrown in the trench for centuries.
He strolled through the plot and explored the ruins of the old castle, talking to hogs, gardeners and sometimes also to artists who worked on illustrations of his book.
In the night, he drank whiskey and wrote.
Scotney's confidential history is relatively large, as the National Trust did not gain access to the documents until after the death of her last heir, Elizabeth Hussey, in 2006.
When Rhodes arrived ten years later, the employees were only beginning to penetrate the archives that Rhodes described in words, as when "aristocrats of many centuries threw their hands with the words: 'Take it to the attic.'"
Journals, letters from the times of the British Empire, maps depicting property: “You may think the land dispute is boring,” said Rhodes, “but I came across one case where two families were dragging on birch.
Leave it, people!"
Some of the stories in the book use the castle as a bridge of reflection and dive deeper into English history, including a story called The Labourer, which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the English Uprising of 1381.
“I found a record of a 1380 castle uprising that was called the Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex in the book,” Rhodes said.
“The English uprising actually started in this area and I thought the uprising was a good starting point.
They may eventually have something to do with each other.”
Other stories are closely linked to the history of the castle - for example, The Priest, which tells the story of a Jesuit priest who had been hiding from Darrell's family for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or The Smuggler about an 18th-century smuggler named Arthur Darrell, who allegedly staged his own funeral when he filled the coffin with stones (which was discovered only a few years after the coffin was discovered).
Darrell's favorite family is Rhodes: "I was taken over by the male generation - the men of that time were always indebted and spending money on things they couldn't afford.
Different generations of the Darrells dealt with it by marrying rich or old ladies – I imagine they were handsome gentlemen who loved to mow their heads to the heirs.
With the end of his stay at the castle, Rhodes is looking for more adventures.
He recently returned from a two-week hike in the Finnish wilderness, where he drew inspiration for his next book on Eleämänmäki, a former sanatorium from the early 20th century that was engulfed by nature.
This is a special place for Scotney.
"I was sad when I left," he said.
"I thought to myself, 'Now to get back to real life.'"
Washington changes the conditions for granting a green card
The media published President Donald Trump’s words on the new U.S. immigration plan, under which there will also be a change in the granting of the green card.
The number of legal immigrants is expected to fall by 50,000 each year as a result of stricter rules for granting temporary work visas and restrictions on family visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and the president.
The bill will be presented to Congress soon.
“This bill will reduce poverty, raise wages, and save billions of dollars for taxpayers by changing the rules for issuing green cards to residents of other countries.
The law will limit the number of immigrants and replace the current scheme.
“The new application process will give preference to English-speaking applicants who are overburdened with funds and will demonstrate capabilities that will benefit our country,” Trump said in a statement.
Sexual robots are on the rise - we should beware
Just when it seemed that 2017 could not be more bizarre, a report about the technological development of sex robots appeared on the Internet.
Oh, yes.
Sex robots are really popular nowadays.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently released a statement on the development of sexual robots over the next five to ten years.
According to former professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at Sheffield University and co-founder of FRR Noel Sharkey, the rise of sexual robots must be taken seriously.
Customers can choose the color of the eyes, the shape of the nipples and the appearance of the nails of the robot.
“People are making fun of them, but sales are growing and we need to be prepared to see them more and more often,” Sharkey said in a statement.
Modern sexual aids are changing from inflatable pans to robotic women with silicone leather, which is pleasantly warm to the touch - of course, artificial intelligence that mimics human behavior.
The user can "edit" the robot to his image - from the color of the eyes and the shape of the warts to the appearance and color of the nails.
What is very disturbing, however, is the fact that many robots have their own “personality” that would shame Stepford’s mistress.
Modern inflatable virgins have evolved into robotic women with silicone leather.
The owner of the RealBotix robot can set his replacement woman different character traits, including shyness.
And then there’s the sexual robotic woman Roxxxy Gold of True Companion, which comes with pre-programmed personalities, including the “frigid Farrah”, which is characterized by a shy nature and the “wild Wendy” with an “adventure” nature.
“Roxxxy Gold’s personality is set to suit your personality as much as possible,” the company’s website reads.
He likes what he likes and vice versa.
He's even in the mood, just like people.
She may be tired, talkative, or “in the mood.”
The rise of sexual robots is alarming for several reasons - among which there is no confusion for real interpersonal relationships. Worrying are rather inferior female traits and violent allusions - e.g. frigid (read defiant) Farrah.
The company True Companion on its website resembles Roxxxy to a vibrator for men.
“If a woman can have a vibrator, why can’t a man have Roxxxy?”
However, sex robots are not just a fetish or a sexual aid.
Their emergence and near-perfect sophistication point to something darker and deeper rooted in our culture - a shift from ideal or gender equality towards a desire for captivating sex with an optional extra.
Of course, most men don’t buy a robotic woman, and while FRR talks about their growing popularity, sex robots still remain on the fringes of the general public’s interest.
However, this marginal interest can become a mirror set in modern times.
And most people are not weird or violent until the free market makes an excuse to do so.
It’s no coincidence that these sophisticated sex robots are emerging at a time when women around the world are exercising their rights and the White House is sitting on the president’s seat, who often expresses himself in a very disgraceful way at the address of a woman.
The scariest aspect of the series The Story of the Maid is not what we see - hung bodies and hollowed out eyes, rather the reality of these visions.
The story of the maid is a step in the right direction, but at the moment it seems to be a small step.
Sex robots should look as much as possible like real women (even with the rates of porn actresses).
Their creators design them to be pleasant to the touch and act at first glance as a real woman.
But when it comes to their “personality,” the robot can’t replace a real woman.
They can't break up with their partner or just leave.
They have no work, no history, nothing that would incite their independence or disturb their devotion to their master.
In other words, they are pleasant slaves.
Speech of the 21st Century: Servants.
The NBA star on the green arm.
Curry is fighting in California for a cut.
Star basketball player Stephen Curry did not lose despite a misguided first start at the premiere among professional golfers.
The two-time winner of the NBA's Most Useful Player Award played the Lower Web.com Tour series at the Ellie Mae Classic tournament in Hayward, California, the first round of 74 wins and will fight for the cut.
The Golden State player, who won his second NBA title with the Warriors this season, started very nervously and his first shot ended up in a drink holder in a golf cart parked at the fairway.
Even after that, he was not as accurate between the holes as under the basketball basket, yet he left behind a dozen professionals with a balance of four blows over the pair.
"It wasn't the perfect way to start, having to call the referee right after the first shot, but then it got a little sad," Curry said, with a huge shaking on him.
It was very nervous to fire the first shot at the tournament, but it was all I hoped for.
"If you told me I'd play 74 in the first round, I'd take it immediately," he added.
If Curry manages to fight with a cut that will probably be set two hits below par, he will become the first representative of another sport to do so on the Web.com Tour.
"I want to play better next time, and now that I've got rid of the binge, maybe it'll work," said the enthusiastic golfer, who has already played in celebrity tournaments and mixed competitions for amateurs and professionals in the past.
In Hayward, he starts for the first time in a tournament that falls under the PGA.
To participate in Ellie Mae Classic, he obtained a sponsorship exemption and retained amateur status.
The Web.com Tour Series is about one category under the elite PGA Tour.
Trump's great victory?
Mitt Romney is the embodiment of common sense.
An undeniable mark of the Trump era is the political rift that divides American voters and, on a micro-scale, interrupts entire families.
During the Christmas and Thanksgiving period, the American newspapers were overwhelmed with advice on how to deal with relatives who voted for Trump.
We're supposed to be just waiting for him to let our nerves go.
However, less attention is paid to Trump’s ability to merge the family.
I’m talking about it because this week my cousin, a leftist poet and fan, who lives in Chicago and has been paying for a Republican dummy in our family for a long time, came to visit me in New York.
She reminded me that seductiveness in the face of a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
Now, with Trump in the White House, all of a sudden the whole family — including all of the Republican siblings she’s been quarreling with about politics for years — is on the same wavelength.
It is a good thing to have dinner at the family table; but I am surprised that in the wider context it presents a significant risk.
Trump is strengthening the left, but the negative effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.
When we talk about “normalization” and Trump, we are referring to the frightening possibility that his jokes might one day lose their appeal.
But there is an even more awful long-term scenario in which Trump “normalizes” right-wing Republicans who, contrary to his standards, will suddenly embody what might be called rational.
In these today, with nostalgia in my heart, I remember Mitt Romney and his version of the crazy act - a dog on the roof of a car, a 14% income tax (at least we were aware of his tax return) - of which both examples look like very mild overtakings compared to Trump.
After Trump’s departure, it will be enough for the subsequent Republican candidate to be at least normal, which will be a tremendous improvement.
We took advantage of my cousin's visits and took the kids to Central Park on the largest wheel drive running the New York Department of Parks - for your three dollars you won't find a better use if you don't need caffeine.
The horses are huge, the center roller is covered with fiberglass - clowns and animals are filming and staring at their own shoulders in horror - a completely gloomy look, and the clinking music is strangely reminiscent of public transport.
Many clichés will soon get tired: the view from high-rise buildings, the panorama turns, instead of breathing in the atmosphere, and the reality of the city does not suit your imagination.
Forty-five years later, I still didn’t move through the fact that Swiss Cottage isn’t actually Swiss cheese – not counting theme pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage – but the London subway station.
The ride in Central Park, however, evokes a remarkably magical experience, to the extent that two two-year-old children, as well as two mature women, have great fun on it.
If I could rate the wheel, it would earn a maximum of points, but fortunately no one asks.
This week I had a similar experience in the store when I was asked to evaluate my “experience” on a scale of one to five when paying by credit card.
In a cafe on the corner of my street, it's the same thing, with the difference that I can add a 15% tip to the rating for something I buy at the counter.
Not only does it slow down the otherwise fast sales, but the waitress is thus forced to rub in favor of shoppers when it is not necessary.
The woman at the store apologized to me with a smile when I reluctantly rated my five-star credit card transfer.
Oscar Pistorius transferred from prison to hospital for chest pain
This is the second time Pistorius has been taken to hospital.
Last year, he was treated for cuts to his wrist, which the prison said he had caused himself after falling into a cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after appealing the original conviction for murder.
He killed his girlfriend Steenkamp early in the morning on Valentine's Day in 2013 with several gunshot wounds through the door of the toilet cabinet in his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed to have mistaken her for a thief.
The plaintiffs announced their intention to appeal again, this time against the six-year sentence of Pistorius, which they said was too mild.
The National Prosecuting Authority said it would appeal to the South African Supreme Court and the trial would take place later this year.
If he succeeds, Pistorius could be sentenced to up to 15 years.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
For the first time in history, she gave birth to a captive-bred panda who mates in the wild.
The Panda Rescue Program is a huge success.
The center is trying to expand the genofond of pandas kept in captivity.
A worker at the Chang Chung Center told New China that panda breeding was at great risk from a kinship.
At the end of last year, only 471 pandas lived in captivity.
In the wild, only 2,000 of them survive.
Trying to pair captured pandas with these wild ones is the first step to helping the breeding of pandas to protect this species.
The 15-year-old Cchao-cchao was released into the nature reserve at the beginning of the pandi mating period on March 11.
Thanks to the tracking device on the neck, scientists were able to observe every step of it.
She met her chosen one, Cchao-cchao, 12 days later.
The sexual intercourse with the panda male lasted for a minute and a half and was successful.
Even this can be considered a small miracle, because panda males are not considered the most successful lovers of the animal kingdom.
Males are quite poor at estimating the time when the female is ready, in addition, they are often confused and have no idea what to do.
The baby was born healthy and, even as Chao-chao had an extraordinary appetite during pregnancy, she weighed 216 grams after childbirth.
The average weight of a newborn panda is 70 grams lower.
Two Bulgarians Arrested for Illegal Camping in Greece
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has announced the arrest of two Bulgarian tourists on the territory of Greece for illegal camping, the statement quoted bTV.
A group of tourists, including two Bulgarians, was detained on August 1 in the morning by Sithonian police.
They were all released on the same day, but the investigation continues.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs told bTV that Bulgarian tourists were later released.
The Greek authorities have tightened the rules of free camping and imposed strict fines on anyone caught in a place where camping is not allowed.
Checks will take place throughout the season.
The ministry said the court could impose a fine.
After the first round of the British Open, Spilk is in 50th place.
Golfer Klára Spilková ranks 50th after the first round of the British Open major.
The playground in the Scottish Kingsbarns bypassed the score one punch under the pair when she played three birdies and two bogeys.
Twenty-two-year-old Czech player has so much hope that the famous major for the first time will go through a cute.
Entering the $3.25 million competition was best-selling American star Michelle Wie, who won the first round of the 64-innings field, eight under the pair.
Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands are withdrawing millions of toxic eggs from the market.
The Netherlands itself has already temporarily closed 180 poultry houses as a result of the incident.
The Dutch Food Safety Supervisory Authority (NVWA) said it was investigating 20 percent of all Dutch poultry, meaning 80 percent of the eggs on the market are harmless.
The Authority stressed that the risk is represented only by a limited number of types of eggs identifiable by specific numbers.
According to the German authorities, the amount of toxic substance in eggs is small and does not pose a danger to adults, but it is a potential threat to children.
SVS spokesman Petr Majer said that eggs and chickens from the Netherlands and Belgium, where authorities have also agreed to close farms, have not been brought to the Czech Republic recently.
Veterinarians, however, will take random samples of eggs and chicken meat originating in Belgium, the Netherlands, France, Italy, Germany and Poland, where problem markers of the insecticide have appeared on the markets.
Eggs from Belgium were on the Czech market for the last time in April and eggs from the Netherlands for the last time in May, according to the veterinary authorities.
Chicken meat from Belgium last appeared in the Czech Republic in June.
In the Czech Republic, however, there is a certain amount of chicken meat from the Netherlands.
Fipronil is a substance that is part of the preparations against fleas, everything and ticks.
However, it must not be given to animals whose meat is consumed by humans.
The World Health Organization (WHO) considers the drug to be mildly toxic.
Its high doses lead to a feeling of nausea and dizziness.
Riga is beautiful, I will miss it, says goalkeeper Sedlá<0xC4><0x8D>ek and is looking for engagement.
I'd like to catch ten more years.
"Maybe I'll come back there someday," smiled the 27-year-old Sedlá<0xC4><0x8D>ek, who could start the season in a Zlín jersey.
It depends on whether he gets involved before the start of the new year.
What were the four years you spent in Latvia?
If I had to rate it as in school, it would be in three.
The first year I did not catch much, I had an experienced goalkeeper in front of me.
I've been studying.
The second year I started catching.
In the third season, I thought they would give me more space.
But they brought in a new goalkeeper, with whom I alternated again.
Last year, I assumed I'd catch it all the time.
But in the first ten games, we only got five points, so the coaches started to shoot.
At the end of the day, my friend caught more.
But that's how it's done.
They wanted to play it for next season.
How was life in Riga?
Awesome.
It is a small Prague.
A beautiful, European, historic city.
I'm gonna miss him.
I found a girlfriend there.
We're in our third year together, we're getting married next year.
So I brought something.
How difficult is KHL for goalkeepers?
The top 10 teams are really good.
Then there are teams like us or Slovan, who have to change their playing style against them.
Skill is on the other side, so you have to replace it with something.
That means playing more backwards, fighting more.
I didn't see a problem in the width of the playground.
The difference is that the Russians want to play in the void.
They shoot less, and even if they have a half-empty goal in front of them, they prefer to record.
There are more shootings in the Czech Republic.
Didn't you have a problem traveling and moving across seven time zones?
If you don't have a family, it's not a problem.
He can sleep in peace.
The program is usually done in such a way that you play maybe four matches outside and then you have two days off.
How do Latvians feel about their club in the KHL?
As a national team.
The whole of Latvia watches hockey, along with basketball it is a national sport.
They're all fans.
Even though it didn’t work out, a lot of people went.
Did Dinamo’s presence in the KHL help Latvia nearly reach the quarter-finals at this year’s World Cup?
KHL has been playing since 2008 and Dinamo has been there since the beginning.
And since then, their results at the World Cup have started to go up.
At the 2014 Olympics in Sochi, they fell in the quarterfinals with Canada just 1-2.
That was an incredible result for them.
Thanks to KHL, they have reached a higher level.
More and more Latvian players are heading to the Czech extraliga.
Roberts Bukarts was established in Zlín and before signing the contract is Ralfs Freibergs.
Why do so many people come here?
They’re not bad players, they’re really good players.
The teams here are looking for cheaper and younger players from abroad, Latvians are among them.
It's a natural direction.
KHL starts in three weeks.
Why are you still without engagement?
At the beginning of February, I knew that I would not continue in Riga.
That's when we started looking for something.
Sparta was on the table.
But because they didn’t have a budget for the goalkeeper, we didn’t make a deal.
Then it was a classic.
We talked with different teams, but in the final they decided for someone else.
So I'm training at home in Zlín and I'll wait for something to show up.
Aren't you nervous about it?
That's what I was four years ago when I left here and didn't know what was going to happen.
The current situation is not the best, on the other hand, I am at home after some time.
I caught something in the KHL, so I'm taking it differently.
The question is when and where to sign.
How real is the option that you start a new year in Zlín?
Anything can happen.
We'll see what happens in a month, where it's going to sprout.
All I can do now is wait for the agent to arrange.
Do you prefer any competition?
Last season wasn’t for me to choose from.
So I'm waiting for the phone.
The government’s flight continues.
In January of this year I wrote in the article With the care of a proper farmer? also about the camp in Lety u Orlík.
The essence of the problem remains the same, so I will allow myself to recall the key passage of the article.
The camp in the years has been talked about for many years.
For readers who do not know exactly what it is, it will probably be best if they take a look at, for example, the official site of the cultural monument of the Holy Place of Lety.
There he learns in the introduction of the historical overview that the camp stood two kilometers east of the village of Lety, that from 8 August 1940 it served as a labor camp, from 1 January 1942 it was a collection camp and from 2 August 1942 it became a gypsy camp.
The next text describes the course of life in the camp, including inhuman conditions, until March 1943, when the first summer prisoners were included in Auschwitz transport.
On 4 April 1943, 370 people were transported to the extermination camp by the largest transport.
There were 420 of them.
A very sad history of the immense sufferings of human beings caused by human beings and perverted ideology.
There is no dispute that these events need to be constantly remembered.
There is also no dispute that this commemoration should take place at the memorial in the place of the suffering experienced by these people.
The problem is elsewhere.
During socialism, the camp was somewhat forgotten and in the 70s of the 20th century it was built near and on part of the former camp.
The history of the camp was accidentally discovered in 1992 by the American Paul Polansky, in 1995 a monument was unveiled in the Years.
In the mid-1990s, the government promised to buy and destroy pigs, but that has not yet happened.
In 1998 the monument was declared a cultural monument and since 2009 its administration falls under the Lidice Monument.
In July 2013, the UN Human Rights Committee called on the Czech Republic to close the pork market.
So many very brief facts about the post-war fate of the camp.
It was only in the autumn of last year that the government approved the purchase of pork and decided to draw up an expert opinion to determine the price.
According to the Minister of Agriculture, the government will then buy pigs.
According to Minister of Culture Herman, "some numbers exist, but I would probably miss those intentions if I went with them in public."
We will see what the expert opinion will bring.
According to some unofficial estimates, it can be hundreds of millions, according to others, the price can reach up to a billion.
In any case, it will not be a cheap thing.
And yet only a few hundred meters from the former camp stands a monument, in whose renovation the state invested almost ten million crowns in 2010.
Even if the entire transaction was financed by the UN Human Rights Committee, which is not apparently in danger, I believe it would be a waste of money.
Doesn’t the government have other priorities?
A memorial, a dignified place of worship, stands the will of history practically in the immediate vicinity of the tragedy, and anyone who wishes can worship the memorial of the suffering and murdered.
I don't see any reason to change this!
Let's leave it as it is, and keep the potable place with the utmost care.
The property entrusted, and therefore also the money of taxpayers, should be handled by the responsible person, in this case the Government of the Czech Republic, with the care of a proper businessman.
At least with one, as in your own company!
Of course, the Minister of Finance and Deputy Prime Minister is not the whole government.
But still, from the point of view of the above facts, I see the slogan of the leader of the ANO movement only as an empty pre-election proclamation.
In May of this year, I went to look directly at the place.
Very decent access road, well-equipped parking, replicas of wooden camp houses.
In one exhibition, in the other integrated toilet with running water.
A small natural amphitheater with the possibility of sitting and overlooking its own dining area, which is created from stones placed in a gentle slope.
Lots of flowers and wreaths.
All attributes corresponding to the meaning of this place as it fits and belongs.
Archaeological research is currently underway at the site of the original camp.
It would be reasonable to consider whether it would not be possible, for example, to preserve part of the exposed foundations and to make them at least visually accessible in an appropriate manner.
Minister of Culture, Daniel Herman, has been working in this direction.
If he succeeds in promoting the purchase of pigs for state money in the government, it will be just another unfortunate step in his already rather problematic role as Minister of Culture.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate can alleviate the symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
For your digestive system, red meat and dairy products can be a nightmare.
However, a new study suggests the opposite: a diet rich in animal protein and dairy products could help relieve the symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease.
The incurable disease, which affects up to 1.3 million U.S. residents and 300,000 patients in the UK, causes abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea, weight loss, and extreme fatigue.
Patients are usually reminded not to eat meat and dairy products to alleviate symptoms, but researchers at Washington University have found that the essential amino acid tryptophan contained in the protein helps to create immune cells that support intestinal resistance.
Dr. Marco Colonna, the lead author of the study, explained that immune cells protect the gut and ensure the breakdown of harmful microbes from food.
The number of inflammatory cells is balanced by the number of cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging the sensitive tissue.
Once the bowls of the scales are inclined to the side of the inflammation, inflammatory bowel disease can occur.
As part of the research, the researchers found the presence of immune cells supporting the tolerance of the body in the stomach of mice with a specific bacterium.
This bacteria requires the presence of tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to form cells.
Professor Colonna said: “We have found a link between one type of bacteria – Lactobacillus reuteri – which is a common component of the gut microbiome and the development of cells that support the body’s tolerance.
The more tryptophan the mice had in their diet, the more immune cells they had.”
At the same time, he suggested that if it turns out that the same applies to humans, then the combination of L. reuteri and tryptophan-rich diets would help develop a more tolerable and less inflammatory intestinal environment.
Postgraduate researcher Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barraganwas, in a study of a certain type of immune cells supporting body tolerance, found that one group of test mice had these cells, while the other group of the same mice kept separately lacked cells.
It was derived from the fact that one group of mice has a different gut microbiome - a community of bacteria, viruses, and fungi that commonly reside in the gastrointestinal tract.
The intestines of mice were tested by DNA sorting, and the researchers found six types of bacteria in mice with immune cells that were missing from the second group of mice.
The mice, which were kept in a sterile environment and lacked a gut microbiome - so they did not develop this type of immune cells - were given L. reuteri bacteria - and created immune cells.
To understand how the bacteria affects the immune system, the researchers cultivated L. reuteri in fluid and then transferred small amounts of fluid - without the bacteria - to undeveloped immune cells that were stored in isolation.
Immune cells have evolved into tolerant cells.
After removal of the active ingredient from the liquid, it was found to be a by-product of a tryptophan metabolism known as indolyl-3-acetic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the diet of mice, the amount of these cells increased by 50 percent. After splitting doses of tryptophan at the same time, the number of cells decreased by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that humans have the same tolerant cells as mice, and most of us keep L. reuteri bacteria in our gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known whether by-products of tryptophan from L. reuteri cause cell development in humans in the same way as in mice, but defects in tryptophan-related genes have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan added: “Each of us should probably strive for the development of these cells because they control the inflammation of the inner surface of the intestines.
Potentially high levels of tryptophan in the presence of L. reuteri can increase cell populations."
José Mourinho considers signing a contract with Nemanj Mati<0xC4><0x87> and his transfer to Manchester United 'genius'
Manchester United have acquired a "genius" in the form of Nemanja Mati<0xC4><0x87> - at least that's what José Mourinho thinks after the defender made his debut in Wednesday's game against Sampdoria.
Mati<0xC4><0x87>, who has signed a <0xC2><0xA3>40 million contract, won the first match 2-1 in Dublin - the last pre-season match before the UEFA Super Cup, where United will meet Real Madrid on Tuesday - and impressed in his role as back-up alongside Paul Pogby and Andreas Pereira.
However, since he did not take part in the team's pre-season Asian tour, Mati<0xC4><0x87> did not form and played only 45 minutes, which according to Mourinho should be worked on before the start of the next Premier League season.
"He needs time, but he's experienced, intelligent, and he has a brilliant mind - he thinks footballically," Mourinho said.
"We can help him get in shape as soon as possible."
Like Mati<0xC4><0x87>, his new teammates Victor Lindelöf and Romelu Lukaku also played their first match at Aviva Stadium and Mourinho is slowly starting to form his eleventh for the next season.
An independent source announced this week that Mourinho still wants to sign a contract with three other players, but insists that the club has done a "fantastic job" bringing three of the four most important players to the team.
"Thank you to the club for helping me get three of the four players," he added.
“Four out of four would please me more, but I admit they did the best they could for me.”
The life challenge of the king of chicken skins Lady Pears.
He wants a lesson from Pohlreich!
This promising picture began to be drawn thanks to a new program on TV Prima Zden<0xC4><0x9B>k Academy.
The pear immediately blew out the chance.
"Dear Zden<0xC4><0x9B>k, I would like to apply to your cooking academy with this, because, hand in hand, I think I can learn a lot from you," he challenged him in a video on the social network.
And since the two of them have been fighting for several years, Lady hasn't forgotten to irritate him this time either.
"In return, I can teach you to snooze from diet chicken, American cucumbers, or invite you to water and show you why fried cheese is popular," said Hru<0xC5><0xA1>ka.
He really takes his participation in Pohlreich’s new show seriously.
It is time to move up the level and learn from the master.
"The question is what the boss says," he said to Lightning.
Pohlreich did not comment, however, because he was filming new parts of his next show Yes, boss!.
Only Prima reacted to Hru<0xC5><0xA1>ka’s participation in the culinary academy by taking the whole matter as his personal activity, which goes beyond television.
Hru<0xC5><0xA1>ka Pohlreich suffered a major blow in December 2004 with her first cook.
In a few days, it sold over 300,000 pieces!
The new program, which Prima presented yesterday at a press conference on the autumn broadcasting scheme, is an unfamiliar cooking school.
Pohlreich chooses his pupils from the audience and in twelve pieces he introduces them to twelve cooking techniques.
In the last part of his show Now Cooking Chef in November 2014, Zden<0xC4><0x9B>k had a crossed pear ironed on the back of his t-shirt.
If I had my face there, I would have laughed a lot.
"I'm just smiling over the pear - the pear is a healthy fruit and it has a lot of vitamins," Ladia responded.
He thinks of Lady's culinary art.
"Boiling according to Lada Khrushchev is not considered at home either, because I will not let my gastropunk go home," says the boss.
I really appreciate Pohlreich’s chicken, even according to him I make chicken on honey.
But his recipes will definitely not appear on my show," Hru<0xC5><0xA1>ka did not forgive himself.
He's an asshole!
He's not a cook for me, he's a TV clown.
"A gastronomic illiterate or a fool," Pohlreich said of Khrushchev in one lecture.
"I'm not twenty to be able to wave my hand over them, but I don't deal with them that way either," Hru<0xC5><0xA1>ka said.
British inventor uses microchip in his hand to unlock car and house by waving
The British inventor became the first person in the country with a microchip embedded in the body. With a simple wave of his hand, he can unlock the door from the house and office and even start the car.
Thirty-three-year-old Steven Northam has a tiny chip implanted between his thumb and index finger, and now offers the same service through his company BioTeq to companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology.
The procedure for implantation and adherence to treatment procedures is supervised by Dr. Geoff Watson, anesthesiologist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester.
The technology works on the same principle as the microchips implanted in dogs and cats, and the whole procedure takes 30 seconds.
Northam also offers a microchip-compatible door lock and car replacement service. The price of one lock is <0xC2><0xA3>300.
The married father of one child had the technology integrated into his home and his BMW Z4 car, which he started with a simple wave of his hand.
White House Requisition Costs Taxpayers Thousands of Dollars
The White House’s decision to fly a Navy helicopter to South Lawn to celebrate the U.S. manufacturing industry, which took place last month, came to $24,000, according to Navy records published by TIME Weekly.
The green-white helicopter Sikorsky VH-3D, also called Marine One in the presence of the president on board, was the culmination of the July 17 White House program, which was a parade of American design programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, and several senior White House officials watched a show of products from all 50 states.
A helicopter from Connecticut was displayed next to a yacht from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin, and a forklift truck from Mississippi.
A White House military officer issued a fragmentary order or FRAGO and requested the helicopter to be present less than 36 hours before the helicopter landed on South Lawn as part of an "extraordinary" event, Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1) records said.
"I wanted to make sure that you were aware of such a significant event," the HMX-1 commander wrote in an email to his superior, the deputy commander of the navy for the aviation the day before the event began.
The report suggested that the helicopter will arrive at South Lawn on July 17 at approximately 7:00 a.m. on the occasion of the parade, which is scheduled to begin at 3 p.m. and will remain in place until the entire site is completely cleared, which was scheduled between 6 p.m. and 9 p.m.
The email also stated that if there is a delay in departure from the White House, a replacement crew will be sent for the return flight due to the working time regulations.
The original crew remained on the scene that evening, along with the helicopter and the security guards.
From the records - obtained by TIME - it was not clear whether the second crew was eventually dispatched.
The Hatch Act prevents government officials from using government property for political purposes.
The records indicate that HMX-1 is investigating a possible breach of this Regulation.
“We were wondering if it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were assured that everything was okay,” the commander wrote.
"It sounds like you're being blocked," the deputy commander replied.
This show "Made in America" was designated by the White House as an official event and the Hatch Act would therefore not apply to it.
But the official events also have political subtexts.
In his participation in the event, the president advocated health reform, which passed through the Senate, and talked about efforts to keep government regulations in check.
The use of aviation vehicles such as Marine One or Air Force One for political purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents use them when traveling.
However, their presence for purely presentational reasons is unusual.
Trump ordered a check in February after the presidential plane drove in the background at his first meeting as part of the campaign in Melbourne, Florida. His Twitter account is overwhelmed with complaints about the use of the presidential plane by his predecessors.
“The White House is delighted with the ‘Made in America’ show, which features products from all 50 states that Americans make from American materials,” said Lindsay Walters, a spokeswoman for the White House.
Crews of HMX-1 helicopters often train landings in the Washington area and on the South Lawn and train possible arrivals with the President of the United States to the White House with maximum accuracy.
While Trump attended the G-20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 conducted 58 exercise landings at the White House.
The flight to the Made in America parade was part of the current crew training, the state official said.
The helicopter's unit flew on the same day as part of "non-presidential support missions" for another eleven hours.
The White House said no additional props were paid from taxpayers’ money.
A Sikorsky spokesman said the company was in no way interested in negotiating the helicopter’s exposure to South Lawn.
The HMX-1 does not keep budget records for presidential flights, and the exact cost of the parade is difficult to determine, according to the Navy.
According to the Ministry of Defense, the hourly price for fiscal year 2017, the refund of DoD expenses for VH-3D is $24,380 per flight hour.
The unit records a time of 30 minutes from the Marine Corps Air Facility Quantico base in Virginia and back.
The White House argues that the actual operating costs of helicopters are well below this amount.
“It is very misleading to state taxpayers’ costs on the basis of estimates for reimbursement of expenses,” Walters said.
“These estimates include personnel, maintenance, and many other hidden costs that are included in the annual costs.”
According to the 2015 RAND study, the reimbursement of DoD expenses does not include the cost of personnel, but includes the cost of fuel, maintenance and contract costs.
White House press secretary Sean Spicer defended the use of the helicopter for the purpose of the parade.
“The idea of the show taking place this week is to introduce products made in the United States,” Spicer said.
“I am aware that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud to contribute to the defense of our state, and that they provide jobs for hundreds, if not thousands of people.
I think, like most Americans, we are proud of the helicopter and other military facilities that countless American citizens are involved in producing.
This fact should be remembered."
It is not clear whether Trump was also looking at the helicopter during his tour of South Lawn. With certainty, it can only be said that he sat behind the wheel of one of the fire trucks.
Back in the White House, Trump spoke to a representative of Sikorsky and joked with the media about his own fleet of products.
"I know Sikorsky very well," said the President, "I own three of them."
A young woman was trapped in a swamp by Lake Máchov, the police rushed to her.
The girl went to the beach around 2 a.m. on Sunday.
Instead of bathing, she was trapped in the wetlands.
When she decided to ask a police officer for help on her cell phone, she had the last 12 percent of the battery.
"That's why the police soon lost contact with her," police spokeswoman Ivana Balakova said.
A few police patrols went to the place she roughly described, but finding a young woman was not easy at all.
"Some of the policemen had to navigate hundreds of meters of raccoon wetlands before they could feel the solid ground under their feet again," Balak said.
Likewise, she was missing.
The police were oriented according to the direction in which her call for help was coming.
"In order not to at least lose this connection, they agreed with her that she would be counting down out loud," the spokeswoman said.
Police found the woman only at three to five quarters in swamps in the locality of Born<0xC3><0xBD>.
She was on the verge of physical and mental strength and showed signs of hypothermia.
That is why the ambulance called took her to the Czecholyptic hospital.
Grandpa's relationship with Stan?
The desired bride becomes a sales girl.
That's a little ironic.
In his web project ledameslusny.cz as if a billionaire was basically telling voters that STAN suffers from a deficit of decent people.
And he also asserted that a politically dissatisfied party of rather lesser-known mayors and independents does not actually have a nationwide program for parliamentary elections.
Her electoral candidate will simply become a decent person after an interview with Grandpa, whatever political opinion he has.
Once upon a time, Vít Bárta started like this, and it didn't happen very decently.
In his pursuit of decent people and personalities, who will replace some of the mayors in the candidates, as Gazdík admitted, Grandfather also cancels the favorite argument of the head of STAN that the greatest value of the movement is political scrutiny and experienced mayors, traditionally the most popular politicians.
Now they're taking the place of swiftly picked up unknown personalities.
The total split with the populists, after which STAN changed the logo and slogan, Gazdik also explained that the movement does not want to lose its identity on the candidates of the populists.
But if STAN suspected of identity only a few at the time, after the arrival of Grandpa, the mere game of identity ends.
Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1> was not the only one who long stood against YES, but in the first joint press conference, Grandfather, who is publicly praised by Babi<0xC5><0xA1>, stated: "My goal is for the YES movement, that is, the Mayors movement to win twenty percent in the upcoming elections."
Let's hope he didn't confuse the movement.
The grandfather is a successful entrepreneur and a billionaire is certainly not a coincidence.
He often talks about politics like Babi<0xC5><0xA1>, but unlike him, he does not build his own political brand.
STAN has been reminiscent of a reality show rather than a real political party for some time now, and Grandpa’s helping hand seems to make the bride even more of a sales girl.
For some time STAN went with the TOP 09, then with the folks and now he is looking for decent people for change.
Let's hope someone gets in touch.
Police Dogs Trained in Bridge Overflight by Helicopter
Dogs specializing in the search for explosives and search dogs today practiced helicopter overflights at Lake Bridge.
The police dog must not be afraid of flying, said Petr Tomá<0xC5><0xA1>ek, the head of the police cynologists of the Uzbekistan region.
The training of a police dog takes about two years.
At the bridge, both the trained adults and those who are still undergoing training were trained.
In addition to the standard training, in which they were to detect sharp samples of explosives around the lake and search for the lost figurehead, all 12 animals had to board the helicopter and fly over the lake.
The main purpose of the exercise is to test the dogs in the helicopter.
In order to immediately reach the helicopter, the dog could go to work, so as not to have a problem with the flight of the helicopter.
"Until now, the helicopter, the dog goes and immediately searches," said Tomá<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
A dog that is restless or unable to start working immediately after the flight by helicopter is removed from training.
"They are usually kept by the dog handlers, for example, for the garden," Tomá<0xC5><0xA1>ek added.
The police have 76 dogs with different specializations in the <0xC3><0x9A>stí kraj.
There are German shepherds, but there are also Belgian shepherds.
The dog caretaker takes care of him from the puppy.
"He raises it himself, he prepares it for the service that the dog will do for us," Tomá<0xC5><0xA1>ek added.
The animal undergoes repeated veterinary examinations that may reveal any medical disabilities.
If the dog is healthy and fearless, pass the first tests in 20 months.
"It takes about two-and-a-half to three years," Tomá<0xC5><0xA1>ek added.
The length of service with the police depends on the health of the dog.
They usually serve up to eight to ten years.
Most of them live with their dogs.
Season 3 Trailer Narcos: Pablo Escobar Is Out of the Game and Cali Cartel Becomes the Centerpiece of Netflix's Hit Series
Despite the end of the second season of Narcos, when the killer Pablo Escobar is revealed, the Netflix series is far from over.
The third and fourth seasons have already received confirmation from the streaming service - the first one has already received the first trailer and a board of other negative characters.
In the third season, the DEA focuses on the richest drug cartel in the world: Cali Cartel.
Under the leadership of four influential patrons, they operate “as a Fortune 500 company,” with the only difference being that they escalate violent acts and pay more government officials.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) plays the brain of operations, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) is in charge of connections with Mexico, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) controls New York.
In the new trailer, Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Peña, a character recruiting U.S. and Colombian law enforcement officers in the fight against drugs.
Other actors include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishé and Arturo Castro.
The third season of Narcos will be premiered on September 1.
According to the UN, Afghan democracy relies on women in politics.
Elections can only be credible if they involve all members of the society, including women, the UN representative in Afghanistan said on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, the head of the U.N. Relief Mission, said hundreds of women are taking part in local elections, three women are running for vice president, and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overlooked," he said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can be fully representative and credible only if women participate in them, as well as in all related processes related to elections.
The local and presidential elections in Afghanistan will be held on April 5.
The Taliban have issued several threats against an election process that shifts international combat activity to a second round.
In this year’s election, for the first time ever, a democratically elected government is handing over its power to a peacefully succeeding government.
Haysom said the strong role of women will strengthen Afghanistan’s democracy.
The Afghan Independent Electoral Commission said that out of a total of 3.6 million registered voters, 1.2 million are women.
The unique brewery is again brewing beer.
For a good beer in a resurrected brewery.
The enthusiasm and honesty of the new owners returned to the life of the brewery in Lob<0xC4><0x8D>a u M<0xC5><0xA1>ena a few years ago.
The brewery first mentioned in 1586 has a Renaissance core and in the nineteenth century it was rebuilt into steam engine operation.
There followed years of bloom, when the brewery was famous mainly for dark beers.
Unfortunately, during World War II production was stopped and in 1984 the brewery was nationalized.
Since then, the buildings have served the state property.
The work of destruction was completed by the owners of the brewery after 1989.
The abandoned area was devastated and dismantled into building materials.
In 2007, however, a new hope shined in the form of new owners, architects Jana and Pavel Prouzov.
They began to repair the buildings with the utmost respect for the spirit of the building and every detail.
Carefully devoted and dedicated to the study of archival materials, trying to preserve the original materials and building elements.
The brewery has the same shape as in the nineteenth century, when its golden age began.
Their work was awarded with the declaration of the brewery as a cultural monument by the Ministry of Culture and the construction became part of the European Industrial Heritage Trails.
In 2015, the tradition of brewing beer was revived.
If you want to taste a great Lobe<0xC4><0x8D> beer in the picturesque landscape of Koko<0xC5><0x99>ínska, visit the brewery area.
When brewing beer here they use coconut water from the protected landscape area, malt from the fields of Lobe<0xC4><0x8D> and hops.
In the canteen you can taste the traditional light deck, but also dark beers and specialties.
And do not miss the tour of the brewery, which takes place on Saturday and Sunday at noon and at half past noon.
The largest artillery fortress in Czechoslovakia?
One of the largest forts of its kind on a global scale?
Such a unique structure was to be the fortress Stachelberg between Trutnov and <0xC5><0xBD>akler, at the top of the terrain ridge above the village of Babí.
It was originally supposed to be made up of up to twelve bunkers connected by a vast underground.
This was to be the headquarters, barracks, ammunition warehouses, material, power plant, machine room and hospital.
However, the Munich Agreement ended the construction.
In less than a year, a single massive reinforced concrete bunker was built and underground spaces were broken down.
Thanks to the enthusiasts of the Stachelberg Association, who began to reconstruct a unique building in the early 1990s, you can also take a look here.
Subterranean access is now 75 percent!
In addition to the T-S 73 infantry barracks with exhibition and underground, there is also an armed object of light fortification, two deployed infantry barracks, trenches and the educational trail Fortified Trutnovsko.
Refreshments, cosy gazebo and breathtaking views of the country are guaranteed!
This unique and beautiful Czech building has been listed next to such monuments as the Great Wall of China, the Port of Traian near Rome or the Assyrian Palace in Nineveh and Nimrud.
Chot<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xA1>ov Monastery originally from the beginning of the thirteenth century, which today is primarily a huge four-winged building of the convent above a beautiful garden.
The list, which he got to, but unfortunately belongs to unique buildings that are in danger of extinction.
However, the enthusiasts do not want to give up and organize a lot of events in support of the monastery.
One of them is another year of the Evening for the Chot<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xA1>ov Monastery this Saturday, August 5, where Vladimír Mi<0xC5><0xA1>ík and Ivan Hlas will perform, you will see fencing performances and you will look at the places of beautiful large buildings, which are usually inaccessible.
But most of all, you will enjoy the atmosphere of this great place.

Get to know the plant with one click.
The new free application Pl<0x40>ntNet will help students with the creation of herbalists and ordinary plant lovers.
When they’re wondering which plant they’ve just come across on a walk, this app will advise them.
All they will have to do is take a picture of the plant and the application itself will recognize what kind it is.
The new app, which is available for iOS and Android, was introduced on Tuesday to representatives of the Centre for Ethics and Environmental Education CEEV in the Mountain Park of Bratislava as part of the project Secret Life of the City.
Students from 50 Czech and Slovak schools also participated in the project, who photographed and added plants from their surroundings to the application database.
The newly created French application is free to download on the Secret Life of the City website.
The main goal of French programmers was to get as many people to contribute to the application with their images, thus increasing the number of plants that the application can recognize.
"Children who hold a tablet or mobile phone in their hands can now go to the forest," said Ivana Polá<0xC4><0x8D>ková, coordinator of the project.
Based on a sufficiently high-quality photo of the flower, leaf or fruit of the plant, the application can recognize its name within a few seconds, which is then assigned in Czech and Slovak under the photo.
The French allowed us to translate the application into Slovak and Czech in the Secret Life of the City project.
It is therefore welcome for users to contribute an image of a plant that is not yet in the database after creating an account in the application.
"The French will evaluate whether it is useful and then add it to the database," Polá<0xC4><0x8D>ková said.
GMB's concerns about investing in McVitie's factory in Glasgow
Trade unions demand assurances from the managers of McVitie's biscuit maker about a long-term commitment to production at the Glasgow plant.
The Scottish trade union GMB said the company was silent about any investment in the Tollcross plant for the time being.
The factory employs more than 500 employees who produce, among other products, Hobnob and Rich Tea cookies.
McVitie’s owner, Pladis, said it had invested more than <0xC2><0xA3>5 million in the entire area over the past few years.
She added that employees and trade union representatives will be "among the first to be informed" in the event of changes to the factory's operations.
In a letter to the construction company, GMB's Scottish trade unions expressed concerns that McVitie's "will not live up to its promises to finance and modernize production lines."
GMB chief organizer Drew Duffy added: “The fact that we have not received a clear response from the builder regarding the needs of the company and the future investment plan in Tollcross is very worrying for our members.
Generations of many families have worked here, and employees come mostly from the local community and the Glasgow area, where work at the factory here is a critical pillar of decent employment in the area of high unemployment and social exclusion.
In terms of work, wages and profitability – and despite the prospect of Brexit, rising costs of living and falling production – the eastern part of Glasgow needs a desperately prosperous manufacturer like McVitie’s.”
A spokesperson for Pladis said: “Builder Tollcross received a letter from GMB yesterday and the company will issue a statement as soon as possible as we appreciate the continued commitment to employees and trade union representatives.
A regular meeting with employees and representatives of GMB in Tollcross took place two months ago and many issues were openly discussed at this meeting.
We have told our employees that, as in all companies operating in extremely competitive and uncertain economic conditions, we evaluate our operations on a regular basis, which applies to all our operations, so that we can continue to successfully compete with others.
She added: “In recent years, we have invested <0xC2><0xA3>5 million in Tollcross, especially in production lines and operational efficiency.
We value the heritage of Tollcross and the locality very much and in the event of any changes in the operation of the factory here, employees and representatives of the trade unions will be informed immediately."
Did PSG warn Barcelona about Neymar’s move three years ago?
La Liga may regret its interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not allow in its attempt to win Neymar on its side after storing <0xC2><0xA3>189 million, the amount needed to redeem Neymar from the contract, but did this French team warn Barcelona of its record-breaking raid three years ago?
The Ligue 1 club is set to break more than twice the previous record amount for the transfer of Paul Pogby to Manchester United, who paid <0xC2><0xA3>89 million for him last season.
After confirming and completing the transfer, Neymar will become the most expensive player in the world and the highest-paid professional athlete in the world – after taxation, he will collect over <0xC2><0xA3>500,000 per week from PSG.
Barcelona is outraged by the way Neymar has withdrawn from his contract, despite a confidential source confirming that the club has always tried to satisfy Neymar in everything since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world alerted to this fact three years ago by the president of PSG?
When Manchester City expressed interest in Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi warned all clubs that would be interested in taking over one of PSG's top players.
"I'm not afraid, because once someone tries to get one of our players, then we're definitely going to address one of their players," Al-Khelaifi said.
“We respect all clubs.
But if they try to win one of our players, they will face consequences."
Barcelona seems to have crossed the imaginary line when it expressed interest in PSG defender Marc Verratti in the summer.
PSG has made it clear that it will not allow the departure of the Italian representative under any circumstances, so it is possible that Barcelona is now swallowing a bitter pill with the departure of Neymar.
Who will explain the sanctions?
Does political punishment have broadly comprehensible rules?
Donald Trump has called for anti-Russian sanctions.
The United States imposed sanctions on Venezuelan President Maduro.
And a day earlier, Trump wrote that China is doing nothing with the North Korean threat and that it will not go on.
Even the thought of sanctions like the straw from the shoe.
Those things can't be thrown into one bag.
Maduro’s Venezuela has indeed embarked on a path of dictatorship, if not totalitarianism.
China is not doing what the U.S. president wants.
Russia is a chapter in itself.
But if someone wanted to summarize all this so that even the ordinary voter, American, European or otherwise, would understand what it is and what system of rules the policy of sanctions is based on, it would be almost impossible.
In the sanctions against Russia, President Trump only touches on what President Obama has already prepared, only put an implementing seal on it.
Then why all the fuss?
Last year, Europe feared that if Trump won the U.S. election, it would embrace Putin and lift sanctions.
That's a terrible idea.
In practice, however, it is the opposite.
With Trump, sanctions are not released, but tightened.
Europe is even more frightened.
German Minister Zypries says Trump’s sanctions are in violation of international law.
Is it like the kosher is just sanctions approved by the UN Security Council?
But then there are no kosher or anti-Russian EU sanctions.
European Commission chief Juncker complains that Trump’s sanctions threaten the EU’s energy security.
It's like they're supposed to use sanctions just so weak they don't threaten anyone?
Ordinary voters win.
For three years, he heard that the fate of anti-Russian sanctions depends only on the implementation of the Minsk ceasefire agreements in Ukraine.
It is now becoming clear that this is the EU's energy security.
The electorate is spreading.
Sanctions are imposed on Russia because it is too much mounted where it does not have.
China is haunted by the fact that it mounts little.
The Venezuelan president is being punished for building a dictatorship within his country’s borders.
All these punishments, or just considerations, have their rationality.
But does anyone see a system, a rule or a rule in it?
Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1>: I don’t think about working with Okamura.
Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1> is married, crossing the republic with his visionary book and finalizing the electoral program.
In addition to the Pardubice region, all candidates are already ready.
In his words, he did not intervene.
He even agreed that the Moravian-Silesian region should be led by the hetman and shadow minister of education, Ivo Vondrák.
"But if he succeeds, he will have to choose whether he wants to be a member or a keeper," Babi<0xC5><0xA1> said.
You have angered many representatives and national politicians with your thesis that directly elected mayors and mayors should run the municipalities and cities themselves, only with managers.
You're serious?
That's not the way it was.
I am a supporter of direct democracy, we elect the president directly, and I believe that we should also elect mayors and mayors.
In my book, I'm not talking about interfering with representatives, they can be there.
The question is how many there will be.
When I presented your book What I dream about when I accidentally sleep, I heard in my own ear that you were talking about abolishing representations.
I don't remember that.
I was talking about direct election and a reduction in the number of delegates.
New York City, with a population of nine million, has five districts and 51 representatives.
Prague, with 1.2 million citizens, has 1,171 representatives.
And the mayor is accusing her of building little and not preparing big projects, but she has no competence for it.
The same is true of a government that has only been run by two people in our history, Klaus and Zeman.
Which I'm not saying they did well.
The current Prime Minister is not running anything, he is only moderating the debate.
That's not how it works.
Is that why you want to enforce the majority system?
It would be perfect, but it's hard to get through.
We only have a change to a one-round Senate election on our agenda.
We have also proposed a sliding mandate of ministers and an amendment to the rules of procedure of the House in order to avoid unnecessary exhibitions of Members who are to work mainly in committees and committees, not to be presented at meetings of the House.
It is certainly not true that I want to destroy the parliamentary system.
But that’s exactly what your opponents are afraid of.
That as a dictator you will rule the government, control the House with 101 deputies, abolish the counties and the Senate, and through grateful mayors and mayors you will dominate the whole country.
That's certainly not the case.
There is nothing wrong with debating the number of Members.
French President Macron has announced a reduction of the legislature by a third, while there are 57,000 French people per legislator, while in our country it is 17,000 Czechs.
However, no one blames Macron for threatening democracy.
Even if someone wins a majority in the Czech Republic, we have mechanisms that would prevent them from making any dramatic changes.
But the stakes for those who have a parliamentary majority are large, just look at Poland or Hungary.
There is no such thing in the case of the YES movement.
We just need a team in the government to work for the people, not for their partnerships or resorts.
I do not understand, for example, why we have not been able to agree that only the salaries of teachers, cultural workers and social services will be increased.
Why did they override me and add 21 percent to the GIBS members who are already taking 60,000?
Is that what you, as Prime Minister, would do?
The prime minister is to intervene when ministers behave uneconomically, confuse the government with the travel agency, and would like to do business for state money like Marian Jure<0xC4><0x8D>ka, who wanted to buy forests in Romania and land in Africa.
Ministers should not argue in the government, they should argue outside the government.
The finished material must go to the cabinet, there is no room for coalition rifts, force votes and deals, there is to be decided.
How do you want to have a coherent team when ministers behave mainly in a bipartisan manner?
Above the parties is a constitutional law.
When it came to breaking the bread, Sobotka said the coalition treaty was invalid and kicked Babi<0xC5><0xA1> out of government.
Any Prime Minister can do that.
However, if he is a personality and has management skills, such a flat gesture is not necessary.
It measures everyone the same and requires perfect performance from everyone.
Do you know who you would propose to be the Minister of Finance?
I'm not thinking about it at all, because we probably won't be in that government, nobody wants to work with us, even though I don't know what I've done so terrible.
So much skepticism is not in place.
The mayors have got an entrepreneur Grandfather, who would like to work with you, maybe the wing of your beloved Ji<0xC5><0x99>í <0xC4><0x8C>unk will win.
I don't think so.
The <0xC4><0x8C>SSD is led by Lubomír Zaorálek, who does not exclude the coalition with the UN, and Václav Klaus Jr., who will not be against, may be promoted in the ODS.
I would leave it to the voters.
Vice Prime Minister and Vice-President of the ANO Richard Brabec said that you have many points in common with SPD Tomia Okamura, for example in the field of economics.
So the Okamurians are considered a coalition partner?
Mr. Brabec says he didn't say it that way.
Mr. Okamura has his political history, he ran as a puppet of Vít Bárta for VV, then he got money from Dawn for his company, there was some coup.
He is, of course, a distinguished personality.
It's a little brown, though.
If I take his program, he has a wide range of people involved in the management of society, direct democracy, and that can be agreed upon.
I'm not asking you that at all.
I wonder if a person who has xenophobic views is acceptable to you, speaks at demonstrations with weaknesses and wants to leave the EU?
We are not considering cooperating with Mr. Okamura's side, I can't imagine.
It is obvious that he went into politics to profit from it.
What about the silent support of the Communists for your minority government?
I can’t imagine it, but the voters will decide.
It will be about negotiating the winner with the second in a row, but God knows who will be the winner and who will be the two.
Of course, it is important that they are able to agree on the coalition government’s agenda.
Let’s return to your efforts to run the state as a company.
But the government just has to follow, Prime Minister Sobotka let everything evade, never decided.
Coalition issues such as <0xC4><0x8C>EB or EGAP did not work.
After all, Sobotka is his puppet, and that, in my opinion, was the reason why he threw me out.
Once he did, <0xC4><0x8C>EZ controlled the Czech government.
It is unbelievable that the Prime Minister has passed a resolution written by the management of the CEZ, which imposes on the Minister of Finance how he is to vote at the general meeting of the CEZ.
If you become Prime Minister, will you change the staff conditions in the Supervisory Board and replace the top management of <0xC4><0x8C>EZ?
Jesus Christ, if I'm prime minister, I'll see.
I'm not him yet.
It is rumored that CEZ has already sent signals in your direction.
He would like to exchange good cooperation with <0xC4><0x8C>SSD for even better with ANO.
Maybe after the election everything will go on.
I don't know anything about that.
I don't have any Humble or Rose lobbyists, I'm a separate unit and I don't deal with this at all.
Then answer it straight.
If you become the head of government, will you seek to exchange the leadership of <0xC4><0x8C>EZ, Czech Television or the General Health Insurance Company, i.e. the institutions that you criticize?
I would like to see a transparent society.
So far, he has done what he wanted for years, thanks to commissions for traditional political parties.
It is enough to check Mr. Schwarzenberg's statements.
Although he has a majority in the CEZ, he never managed it, he was only there in numbers, which is wrong.
It's a trivial thing for me.
<0xC4><0x8C>EZ is to take Dukovany, appreciate them, put them into a subsidiary, arrange financing, make a supplier competition or get a co-investor and build a new nuclear block.
The concept that the state is to finance and build new nuclear blocks is absurd.
And the Czech TV?
Some of her shows are running a permanent purpose campaign against me, but I don’t have and will not have any competence to fire anyone.
But to control, yes.
I don't want to control anyone.
I'm just saying that citizens pay about 7.2 billion per year for public broadcasting and television, but they don't really know how these institutions manage.
How come they don't know?
After all, the House approves the report on their management, which has a direct impact on the positions of the CEOs of the Czech Republic and the Czech Republic.
Look how those reports are dealt with, the super power pact of Sobotka Kalousek, which has always worked.
This applies both to the current parliamentary committee on leaks from investigative files and to lex Babi<0xC5><0xA1>.
And Sobotka was so stupid that he had Kalousek push me out of the government, which was a percentage of the TOP 09, but the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD took them away.
They are afraid of disrupting their corruption system, and so they talk about the threat of democracy by Babi<0xC5><0xA1>.
No one is immune.
What do you say to the articles describing how the first vice-president of ANO Jaroslav Falt<0xC3><0xBD>nek builds a power base by placing his son on the supervisory board of Tepláren Brno and arranges contracts with the related lawyer Kv<0xC4><0x9B>toslav Hlín with municipal and state-owned companies such as <0xC4><0x8C>eská d<0xC5><0xAF>pra?
We have a constant dispute about this.
I don't like it, and I blamed him a few times.
Faltynek argues that the aforementioned lawyer works at significantly lower rates and is reliable.
I wouldn't do that.
As a finance minister, I had no one.
We, unlike socans, have never had a corruption affair, no Pelt, Kratochvil, Brezin.
If there was any sign of clientelism, we immediately fired such a person.
I am uncompromising in this regard.
If something like this happened, we'd get rid of anyone, no matter who it was.
