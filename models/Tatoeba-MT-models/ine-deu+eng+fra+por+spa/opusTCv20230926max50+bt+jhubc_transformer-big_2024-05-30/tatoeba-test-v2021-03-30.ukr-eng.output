Tom was upset.
She was a foreigner and was treated like a foreigner.
Karen went there on her own.
Do I seem to be nervous?
The girl we saw waiting for someone at Tom's house is Mary.
Why don't you quit smoking?
We all make mistakes.
He wondered why his wife had left him.
I think I've put too much sugar.
Do you know how to skate?
I know how to do it.

He is incompetent.
Thomas was training.
He's unbearable.
He is sure that he will pass the exam.

Did Tom tell you how long it took him to do it?
Let's start!
Careful!
I am completely exhausted.
The prospects are not too bright.
I don't believe in anything supernatural, but I'm fascinated by the devil's literary singing.
The problem is that it lacks experience.
I spent some time in Boston.
You look great.
I was a teacher.
You like English, don't you?
Tom and Mary named their child John.
I wonder if Tom will actually go to Mary's concert.
Did Tom say he spent last weekend with that?
I once had the same problem.
I love nature.
She taught us how to sing.
Let's not do anything at all.
Tom wants his father to be buried next to his mother.
You think we wouldn't have noticed?
Your dinner was so delicious!
I just found a solution to the problem.
Tom promised me he wouldn’t cry.
I'm a DJ.
I hate christmas.
Was the money enough?
Tom found my contact lenses.
It's too expensive.
The child is lost.
I just wanted to give it to you.
I want to surprise him.
You have to learn to restrain.
We're all right.
My wallet was stolen.
He knows a lot of people.
You're not young.
The same is true of Japan.
We'll lose.
The situation is getting worse and worse.
Speak.
The surface of the balloon is a non-Euclidean space, so the rules of euclidean geometry are not complied with.
The talks were successful.
I'm sorry about that.
Don't you want to come with us?
I was trying to call you.
I've never killed anyone.
Be honest and straightforward.
There is always hope.

You panda.
You want to know?

I need that money.
My tie is orange.
Tom's gonna cry?
It would be cool to be higher.
I have to help my mom.
His book has inspired me.
You brothers?
These are not my ideas.
You have a plan, right?
He walks.
Tom is not in town.
I wore my shoes.
Next year will be worse.
Mary in a yellow dress.
Love has a bitter taste.
The meeting was over.

Fragments of mirrors were scattered on the floor.
You're so weird.
The country is rich in natural resources.
I'm Tom's partner.
What a wonderful car!
She missed the school.
Tom sat by the window.
Tom is just like the rest of them.
Tom doesn’t think I should do that.
The public debt is rising.
Why am I me, not you?
Tom probably won’t do that at all.
It's a doll.
Save yourself! Save yourself!
Tom doesn't know where Mary is right now.
We all agreed with Tom.
I'm a widower.
I read this story in a book.
Does Tom still have a bike?
Speak briefly.
Tom is smarter.
It was a hard night for him.
I want to complain.
Don't look at me like that!
I don't think Tom knows anyone who could do that.
I'm a teacher.
You played well, didn't you?
I was born in Osaka in 1997.
You have a good voice.
It is important that you understand.
Tom won't do that.
I hope Tom understands.
She spends too much time on the internet.
You're so charming.
Tom said he would complain.
Let's get to know him.
Have you ever been to Brazil?
What happened to her?
I can't digest it.
Tom is hiding under the bed.
Have you ever been to India?
Tom's coming in 30 minutes.

We know how to speak.
The computer can count very quickly.
You're not needed.
Excuse me, can I open the window?
How's the weather?

Tom won't bother you anymore.
Would you like more tea?
It's a Japanese doll.
What did you eat for lunch today?
You can't even change your diapers.
Do people still use webcams?
I wonder if Tom ever asked Mary why she dropped out of school.
This word is borrowed from Greek.
I'm gonna die?
I'm dying, so I want to see them.
My brother is sick.
Don't move.
The car is outside.
I was weak.
Please, make me a cup of coffee.

He answered my question easily.
What is the purpose of your trip?
Tom is looking for something.
He's probably innocent.
I love kids.
Who's left?
When is she coming?
It's not my style.
Try to focus on it.
I’m so glad I did that yesterday.
Is Tom still living with you?
I wanted to impress Tom.
I just want to help you.
Do not throw stones.
- Does she have a dog?
I was a wizard.
Don't interrupt me when I talk.
Tom asked Mary where the dog was.
Do you meet him often?
You'd like Tom.
Are you still hungry?
We're crazy.
She has wine.
You'll stop.
She waited for him for hours.
Doctor, I'm sorry.
They made mistakes.
How did you know I grew up in Boston?
This is a very interesting story.
They have two sons and one daughter.
It was in the 2000s.
Tom will probably take care of it.
It has to be the right color.
Tom has a very strict mother.
After a short peace, the war broke out again.

Just talk to Tom.
May I remind you of your promise?

I don't understand your French.
What is the name of this restaurant?
Excuse me, could you pass me the sugar?
Where is Tom planning to build his house?
"Where's my laptop?" - "On the chair."
I don’t think there will be any problems.
Tom broke down?
You need to cut your hair.
The green fits you.
Success comes with education.
I don't like you anymore.
Mary plays football.
How does it all work?
You're very ugly.
Hurry up, guys.
I'm fixing my shirt.
When is his return expected?

He is no better than his sister.
Tom beats Mary.
I make too many mistakes.
He is not afraid of death.
It would be nice if there were 28 hours a day, right?
Kobe is the city where I was born.
He would have liked this disaster not to happen.
We do not hope for victory.
I don't have the money.
I don't teach here anymore.
We didn't find the guy.
Get on the bus.
Why didn't you help him?
I need to call Tom.
What advice can you give me?
I'm the only one you can trust.
He's a DJ.
Soon Tom will learn to swim.
What's wrong with how I did it?
They know how to fish.
Tom came out of the room.
I still do this every Monday.
I want you to eat something.
He received the first prize.
Tom teaches French.
I tried to contact her.
Give me your phone.
You're not funny.
Tom said he thinks he can do it.
I don't have any books.
The next story is true.
I just saw them together.
She watched him swim.
Tom thanked Mary for the gift card.
Can you remember when we first met?
My work is very boring.
He is, so to speak, a robotic man.
Answer the question!
You're needed in the hospital.
I can't find a lift.
It's a fake.
It wasn't Tom who asked Mary to do it.
He has green eyes.
Yours was better.
Tom is often wrong.
He was feeling tired.
Did you vote for Tom or Mary?
I don’t have any friends at all.
Did you see that?
I hope for that.
Sadly, but it is true.
Is it true that Tom has never been to Australia?
Now I understand.
I don't think about it anymore.
I think we're next.
I turned on the TV, there was a Grand Prix broadcast.
Tom is proud of his daughter.
Don't remind me.
I'm rich.
Have you considered amputation?
I was surprised that Tom wanted to do it.
English is not my native language.
I didn’t have any friends in Australia.
You think I'm smooth?
I'm too rich.
What's the girl's name?
We shouldn't have let her go.
Therefore, it should not be done again.

Not all the gold that shines.
I have very few friends.
Do you believe in the existence of God?
I live in Boston.
Tom is blind from birth.
He did not answer my question.
Does anyone know him?
Aren’t you starting to get bored?
What kind of men do you like?
Why do people still smoke?
I won't work for you.
I can do it for her, unlike you.
I am a student and he is not.
That's what I was trying to do.
I wrote a book.
Silence, please.
I bought my son a new sledgehammer.
I know Tom's wife.
This is my younger sister Sakiko. She was born the same year as me, and now she is preparing for the exams.
I don't like tea or coffee.
Have you done your homework?
Monday is going to be a busy day.
I'm going to Tom's house.
I don't agree with him.
Maybe you should help Tom paint the fence.
Why do humans behave like big monkeys, and vice versa?
Can you help me?
Asshole.
I'm a physicist.
I think you should go to the doctor.
I filed for a visa.
It's snowing today.
She continued to work.
The rope broke as we went up the mountain.
Tom is driving.
If you ate less hamburgers, you’d probably be healthier.
She helped Mary.
Good choice!
Don't you want ice?
Mary isn't going, is she?
What's in the garage?
Don’t you speak English?
Tom needs to be taken to the hospital.
I had to go in person.
Please show me how this is done.
Aren’t you going to meet someone?
All the stores are busy.
I have not yet made a decision.
What is the date today?
Where's Daddy?
Lock the door.
I'm not going to talk to Tom in French.
The apple from the apple tree does not fall far.
Be a realist.
Who were you talking to?
Your uncle is your father’s brother or mother’s brother.
Do you know whose parents they are?
She has red eyes.
They won't come back.
I was in jeans.
See you after the show.
I'd like to ask a question.
This is my grandmother.
It's a cat.
This bag is mine.
Are you ignoring me?
Tom entered the Church of Satan.
I still want to do it with you.
Tom has no money.
Aren't you surprised to see me here?
I'm a conservative.
You don't mind?
I haven't seen you in forever.
You're obviously right.
Whose books are they?
That's what you want to do, isn't it?
You want to kill me.
You see?
Tom walks the dogs twice a day.
Let me take a look at this book, Tom.
The main islands of Japan are Hokkaido, Sikoku, Honshu and Kyushu.
You must be very busy.
Tom doesn't have much money in the bank.
I think we should go now.
We didn't do it.
You think Tom's crazy?
I can do it now.
How can you be so naive?
I can't help you.
Slow down.
I'm not a monster.
She closed her eyes.
No one compares to him in tennis.
Who asked you?
When did you realize that?
She's committed suicide.
We have equipped our office with computers.
You have to pay in advance.
You're sure?
Do you think Tom will die?
Aren’t you planning to stay?
I didn't do what you accused me of.
Please don't be late.
I know Tom's drunk.
Did you agree?
I came to get my book.
I'm still teaching French.
Tom will do it right away.
Let’s sing a song together.
Tom has three times as many books as I do.
You missed a lot.
I wear boots.
You can count on me.
His book has become an object of criticism.
That would be genius.
I'm terrified.
You have to help her, and quickly!
It's a lot worse.
I'm under the fly.
You weren't wasting your time.
Who knows when Tom will do it?
Tom testified in Mary’s case.
I thought you were gone.
Tom won't catch Mary.
May I ask what your name is?
I wrote you ten letters.
What should we do?
Aren't you going to vote?
You should stop smoking.
I think Tom is cheating.
I know a lot of French teachers.
You don't look like her at all.
Do you know how to play the violin?
Can you give me salt?
Just sit there with Tom.
I think Tom speaks French well.
I don't think Tom knows Mary's unhappy.
Sami was popular both among students and among teachers.
You can't help the tears of grief.
Tom plays football and runs.
You can go wherever you want.
We'll meet with Tom later.
I know how we can have a good time.
Did you know that Tom can't speak French?
He always sings when he takes a shower.
You're not as young as Tom.
How are we doing?
Then Tom hung up his ear.
I'll be right back.
The church is located at the foot of the mountain.
Where's your assistant?
Why did I do this to you?
More coffee, please.
Tom will try to convince Mary to do it.
It's Tom calling you.
You have to tell him to do it.
He speaks Esperanto with a small French accent.
It's not your knife.
Who lives in this house?
Tom didn't get around it.
She has good manners.
I wanted to sit.
Why would Tom do that?
I hope Tom's coming to my party.
Tom told me that he doesn’t like to speak French.
That sounds good, doesn't it?
When he was younger, he was a businessman.
I'll take care of it.
Have you found any errors?
I'd like to see your mother.
You're a wizard?
Am I beautiful?
Even a teacher can make mistakes.
Get off.
Will you let Tom move with you?
You're a good woman.
There is hope.
When I was a kid, I was very shy.
Did Tom really move to Boston?
Tom stretched out Mary's beer.
How did you know Tom wasn't here?
Kids grow up so fast.
Tom loves to talk.
I want to play cards.
He returned to the hotel.
When did you come back from London?
Aren't you still cold?
The native speakers subconsciously follow the rules of their language, without even realizing them.

What happens if I press this button?
The hunters pointed their guns at the elephant.
No one cares.
They were trying.
Is Tom and Mary still here?
Tom's wife is Canadian.
Do you have any allergies?
Don't go.
Tom and Mary couldn’t help me do that.
I would like to withdraw money.
I'm squeezing Tom's hand.
They'll be fine.
Half of these apples are rotten.
Tom is no longer a member of this club.
You don’t have to worry about tomorrow’s exam.
Did Tom vote?
I'll be back.
Tom won't force Mary to do it.
Tom didn't even start.
Instead of going to school, he stayed home.
I didn't know it was Tom who helped you paint the fence.
It's on the eighth floor.
Tom's wife left him three months ago.
I'm sorry I went there.
You shouldn't trust her.
Tom lost his best friend.
Tom still wants to come.
You don't run away.
I'm Japanese, but I don't live in Japan.
What do you want to talk about?
Where did you spend your holidays?
Did you get a Christmas gift from Tom this year?
I’m still a little bored at home and so many things seem strange to me.
Sometimes I have a problem with memorization.
Where's Mom?
He recovered three hours after the accident.
Do you speak Macedonian?
You shouldn't talk here.
Are you talking about us?
Tom is with me now.
Is Tom okay?
I thought you recognized Tom.
Very good!
Do you know the reason?
Check your voice mail.
She speaks in three foreign languages.
Tom is a little behind schedule.
Tom is not a hero.
Is it possible to catch a taxi?
Hurry up, you're late.
It's going to be difficult.
Does Tom always behave like this?
I like to play golf.
I have a sister and a brother.
Tom didn’t want to speak so loudly.
Our team needs your help. We're here for you.
You're never lying.
Wait, did you say "girl" or "boy"?
It will work, you will see.
She dropped him.
Tom is safe.
I finally got my driver's license.
I'm not a student.
It was a pity for Mary.
I'm just watching the news right now.
Tom checks the phone all the time.
How's your wife?
You're absolutely right.
Tom is not rich, Mary is rich.
I broke my glasses.
I've lost my favorite pen.
Everyone was late, except me.
Let's stop!
It's a book.
I don't plan to shake the boat.
Money doesn't smell.
Tom has a lot of weird ideas.
Eat something. Eat something.
I'm with the client.
I am disappointed in your efficiency.
Didn’t you have a car before?
Were you at work?
What are you teaching?
I'm sorry I ate those oysters.
Good-bye.
Please write your name in a pencil.
Tom wants to study medicine.
She totally ignores me.
Tom goes to the party in the evening.
I was talking.
She was on her way to the airport.
She is studying Portuguese in Brazil.
What will you tell them?
How did you know this was going to happen?
What's in there?
If natural language can be compared to a tree that develops over time, then Esperanto can be compared to a plastic tree that was created artificially.
Everyone wanted to sing.
What is the meaning of this phrase?
I think Tom's going to Boston.
Do you know where we are going?
Tom doesn’t know what to do.
Don't be so angry.
Tom has a beautiful garden.
I know when you're lying.
I know you were just doing your job.
We'll walk.
Did Tom tell you exactly what happened?
I finally realized that I'm not in love with you.
You told Tom I was joking?
Tom was terribly bored.
Tom said I was beautiful.
I'll be in the lab.
Please, wait a minute.
I'm a little shy.
The prisoner died under torture.
It's unbearable.
I have a lot to do today.
Tom and Mary will both be there.
What do you understand?
Are they suspicious of me?
Tom was a little confused.
I want to talk to her.
Take out the trash.
Aren't you coming back tonight?
I forgot your number.
Do you have a map of Boston?
Your sister, as always, is wonderful.
It will be very difficult to do.
The child was paralyzed by fear.
Do you like these perfumes?
How awful!
Are you in a hurry?
I don’t have two cats.
When you hire him, you should take into account his youth.
We're sure it wasn't a coincidence.
This is his obsessive idea.
It's a matter of principle.
Tom reluctantly left the room.
He knows that I love him.
I don't believe that.
I was in a white dress.
Check again.
Tom has a son-doctor.
I know it will be impossible.
Do you have any headaches?
Children follow their friends, not their parents.
Tom is falling.
Tom wants to play with his friends outside.
No matter what happens, keep calm.
Tom sent a message to Mary.
He is always happy.
When Mary reached the bus stop, the last bus had already left.
Tom's in a black coat today.
I'll wait until 2:30.
Tom is my child.
We used to speak French as a rule.
Bananas are delicious.
They're eating.
Tom can go.
Where do you live?
Now they are useless.
Did you try to talk to them?
It was much harder to do than it seemed.
Her friends laughed at her.
Allow me to talk to Tom.
Tom seemed to understand what I was saying.
I doubt that Tom can win.
Aliens are coming and taking our work from us. Earth for Earthmen! Let's deport the Martians!
Don't worry.
Bell invented the phone in 1876.
You're going by train?
Tom said that Mary is beautiful.
He can no longer go.
Tom and Mary are still sleeping, right?
Do you still like Boston?
Why would you do that?
This young man is a doctor of medicine.
He went abroad and never came back.
Collect your toys together.
It was much harder to do than it seemed.
I think I did a good job.
What does Tom want for Christmas?
Don't you want me to help you?
You have to do what Tom tells you to do.
I've gotten better.
Are these people crazy?
That's why I'm interested.
Have you already finished the work?
Three years ago, I was very rich.
It is easy to do.
Tom's dead.
I like to be alone.
We were both drunk.
I am not as tall as my brother, but higher than my father.
Tom doesn't know what you did.
Did I ask for your help?
Tom took one of the sandwiches.
I have never lived in Boston.
It's important to me.
This box was heavy.
You can rest.
Are you ready to start?
I wanted to sell it anyway.
Tom said that, in his opinion, Mary will not be.
You missed something.
I called Tom right away.
You looked interested in it.
That'll help.
I'll sleep.
I told Mary in French that I loved her.
We don't really have a choice.
I'm dead.

This is what we want.
Tom's wearing sunglasses.
Tom is a good painter.
All you have to do is click on the red button.
You looked very sad.
Where can I rent a costume for Halloween?
Tom is busy and can't help you right now.
We're not a couple.
He wants to see a student.
We want to vote.
Tom and Mary tried.
I think I'm getting a fever.
Why aren't you sleeping?
Do you really think that someone is listening?
No surrender is required!
Tom, you can say, is beautiful.
Anyway, I don't agree with you.
I should have left earlier.
I met him by accident.
Why do you like her?
The problem is that solar energy is too expensive.
I'm very old-fashioned.
Tom's in a hurry.
You saved my life.
Did you call him?
Do you understand?
Tom wasn't rude to me.
How to say "thank you" in Japanese?
She's sleeping.
Tom's wife asked him to quit his job.
Couldn't you open the door?
Are you comfortable?
This chair is made of plastic.
Tom could and should have helped Mary.
Don't you know how?
He adopted an orphan.
I was playing baseball.
She deserves a better life.
I got a ticket for free.
You're such an unbearable man.
What's going on?
Tom said you speak French.
I did everything I could.
No, sir, it's free.
I am very interested in learning French.
It's good for the cat, please.
I don't have time to read.
Do you have a lantern that I can borrow from you?
I'm going to the store.
Don't trust anyone.
I'm glad you're happy with your job.
Do you work somewhere nearby?
You admit it, don't you?
I have business tomorrow.
I'm insane.
You are always wrong.
I didn't know it was possible.
I'm exhausted.
I was born in Osaka, but grew up in Tokyo.
You are very materialistic.
I don't understand, and I'm not used to not understanding. Please explain again.
I share it all.
The options are obvious.
The only person Tom ever talks about is Mary.
I want you to stay here with Tom.
She's been cancelled.
My country is densely populated.
Mary said she was ready.
You have time.
I wonder if Tom is okay.
I don't sleep well.
Aren’t you going to buy it?
Women are beautiful.
Wouldn't it be great if Tom did that?
You did it?
I have trouble sleeping at night.
Tom sometimes annoys me.
I'm pretty good at dancing.
You can ask Tom for help.
I'm just a teacher.
It is obvious that you will be cheaper to spend the night with us.
He doesn’t watch TV at all.
I never said no.
Rio already has a subway.
Are you ready to help us?
Tom's a rare asshole.
His hair was getting thinner and thinner.
