The great return of the Czech slumberer is approaching.
Pavel French was called to the NHL
Czech hockey goalkeeper Pavel Francouz, who has been going through a difficult period in his career in recent months, is returning to the NHL.
A thirty-year-old native of Pilsen will be on the crossroads and soon he could even get into the goal.
A former goalkeeper from Lithuania, Pilsen and Chelyabinsk was injured in preparation for the NHL in October this year.
In the middle of the game, he alternated with Vegas and has not appeared in the NHL since.
The incident occurred when an experienced goalkeeper moved from one bar to the other.
“Paul French will be out for about three to four weeks with an injury in the lower body,” the Denver team said in a statement.
His return to the NHL goal was eventually extended to more than two months.
On Sunday morning, U.S. time, he was called from a farm where he picked up four duels and showed off his old form.
In the AHL he attributed 94.5% of his interventions.
A Pilsen hockey fan wants to finally make his mark and confirm that he belongs to the best league in the world.
In the last year he had problems with his hips and in the shortened pandemic year he did not catch a single match.
In the NHL “Francík” caught 36 games, his success of the procedures is at 92.3%.
Charles puts on Camille's disguise on Christmas wish, William and Kate pose in Jordan
Prince William and his wife Kate have chosen a family photo taken during their trip to Jordan as a Christmas wish.
His wish was also expressed by Prince Charles, who used a photograph in which Camille helps to put on a cape.
This was reported on the BBC's website by the British news station.
They send their wishes to friends, co-workers and the foundations they work with.
The photo was taken somewhere in the desert.
The Duchess of Cambridge is dressed in a long summer dress in a khaki color and the dress is also worn by Princess Charlotte.
Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, wears shorts and a shirt with a collar just like Prince George and Louis.
Whoever took the photo, William and Kate did not mention it, it is not clear exactly when it was created.
Last year, the royal family posed for a photo intended as a Christmas wish on a package of straw in front of a pile of wood in their country house in Norfolk County.
The picture, which will serve as a Christmas wish, was also published by the successor to the throne Prince Charles with his wife Camilla.
Photographer Sam Hussein captured in June at the Ascot racetrack.
Charles, who has a cylinder on his head and a cloak on his face, helps Camille put on her cloak colorfully matched with a light dress.
Slavia according to efotbal.cz promised Berbro a million for the title, Tvrdík denied it.
Prague – Criminalists in the current corruption case allegedly worked with the accused former vice-president of the Football Association of the Czech Republic Roman Berbr was to receive a million crowns for the league title from Prague in the 2018/19 season.
He informed the efotbal.cz server about this, saying that he got to part of the police files.
Jaroslav Tvrdík, the chairman of the board of directors of the Przysztof club, said that the red-and-whites did not commit any corruption proceedings.
The server has published a transcript of police wiretaps, in which Slavia is mainly featured by its former sports director Jan Nezmar, who finished last summer at the championship club.
According to the file, the former influential red-and-white official was in frequent contact with both Berbrem and the former sports director of the then second-league Vy<0xC5><0xA1>ehrad Roman Rogoz, who is also among the accused.
The criminals allegedly worked with information that Slavia Berbro promised a financial reward for winning the title.
In 2019, SK Slavia Praha won the title in the first league.
The police authority had the knowledge that Roman (Berbr) was to receive a million-dollar bribe from SK Slavia Praha officials for winning the league, the server quoted from the file.
A day later, according to the criminalists, Berber met not only with Nezmar, but also with the chairman of the board, Slavia Tvrdík.
According to the server, it is no longer clear whether the police are still dealing with this information.
The defendant has rejected any anti-corruption action.
In the years 2015 to 2017, we actively tried to change the conditions in Czech football and offered an opposing alternative to its development.
We have never committed any illegal act, we have not sought to influence the referees in violation of the rules of fair play, and we have not provided anyone with any financial support in this regard," Tvrdík said.
In interrogations, Nezmar, among others, insults some former players of Slavia's dark skin and also slanders his former boss Tvrdík.
The cause of the alleged influence of matches through referees was triggered in mid-October last year by police intervention in several places, including the Prague headquarters of FA<0xC4><0x8C>R.
The highest-ranking in the affair is the Berber, who no longer appears in any of the football functions.
In mid-January, the former sports director of Vy<0xC5><0xA1>ehrad Rogoz was released from prison.
Helicopters, tanks and BVP are the larping of the Cold War.
The guns will be new, but in principle of a worse type (artillerymen must come out of the armored cabin and wear shells by hand without cover).
Cars - Toyota hi-lux - are new and good
Trucks and various armored vehicles - on a decent level, in addition, it has already managed to get rid of Prague V3S even with specialized units.
Aircraft: combat- decent, but at the end of the rental, transport - too small with a short range, but modern.
Drones - few and only small types without combat potential
Rockets - we do not have at all (but we produce and balance abroad)
PVO: medium - cold war, obsolete; short-range - good, modern, relatively good number.
I have a story like that.
Honitbu is right next to town.
Nutrients climbed out of the river and damaged the crops, so I sat there.
When I arrived, I saw a fisherman on the other side of the river.
I didn't want to do shit, so I just sat down and the guy didn't notice me.
I was hoping he'd leave before anything came out, but of course the fox was gone shortly.
I let her come up to 40 meters before I decided to shoot.
The poor fisherman almost screwed himself up, waving his head to all sides, so I called him that it was on a fox.
Before I got off the seat, he was gone.
I mean, I want a man to be Prussian.
On the other hand, this is not a war, it would have to be a coincidence of a lot of coincidences in order for something to happen, you would probably be seen in the thermovision that almost everyone has today.
So in a visible place, dear thing, put your feet in your sleeping bag and you should be fine.
Warriors versus Hammocks.
Inside got the respirators significantly cheaper than the Ministry of Health
The state responsible for buying and distributing robes, masks and respirators for the professions closest to the coronavirus has spent billions of crowns on them in recent weeks.
The iRozhlas server compared the purchases of individual ministries and found that in a single day, the amounts per respirator varied by up to hundreds of crowns.
Why did prices move so dramatically?
Which governments have been economically efficient?
And why did others buy a runway?
Lenka Kabrhelova speaks with iRozhlas server editor Dominika Kubi<0xC5><0xA1>ta.
I appreciate the soldiers and armies (I am probably not affected by the memories of the <0xC4><0x8C>SLA, which passed through older generations), but the Czech Republic cannot benefit from compulsory warfare.
We don’t even have a large inventory of technology that could be used for training, we don’t actually have modern technology even for existing professionals, and modern technology is becoming more and more complex, so the skills of back-ups will quickly be lost in time.
In addition, modern conventional conflicts, where there is one who can deploy, will take place very quickly, there will be no time to re-exercise.
And finally, backers/territorial defense are of great importance for countries like Ukraine, where mass guerrillas are going, and this is also a pronounced need to deter the enemy.
In the territory of the Czech Republic, the fight will be fought only in a conflict of such magnitude and intensity, where the guerrillas will be irrelevant, and we do not have a suitable geography for this.
We do not have individual skills.
That's not the worst.
The worst part is that half of them play as if they had it.
Then there's a situation where you're watching a guy who didn't hit an empty gate two minutes ago go into attack alone between two or even three Swiss and you're like, "Hey, what do you think's going to happen now?"
Of course, they choose him as the average taxpayer.
"The situation with this skill of 'watering the defender' is so awful that I am shocked to be frankly surprised to see that our attacker has managed to beat one player of the opponent.
The First Vla<0xC5><0xA1>tovka
The Covid pandemic is slowing down, but experts do not expect any major reversal for the coming weeks.
According to statistical models, the strain in hospitals will last for some time and a new unknown has become known in the pandemic equation: the omicron variant, which is most likely spreading faster than the current prevailing Delta.
At the same time, it is not yet possible to say with absolute certainty whether it can cause a more serious course, how much vaccination or post-infectious immunity gained from a previous illness helps against it.
But this week, an unexpected phenomenon on the plus side also entered the COVID equation: the possibility of treatment.
A new drug, antiviral molnupiravir, has arrived in the Czech Republic, which reduces the risk of severe course of the disease and associated hospitalization by a third and can be treated at home.
And soon it should also be supplemented by the drug paxlovid from Pfizer, which from the results so far reports a success of up to 85 percent.
However, the first deliveries of molnupiravir to the Czech Republic, in addition to the hope of expanding the portfolio of tools useful in combating the coronavirus pandemic, also highlighted the question of how the local administration is prepared for incoming medicines.
As it has been said, the first to receive domestic patients is molnupiravir from Merck.
The company was the first to end up on tape because the drug began to be developed long before the outbreak of the current pandemic in order to find a suitable treatment for equine viral diseases on the South American continent.
In this research, it is often overlooked that people in the West (Germany, Sweden, etc.)
They are generally less open and do not openly share their views.
On the other hand, Eastern Europeans, and especially Czechs, are accustomed to saying "how our beak grew".
See you do research where you ask people if they like Muslims.
In the Czech Republic, most people will say no without hesitation.
In the West, they will tell you how much they love migration, how everyone should help them, and how we Czechs are racist bastards.
And then they go and vote parties like the AfD.
He's afraid to cancel culture, to say this in public means job loss and media lynching.
Then it looks nice in the surveys, west good, east bad.
But it really finds out what people think.
In France, Le Pen and Zemmour both have over 20%.
We even know that the objects are three and completely identical in Czech.
Identical because of the rotation of the units, so that the soldiers do not have to learn again where it is, so all the objects on the hair are the same.
One is the Atom Museum of the Mountains and the other two are abandoned.
The joke is that the USSR did not want to have nuclear warheads on its own territory either because of the security or the speed with which the warheads were deployed because of the western position.
In those underground shells (there are two in each maple) only the warheads were kept, not the entire rockets as they say.
If it was necessary to deploy this weapon, a special unit arrived, which picked up this warhead and mounted it on some carrying device.
In addition to the museum maple, the remaining ones are in a desolated state.
In the second grade of primary school we had a fellow gypsy student, we were with him for 4 years.
He was pretty good, he made good jokes, he often showed himself too much, but he was our mascot.
Everyone talked with him, often walked and wanted to explain something, he lacked a little, walked regularly, played sports with us, did not steal snacks or phones, walked cleanly dressed.
He also drove to schools in the countryside, did various monkey shops, but he was fine, maybe never any trouble.
In the eighth or ninth grade, siblings, gypsies, entered the same grade, a different class.
In short, they beat the teacher, they often dealt with the police, they threatened and threatened other students.
Personally, I sometimes sell something for advertising (old stuff, something I don’t need, etc.) and I have sold it to Gypsies often, they always had money, they didn’t try to pull me on the price, communication in peace.
I even sold a car like this, the guy called in a month that he had already overwritten it on himself.
I say to myself that I’m not a racist, I don’t care if someone is white, black, yellow, blue or otherwise, as long as they behave as they should in a decent society (work, work, don’t beat women, just normal behavior).
But when someone comes in, stretches out his hand, moves out apartments and houses, he's just messed up, he's in trouble, no matter what color he's in, but I don't mind.
I have no problem with African migrants, if they join us, start doing business, work, learn a language (not necessarily, at least English), they respect our culture.
If they believe in Allah, I don't care as long as they respect my traditions and culture, I will be theirs.
A young woman died in a car accident in Prachaticka
“The young woman suffered serious multiple injuries and, despite resuscitation care, unfortunately succumbed to her injuries on the spot,” said Zuzana Fajtlová, a spokeswoman for South Bohemian health rescuers.
The accident was probably caused by the driver who was driving the girl.
The eighteen-year-old driver of the Peugeot car probably drove in the direction from the village of <0xC5><0xBD>íhovec to the village of Bavorov and, for reasons not yet known, went in a corner in the opposite direction.
After a collision with a <0xC5><0xA0>KODA Octavia, a Peugeot car ended up on the roof off the road, South Bohemian police spokeswoman <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>pánka Schwarz said.
The young Peugeot driver suffered a very serious injury in the accident.
There were multiple injuries and he was stuck in the car.
After his discharge, he had to be provided with acute pre-hospital care and was transported to a hospital in <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xBD> Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice by air in a stable condition, said Rescuer Fajtlová.
She added that the man in the second car suffered a minor chest injury and was taken to the hospital.
New rules apply to packages from non-EU countries, customers often do not provide data about them
Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Neuheisl orders from abroad several times a month.
He mainly buys collectible cards.
“Usually it can be tens of dollars, say from ten dollars up, where it’s still worth importing, especially from Japan, where mail is often free,” the collector approaches.
Since October, the ordering of small consignments has slightly increased, new VAT must be added and the post office must pass the data to the customs procedure.
He receives an e-mail stating that customs are expecting the package.
Then it is enough to fill in the details of the shipment, and if the trader has not included VAT at the time of sale, the customs office will measure it from the total amount per shipment and for transport.
In the event that the addressee does not carry out the customs procedure himself, the total amount must also be added to the remuneration of the carrier.
According to Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Neuheisl, the whole process is not complicated.
I click one or two tear boxes, insert two attachments, and I'm done.
For me, it’s usually a question of five minutes, Neuheisl says.
Not all shipments can be delivered smoothly.
Due to the new customs rules, the number of daily shipments received from abroad at the international post office in Prague fell from 60,000 to 15,000.
Moreover, according to the Czech Post, the problem is also that people do not respond to requests to provide the data needed to complete the customs procedure.
There are currently 30,000 parcels on the international mail that we have to process.
If people were to fill in all the necessary data and fill them in on time, we would be about halfway there, according to Czech Post spokesman Matyá<0xC5><0xA1> Vitík.
Solution to Inflation
See the title, how would you propose a solution to the current inflation?
We are currently at 9.9% inflation and it is expected to grow further.
What do you think the state should do to slow down or compensate for this growth?
We see, for example, in Poland a reduction of VAT on food and PHM, is this the way for you?
What do you think will happen, what is inevitable with where it leads?
Prices are rising faster than wages, in my opinion it is inevitable that people will not be able to afford ordinary things, especially energy.
How much do you need to add (who is the employee)?
I was added 2% in gross this year, which is ridiculous, but fortunately I have a similar income from the business that I run on the job.
Would anyone be able to explain to me why convicted rapists are sent to prison for perhaps only six months?
This just doesn't take my mind off how a court can only send such an animal out of prison for six months just to do it/and again as soon as it gets out.
6 Months is nothing compared to the fact that his/her victim will have trauma for several years, it will negatively affect her sexual relationships and relationships in general.
Not to mention the fact that the rape victim never has to recover from it either.
Isn't that also a potential future report of rape victims?
The man from the tomb "crashed" his girlfriend from Kostomlat
The man from the Tomb inadvertently helped the officers to secure his nationally sought girlfriend from Kostomlat, who was issued a warrant for arrest.
He called them to her himself.
He went around it.
He first addressed the passerby and made up a story that he had been stolen.
The officers arrived at the scene after an emergency call, and they were not surprised when the alleged “robber” told them that he had made up everything to get the officers to the scene.
In fact, he only wanted to advise the officers on how to file a complaint with the Police of the Czech Republic.
While checking the identity of the man and his girlfriend, officers found out that the woman was on the list of wanted persons, in a nationwide search, and a warrant was issued for her to be arrested.
Therefore, the case is resolved by the PRC.
Honest question for the people here, do you consider our country to be Slavic?
I personally believe that we are not ethnically or culturally enslaved for a long time, but I would be interested in your opinion.
Otherwise, I agree with the meme, of course, a pity that Churchill failed to secure the liberation of Prague USA :')
Of course, I do not deny that we have a Slavic language.
Well, I don't know, it's quite a question of whether a rational person can really believe something completely without evidence just because it could potentially benefit.
I personally would not consider such a case to be a true faith.
I can’t agree with Pascale here, there is an estimate in the world, if I’m not mistaken, about ten thousand different religions.
Which god or god should a person choose?
I would say that it is quite likely that in any of those thousands of religions there is at least one god who will punish you badly if you believe in another god.
But even in the tenth it says that there is no other god but Yahweh.
Would it not be more rational, then, to refrain from believing in any god than to risk choosing the wrong one of those thousands of gods, and the one true god, whom I have not just met, will send me to hell or some other place?
Other: Voluntary training with subsequent inclusion in reserves.
The Swiss model is similar.
X months of training (in different specializations, X months to one) and under the guidance of professionals with practical experience.
If you do well, you can get a professional offer.
This would be a good thing for all ACRs.
This could be done in collaboration with the University of Defense.
We can say this: Cooperation between the education sector and industry is constantly getting worse, companies hunt in schools, and there is some kind of junction where the workforce migrates from educational institutions to working conditions.
Not only during adolescence, but this process takes place constantly, each of us constantly learns something new, moves from one field to another, etc.
A similar interconnection should also work between the civil and military sectors.
I also see it as a way to build some kind of relationship between the citizen and the army, that is, an institution that guarantees that there will never be a Russian, a German or even a Mongolian invader again.
I find it funny how you think NATO is something carved into stone, we have allies and they will defend us in case of trouble.
Well, you'll please the pan.
Just one election in the U.S. that screws up their budget and the whole of NATO goes to hell.
The English will trade us for Russian money, the Germans will trade us for Russian gas, and the Poles have already proved once that it is enough to show them their backs and take what they want.
The only thing that has long served as a guarantor of independence is an armed army and a population that can control the military technology of their time.
And nowadays, he's able to pilot every teenager's remote controls, so what can't he do?
We don't need border fortifications, it's a mess today, but a stubborn teenager behind a remote-controlled device can handle it.
How not to drown in a box tsunami
Do you unpack gifts under a Christmas tree and suddenly you’re at home packed with boxes and fillings?
This “waste” is reused by e-shops, which lack packaging materials.
This is why a map of stores has been created that will welcome your used boxes.
And not just about Christmas.
All packaging materials are designed to withstand repeated handling.
Therefore, it is a pity to treat them as disposable waste.
Anyone can bring to the involved store (the KAMsNIM.cz project map contains almost 150 of them) cardboard boxes, plastic or paper fillings.
This will support small businesses, reduce the amount of waste generated and also avoid overcrowded blue containers.
Shops themselves welcome packaging, which is currently scarce on the market, as well as savings, as packaging cartons have increased by 50% in recent periods.
In the eyes of environmentally friendly customers, I am also strengthening my brand.
One such store is TIERRA VERDE, a manufacturer of eco-drugs and eco-cosmetics.
Boxes and fillers are brought to us by individuals who gather at home, but we are also contacted by companies with whom we have agreed on regular amounts of deferred cartons.
We will use everything when packing shipments from our e-shop.
Thanks to individuals and companies, we are creating a more respectful world together.
Our wish is to preserve the resources and beauty of nature for the next generations, says Petra Lopu<0xC5><0xA1>níková from Tierra.
However, the application www.KAMsNIM.cz shows not only picking points for packaging material.
It serves as a search engine if you need to get rid of anything (where to take sorted household waste, where to hand over past medicines, tires, spent electricity, batteries, light sources, large-volume waste, etc.).
All waste can end up in the right place, and reusable items will find their second home.
In total, the map of the project already contains more than 100,000 such places.
“It gradually grows in collection yards, re-use centers, textile containers, food banks, charity shops, SWAPs and other places that help to find use for things that would otherwise unnecessarily become waste,” adds Miroslav Kubásek, one of the authors.
Rather, I find it awkward that today the technique is so simple and dumb-resistant that children who use a computer or a phone play games on it, but do not learn basic computer skills.
Recently, there has been a problem (especially in English articles) that college students do not understand the principle of the components on the computer.
Because, for example, Google Photos or Apple apps for photos or actually mobile phones generally simply hide the underlying filesystem with folders and put everything on one screen in the app.
Let them use the technique from childhood, but above all, let them learn something.
Let's rewrite history, seriously
Emmanuel Macron presented the priorities of the French Presidency of the EU last weekend – starting in January – and it was spectacular.
Macron spoke over an hour in which he unveiled the presidency logo, called for the protection of Europeans – at work, on the street – and mentioned so many events that they cannot be achieved in six months.
But French politicians like it, and voters like it.
Macron’s supporters of the split between the right and the left agree little, but in Europe it does.
And in France, there will be new heads of state elections in April.
The election calendar has also influenced the priorities.
The French leader mentioned, among other things, that historians should write “one history of Europe” and France is ready to create conditions for such work by historians.
A number of commentators immediately hurried to criticize Macron’s pro-European propaganda and rewriting history.
In fact, it is more of an attempt to defend the rewriting of history.
The far-right candidate for French President Éric Zemmour is now circling France with the thesis that the Vichy regime, which collaborated with Hitler during World War II, was not so bad, and is quite successful with the French.
Let’s try to take Macron’s idea of a history textbook seriously and not look at what’s happening in France.
Wouldn't it be necessary?
Students in European countries are learning history as a story we versus them and never as a story as a whole.
The Spaniards, the French, the Czechs find out who defeated whom in which battle.
But if they don’t have an enlightened cantor, they won’t know what the wider context of the event was.
The movie of the year is Quo vadis, Aida?
The Czech "Mice" did not win.
The story, which returns to the 1995 Srebrenica massacre, also won an award for director and best actress Jasna Duri<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x8D>ova.
At this year’s Karlsruhe festival, he held on to the first ranks of the audience.
The best actor in Berlin was Anthony Hopkins in the film Father.
I'm not very young, I'm not very healthy and I'm not vaccinated.
It was like "having the flu/being inflamed" for a few days I had diarrhea and didn't really want to smoke...
It was worse than the usual flu.
I don't have diarrhea with the flu.
(Only personal experience. I'm not saying everyone has that)
Christmas Book Tips
The Christmas duo, which will be released on December 20, will include a traditional literary appendix.
And with it, there will also be cultural tips.
In addition, we add those books to you, subscribers, already to this digital edition, so that you may have enough time to buy books as Christmas gifts.

Trains start to run according to the new timetable, somewhere the carriers will change
From Sunday onwards, trains start to operate on the railways according to the new timetable.
The biggest change is the exchange of carriers on some routes, for example between <0xC3><0x9A>stí nad Labem and Cologne, where RegioJet starts to operate instead of Czech Railways.
For most lines, the departure time is only adjusted, or their route is slightly adjusted.
There will also be dozens of new trains on the tracks.
The ticket sales began in the autumn of this year.
In the new timetable, Czech Railways plans to operate an average of 6,783 passenger services per day, of which there will be an average of 478 long-distance trains per day.
Trains will travel approximately 118 million kilometres during the new timetable.
The routes in addition to national connections under the new timetable will also travel to Germany, Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Austria and Switzerland.
Together with the new timetable, the company will deploy dozens of new trains.
The main news will be InterJet trains, which will travel on the lines from Prague to Cheb.
Further new trains will be sent by the carriers to northern Moravia or western Bohemia.
The carrier will also traditionally increase ticket prices by an average of 3.2 percent from next year.
Tracks take inflation into account in their tariffs annually.
The biggest change in the RegioJet timetable is the entrance to the R23 line <0xC3><0x9A>stí nad Labem – M<0xC4><0x9B>lník – Nymburk – Cologne.
The carrier here will replace Czech Railways after the success in the competition of the Ministry of Transport.
Every day, RegioJet will operate a total of 16 routes, eight in each direction.
Further changes are related to the long-distance connections between Prague and Brno, which will also stop at Havlí<0xC4><0x8D>k<0xC5><0xAF>v Brod, <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F>ár nad Sázavou and Kolín stations from Sunday.
Leo Express has maintained its 16 connections, two return connections to Slovakia and a weekend connection to Krakow.
According to spokesman Emil Sedla<0xC5><0x99>ík, despite the planned exclusion work, the carrier tried to maintain as similar the driving times of its long-distance trains as possible.
Without major changes, the operation of Arriva trains and other carriers should continue.
The carrier will also be exchanged on some regional routes.
The changes await passengers in Czech Republic, for example, where on the route from Mladá Boleslav via Czech Lipa to Rumburk, instead of Czech Railways, the Trilex trains of the German company Die Landesbahn will travel.
Passengers will also be able to use single rail fares for the second year.
As with Czech Railways, their price will increase by inflation by 3.2 percent.
I have to disagree.
Shouldn't we learn the other side's point of view?
Everywhere we hear how much they had to fight for their rights, how they had to be oppressed, how they had to struggle, how they had to die.
In my life, I have never heard a lesson from the point of view of the slave party or from that time, no one defends this, only condemns it.
No one will even tell you in schools that blacks were often sold into slavery by blacks themselves and that they were often the worst slavers.
No one in school will teach you that the settlers often bought land from the Indians, they will tell you everywhere how brutally we Europeans murdered them, but they murdered each other long ago.
I also spent some time in the United States, directly in schools, both in northern schools and in southern schools.
I didn’t encounter anyone deliberately concealing the facts, but I’ve heard before that it’s happening and I think it’s a problem, I’m not denying it (for example, in Japan, WW2 atrocities are quite taboo).
My point was rather that history is not black and white and that we tend to look at it from today’s perspective, without understanding.
History doesn’t care about someone’s feelings, it’s just what they are, and I think it’s a fatal mistake to judge without looking at a thing from that time.
On the other hand, we should learn from it and never repeat this.
By the way, when we are in the southern states, yes, the Confederate flag and the famous slavers there are quite popular, on the other hand, they also had some of their good achievements and it seemed absurd to me to reject them.
In addition, the North was not much better, as many people idealize it nowadays.
And a lot of people also forget that not everyone in the South was a slave, and a lot of things were against them, too.
I would not compare this with the Russians, they deliberately omit some facts, lie and manipulate, besides maybe our view does not exist with them (there was also a video on YT from the television where they turned off someone who started talking about our legionaries and 1968).
What I found ridiculous in U.S. schools was the rise of Marxism and the idealization of communism, something their country has never experienced.
Overall, I found it to be horrific at some universities, these students were pretty radicalized, and those schools supported them so many times.
And if I imagine that these people are going to be a lot older one day, I'm a little bit upset that this could be the voice of the majority, because it's among the young and even in the ruling elite.
It seems to me that feminism has already achieved what it had and it is no longer the same, it has radicalized.
Today, feminists are referred to as those who have nothing to do with it and ignore the basic biological fact, as well as other groups such as LGBT, and this leads to radicalization on the opposite side, where it often leads to resistance even in quite reasonable things.
In addition, the more radical someone is, the more they are heard.
In conclusion, I also did not see anyone condemning me for colonialism or slavery.
I've been through a lot of geography, but it's both ways. :D
Not because I don't like it here, but because I think it's completely pointless.
Am I supposed to be proud of something I couldn't do on my own?
In addition, I consider the concept of nationality as a whole unnecessary in terms of some personal identity.
If something with people connects me to interests, worldviews and shared experiences, not the place where we were born.
I am not a believer, but from what I know, I can tell you this: we have two Greek-Catholic parishes, one is Ukrainian and the other is Slovak.
The Slovak priest is a very nice guy, he preaches more about theology than politics, but then he always fucks up some coconut about the coronavirus that everyone is ashamed of.
Then, of course, there is the Czechoslovak Hussite Church.
Officially they are Protestants, but in fact they were born out of Catholic modernity and are in fact Catholic without a pope.
I know a lot of people who are Catholics, but they go to the Hussites for worship because it is theologically very similar, but the members are mostly more liberal.
They have a beautiful and historically very valuable functionalist temple on Botanic Street.
Otherwise, the church of St. Michael in Dominican Square belongs to the Dominicans and even there every Sunday at 15:00 they do Mass in Latin, as was done before Vatican II.
The flame from Bethlehem is in the Czech Republic, the scouts took it from Austria
B<0xC5><0x99>eclav – A flame lit in Bethlehem, where, according to Christian tradition, Jesus Christ was born, is in the Czech Republic.
The scouts did not go to Vienna for him because of the coronavirus pandemic, but in the morning they took him from their Austrian colleagues at the border crossing between Reintal and B<0xC5><0x99>eclav.
It was taken over at the border last year.
The light of Bethlehem is a beautiful Christmas tradition that we attend with the section every year, I look forward to it.
It’s an honor for me to have been selected,” Scout Amalia Budíková told reporters.
Last year, the transfer took place at the Mikulov-Drasenhofen border crossing, directly at the border bridge, now at the Reintal-B<0xC5><0x99>eclav crossing at the parking lot.
For him, however, scouts usually travel by train to Vienna.
There is no change in the distribution of flames throughout the Czech Republic.
With the Bethlehem light, scouts traditionally left by train first to Brno, where they handed it over to Diocesan Bishop Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch Cikrle.
The subsequent distribution of light will be handled by scout couriers on Saturday, December 18, who will travel by selected high-speed buses and personal trains.
From them, the light will be taken over in the stations by local scouts or volunteers, who will then continue to spread the flames throughout the Czech Republic and where the tracks do not lead.
This year, scouts must follow the current measures against the spread of the coronavirus.
It's going the same as last year.
We recommend both the courier teams and the organizers of local events to wear robes of course, try to keep the distances, there were as few of them as possible, not to sing to colleagues, just to behave in a way that was as safe as possible, described the spokeswoman of the Bethlehem Light event Zuzana Hrbková.
The tradition of Bethlehem light, which travels through Europe, was born in 1986 in Austria.
The aim is to spread at the same time as the flame of the idea of peace, friendship and peace.
For the believer, the light of Bethlehem is a symbol of hope, a light that transcends the darkness.
In the Czech Republic, scouts and scouts have been taking care of its spread for more than 30 years.
The event is attended by hundreds of volunteers, and the flames are also a symbol of generosity and human reciprocity.
All news, including a list of places where people can come for flames, can be found on the website www.betlemskesvetlo.cz.
I don't have an economic education, so I don't know the basics of economics that confirm that subsidies are the cancer of the economy, but I don't think subsidies as a whole would be a problem.
The development of infrastructure, ecology (e.g. water retention), health care and education use this money properly, but I do not understand why this money is given to agriculture, industry and companies as a whole.
As mentioned - a useless product is produced and it invades the free market and the "natural life of the company".
I work in a factory where a million billboards are "XY financed/co-financed by Project XY" in the hallways, and such a company is simply artificially kept alive.
This is not the support of a company that gives work x people, this is the impetus of development when this company both holds on and takes the contracts/employees to companies that could grow and be more productive after its demise
Totally agree, it's awful.
Sometimes even a person who was born in the age of the Internet gets caught in some trick or trap - especially advertising.
I don’t think internet ads move with me, but then I get caught up in the fact that they also influenced me – it’s just so pretentious that you can’t always avoid it.
For this reason, I support the radical votes in the European Parliament, which at the moment want to give a complete ban on programmatic (= targeted) advertising...
It's all bullshit, in the words of a classic - I'd ban those internets.
I have a feeling that this virus has its roots in (but mostly in point 1):
“I’m not going to believe something that most people believe and makes sense, I’m not a sheep, but I’d rather believe something that’s less likely, it doesn’t make much sense, but it’s important that I have my own original opinion that I’ll say is critical thinking.”
“I’m not going to believe everything the media says.”
“I don’t trust politicians.”
The TV has fallen the trend of Christmas movies, the premiere of which this year has two hundred
Los Angeles – Movies, TV stations and streaming platforms in the U.S. and other English-speaking countries have fallen into the trend of Christmas movies, bringing their audiences to a record over two hundred this year.
This was calculated by the operator of the film database IMDb.
The genre of Christmas family and romantic films in recent years scores and significantly increases the audience, therefore these images are increasingly being created.
This year, there have been four times more Christmas movies than in 2011 and twice as many as five years ago.
The IMDb database included only those images that have the word Christmas in their name, so there will actually be much more holiday movies.
Movies that people traditionally associate with Christmas have always existed.
In the Czech Republic, fairy tales are especially associated with this period, pictures from Sam at home, Love Heavenly or the classic Christmas story Life is Beautiful from 1946 are also popular around the world.
But the real boom of Christmas movies only started in 2009, when the special film series came with the American cable television station Hallmark, the BBC said.
Her advent project called Countdown to Christmas included four films at the time and was a very successful one.
This year, the station began tuning its spectators for Christmas on October 22 and will present a total of 42 Christmas pictures.
Competitive Lifetime has 35 new Christmas-themed movies on its program this year, and popular streaming platforms such as Netflix are contributing to the total.
“At this magical time, the story doesn’t matter much, it’s important that there are a lot of Christmas trees in the background and it’s snowing,” said Brandon Gray, author of the book I’ll Be Home for Christmas Movies.
“For viewers, it’s a form of escape and a way to feel a little bit of peace for at least two hours amid all the festive madness and madness of the world we’ve been living in for the last few years,” Gray added.
According to him, for example, Hallmark TV still uses the same recipe for its films, which is uniform but successful.
You have two people who fall in love with each other, but then about half an hour before the end there is some misunderstanding that will be solved well and the two of them will kiss.
It’s like this all the time, and as long as all the movies look the same and have the same atmosphere, people are watching one after the other, Gray adds.

Only nineteen riders will go to the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix in Formula 1.
Nikita Mazepin had positive text on COVID-19 and will not hit until the last race of the season.
Stallion Haas will send only one formula to the track.
In the final race of the season, he had to attack for a better placement from the 20th division, which he took in the qualifying.
However, the Russian Nikita Mazepin from Haas stall will not eventually hit the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.
He was tested positive for COVID-19.
Only nineteen cars will appear on the starting grid, Mazepin teammate Mick Schumacher from the first Max Verstappen to compete with Lewis Hamilton in the direct title battle.
According to Haas stable, mazepin is quite fine and shows no symptoms.
Nikita is physically fine because she was asymptomatic.
She is now in isolation and will follow the instructions of the relevant public health authorities, with safety being the ultimate priority for all stakeholders," she told Formula1.com.
He doesn't send or can't send a replacement driver into the Haas race.
A possible substitute would have to complete a qualification or ride in another part of the weekend.
Covid-19 does not affect the first racer.
At the start of the season, Kimi Räikkönen had COVID-19, Sergio Pérez and Lewis Hamilton tested positive last year.
They can put you in jail for that, too.

Gold, silver and 150 diamonds: The price list of the most expensive sweater will amaze!
It's kind of like a portable jewelry store and the creator put half a year of work and all his savings into it.
“I had a vision of what I wanted to create, but with little experience, sweaters never wore much at home,” admits Lebanon, who spent 3,000 hours over the course of six months.
Silk was purchased in Italy, 24k gold threads in France and 2000 ornamental crystals were supplied by Swarowski.
He then decorated the silver stars with 150 diamonds.
"The basics are wool and cotton, but silk gives the sweater softness," praises the creator of his work, which he does not recommend washing.
And there's another hook.
“I’m completely out of my mind, I have to sell the sweater as soon as possible,” Lebanon admits.
If it succeeds, it will set a world record.
The most expensive sweater to date, sold five years ago, cost "only" 720,000 crowns.

The government approved the deployment of up to 150 troops to help Poland.
Wives, scouts and drone pilots could leave before Christmas, the mission is approved for six months.
They are to help Polish colleagues with the protection of the border with Belarus and with the construction of the planned fence.
Poland has officially requested assistance from NATO countries, in connection with several months of actions by the Belarusian regime, which invites citizens of Middle Eastern countries to its territory with the false promise of an easy crossing of the EU border.
British and Estonian troops are already operating on Polish territory.
Is the Omicron mutation spreading in southern Moravia?
The hygiene department is looking into another case of an Adam's child.
“We are currently reporting further suspicion of this variant in another child from Adam’s, from the preparatory class.
Direct contact with previous cases from Adamov State University has not been proven," Ciupek said.
There have been six cases in the region this week.
“We are still waiting for the official confirmation of the variant in our six cases – it is carried out by the National Reference Laboratory for Influenza and Non-Influenza Viruses of the State Institute of Health in Prague,” said the Director.
She added that they are two nurses from one workplace of the Brno University Hospital and two children of one of them, and two eleven-year-old students of Adamov University.
There is no connection between the cases of Brno and Adamov.
Three of them, according to the director, have mild symptoms, four have a symptomless course.
No one has ever traveled abroad with suspicion of Omicron.
None of them traveled abroad, nor did any of their families, nor did they make contact with anyone living abroad.
There is no link to the water polo championship with any of the above, Ciupek said.

California will restrict the sale of weapons.
He wants to act like Texas in banning abortions.
California Gov. Gavin Newsom on Saturday announced a plan to impose a ban on the sale and production of certain weapons in the most populous state in the U.S., using a legal mechanism that Texas used in its controversial abortion law after detecting an embryo's heartbeat.
People would then be entitled to compensation when prosecuting anyone who manufactures or sells assault rifles and home-made firearms in California.
Newsom’s announcement responded to a U.S. Supreme Court ruling on Friday that left the Texas abortion ban in place, despite going against a nearly 50-year-old precedent verdict that established the right to abortion on a flat basis throughout the U.S. by roughly the 24th month of pregnancy.
However, the Court has now decided not on the constitutionality of the entire law, but on the technical issue arising from the innovative design of the measure.
The enforcement of the ban in this case was carried over to the public, thus preventing the Texas Republicans from attacking him by the usual legal means.
“I am outraged by yesterday’s Supreme Court decision that allowed Texas to maintain the ban on most abortion services and largely supported Texas’s maneuver to protect its law,” the governor said in a statement.
“If states can now block the review of their laws by federal courts, then California will use this power to protect human lives,” he said.
He told his subordinates to work in cooperation with the state parliament and the minister of justice on measures that would empower the public to enforce the ban on assault rifles and so-called ghost weapons.
This is what we call home-made weapons that do not have serial numbers and that can be used to circumvent regulations.
Newsom wants “private citizens” to have the right to claim compensation of at least $10,000 (over CZK 220,000) and court costs from anyone who would manufacture, distribute or sell assault rifles, “ghost weapons” components or kits for their production in California.
“If the most effective way to keep these terrible weapons out of our streets is to create a threat of private lawsuits, then that’s exactly what we should do,” the governor said.
California has for decades banned the production and sale of certain military-style weapons, but in June a federal judge blocked the ban as unconstitutional.
If the state were to actually renew the ban using the Texas template, the words of the liberal member of the Supreme Court Sonia Sotomayor would be confirmed, who warned in a disagreeing opinion on Friday’s majority verdict against extending the legal mechanism to other US states.
However, the Texas Supreme Court did not grant full immunity from a judicial review and allowed abortion clinics to continue to sue selected officials from the southern U.S. state.
Each emergency vaccination has its own public testing phase, where it gradually finds out what the vaccination schedule will look like and also improves the vaccines themselves, based on the results.
Perhaps from Israel, there is already a large-scale study on the effects of 4 doses.
And according to these studies, most patients experience up to a five-fold increase in antibodies, which has the long-term effect you already mentioned.
Just like any other vaccine, it will have its own vaccination schedule over time, but it’s too early for that yet.
Another fact is that a new vaccine based on an inactivated virus, which according to the manufacturer’s specifications promises up to 10x more efficacy, should be on the market shortly.
The quantity teaches to keep calm.
But reassess what you're learning.
Since the days of Marie Theresa, our civilization and technology have advanced a little, and learning phonebooks and describing textbooks in notebooks no longer makes much sense, and it’s really a waste of time.

Poland threatens to stop payments to the EU budget
According to Ziobra, the European Commission would act contrary to the law if it used the new powers and suspended the payment of money to Poland due to a dispute over the rule of law.
The Commission has already postponed the approval of the Polish plan to draw <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>36 billion from the EU fund to rebuild economies affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.
And it is under pressure from the European Parliament to move forward and use a mechanism allowing EU subsidies to be withdrawn from countries that violate the rule of law.
“Poland should respond to this blackmail by the EU with veto in all matters that require unanimity,” said Ziobro, the head of the small party Solidarno<0xC5><0x9B><0xC4><0x87> Poland, without whose vote the current government would lose a narrow majority in the Seimas.
"Poland should also consider its commitments in the EU's energy and climate policy, which lead to drastic increases in energy prices," Ziobro added.
If the dispute continues, I will demand that Poland stop its contributions to the EU.
This would be justified given that the EU is illegally denying us funds from the common budget, to which we are also contributing, the Polish Minister added.
His party is more radical in its approach to the EU than the ruling Law and Justice party.
According to the European Commission, the changes that the Polish justice system has undergone under Ziobro threaten its independence and subordinate it to politicians.
According to Ziobra, Brussels sets “impossible conditions, because its goal is not the rule of law, but a change of government in Poland.”
Warsaw is facing a “political dictatorship carried out by blackmail and an attempt to undermine the democratic decision of several million Poles,” Ziobro said.
He said Poland should be a member of such an EU that is based on a partnership of sovereign states, not on a government of the strongest and Brussels bureaucracy that is not under democratic control.
He said that his party would never agree to such concessions by Brussels, which would limit Poland’s sovereignty.
“We will never agree that Poland should have colony status,” he said.
But to admit it... we in Lidl have one kind of cheese in four different places.
I did not look for other things, I also met one yogurt several times, I only needed cheese, parmesan, after ten minutes at the milk shelves I resigned and asked.
They had it, it's true, in that narrow sector they were all selected, less common and special cheeses, but it was between the vegetable and the lactose-free zone...
If it is avoided, no longer in any market or smell, non-action action, gold store in the square, there may not have such a choice, but most of the time they have everything I need and it has some order, so I'm done in ten minutes.

When I was a child, I was punished with a boil.
It was never because of the signs, most of the time it was just because I repeatedly refused to listen and became angry (reading instead of going to bed, wrestling with my brother, etc.).
At the same time, I was never punished without warning, my mother always first threatened that if I did it again, I would get a blow (sometimes even after the next "grabbing" the cooker just brought and laid so that I could see it).
Only after I repeatedly refused to listen did I get a couple of asslashes (over clothes).
Personally, I think that physical punishments (in reasonable execution and degree) are beneficial, because the child responds to them much more than to words.
In my opinion, the part with the warning is important, because it gives the child in its own way a choice whether to disobey and get or not to get better and there will be no punishment.
At the end of the day, all I needed was a warning to start listening.
Defense of the system
When Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch Cepl, a prominent Czech lawyer and constitutional judge, answered a journalistic question in 1999 about what the Czech constitution means to him – whether it is a sacred charter, which he swears to and about which he has been taught since childhood in school, or, on the contrary, an agreement that can be changed if necessary, the first step is made.
Once in the Constitution, we agreed on the democratic rules of our lives, which at the same time define who we are as a state and its citizens, and with changes we can better spare them.
And imagine: some nations even like their own rules.
Just as the Czechs like dumplings with pork and cabbage, Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch Cepl voted at the time.
Recently, however, the opinion among lawyers is increasingly emerging that the Constitution of the Czech Republic needs changes.
Years are being tested by situations that its creators (to which Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch Cepl belonged) could not have predicted, such as the behavior of the directly elected president.
But in one thing, Cepl was right.
Everything we know about such documents shows that political interventions in their texts must be thoughtful.
The constitution must be understood and actively defended, only then can it be the key to managing most of the crises that societies encounter throughout history.
The Constitution is, among other things, some sort of order of government consisting of individual rules that set the politicians of the game.
We fear that power will be abused against minorities or individuals, so we bind politicians with bans.
At the same time, constitutional texts also allow politicians to take their power.
Covid does not choose, in FN Brno they fight for the life of a several-month-old baby
Although the coronavirus is known to be milder in children, there are also severe cases that hospitals are facing, especially in recent times.
“We know that children are at risk and affected less than adults, there is talk of 2 to 5 percent compared to adults,” said the Primary of the Clinic of Pediatric Anesthesiology and Resuscitation of the Faculty Hospital Brno and the Faculty of Medicine of Masaryk University Dominic.
The course is often much easier, lighter, often without symptoms.
But there are pediatric patients who are severely ill with the coronavirus, which we see especially in the recent period," Dominik added.
According to the doctor, these are dozens of children who need mild supportive care.
This takes place at the Children's Infectious Disease Clinic.
Really very seriously ill children with the coronavirus are on ARU until recently.
Children with post-covid syndromes were on the ward continuously throughout the year, according to the doctor.
"Now there is an increase in children with acute COVID pneumonia, that is, with pneumonia, which requires staying on a resuscitation bed," he said, adding that the disease affects adults in addition to both teenagers and multi-month-old babies.
In hospitals there are also children in severe condition due to the coronavirus.
“Currently, we have a baby of several months and adolescence,” said the principal.
However, he is pleased that no child deaths have been reported at the FN Brno Children’s Hospital so far.
According to the available data, six children aged 0 to 14 died in the Czech Republic on December 6.
According to Dominic, in the children’s hospital – not only in the coronavirus department – it is an integral part of the cooperation of the psychologist.
At the same time, it also draws attention to the fact that, just like in adults, vaccination reduces the course of the disease and, at the same time, reduces the incidence of post-covid syndrome.
"Therefore, we recommend the administration of the vaccine dose to children," the doctor added.
In a quiet zone, you can only walk on marked roads.
But those quiet zones aren't that big.
They can be seen on the tourist map on maps.cz.
In general, in national parks outside the calm zone, you can walk anywhere (but do not walk across the fence to the field).
Skiing/biking in the forest outside the marked path is not allowed anywhere unless you have an exception (but of course it is not taken care of very much outside the national parks).

China Building Impressions of Managed Disease and Authoritarian Regime Facing Crisis Better
Sinolog Jirou<0xC5><0xA1>: China is building the impression that the disease is managed and that the authoritarian regime is facing the crisis better.
China has gone on a medical and political offensive.
A few months ago, Beijing reflected criticism for failing to stop the contagion that has turned into a global pandemic.
The country is now reporting a zero increase in infections.
Countries including the Czech Republic are competing for Chinese protective equipment, and Chinese doctors are helping a lot in the fight against the coronavirus, for example, even in the worst-hit Italy.
How do you feel about Beijing?
Is it friendly support or is the communist regime trying to improve its image in the world?
A friend meets a friend and says to him, "Don't you want an elephant?"
I got it, and it's great.
The wife is happy because she saves the grass, the car is washed with water, the children play with it.
Well, it's just great.
If you want 5,000, I'll sell you an elephant.
My friend, I'm going to make it, it's going to be great.
After a while they meet and the one who bought complains: dude, what did you sell for an elephant???
The lawn is laid out, the big shit is everywhere, the car is gone, the kids are afraid of it, and the wife wants to get a divorce.
The man who sold it says, "You don't talk nicely about an elephant, you don't sell an elephant like that."
The world is controlled by great powers.
Although the equality of sovereign states applies, it is the great powers that determine the course of international affairs.
Europe can only become such a great power if it works for its integration.
It is still operating at the economic and political level (on selected issues), but there is still a lack of military integration.
I personally think that Europe is moving towards federalization.
It won't be in 10, 15 or 20 years.
But maybe in the middle of the century, the mood will be different and it will work.
I thought so too, and it's quite possible.
I'm not an expert in Czech, so maybe I'll vocabulary.
I'm just assuming that the ellipse usually involves 2 different units at the same level.
I will take an example from another commentary on "Spanish oranges and mandarins", where it is clear that they are both from Spain, whereas "Spanish fruit and mandarins" are no longer clear on mandarins that they are from Spain.
In addition, I base it on the fact that the phrase reads “all American forces” including their weapons and that I know that American complexes are operated only by Americans.
In other words, I expect that it is already included in this broad concept and there is no need to specify it further with the American forces.
But again, maybe I'll just say the words :D
Either way, it’s a nonsense request.

Vicki Holland of Britain tortured the monkey of the cosmonaut Milly
Horrifying footage shows the moment when the frightened monkey squeezed into the toilet bowl before her heartless owner rinsed her and laughed at her.
The Dutch monkey also fed sausages, kebabs and burgers, regardless of her real nutritional needs.
A court in Gwent has banned her from raising animals for life, The Sun newspaper reported.
The monkey rehabilitation specialists who take care of Milly after she was abused said they had never seen such a frightened cosmonaut before.
Milly spent nearly two years rehabilitating Monkey World workers in Dorset and is now playing happily with another rescued monkey named Moon.
A four-time mother confessed to two accusations of causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal.
She was sentenced to 12 weeks imprisonment by the Gwent Magistrate's Court with a conditional deferral of one year.
Hollande was also sentenced to 120 hours of unpaid work, was given a life-long ban on animal husbandry and has to pay 12,000 crowns in legal costs.
The head of the Small Monkeys team, Steph Sawyer, said: “Milly is fine, but the rehabilitation will continue.”
Milly took a while to get used to people again.
She shrugged and hid from everyone she met, and any loud sound or sudden movement made her scream.
The monkey refused to eat for a long time.
Even now that she has settled down and is satisfied with a male, looking at new people in her can still cause panic.
The mental scars of abuse will accompany her forever, Sawyer adds.
Milly's harassment came to light after police in Gwent discovered horrifying footage of a woman's phone after a blast in her apartment on drug charges.
In the footage, you can hear Milly mocking vulgarly.
In the next video, he hears a Holland monkey offering cocaine and saying, “Do you want cocaine?”
Then lick my fingers.
In May, she and her partner Russell Cox, 43, admitted to possessing cocaine with the intention of selling it.
In her home, cocaine for <0xC2><0xA3>1,600 (less than <0xC2><0xA3>50,000) was found hidden in Kinder eggs.
Cox was subsequently imprisoned for 30 months and Hollande was given a 20-month probation.
And what amazing concepts will you learn from that ancient world three times in a row, if you bravely skip the whole 20th century?
Like you're going to take the same stuff in high school as you did in sixth grade?
And it all kills the idea of buffalo, where no one, with the exceptions, cares if you can or understand.
Write a test on 1 and then no one cares.
Go and on the street, people randomly ask if they can determine the character of the roots of the square equation and the coefficients.
They've all gone through it, and the absolute majority won't even get a kick out of it and tell you they're totally fucked up.
So what the fuck is he learning?
I’m a big fan of the general overview and the fact is that people don’t want and don’t need.
And at that moment, it's useless and you'll never get it into them anyway.
Part of it is being taught to the many people who will need the thing.
But, like, the note that you don't really need all this stuff standing by the machine, I meant absolutely serious because you just don't need it.
In addition, we are slowly entering a time when not knowing is a sign of punk.
(Which we probably have our communist past and our resentment against educators and elites) However, the cost of becoming barbarians at these machines is simply high.
If journalists could count, Covid would probably never have reached this size.
Wedding at first glance: The war of Kadri and Andrey continues!
That’s the main reason why she can’t leave Switzerland right away,” Andrea said on Instagram on Stories, responding to all sorts of questions from her fans, which disappointed her on Kadri so much that she decided to end all contact and even block it on social media.
Between Kadrim and Andrea, it's been crunching since the beginning of the experiment.
The main problem was the fact that Kadri lived and worked in Switzerland and his idea was that Andrea would move after her, at least until she returned to Bohemia permanently.
But she resolutely refused.
And as you can see, their relationship not only did not end with love, but rather grew into mutual disrespect and hatred.
It was a planned attack from you! he was angry at Kadri's turn in response to Andre's accusations of lying, gambling and debt.
Kadri's alleged sincerity now disliked his ex-wife, not even his younger sister Linda.
She decided to defend her brother publicly.
Normally, I don't talk about things like that at all, and we've never said much of these things to each other in our family.
I definitely don't want to invoke any remorse.
But when I see someone trying to publicly hurt and dirty the name of someone I love so much, I just don't get it!
I’m sorry to have to do it this way, but I would like to publicly thank my brother Kadrima for making himself a character and helping our family when we needed it most, despite how young he was.
I am even more sorry when I have to read such untrue information, which is probably quite out of context.
I would like everyone to know Kadri as much as I, our loved ones and family, stand in confession in response to Andrey’s words.
I am truly grateful to him for everything!
Of course, people will believe what is written, but the most important thing is that we, his family, love him above all else and know the reality and know how it really was, added indefinitely.
The drunken thief climbed up the façade to the fifth floor.
You won't believe why.
Cchao began his robbery in a parking lot in the residential district, where he tried to break into several cars.
According to available information, he eventually stole less than 330 crowns from one vehicle.
Then he thought of nothing better than climbing up to the 5th floor and entering the apartment through an open window.
He stole two bananas.
In a video from a security camera, he is then captured leaving the street away from the crime scene and eating a banana.
When the owner of the apartment woke up in the morning, he found that the bananas were not where they were, and called the police.
She then detained Chaa.
The man admitted that he drank alcohol on the day of the crime.
And since he needed money, he decided to rob drunk.
The whole thing is under investigation so far.
The drunk climbed up the façade to the 5th floor, where he stole two bananas.
Pandemic law is limited in time and effectively tied to pandemic emergency.
If it is repealed, the law will not be effective.

The right to collect will be limited, but not revoked.
More than 60 percent of voters came to the four municipalities on Saturday.
On Saturday, people voted in the villages of Kom<0xC5><0x88>a in Uherskohradishsk, Lu<0xC5><0xBE>ice in Mostek, Nová Ves in Liberec and in Rovna in Pelh<0xC5><0x99>imovsk.
The number of representatives in these municipalities has fallen below the statutory number or the elected representative offices have disintegrated.
There were 99 candidates for a total of 28 terms on Saturday.
The average age of newly elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest of them is 69 years old, the youngest 33 years old.
The processing of the results of Saturday’s elections for us symbolically concludes a rather challenging but successful year.
There were a total of four new or repeated elections to the municipal councils and, above all, highly watched elections to the Chamber of Deputies, said CSU Vice-President Eva Krumpová.
She recalled that due to the COVID-19 epidemic, elections were more demanding for equipment and personnel security.
In Komna, Hungary, the Association of Independent Candidates won the elections on Saturday, which won 27.76 percent of the vote and two mandates in the seven-member delegation.
The STAN candidate received 24.84 percent of the vote, which also means winning two terms.
Citizens also won two seats in the House of Representatives, with 18.52 percent of the voters giving them their vote.
Again, Jana K<0xC5><0x99>i<0xC5><0xBE>ková, the former mayor of the village, who is a member of the Private People’s Party, came to represent them.
One mandate in the deputy council was achieved by the Comanches – independent candidates.
75.48 percent of eligible voters came to the polls.
In the village of Rovná in Pelh<0xC5><0x99>imovska, the association Pro Rovna won.
He won 50.50 percent of the vote, which means four seats out of seven.
Two other representatives from the Association of Independent Candidates 1 and one from the Association of Independent Candidates 2 joined the Municipal Council.
Voter turnout was 93.62%.
The re-election in Lu<0xC5><0xBE>ice on Mostek was won again by the Association of Lu<0xC5><0xBE>ice and Svin<0xC4><0x8D>ice led by Mayor Jind<0xC5><0x99>ich John.
He won 56.73 percent of the vote and, as in 2018, has four mandates in the seven-member delegation.
The second candidate, the Municipality for the People, who voted with 43.27% of the voters, will have three representatives in the representative office.
76.7% of the electorate voted.
The elections in Nové Vs in Liberec were won by independent candidates of Hope for Nové Ves before the ANO Movement.
For the Association of Independent Candidates, 59.88 percent of the electorate voted and won four seats in the seven-member municipal council.
The ANO received 40.12% of the votes, and against proper elections in 2018 it strengthened, won more mandates and has three.
Voter turnout was 42.9 percent.
The election results will be discussed by the National Election Commission on Monday.
They will then be published in the Bill of Rights.
What do you think would be a bigger problem?
Dead civilian or foreign policy?
I think you know all these things that people here write.
You're just playing a fool to have someone to argue with.
If not, it's sad.
I'm not saying that Christians are degenerates, or anything like that.
I even like a lot of church buildings from an aesthetic point of view (which, after all, was the goal to make them look good).
I don’t care who believes in what.
On the other hand, I don’t care how much power the church had in the Middle Ages, how much money it made, the suppression of science, etc.
Not to mention all the wars it caused, such as the Thirty Years War.
“Believe in a spaghetti monster, but the state and the church have nothing to do together.”
The man fell head down from twelve meters.
The impact on the concrete survived.
A man in Ostrava survived an incredible fall on Sunday night, in which rescuers of the regional Health Rescue Service intervened.
District Operations Center workers responded to an emergency call an hour after midnight on Saturday with initial information about a man's fall from a height.
Two ZZS crews – medical and medical – immediately took off.
After arriving at the site, the ambulance found that the 27-year-old man had to fall out of the window from a height of about twelve meters and hit his head on concrete!
Coal was caught in Vítkovice.
But not as it should, and the firefighters went into action.
At the time of arrival of the rescue teams, the man was unconscious, with multiple injuries and in direct danger of life.
The intervening doctor intubated his airways, provided artificial pulmonary ventilation and after further measures in the pre-hospital emergency care, his ambulance transported him to the additional care of the Ostrava trauma center, the spokesman for the ZZS MS of the region, Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Humpl, reported.
I am more concerned than the coronavirus about the inadequate reactions of the public and the authorities
The spread of the coronavirus in the Czech Republic is a challenge for politicians and officials, but in the first line of the fight against the disease, doctors and medical personnel are the main ones.

Legendary Nunes fell after seven years, Oliveira defended the belt
MMA has had a great gala night full of interesting results.
In UFC 269, there was a lot going on.
Outsider Julianna Pe<0xC5><0x88>ová has been able to defeat legendary fighter Amanda Nunes, who has not found a conqueror for seven years.
Charles Oliveira did not hesitate in the lightweight, showed a great strangulation against Dustin Poirier and defended the belt.
The victory was also recorded by Kai Kara-France, who quickly cleared Cody Garbrandt of the technical KO in the first round.
He was also defeated by Sean O'Malley.
A surprise that no one expected.
This was brought about by the women’s bantam match between the famous Amanda Nunes and Julianna Pe<0xC5><0x88>a.
The American woman entered the battle with each other as an imaginary "dwarf", after not losing for seven years and grinding her teeth for another triumph.
In addition, the beginning of the duel was carried in the spirit of paper assumptions.
Nunes started her path to victory very actively, and the opponent even gave a push kick by which she sent her to the ground.
However, she did not allow herself to make any further mistakes and unsuccessfully attempted to attack herself with a lever on her hand.
The second round was exciting and very exciting for MMA fans.
Both rivals were honored with a lot of excellent punches and hard hooks.
In addition, Nunes was taken to the ground, where she began to choke her.
She had to give up and stop the attack.
The American woman was so shocked when she became the new champion.
The highlight of the gala evening was the battle between Charles Oliveira and Dustin Poirier for a lightweight title.
Initially, Poirier was doing better, but the card gradually began to turn.
In the second, he tried to be more active with Oliveira, who tried to beat the opponent with a lever on his hand.
He did not succeed, but then he put a lot of pressure on himself, put his opponent on his back, and inflicted a series of wounds.
Thanks to this, he won the second round.
In the third round Oliveira showed the rear naked choke, which Poirier defied for a while, but then had to knock off the choke.
The Brazilian defended the title, while Poirier lost after two years.
In the next match, he scored a sovereign victory for Sean O'Malley, who already put Raulian Paiva on the hard right back in the first round.
Subsequently, he hit him with a series of precise punches and recorded a fifteenth triumph.
Kara-France was able to deal with Cody Garbrandt.
In the spring, Nunes celebrated another triumph with her little daughter, now losing after seven years.

At first glance, it’s nothing complicated.
Most substantive names in Czech only express one grammatical gender, so it is not a problem for them to determine whether they are male, female or middle-aged.
Then there is also a fairly numerous group of substantive names, for which the genus is not established.
Such substantive names vary between two genera.
When inclined, they acquire two ends and in some cases remain in an inclined form.
For example, the words "switch" or "kitchen" are male and female, in the first they are inclined according to the pattern "machine", in the second according to the pattern "song".
For other substantive names, different forms are already in the first drop of a single number, for example: ‘line/line’, ‘keduben/keduben’ or ‘potato/potato’ (in the sense of food).
Both forms are written, have the same meaning, and are therefore freely interchangeable.
Some terms may vary regionally, for example "cucumber" in Bohemia and "cucumber" in Moravia, but in this case the Moravian variant is unwritten, similarly there are other Czech-Moravian pairs of words: "p<0xC5><0x99>íkop" and "p<0xC5><0x99>íkopa", "dough" and "dough" etc.
Some words that penetrated into Czech from other languages were originally inclined, but gradually took over Czech endings.
A typical example is the term "image", which is male and female, or the word "buffet", which has remained inclined in the middle ages, but in the male it has endings according to the model of "castle".
Turkey has opened the way for migrants to enter Europe.
What is the situation on the Greek border?
On the Greek-Turkish border there are tensions over the growing number of migrants trying to get further into Europe.
Thousands of people began to surrender to the southern border of the Schengen area after Ankara stopped defending them.
European politicians are promising support to Greece, and the Czech government is also preparing humanitarian aid.

Three months we didn’t see the blue sky and we choked, describes a journalist from Sydney
The devastating fires Australia has been facing for the fourth month have killed nearly three dozen people and hundreds of millions of animals and devastated millions of hectares of land.
How do the authorities and the people themselves cope with the disaster?
Could Prime Minister Morrison’s government do more to prevent drastic impacts, critics say?
And what will the country have to prepare for in the context of climate change in the future?
Lenka Kabrhel is talking to the Sydney journalist Ika Detrich.
False accusations have always been and still are rare.
That’s why it’s always written about everyone everywhere.
It’s uncomfortable for people to deal with what sexual violence looks like in our society, and how widespread it is, so they’re trying to make a reservation.
I personally don't know anyone who has been falsely accused.
But I know a lot of people who have been raped and I have experienced how people around them or even the police are often treated.
Victims should always be trusted.
The trend has become that victims are finally opening up about their traumas.
But he still keeps too many people to himself.
There are also those who falsely accuse others.
It's disgusting and spitting in the face of all the victims of sexual violence, but by spreading the idea that "a lot of the accusations are fictitious" and that it's a "trend" you're only helping sexual abusers.
Czech Republic floods derelict houses, families have no money to complete
Construction materials prices have risen by more than 30 percent in recent weeks and months.
A lot of people got into a bad situation because of this.
She does not have the funds to complete the decommissioned family homes, and the banks are refusing to increase her mortgage loans.
In addition to the price of materials, the cost of construction works also increases.
Therefore, people do not have enough money to complete the already deployed family homes.
In many cases, banks refuse to increase their mortgage loans, which creates extremely unpleasant situations.
In the best case, people move to detached and uncoloured homes.
In the worst case, the detached houses are uninhabitable and families are forced to sell them because they cannot afford to pay the mortgages and still pay the rent," says economist <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>pán K<0xC5><0x99>e<0xC4><0x8D>ek.
We will build two or three family houses in a year, and at fifty percent it happened to us.
It’s hard for us as a construction company to have to keep certain things contractually, even if the material is expensive.
So we do without earnings," said the owner of the construction company Zden<0xC4><0x9B>k Slivo<0xC5><0x88>.
A lot of people will still have financial problems.
If they calculated that the building of the house will cost five million, now it will cost them seven.
I think some will be waiting," Slivon added.
Copper, iron and also plumbing and heating equipment were the most expensive materials.
Construction companies are also struggling with labour shortages.
In the Czech Republic, graduates in the construction sector are missing and the influx of foreign workers is hampering the pandemic.
At the moment, only the situation regarding the issuance of a building permit is more favorable.
“The construction authorities issued 7,675 building permits in October, which is almost 10 percent more than a year ago,” K<0xC5><0x99>e<0xC4><0x8D>ek said.
We're doing well, and we'll be doing even better.
The real vision is missing, says the commentator <0xC4><0x8C>RO – mujRozhlas
In addition to classical celebrations, the entry into the new year has traditionally been accompanied by speeches by politicians.
This year, in addition to the Prime Minister and President of the UN, Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1>, and the Christmas message of President Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Zeman, the Presidents of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies also spoke to the people.
What important things have we learned?
As a graduate, I find it super, I have my own theme that I chose, I attach myself to a bachelor's degree, I always work on it all year and then in a week or two I write a written part.
The states are completely at ease with us, if a man is not a total monkey and something remains in his head, then the commission will not unnecessarily suffocate him on the theory.
I may have been studying for a week at the State University and when I was in the end, the commission always tried to lead me to some logical derivation, which came to me right away, and I had it right.
Otherwise, on those projects, I know people who pay someone to do the semester project (we did it many times, really beneficial, they will learn a lot) and then they just learn the project and they are outdated.
I think it’s great when at the end of the course there’s an exam where the knowledge gained within the project is projected, not just defense.
But don't overload emails and phones, and don't send any packages to the embassy.
You'll be the same as them.
Those people at the embassy may have nothing to do with it.
And if they were against Russia, they would take a lot of risks, so maybe they have to play with them, otherwise something could happen to them.
But you can safely build a similar statue of Putin next to the statue of the bear Pu.
You might want to give it a shot at Xi Jinping's ass or something.
I agree, even though Insta is throwing sticks at artists.
As soon as you don’t give stories every day and at least every other day a new picture, your achievements will be reduced to the absolute minimum.
In addition, it constantly changes which function is more important, whether like, comment or save.
It's terribly messing me up lately, so maybe I'm going to have to go down to the tik-tuk, where a lot of artists in my industry are successful and they're not going to let that happen.
In the end, I would also like to see something user-friendly that doesn’t draw all the creativity and energy from the artists.
Declaration of the parties working in Donbas
The Union – yes, the breakup – no, the opponents of the breakup of the USSR express their opinion in the picture.
Thirty years since the illegal breakup of the USSR.
On December 8, 1991, there was the largest geopolitical disaster in the history of mankind.
On December 8, 1991, Boris Jelcin, Leonid Krav<0xC4><0x8D>uk and Stanislav <0xC5><0xA0>u<0xC5><0xA1>kevi<0xC4><0x8D>, without any legal powers and in violation of the results of the referendum of March 17, 1991, with an open, forgiving position of Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the subject of the international law, as a secret, regardless of the people's rights, signed the
With one pencil cut, they “removed” a huge country with nearly three hundred million inhabitants.
With the disintegration of the USSR, tens of millions of ethnic Russian citizens were abroad.
Since the early 1990s, the population of Russia has declined by ten to eleven million.
Despite the loss of the non-Russian population of the former Soviet republics, we have already lost more people than in two world wars combined!
Even earlier, the same people who in one session in the White Forest destroyed what had been built in the previous seventy years betrayed the socialist camp (created at the cost of millions of lives in World War II and the Great Patriotic War).
They deliberately deindustrialised, braked agriculture, and tore away from the world’s greatest power the fourteen republics that had previously been economically united into a single mechanism.
If we want to look even deeper, then we see the impoverishment of the population, the collapse of the economy, science, the army, the rise of crime, interethnic conflicts, the war in Chechnya, all the conflicts in the post-Soviet space, the series of orange revolutions, the expansion of NATO to the east, the war and the collapse of Yugoslavia – the result of the social war in Yugoslavia, the Arab war.
There is such a term in political science as “vacuum of power”.
Everything that was hurriedly betrayed and surrendered was quickly filled and conquered by the NATO countries that accepted our geopolitical capitulation.
And the whole world is still shaken by the events of the late 1980s and early 1990s.
The price of a product sold in a supermarket with a large turnover may not directly correspond to its quality and quality.
It is Monday and we have some meat in the supermarket, which costs 189 CZK / kg.
I'll buy it by putting it in the fridge and making it a Thursday dinner.
In alternative reality, in which I will not buy the meat on Monday, on Tuesday the chain will discount it to 99 CZK / kg - describe the mechanism by which the change in the price of the meat will become a burden for my digestive system?
Or I will wait until Thursday and that meat will be discounted to 69 CZK / kg 1 day before the date of consumption - how would this meat be different from what I bought on Monday about 120 CZK in a draw and left it 3 days in my fridge?
I'll answer to myself - nothing.
These bullshit about if something is cheap, then it must be guaranteed bad, corrupt or of poor quality are terribly retarded, to tell you the truth ;-)
I recently went to Hlaves in Brno and in the driveway the ladies were distributing some brochure, I always take things like this to help the brigadiers, they can't throw it away...
Well, the brochure was full of peasant reason and conservative views on the functioning of the world, but nowhere about God, I was confused, but I thought it would be some kind of agitation.
After reading, I found out who was publishing it, and Scientology came out of it.
Well, as a good motherfucker, full of completely useless lessons, like I'm supposed to wash and not be a dick.
Too bad the paper didn't have to cut down the forest for this.
I had a similar experience with my ex-girlfriend.
Mental manipulation and emotional blackmail will force you to please that person because you love him without realizing how much in the fucking situation he is.
She threatened to hurt me several times because I went out with a friend she didn't like to talk to.
Or when I wanted to leave her apartment earlier, she cried and begged me not to go anywhere on my knees.
She then began to physically lock the door.
About a year it was a great relationship but then another six months went by and started kicking her on the stick.
Then I ended the relationship with the fact that I told her I was breaking up and lied to her but that we could talk about it next week so that I could calm her down and make sure she didn't catch any trouble again.
Such a person sucks feelings, emotions and overall joy out of you.
Better to keep a distance
When insurance companies are furiously robbing themselves by buying a cloud of tests and rushing for positive ones who wouldn't even know about this terrible disease without a test.
The only thing we achieve is complication for companies, carriers, and others, because their employees in the random number generator fell five days of house arrest.
In the West, they had already stopped this nonsense and recognized that there was no point in dealing with a disease weaker than the famous flu.
Unfortunately, the War is new and has to steal something and drive the ego by inventing buzzing.
I see the good old bastard coming back to us.
After several years of depression and suppression of this unholy business, MLM recruiting is once again back on track.
I was one of the recruits, I tried it (I was 20 years old, a freshman at the university), the initial promises about training products and business skills quickly switched to "it may not interest you, especially get people".
I was genuinely interested in the products I offer because I wanted to help people, but training was more about how to frighten and ukecat.
When the first money made came, one quickly realized that if he wanted to make money, he had to pick up a few certain products a month.
Investment life insurance and mortgages were the only earnings, that is, one felt like a sub-home seller of pots.
But what can I say, the experience was valuable, one has learned not to jump right on every spike and thoroughly check the information.
At the same time, I wouldn't throw them all in one bag.
People in this business are successful and even beneficial to people, but they will certainly not boast of expensive consumables or a "fat" account.
I haven't experienced a lot of things like that in the corporation where I work.
HR is calm, managers are looking out for their management and they don’t mess with us.
Therefore, regular evaluation is happening in some way, in the form that it happens in our country, it goes quite well (set some goals for the next year, in a year we will see what has worked out and what does not) - it is more of a self-assessment than that you would be evaluated by someone according to some numbers, and so on.
Corporate events are also optional.
But we are also a little unique within our company - there are departments that are more "corporate".
Sometimes a person feels like we're such an almost-startup that squats in the offices of a big corporation no.
But it works so don't bother us much as long as the results are there.
The Czech Republic, missing in Britain, is now dead.
Her body was found in London.
For nearly ten days, British police searched unsuccessfully for the missing 32-year-old Czech, who disappeared at the end of November.
On Sunday, 12 December, Foreign Minister Jakub Kulhánek announced on social networks that a woman from Hungary had been found dead.
Unfortunately, the British police confirmed this afternoon to our representative office in London that they have found the body of a missing Czech citizen.
The cause of death is being investigated.
With regard to the family, we will not give more information on the case.
My sincere condolences, Kulhánek said on Twitter.
The young woman was last seen on a bus on her way from work on November 28, when she was supposed to pick up money from an ATM before boarding.
Her disappearance was announced by colleagues at work five days later.
London police began searching for her, and Interpol ranked her among the missing around the world.
It also appeared in the Czech database of missing persons.
Police detained a man a few days ago.
What role he was supposed to play in the case and what he suspected, but did not disclose.
At the end of the year, new councils were appointed in four municipalities.
On Saturday, December 11, new deputies were elected in the villages of Kom<0xC5><0x88>a in Uherskohradishsk, Lu<0xC5><0xBE>ice in Mostek, Nová Ves in Liberec and Rovná in Pelh<0xC5><0x99>imovsk.
The number of representatives in these municipalities has fallen below the statutory number or the elected representative offices have disintegrated.
There were 99 valid candidates in the new elections for 28 terms.
Voter turnout was 62.41%.
The highest interest was recorded in the village of Rovná, where 93.62% of eligible voters voted.
A total of 8 women and 20 men took office.
The average age of elected representatives is 46.7 years.
The oldest is 69 years old, the youngest is 33 years old.
A total of 13 candidate documents were registered for new elections to the local councils in the four municipalities.
There were 36 women and 63 men in the 28 deputy posts.
The average age of the candidates was 46.6 years.
The youngest candidate was 22 years old, the oldest 72 years old.
The processing of the results of Saturday’s elections for us symbolically concludes a rather challenging but successful year.
There were four new or repeated elections to the municipal deputies and, above all, highly watched elections to the Chamber of Deputies.
In most cases, we had to work in more demanding epidemic conditions, which placed greater demands on equipment and personnel security, Eva Krumpová, 1st Vice-President of the Czech Statistical Office, said.
The last polling station was processed on Sunday 12 December at 03:49.
On Monday, the results of the vote will be discussed by the State Electoral Commission and will be published in the Bill after approval.
This is the biggest problem I have with the pandemic.
Coping with the fact that we have a rather dangerous infectious disease here took me a while at the very beginning, but it was possible without any major delays.
To deal with how idiotic a large part of the population in all its strata is, I've had a problem with that so far.
I am most looking forward to getting vaccinated (tomorrow!) because thanks to it I will finally be less dependent on the fact that other people are not cattle.
He would be deprived of the office of president and of the right to re-acquire it.
The odds are that this will happen, but as others here mention very little.
In addition, I'm not sure if the archived file could even be considered a treason.
The Velezrada is an act by which the President of the Republic threatens the sovereignty, territorial integrity, or democratic character of the state.
It must have been something more serious.
How the pandemic has affected intimate life: The number of people under 35 who are without sex throughout the year is growing
More and more young adults in the United States are living their lives without sex.
These are mostly religiously based people, according to the DailyMail website.
The survey showed that from 2008 to 2021, the proportion of people under 35 who give up their sex lives rose from eight to 21 percent.
Women between the ages of 18 and 35 who reported not having sex in the last year are more than ever before.
Other factors contribute to the decline in the number of sexually active individuals, a survey by the Institute for Family Studies (IFS) showed.
One of them could be the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic and higher unemployment rates.
But the presence of media, social networks or video games, which make sex less and less a priority for young people, could also contribute.
“Since 2010, the proportion of men and women between the ages of 18 and 35 who reported not having sex in the previous year has been growing rapidly,” said IFS researcher Lyman Stone.
Sexual activity is more prevalent among people in marriage, with only 5% of them saying they have had no sex in the past year.
In the case of single people, it was 29%. Stone added that marriages under the age of 35 are only a small percentage.
Fear of premarital intercourse and religious foundation also contribute to the loss of sexual activity.
Although husbands are more likely to be sexually active, the percentage of married people under the age of 35 is still declining.
Young people are divided about premarital sex, about 30% think it is a bad thing, while about 70% think it is okay.
“It’s true that free individuals in this age group are a minority, but their behavior is shifting this trend,” Stone says of these thirty percent.
For most of those who have a moral problem with premarital affairs, the reason is religious foundation.
Since 2008, for single people under the age of 35 who attend religious meetings more than once a month, the abstinence rate has increased from 20% to almost 60%.
Among the "less-faithful" the trend has risen from 10 percent to 20 percent," Stone said.
Other factors also contribute to the decline in sexual activity, such as less social interaction and especially social drinking during the pandemic.
The study also showed that sex is less likely in people without a job or with lower incomes.
Another reason may be the expansion of digital media, which seems to reduce the need for sex.
People spend more time online, replacing this need.
This trend is mainly behind the lockdown at the time of the coronavirus pandemic.
The whole ordinance of COVID vaccination is about whether society should force some of the population to behave that they don’t want, but that can save their lives.
This is a rather difficult question, which I personally am most interested in the question of social conscience.
That is, for example, the question of whether if we do not order them and they die, it will be our fault.
My argument is that for the death of an eighty-year-old man who didn’t really know much, we didn’t explain it to him well, he heard some misinformation, and as a result he didn’t get vaccinated and eventually caught it and died.
On the other hand, I do not think that we can blame the death of a staunch opponent of vaccination, who is doing something on the side of the SPD and the CCP about bullying and a totalitarian state.
From the statistics I have mentioned, it is quite clear that the majority of unvaccinated pensioners probably belong to the second group, so they will really be able to do it themselves.
Czech Republic without snow.
How does a mild winter sign up to combat drought?
The winter so far in the Czech Republic has brought one of the smallest snowfalls in recent times.
The operators of the ski resorts will not do without technical snow, the weather complicates the preparation of the cross-country skiing Jizera Fifty.
Is it a trend or an exception?
And what will little snow mean for the fight against drought in the Czech Republic?
I'd have a story, but it's not about a pancake maker.
One day in high school, a teacher took us across the city to the yard to take a boat ride along the river.
On the way there we walked one such a wide street and who we probably do not see in the middle - followers of the Hare K<0xE1><0xB9><0x9B><0xE1><0xB9><0xA3><0xE1><0xB9><0x87>a sect.
Of course, they've come down on us.
Fortunately, I ran away, but a friend of mine had a conversation.
When she left them, we asked her and the teacher what she said to them.
"They asked me if I wanted to save my soul.
I told them I had no soul," she replied.
All of us, including the teacher, laughed all the way to the yard.
We're terribly spoiled.
Not so much is happening, but the system is already collapsing, says Orozovich
The new German Chancellor Olaf Scholz arrived in Warsaw on Sunday after previous visits to Paris and Brussels, where he was greeted with military honors by Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki.
“We are opening a new chapter of mutual relations,” Morawiecki said at a joint press conference after the talks.
Scholz stressed that Europe must show together that it will not accept the violation of the territorial integrity of Ukraine.
According to the chancellor, the crisis caused by the disturbing movements of Russian troops at the Ukrainian border is to be addressed by Western diplomatic talks, including within the “Norman Group”, which unites France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine.
Morawiecki said he had informed the chancellor about the situation on the Polish border with Belarus, whose leader Alexander Lukashenko artificially triggered a migration crisis and used people as live targets and weapons, because night after night we see hundreds of attempts to cross the border.
He negotiated further sanctions with the chancellor so that Lukashenko’s regime and his patrons in the Kremlin finally understand that we are determined to defend the EU’s eastern border.
Scholz assured that Warsaw enjoyed German support in the dispute with Belarus, and condemned the inhuman treatment of the Lukashenko regime with refugees.
A drunken Polish nun blamed the accident, tried to conceal it
After a while the car returned to the scene of the accident, but the car was driven by another nun who was trying to take the blame.
When police told her that she could still lose her driver's license for not giving priority to driving and getting caught at the scene of the accident, she came out with the truth, TVN24 said.
She admitted that another nun ran into the vehicle and asked her for help.
Then the police came for Sister Celestina.
She underwent a breath test and, after finding that she had more than two milliliters in her blood, they immediately removed her driver's license.
At the same time, she was informed that she would confess her actions to the court.
Hugo's dog does what he can.
Juraj <0xC5><0xA0>ajmovi<0xC4><0x8D> did not watch his film.
Czech family comedy creators have looked into American stories about dog pets.
But they forgot the essential thing: the legality of the film industry.
After the kitten movie F. Brabce Gump - a dog that taught people to live, there is now another film about the emotion of the audience in the cinemas.
The co-author of the script and the director in one person Juraj <0xC5><0xA0>ajmovi<0xC4><0x8D> Jr. freely follows his previous film Here I watch from 2012.
Hugo, a talking squirrel, returns to the scene, along with some well-known characters around him.
Julie and Ivan, the owners of the <0xC5><0xA0>umava boarding house, who is dying, and so begin to invite the dog owners, Julia's father with her partner and especially her daughter Veronika.
She is no longer a little girl, but a teenage girl experiencing her first love.
The director and his partner Beatriz <0xC5><0xA0>ajmovi<0xC4><0x8D>ová (who is also the producer of the film) had to deal with the narration procedures already in the previous dog film, but there were at least children and a dog.
This time, the creative couple wrote an even weaker scenario, which evokes a mixture of amazement and embarrassment.
Let's summarize it.
Julie, though a scientist, is subject to the desire for a child to be taken away from the procession of darkness, and if the right “constellation” comes, she can copulate with her forest engineer Ivan, wherever the coordinates determine – on the hood of the car or the church tower (of course, during the current excursion, she can go to the forest with a local guide), she can copulate with her own.
Nothing against the purifying treatment of nature and the power of pets.
Their owners know why they have them.
The spectator is surprised, however, at how much content plume full of unreliable situations and figures was needed for this message.
A pair of staff thieves, a dog contest, a Schumacher charlatan, police officers arriving in search of “drugs” and discussing the herbs about the fertilizing power of bone meal – and which a roasted family in a boarding house will of course drink.
When the heroine wakes up after a severe coma and then sits on the table with a cigarette and demands her father's whiskey and whiskey as a cured vegetarian, she can't help but laugh.
On top of that, the creators will explain to the audience that “this sometimes happens after a coma”.
<0xC5><0xA0>ajmovi<0xC4><0x8D>’s team lacks basic dramaturgical knowledge of working with the text, the ability to construct bearable situations, a feeling for the characters of the characters and the point and the direction.
The acting performance is uneven, the cut is helpless and the overall impression is inflamed.
As much as Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Vaculík, Jitka Je<0xC5><0xBE>ková or Nela Boudová try to stand up for their party, they don’t have much to play.
The only remnant of the film remains poetic footage of the <0xC5><0xA0>umava nature cameraman Vladimir Holomka and a pair of jezev<0xC4><0x8D>íks.
It is not enough to draw a few characters, a chattering plot and dog statements, let alone more popular vulgar expressions by which the characters commit.
The argument is not even a year-long membership in the Squirrel Breeders Club - as in the case of Mrs. Producer.
Behind the good intentions to promote nature and the friendship of a man with a dog must also be the knowledge of the craft, if a man wants to tell a credible story.
This did not happen in this case.
For a good family picture, there is a little too much eroticism and a minimal sense of genre.
Even as a canis therapy commercial, this amateur-conceived piece wouldn't go through.
Yes, respect, because they have to listen to constant insults from fools like you.
There's a difference between offering and coercion, here's how you understand shit, but that's just because you've never tried it.
The decision is always up to the customer, if he does not want to, the answer will always be no.
If you listened to those guys all the time, maybe you'd change your mind.
It is a job like any other, in this case, a brigade for profit.
The Middle East suffers from unusually dry months.
Winter is the only time of the year when it rains.
"Almost the complete absence of precipitation during November, as we have seen at some stations, is unusual," the Israeli Meteorological Service said in a statement.
For example, the village of Kfar Giladi in northern Israel reports only six percent of the long-term precipitation average for November.
The two-day rain this week was an exception.
It's good for us.
It hasn't rained in a long time.
It is also the right Christmas backdrop, rejoiced the inhabitants of Nazareth Wasim Askar.
Precipitations in Israel come almost exclusively in the winter months, are shocking and irregular.
Forests depend on winter rains.
Without them, they dry out and are prone to fire.
It is not only about forests, but also about supplies of drinking water and irrigation for farmers.
Israel’s largest freshwater spring, Lake Galilee, has been flooded this spring by the last three rainy winters.
Since then, the level has been decreasing.
Water managers have been warning of drought for a long time.
“It can be expected that, depending on global warming and climate change, rainfall here may decrease,” Uri Schor, a spokeswoman for the Israeli Water Authority, predicted in 2018.
Israel can use technologies such as salting or recycling wastewater.
Economically weak countries such as Lebanon, Syria and Jordan are worse off.
In the streets of the capital of Jordan, Amman, there is an increase in tanker cars.
Water pipes and private wells are drying out.
"This year, my orders have risen by seventy to eighty percent compared to the previous two years," said Imád Suleiman, a tanker driver.
In Isfahan, Iran, clashes have erupted between farmers and security forces.
The reason for the protests was drought.
The local river basin was completely devoid of water.
The region has the driest November in many years.
Israel prepares military intervention against Iran
The Israeli defense minister said the talks in Vienna had brought “no progress” and had informed Washington of preparations for an attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities.
Minister Benny Gantz said on Saturday he had ordered the Israeli army to prepare for a military strike against Iran, Jonathan Lis reported.
Gantz, who resides in the United States, is trying to persuade Americans to step up their pressure on Iran, but he also informed Washington of military preparations.
During a press conference in Florida, Gantz said the Vienna nuclear talks had brought “no progress” and world powers “understand that the Iranians are playing with them.”
This happened to me about three years ago.
I liked Miss a little bit and grilled during the interview to find out what she really wanted from me.
Eventually, I found that my suspicion of the pyramid was justified.
Because I really don't like these scams, I've been pushing the lady for a while with doubts and questions, and finally thanked her and left.
Please tell me I'm a jackass, but the pyramid is a pyramid and the financial advisors are the financial advisors.
The skiers went to the mountains on the weekend, there was enough snow and nice weather
Mountain resorts in the Czech Republic experienced the first major effort of skiers this weekend.
After extensive snowfall at the end of the working week, there is no need for snow and some ski resorts have started operations.
She did not dissuade the riders from the obligation to prove themselves with a Covid certificate in lifts.
While lifts do not complain about the lack of interest of customers, some ski equipment rental companies report a weaker demand for their services than before the epidemic.
Thousands of people took to the runways and slopes in the Liberec region over the weekend.
The skiers wished the weather, which offered the sun and excellent snow conditions today.
“We are pleased, the opening weekend has really started since the Friday evening skiing, when we had the first skiers on the hill,” said Jakub Hanu<0xC5><0xA1>, director of the Je<0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC4><0x9B>d Sports Complex.
Hundreds of people also went to Jeseníky for the first weekend skiing in the new season.
For example, Ski Arena Karlov or a resort in Branné na <0xC5><0xA0>umpersk were opened.
The weekend visit was very decent, an estimated 400 people came on Saturday and today.
The conditions are supreme.
Today the sun was shining, it was around minus three degrees, so perfect, did not spare the praise of the representative of the ski resort in Branna Rostislav Procházka.
Ski resort operators can only sell ski pass to people who are vaccinated or are in the period after passing the Covid-19 disease.
Except for exceptions, people are prepared for this and prove the necessary documents, said René Hrones from the Spindleruv Mlyn ski center.
“We only recorded units of incidents,” he added.
Some ski equipment rentals and stores report a lower interest than before the pandemic.
The interest in ski rental is fortunately.
It is not like in previous years, but there are still enough customers, said Alexandra Boki<0xC5><0xA1>ová from the Opava store Skiopava.
Greater stress is expected during the ski courses period.
David Shintak, CEO of Snowbear, also feels that because of COVID, there is no interest in lending ski equipment as before.
By this time before the pandemic, we had almost been lent out.
Compared to the period before the pandemic, we are about 50 percent, said <0xC4><0x8C>TK <0xC5><0xA0>inták.
According to him, people became lazy with the pandemic and learned to sit at home.
On the contrary, the rental company Novako na Bo<0xC5><0xBE>í Dara is in high demand.
They started to rent skis there a week ago and now they have to book them in advance.
“We are starting to lend runners this weekend, but people have already called ahead, so we expect a lot of interest, just like last year,” said Pavlina Nováková, the operator of the site.
According to her, an interest comparable to the period before the epidemic is also about the ski school.
If we want the successful and the rich not to go abroad, they must have the opportunity to live a quality life like abroad.
This certainly does not include socialist health care, where it is often not possible to get a dentist or a specialist doctor.
There are smart and clever people going abroad who don't have any property here.
The owner of the company is not going abroad.
I totally agree with the rest.
If these people do not live well in the Czech Republic and if these people do not have a vision of a reasonable future in the Czech Republic, they will simply not live in the Czech Republic.
Emigration from Hungary began with Orbán winning one beautiful day, reigning for a year, and suddenly the annual emigration rose by a few tens of thousands.
It is naive to think that the Czech Republic cannot find itself in a similar position from day to day.
The next question is election at all.
If you're going to live a dumb life here, some traditional V4k lunatic can win here too.
Young and educated will leave, his supporters will remain, and people whose possessions cannot be put on the plane.
A terrifying photo!
Langmayer in the blood for a beer bet?
While the autumn was in full swing in the Czech Republic, in Thailand the staff of the film Island led by Ji<0xC5><0x99>í Langmajer (55) enjoyed tropical weather!
The actor posted a bloody photo of his face on social media.
Is it a real injury, or is it a makeup for filming?
Police in London are still searching for the missing Czech woman.
She was last seen on her way home.
"Petra's disappearance is not at all similar to her behavior and we are beginning to be very concerned about her," said Lucy O'Connor of the Lambeth Police Department, where Srnc was working, in a video Saturday.
“Her family in the Czech Republic is also very worried about her and simply wants to know where she is,” she continued.
The missing Czech Republic reportedly left work on Sunday, November 28, at around 7:45 p.m. and headed home to the Camberwell district.
She was last seen on the bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported on December 3 by one of her colleagues.
According to the British media, she served as a nurse's assistant at the Evelina London Children's Hospital, which belongs to the Guy's and St Thomas Hospital Association.
"We are extremely concerned about our dear colleague Peter, who is missing," the health care group said in a tweet.
"We would like to encourage anyone who might have any information that could help her find it to contact the police," the statement continued.
The public is also invited to cooperate with MEP Harriet Harman, who on Saturday alerted to the case of Srnkova at a press conference.
"She's been missing for days, she's only 32 years old, she's from the Czech Republic, her parents are obviously worried to death," the Labour politician said, holding a photo of the woman distributed by the London police.
"I feel that we all have a particularly great responsibility to try to find her because she was outside her home country, away from her family and working here for our health care," she said.
Police have arrested a man who remains in custody in connection with the case.
However, according to the BBC, police have not provided any information about his identity or what the man is suspected of.
Russia is not able to occupy Ukraine, and certainly not with 30 BTG (i.e. about 5 divisions).
I don't underestimate Ukraine like that either.
These are not "huge amounts", but about 8 percent of the Russian army.
Note that Ukraine keeps repeating that we are exaggerating the threat of invasion and is starting to have our entrance full of teeth.
I quoted above.
I don't know why you thought Russia wanted war.
The war is a damn expensive joke and Russia has Italy's GDP.
Compared to the situation in the year 38 is out in so many points that I don’t even know where to start.
I can now compare it to the First Punic War and the "annexation" of Sicily :D
I can imagine that after Ukraine announced that it would not comply with the Minsk agreements, Russia is annexing those ridiculous republics.
That's all, and that's what the "concentration" at the borders would be like.
I'm a sergeant...
New timetables apply in Prague from Sunday, mainly affecting suburban connections
Passengers in Prague’s Integrated Transport (PID) have been awaiting several changes since Sunday, which mainly concern suburban connections.
New lines were created, some changed the route, and others, on the contrary, disappeared.
Mladoboleslavsko is newly involved in the integrated system.
In the capital from Sunday they stop rapids from <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice at the station Garden City.
In suburban train transport, trains S7 depart, which on the route from Beroun to <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xBD> Brod pass Prague main station.
At the recently operational Prague-Zahradní M<0xC4><0x9B>sto station, the R17 highway from <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice and Bene<0xC5><0xA1>ova will be stopped again.
The PID will be extended to other areas.
Among other things, there are buses to Sv<0xC4><0x9B>tlé nad Sázavou, Blatna u Jesenice, Star<0xC3><0xBD> Splav<0xC5><0xAF> and Turnov.
Buses in Mladoboleslavsk will be included, including lines crossing into Liberec and Královéhradeck<0xC3><0xBD> kraj.
With the integration, 77 lines will be cancelled, 37 new ones will be introduced and 12 operating lines will be adjusted.
A new bus line 405 will depart from Prague Zlicín, which will go all the way to <0xC5><0xBD>atce.
There is also a new direct connection between Prague and Kralovice near Rakovník, which replaces the cancelled S53 train line.
They will be strengthened in the morning and at the weekend connections from Prague to Rakovník, when the express line number 404 will be released.
New lines 400 and 410 to the Liberec Region are included in the PID system.
They leave from St<0xC5><0x99>í<0xC5><0xBE>kov metro station, not from Hole<0xC5><0xA1>ovice station.
Line 400 goes through M<0xC4><0x9B>lník, Dubá and Czech Lipa to Nov<0xC3><0xBD> Bor and the selected connections continue to Rumburk or Cvikov.
Supplementary line 410 passes through M<0xC4><0x9B>lník and Dubá to Doks, Mimona and Jablonné in Podje<0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC4><0x9B>dí.
On the contrary, the new operation is cancelled or limited on ten Central Bohemian local routes, among others to Mochov, Dob<0xC5><0x99>í<0xC5><0xA1> or Ro<0xC5><0xBE>mitál pod T<0xC5><0x99>em<0xC5><0xA1>ín.
All trains departing from Prague at 02:30 are cancelled.
Due to the modernization of the railway, long-term restrictions on the lines Prague – Beroun, Prague – Lysá nad Labem and the surrounding area of Kolín continue.
Changes are also awaiting passengers in other locations.
Buses replace some cancelled railway lines or extend the section on line 420 from Dob<0xC5><0x99>í<0xC5><0xA1>e with follow-up from Prague, where it is possible to use PID tickets to Milevska.
The routes of lines 540 to 543 in Nymburk have changed and the routes of some buses on the border of central Bohemia and Ho<0xC5><0x99>ovi<0xC4><0x8D>ka in the Pilsen region have been adjusted.
Healthy snack/lunch in the office from the supermarket
Hi, I do a classic 9-5 with a 30min break and my only option where to get food is to go next to Billy or a bit further to Lidl.
Since I have no movement, I do not have the strength to exercise after work, so I need to eat as healthy and diet as possible.
Unfortunately, I never know what to buy and in a hurry I will buy maximum pizza ground and snack yogurt and apple.
Q: What healthy without the need for heat treatment would you recommend me to buy in the supermarket?
Not everyone is waiting for a meter of snow like you, so unfortunately it is.
And it's not about the trees that you need to see.
Only the tip of a tree can hide under the snow.
If destroyed, the tree may be more susceptible to fungal disease.
I'm not saying that's the only reason we're not allowed off-piste, but it's one of them.
Confessions of a Gift on a Relationship with Nedv<0xC4><0x9B>d: This I Didn't Look For At All
Since Friday, the Czech show business pond has lived on nothing but revealing the relationship between Dara Rolins and Pavel Nedv<0xC4><0x9B>d.
They've been pulling it together for years, the famous footballer even got divorced because of the singer.
Dara has now sent a comprehensive message to the fans explaining why she has been hiding her love for six months.
“I can say that there is currently no one in the Czech Republic or Slovakia who would have escaped that Dara caught a bear, i.e. pardon, Nedv<0xC4><0x9B>da,” jokes Dara Rolins, who is in love with the most successful Czech footballer right up to her ears.
But he said he packed it, not the other way around.
Three days are the center of attention, and although they are accustomed to the public interest, they do not enjoy it.
And here it is.
What we both didn’t look forward to, but we knew it would happen one day, the singer continues.
I just don't know who's worse.
Whether those who are not interested in it at all and it jumps on them and canned food, or we, whose lives are being questioned in detail.
As if one of you would like to hear an opinion about whether you and your spouse or girlfriend fit well enough, or if you insisted that everyone really know the list of your former partners in detail and be familiar with the list of your mistakes and mistakes.
That's what you want, it's what you want, it's what you want, it's what you want, it's what you want.
The couple got together in Italy, where Rolins was going to prepare their new fashion collection.
Nedv<0xC4><0x9B>d has long served as the vice president of Juventus football club.
They went out with the truth until now, because they were waiting for the completion of the divorce of the Widow.
They had been separated from their wife Ivana for three years, but not on paper for only three weeks.
In any case, to those who rejoice with us and wish us to do so, we thank you.
We are just people, we have families, children, the past and dreams.
We're not perfect, but I think we both have hearts in the right place.
That’s why I love my new husband and, like him, I stand by him, for better or for worse.
Hello, the other commentators have probably said all the essentials, I just confirm that the colleges are great at the beginning, my classmates mostly met during the first semester or two and scammed and then found sub-rents together, which seems to me the best option, because you know who you will live with.
The apartments usually don't advertise very long in advance, so you probably won't find much now, but looking at the offer certainly won't hurt.
Otherwise, you should definitely avoid not only Ceylon, but also the surroundings (streets like Vranovská, French, etc., this is quite a bad address), and some parts of the Jewish community are a bit of a ghetto.
On the other hand, Veve<0xC5><0x99>í district is a lot of student, Královo field and that direction is fine, besides it is close to most faculties of VUT (I don't know where exactly you are going).
I have never been looking for a rental, but I am a native of Brno, so I can possibly consult with Brno as such, if you still lack some information :)
This is an example of “normal” thinking.
Because of what a few doctors have decided to do somewhere in Poland, it’s actually quite okay that the state doesn’t fund some schools enough.
Either they learn what they want and pay for it on their own or they go by the state and pay the state.
After all, we cannot let a private actor control a piece of education just because a full state contribution will be paid a couple of crowns and, thanks to this, he will be able to learn what he wants in schools.
Such a claim loses some weight when it is written by a man who two days earlier had said this about a petition for a boycott of a totalitarian state:
So the vote against having an abortion is the same for you as the vote against having a statue standing in the square?
If I were you, I'd consult directly with the person who gave you the job.
Otherwise, I have already experienced in cataloging/digitalization that (and this for many years professionals) it either somehow throws off the eye, or they write something in the way of xxx *** or ... (according to the convention) and in the note that it is illegible.
The truth is that in this case it is quite readable, so I probably wouldn’t recommend it at all.
Personally, I would probably deal with it somehow in a note depending on what program you are using.
If you want to be a decent and hardworking student, you can look into some character databases and search for the nearest one.
But since it looks like you're drawing from a book, I'd guess the author or printer just created their own character that fits into what's physically on that coin.
P.S. Isn’t it more of a Kingdom of Odry than a Kingdom of Odry?
P.S. Someone has already made this up to you.
Look at that comment with <0xD0><0xA4><0xD0><0x98><0xD0><0x9B>H
Politicians have no idea what the "theme" of our Presidency will be.
That's a much worse problem than having interpreters with them.
The idea that they would approve of something because no one understood a text is ridiculous.
All important approved documents are examined word for word, but some basic knowledge of English is not enough, it is a matter of lawyers.
Hundreds of translators and interpreters work in various EU institutions, English is more suited to politicians for informal contacts, establishing extra-standard relations.
In addition, with the English it is quite interesting, after the GB withdrawal from the EU.
I don't understand the hatred of Cel.
I've been working there for the third year and I'm fine.
How many times do I drive from work even at 10 in the evening and never have any problem.
That it is a ghetto can only be said by someone who hardly ever entered it in his life.
Yes, the majority of the Roma population in Brno live there, but the only thing they do is to obstruct on the sidewalk and park where they do not have :D It is definitely not that I would be afraid to climb the street in the evening.
So if you're looking for relatively cheap housing with good accessibility to the center, then I'd go for it.
A lot of apartments are now newly renovated or newly built.
Felix Slova<0xC4><0x8D>ek (78) without Dáda and his mistress Gelemová as a pole in the fence!
Who will he spend Christmas with?
On Sunday, most people lit their first candle on the Advent wreath, not Felix Slova<0xC4><0x8D>ek.
I don't have an Advent wreath, so there was nothing to light.
“I saw Grandma’s wreath, and Lucie must have one,” said the saxophonist, who had so confirmed Patras’s words that he often visited her.
He visits, but does not live in their house in Vinohrady, where Dáda was left alone after his departure.
Slovak still does not know where he will be on Christmas Eve.
We recently met with Ani<0xC4><0x8D>ka, Felix and both grandchildren.
VIDEO: Felix Slova<0xC4><0x8D>ek and Lucie Gelemová: Again together!
Felix Slova<0xC4><0x8D>ek and Lucie Gelem: AGAIN!
But we were still talking, so it didn't happen at Christmas.
I really don't know where I'll be.
I buy gifts all the time and I'm sure I'll buy something for Grandpa and Lucia, maybe perfume.
“I’m a gentleman,” added Felix, who himself came to baptize the music video for the Richman Club.
I'm alone here, but I don't feel alone.
I always find someone with whom I like to have fun, says Slovak, who was happy to meet the wife Ludika Sobota Adriana or the singer Kamila N<0xC3><0xBD>vltova.
And he made it clear.
And we are Iceland so we can afford not to have soldiers and weapons?
I doubt that anyone will defend us, and our location is so strategic that the aggressor would have to be an absolute idiot to not occupy this territory.
And I don't understand why this should be a bad argument, can you explain that to me?
I don't know of any other component that could be deployed in hospitals in a crisis.
There are few police officers and they can’t afford it, just as firefighters and nowhere else is such a high percentage of people trained in health care at such a level.
And the fact that our army is able to defend Ostrava goes to the head of the previous governments, not the army, which has been asking for new toys for a long time.
Record-breaking drought in the Czech Republic.
It is necessary to change agricultural subsidies, the country should not be just a food factory, says the journalist.
The Czech Republic is experiencing its worst drought in years.
According to scientists, water has fallen in mountainous and sub-mountain areas, with a smaller amount of precipitation recorded even in places where there has not been a need for moisture.
The cause of drought in much of Central Europe is climate change.
But the impact is also amplified by the way we manage the land.
What to prepare for in the context of drought?
And how can we help nature in difficult times?
Yes, it will be, I can barely stay in the ice skating, mushrooms I know what it is to play hockey and the tactics (which I tried in Franchise Hockey Manager) is also a hallucination.
And whether you are a hockey team "Bear Russia" or "Lama China" so lose two goals even if you do not have to win the match at all costs is different than when it is compared.
But just as I listen to Czech commentators who say what the referees do not notice, whether it is male or female hockey, it's weird, but that's probably the case with all the sport, UEFA and "Italian actors" or motorsport F1, WRC, etc.
Controversy is everywhere.
And imho, if it were the other way around, it would be as it always has been, and that the Czech Republic and Russia have already lost more often than they have won, it would probably be the classic "they lost" vs "We have won".
Coronavirus: The number of infections in Russia has exceeded 10 million
On Saturday, December 11, the Czech Republic recorded 9,080 daily infections.
5,766 people were hospitalized.
A total of 34,451 people died in the Czech Republic, another 74.
Confirmed cases in the last 14 days in the Czech Republic in 1967 are 100,000, 871 per 100,000 in the last week.
The number of diseases in Russia on Sunday exceeded 10 million.
In the last 24 hours, 29,929 new diseases have been registered.
It is the lowest daily count since October 13.
The total number of registered diseases in Russia is 10 016 896.
The daily death toll is 1,132, the lowest daily death toll since the end of October.
Britain is facing an "inevitable" wave of major illnesses caused by Omicron, Dr Susan Hopkins, the UK's chief medical adviser, said on Sunday on television.
New quarantine measures will be needed.
Omicron-infected people are already hospitalised in the UK, and Hopkins expects their numbers to increase.
No one has died of omicron yet, but hospitalizations occur about fourteen days after the disease and deaths about three weeks after the disease.
British Labour chief Keir Starmer said on Sunday that Boris Johnson apparently broke the law by holding a Christmas quiz in Downing Street last December, when a lockdown was introduced and Christmas parties were banned.
A minister in Johnson’s government argued that the quiz took place “virtually,” via a computer.
However, it was attended by a group of employees gathered around the computers on Downing Street.
In the UK, pressure is on Johnson to be removed from office.
During last December, when a strict lockdown was introduced in London and Christmas parties were banned, Johnson’s ministers organized numerous celebrations despite the lockdown.
The British public and the media are angry that Johnson and his government made fun of them:
Paul Brand, editor of commercial ITV for Britain: Today, two years ago, Boris Johnson won the overwhelming majority in the general election.
This morning, the Conservative Party is talking about the need to remove him from the post of Prime Minister.
It is remarkable how quickly the events unfolded.
Do you want to turn around and save your skin?
Hungary is set to hold elections in the spring that could end the 12-year rule of Viktor Orbán.
It will be a European-wide election.
How can we expect them to be fair?
They won't be fair.
They probably won’t be free either, because that wasn’t even the last two elections under Orbán.
His Fidesz party controls the media, changes the borders of the electoral districts to profit from it, and does other smaller or bigger tricks.
So far, the last one sounds so that in practice everyone can vote wherever they want.
This will allow Fidesz to tie voters from determined districts to those where the result is uncertain and the opposition could succeed.
So I just repeat, they're not going to be fair at all.
Do you think it will be as unfair as it was in 2014 and 2018?
After all, the situation is very different.
Previously, it was not about whether Fidesz would win, but how much and whether it would have a constitutional majority.
There is now a real chance that the united opposition will get more votes and mandates.
That's a big habit for Viktor Orbán and his party.
Won't they try to keep the power playing even harder?
Yes, we have some clues that they are ready to go beyond what they have been doing so far.
Recently, a footage by the president of the parliament and one of the leaders of Fidesz László Kövér, where he explains to the heads of the secret services that the opposition is a threat to national security, escaped the independent media.
Are these the signs of a new approach you're talking about?
Yeah, that's one of those news stories.
It all starts with the language.
I have been beaten quite often, the last time at 14, my mom’s parents don’t have much patience, I don’t either, my dad has her for a long time, but then she blows extremely (only in connection with me).
At the same time, I was very choleric and I was angry as a little girl terribly, to the extent that I lay on the ground in a convulsion and was all blue, about 2 times they took me in the shower to calm down.
Sometimes I was stabbed in the classroom, sometimes it was more like they didn't know anymore.
I definitely have a tendency to deal with things violently now, as a little girl I was quite washed, now I am at least hitting something and as a young person I need to cry my parents over my hand (so I don't get too much over stress), so never anything extreme, but I always have the urge.
I can't say to what extent it's my explosiveness, but I'm sure that education has a part to play in that.
I'm afraid I'm going to lose patience with all the kids and deal with it the same.
I think beating children is just wrong and that my parents shouldn't have done it, especially not when it wasn't "educational" anymore, but out of frustration, on the other hand, maybe every parent just screws up, maybe it's not possible to at least a little bit to suck their children up, so don't let them do that.
I don’t understand why he should be ashamed of something.
The laws must be clear and unambiguous.
I would therefore call Kundami those who make laws in such quality.
Otherwise, I wonder if you're not afraid of a cut in income?
Can you really count on people wanting and buying the product and you will have what mortgage to pay for?

Where will Slovakia move the trial of the murder of journalist Kuciak?
In Slovakia, the main trial begins with the four accused in the murders of Ján Kuciak and Martina Ku<0xC5><0xA1>nírová.
The death of the investigative reporter and his partner changed Slovakia.
She moved civil society, but she also revealed the practices of the accused entrepreneur Marián Ko<0xC4><0x8D>ner and his connection to the top of Slovak politics and justice.
How important is the process going to be for Slovakia?
Journalists can be hugely responsible for this.
How is it possible that this petition had much more media attention than the counter-petition of the dean of all medical schools, which was published a day or two later?
No, they've been let down, and the company's bouncing back.

Another government ends and the law on the involvement of municipalities in the selection of storage places nowhere
Minister Karl Havlí<0xC4><0x8D>ek’s proposal needs to be fundamentally revised
The government of Prime Minister Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1> is at an end and there is still no law to ensure that the interests of municipalities and their citizens are respected when selecting and permitting deep storage of highly radioactive waste.
The Legislative Council of the government interrupted the debate on a proposal submitted to the government by the Ministry of Industry and Trade after years of questioning.
Its content, however, is in serious contradiction not only with the affected municipalities united in the Platform against deep storage, but also with the Union of Cities and Municipalities of the Czech Republic.
Self-governments expect from the law a more significant strengthening of their capabilities in deciding on the storage facility, which has been promised to the mayors since 2011, when the first work on this legislation began and which is required by the Czech nuclear law and the European directive.
We expect the new government, in accordance with its coalition treaty, to revise the proposal in cooperation with the municipalities.
The proposed law from Minister Karl Havlí<0xC4><0x8D>ek, which has the Platform at its disposal, blames the municipalities in particular: The proposed level of involvement of municipalities and the public in the process of deciding on the location for the storage is insufficient and cannot ensure respect for the interests of municipalities and their citizens.
It can only be truly effective if municipalities or the public can influence whether the process will continue at all in a given location.
This can be ensured by imposing the obligation of the Warehouse Administration to obtain the consent of the municipalities concerned before the start of a specific procedure.
The proposed substantive proposal almost completely ignores public involvement and makes citizens of municipalities virtually mere statisticians in licensing procedures.
The proposal lacks a system setting of compensation for the municipalities for the entire process of searching and selecting the site for the storage, its authorization and operation.
The representatives of the municipalities do not really have much opportunity, according to today's legal norms, to defend the interests of their citizens in finding a place for storage.
Only in certain authorisation procedures may they submit their comments or appeal, but the decision shall be taken by the Office or by the Minister in whose interest the authorisation is to be granted.
The possible action shall not have a deferral effect on the performance of exploratory or construction works.
Co-decision of the self-government, as requested by the Platform, is a principle commonly used in many democratically developed countries, and certainly then in those where they have already made progress in authorizing storage, such as in Sweden or Finland.
The drafting of the law is, moreover, another failure of the state administration, which hires external law offices to prepare the legislation.
In this case, it is a contract with the law firm HAVEL & PARTNERS s.r.o., which was concluded by S<0xC3><0x9A>RAO and following contracts with lawyer Jan Zemánek.
According to the contract register, the total amount for these works is almost 4 million crowns.
Antonín Sekni<0xC4><0x8D>ka, deputy mayor of Cejle from Hrádek and a spokesman for the Platform against Deep Storage, said: “After the ministers of industry, who aligned the position of local authorities towards state authorities in the search for a deep storage of highly radioactive waste, they only pushed the new debris out of their successors.
We also offer a helping hand.
We also thank the Union of Towns and Municipalities for their support, which perceives the issue of insufficient rights of municipalities in such a fundamental construction in a similar way as directly affected municipalities in selected locations.
The Anti-Depth Warehousing Platform brings together 51 members (35 municipalities and cities and 16 associations) to enforce a change in the state’s approach to the management of spent nuclear fuel and other radioactive waste, which will not be limited to deep-sea warehousing.
The platform further enforces that the decision to select a location for possible storage is conditional on the prior consent of the municipalities concerned.
Actor John Goodman (69) caused fear of losing weight: He dropped 90 kg.
Although he had not needed to change anything about his lifestyle for many years, in the end, he was frightened by doctors.
They told him that if he didn't lose, he would die.
And it worked.
Goodman gradually lost 90 kilograms, half his original weight of 180 kilograms, reports The Sun.
He made his debut in Los Angeles at the premiere of the animated series The Freak Brothers.
The fat man from the sitcom Roseanne is a completely different person!
John liked to joke that his friends and family begged him to lose weight because his large body caused the furniture to crack.
“I put it all in my mouth,” the actor said in a 2018 interview with AARP.
This time I wanted to do it slowly.
Moving, exercising.
“I’m getting to an age where I can’t afford to sit still,” Goodman told ABC, whose transformation is amazing.
It also depends on what kind of boss you want to use the word "boss" in.
If it’s some text on the platform that expects readers from the gaming environment, I wouldn’t translate it at all.
If it were a formal text, and perhaps a university text, I would probably look for a way to describe or explain the boss.
There are different types of bosses for everything.
For example, a game like Dark Souls etc. has several bosses that do, so the "boss" is something like a master / ruler of a given level, and then there is the final boss...
In many games, there are hidden bosses (super boss, hidden boss) who do not need to beat at all to complete the game or level, but they are often even stronger than the standard boss.
Then there are games like Half-Life, where the bosses are, but the player does not directly touch them (Tentacle, Gargantua), and can they be called at all?
And then there are the mini bosses.
It is a one-word translation of the boss, but it is probably not possible to translate it in Czech or other languages (interesting is Catalan, which translates bosse as the final opponent).
It is generally significant for the story or game, computer-controlled, opponent stronger than all previous and guarding the completion of some level or task.
The whole world is searching for the missing Peter of London.
The Czech police were also involved.
The British police have been searching for the missing Peter Srnkova since December 3.
The Czech police were also involved in the search.
The 32-year-old woman from Uherskohradishts'ka has been looking for since December 7.
At the same time, Interpol is helping the British police.
Petra Srncova was last seen by her colleagues on November 28.
British police have been looking for her since December 3.
Interpol issued a so-called yellow circular for her.
The whole world is looking for Peter.
"The Czech police are working closely with the British police," police spokeswoman Kate<0xC5><0x99>ina Rendlová said.
"We share information on the case together," she added.
The alleged search for Peter has already appeared on the police website.
According to him, she is 168 centimeters tall, thin and has brown eyes and long straight hair of the same color.
It should come from Hungary-Hungary.
Petra worked as a nurse at one of the London hospitals.
Friends and colleagues are worried about her, such disappearance is very unusual for her
Harriet Harman, a member of parliament, was also involved in the search for Peter.
She was involved in hanging out leaflets with Petra's face.
“We are very worried about her,” she said at a press conference on Saturday.
In connection with the disappearance, British police have already detained one suspect.
It is unclear who he was and what he had to do with Peter.
Pre-Christmas Czech Republic terrorizes Tesla agent.
While the data in October showed a slight drop in offensive campaigns, last month with the end of the year approaching, the attacks intensified significantly.
We saw a big campaign in connection with Agent Tesla on November 18th.
The attacks are targeted at the Czech Republic.
The strategy of the attackers remains the same for now.
An infected attachment in an email is intended to draw the user’s attention by a name that refers to payments and financial transactions.
“While last month a dangerous attachment in the name had the word invoice, this time it was labeled as a copy of the 11.2021...exe receipt repair,” said Martin Jirkal of Eset.
Spyware includes features that scan web browsers and other programs, such as email clients Microsoft Outlook, Mozilla Thunderbird or Yandex.
The malicious code actively searches for stored login data, which it subsequently sends to the attackers.
The last strong campaign took place in the Czech Republic at the turn of August and September, and with the coming holidays and the end of the year, the activity of the attackers is growing again.
Formbook spyware also remained active in November.
Unlike Agent Tesla, the attackers in this case do not specifically target the Czech Republic, and security specialists captured campaigns with a global reach in November.
Compared to October, Formbook data in November weakened slightly, but still stands behind almost five of all detections.
The attacks continued throughout the month with increased activity on the 3rd, 10th and 15th of November.
Formbook most often contained an attachment with the extension .exe, which was named REQUEST FOR SPECIFICATION.
However, the name of the receipt still appears.
Attachment in Czech can then be much more dangerous for Czech users.
Security analysts at the Fareit program, which accounted for 1.6 percent of attacks and had no major offensive campaign in the Czech Republic in the past few months, report a significant decline and slowdown in activity.

The flow of Prague was larger than the media reported.
According to the footage of the parade along the waterfront and according to my experience, the demonstrator is not afraid of an estimated 10,000 people.
The people in the parade filled the waterfront and the bridge and the opposite waterfront communication.
That means a lot of people.
An unprecedented number of passers-by is spontaneously added to the parade of about four thousand demonstrators.
I say something new is born here, writes Radek Mokr<0xC3><0xBD>.
That the persistent dissatisfaction of several large groups or strata of the population led them to find common ground.
Only the anti-tanks, anti-dressers and co-workers themselves would not be able to fill or pay for such a large parade.
The actions of the Chcipl dog association have been growing in popularity, it reminds me of a million moments for democracy on the edge.
Sometimes I have the impression that they rent the same stage and technology.
It’s hard to say what kind of movement this dissatisfaction could pay off, it depends not only on the supply of money, but also on whether the three-dose Pfizer vaccine will not become a square and more dosed.
It's not going to be a left-wing or a middle-wing movement, you bet.
A three-dose vaccine will almost certainly become a multidose vaccine, because it is obvious that we will have to get re-vaccinated every six months.
I'm glad the vaccines saved us.
A brilliant act of scientists, of which humanity is quite proud.
At the end of the day, Bulgaria has a new prime minister announcing a change
Bulgarian President Rumen Radev commissioned the formation of the new government of Kiril Petkov from the anti-corruption movement Continue in the change that won the November elections.
This has already succeeded in forming a government of a broad coalition, which should take office within a few days.
The political crisis in the country has been ongoing since April, when the previous government lost elections under the weight of anti-corruption protests.
However, the victorious parties that announced the fight against bribery and abuse of power were unable to agree, so there were two more early elections.
What do cats do when no one is watching?
From the “secret” shots it is a global hit.
In Britain over the weekend, concerns about the fate of the 32-year-old Czech woman, after which the London police have been searching for several days.
Petra Srncova was last seen two weeks ago when she was driving home from work to the south of the British metropolis.
In addition to the police, the employee of the children’s hospital is also called by her previous employer or member of parliament representing the part of London where she lived.
"Petra's disappearance is not at all similar to her behavior and we are beginning to be very concerned about her," said Lucy O'Connor of the Lambeth Police Department, where Srnc was working, in a video Saturday.
“Her family in the Czech Republic is also very worried about her and simply wants to know where she is,” she continued.
The missing Czech Republic reportedly left work on Sunday, November 28, at around 7:45 p.m. and headed home to the Camberwell district.
She was last seen on the bus about half an hour later.
Her disappearance was reported on December 3 by one of her colleagues.
According to the British media, she served as a nurse's assistant at the Evelina London Children's Hospital, which belongs to the Guy's and St Thomas Hospital Association.
"We are extremely concerned about our dear colleague Peter, who is missing," the health care group said in a tweet.
"We would like to encourage anyone who might have any information that could help her find it to contact the police," the statement continued.
Zden<0xC4><0x9B>k Dvo<0xC5><0x99>ák Kocourková, a <0xC5><0xA0>umper amateur painter of children's rooms (and also a regional pirate councillor), has reported anonymously that her paintings violate copyright.
But the court ruled that the paintings of the Rat in the slumber rooms do not violate the law.
In <0xC3><0x9A>stí nad Labem there was a moon hole in the road in the form of a canal without a lid.
It was a life.
The magistrate referred the complaints to the RSD, to which the road belongs, and because it was said to have not responded, the hole went further.
Eventually, the authorities clarified their responsibilities and ownership, and after a month, the RSD began to “treat the situation intensively”.
