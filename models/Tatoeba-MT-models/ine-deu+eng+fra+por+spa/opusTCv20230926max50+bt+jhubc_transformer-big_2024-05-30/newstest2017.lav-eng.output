28-year-old cook found dead in San Francisco supermarket
This week, a 28-year-old cook who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in a staircase of a supermarket.
But the victim's brother says that he can't imagine anyone who would want to do wrong to his brother, stating that: "His life finally began to improve."
The lion, found Wednesday at the Westfield supermarket, has been identified as 28-year-old San Francisco resident Frank Galicia, a representative of the San Francisco Judicial Medical Examination Office said.
San Francisco police said that her death was considered a homicide and an investigation is underway.
Victim's brother Luis Galicia tells ABC KGO in San Francisco that Frank had previously worked as a chef in Boston, but six months ago he met at his dream work restaurant "Sons & Daughters" in San Francisco.
A representative of the restaurant "Sons & Daughters" informs that the news of his death shocked and shocked them.
"We are a small team that works as a united family and we will miss him very much," the representative said.
In this difficult time, we think we are together with Frank’s friends and family.
Luis Galicia says that at the beginning Frank had spent the night in hostels, but recently life has finally improved.
"He went into a new apartment and met a girl," Louis tells KGO radio station.
Luiss Galicia claims that he does not know who would want to hurt his younger brother.
He was a good man with a wide heart.
"He always pampered his family by preparing a delicious meal and preparing lunch," said Luiss Galicia.
He never wanted to get involved in a fight.
He was the brother who adapted to the others.
"Given everything that went wrong in the world, he was like an unprocessed diamond that shone brightly every day," he says.
Anyone who has information about the incident is invited to call SFPD Information at 415-575-4444.
Young doctors strike: calls for new protests
Representatives of the new doctors are demanding that their trade unions start protests in the dispute over the new contract.
The British Medical Association (LMA) Young Physicians Committee (JAK) is about to request advice to support wider protests in early September.
JAK believes that the ministers have failed to dispel doubts about the contract.
In July, young doctors and medical students rejected the contract offered by LMA.
58 % of the votes cast in favour of the treaty were taken by all the Members who took part in the vote.
In a message posted on Twitter on Thursday evening, JAK board member Elena Mackorta points out that the government continues to remain silent on the issue and therefore the offer of the contract has been rejected.
She said: "In view of this, JAK's vote has resulted in a complete rejection of the offer of the contract and the decision to request new formal negotiations to discuss the most important issues."
In response to the government's silence, JAK today formally requested a meeting with the LMA Council to authorize the development of new contracts that will enter into force in September.
As a result of the dispute, the young doctors took part in six strikes, including for the first time in the history of the NHS.
After a vote to reject the terms of the contract proposed by the LMA, recommended by the BMA, the representative of the LMA's new doctors, Dr. Johan Malawana, resigned.
Before meeting 54,000 young doctors and medical students, he had told BMA members that the offer was good and would be accepted.
After the vote, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt announced that the contract would be concluded with English doctors.
Russia and Turkey: Repulsed alliances?
The gesture that ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to announce the end of the eight-month-long war of names and economic sanctions.
However, when Vladimir Putin greeted the Turkish leader at St. Petersburg Palace, it seemed that Ankara needed this partnership more.
However, they both met.
The smile of Vladimir Putin looked convoluted and did not provoke warm emotions, even taking into account his usual abstinence.
In contrast, Tayyip Erdogan has called Putin his "dear friend" at least five times, according to a review of the meeting.
I'm sick of counting.
He also promised that relations with Russia will not only improve to pre-crisis levels, but will become even stronger.
The next day, a newspaper reported that Erdogan behaved as if nothing had happened.
In my opinion, his enthusiasm provokes conflicting feelings.
But the radiant coolness of Putin shows that the Russian leader has not forgotten anything.
The first thing he mentioned in his speech was the crash of a Russian plane on the Syrian border.
At that time, Moscow reacted sharply.
Putin accused Ankara of shoving a dunk in the back of Moscow.
The incident was even more painful, given that it came from a friend.
Restoring true trust will be very difficult, perhaps even impossible.
Since November, Russia’s public position has changed.
For several months, government-controlled television spread aggressive accusations against Ankara.
Suddenly, it seemed that the Turks were to blame.
The most serious allegations were that Erdogan’s own family had profited from the illegal oil trade with the Islamic State-controlled part of Syria.
He himself, of course, denied it.
However, the main message of the St. Petersburg meeting is that it is time to forget the past.
In the end, this meeting was only because Putin received President Erdogan’s apology.
Russia could see this as a kind of victory.
The benefit of Ankara's reconciliation is obvious.
First, Erdogan needs all possible friends after the unsuccessful coup last month, in which he was tried to be ousted.
The countless terrorist attacks have also shaken his position.
There are also economic motives.
The Russian sanctions have caused substantial losses, in particular the prohibition of charter trips, which usually ensures the influx of several million Russian tourists to Turkish resorts every year.
The number of tourists decreased by almost 90%.
Also, Russian tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when regular flights will be renewed.
They hope for a holiday fever in the Mediterranean in seasonal sound.
Already this week, the state TV forecasts a decrease in the prices of fruits and vegetables, as imports of Turkish fruits and vegetables will be restored.
As the local newspaper Vedemosti quotes: "To tourists for them, tomatoes for us."
But the visit also had other political motives on the part of Moscow.
Ankara is angry at the West for, in their opinion, a weak reaction to the coup attempt.
There is also dissatisfaction with the lengthy negotiations on EU accession and the intervention of Putin, who is willing to take advantage of the situation that Turkey has alienated itself from the West.
The Russian leader undoubtedly gained additional points in the eyes of Ankara, expressing support for his elected government after the coup attempt.
Note that Moscow understands this well, because it is itself deeply rooted in the fear of regime change in the country.
The summit, which took place in this luxurious seaside castle, gave Russia and Turkey the opportunity to present, as one analyst called it, the "repressed alliances", the two countries, which feel excluded from the West, join forces.
However, despite the unity demonstrated publicly, there are still significant differences of opinion between the two countries.
The main discrepancies affect Syria, where Russia presents itself as a peacemaker, but in fact Russia and Turkey support the opposite parties.
After more than three hours of initial talks, both presidents, reluctant to reveal information, announced at a press conference that they had not discussed the issue.
The Turkish president deliberately avoided issues of disagreement between the two countries, while President Putin wanted to emphasize them.
There is no clear consensus on how the two countries could find a common language on the Syrian issue.
But after months of openly hostile relations and potential disasters when NATO member Turkey hit a Russian fighter jet, the situation has improved as the two leaders have at least resumed talks.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside of Scotland
In the future, SKB will play a supporting role for the brand, the Bank’s Executive Director announced.
Outside of Scotland, the SKB will no longer be available.
Ross Makevans tells the BBC channel in Scotland that the SKB brand was associated with the bank's ambitions on a global scale.
It has given up on these ambitions because eight years ago the bank almost went bankrupt and needed financial assistance.
Meanwhile, brand strategy experts have used the SKB brand to protect other consumer financial brands.
The bank received millions of pounds from international sports sponsors, ranging from Six Nations rugby to Wimbledon tennis champion Andy Murray.
But it is now decided to put other national brands in the foreground.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be available to Scottish customers, but it will not be initialised.
In England and Wales, all SKB references, outside the head office and official exchange listing, will be replaced by the name NatWest.
The brand The Ulster Bank is already in use in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
Now, smaller private financial brands such as Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank will also get attention.
Makevan was interviewed during a trip with customers and employees through Inverness.
He told the BBC Scotland channel: "SKB will become our investor brand and with whom our employees are working, because now we are becoming more of a brand bank."
In time, the bank itself became a global brand and SKB became a global brand.
Now I say that we no longer have global ambitions, we have local ambitions.
Each of these brands will represent something unique in their industry and our employees will work with customers under these brands.
SKB has already announced that it will not continue sponsoring Six Nations and will involve various brands in sponsoring sports.
"Is it time to become a brand bank, because we have long wondered how to become a better bank for our customers?" says the CEO.
Three years ago, it would have been very cynical if we had announced that we would become a great bank for our customers and develop these brands.
But thanks to hard work and focusing on the needs of the customers rather than our own needs, we have obviously made a big change.
We can revive these brands again, so I think now is the right time.
Frankie Detori wins the 3000th with a horse Predilection in the New Market
Detori re-corked the champagne, winning his 3000th victory by finishing twice in the first race in Newmarket.
On Friday, jockey Frankie Detori won his 3000th victory in British history, earning the first place in the New Market.
He achieved this by scoring a second victory in these races, which took place in his hometown, while riding with Predilection, coached by John Gosdens.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to achieve such results in a horse sprint race.
He has joined Sera Gordon Richard, Doug Smith, Lester Pigott, Pete Eder and Willie Carson.
Three-time champion jockey Detori, who previously won with a horse Ghayyar, said, "It's something special."
I am very moved because my family is here.
I am very happy that it happened in Newmarket, because I have lived here for 30 years.
This is not a big race, this is not a Royal Ascot, but a normal Friday evening with 20,000 people.
I feel relieved and very grateful.
After the victory Detori and Predilection are welcomed with applause and cheers.
Two jockeys have achieved this record in obstacles races - champion Richard Johnson and career-ending 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who has set several records in his career, scoring more than 4,300 wins.
Lester Pigott, a nine-time derby winner, has won 4,493 career victories.
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of today and it is no surprise that he has achieved success that only a few can achieve.
He is stylish and powerful, but his tactical sense distinguishes him from other jockeys.
He is a fantastic racing representative, his enthusiasm and charisma for years attract fans of this sport.
A few weeks ago in the Epsom races, I told Frankie that he would have already won 6,000 wins if he hadn't only participated in the weekends and the big races.
But seriously, it is a real pleasure that Frankie has been regularly winning races in the United Kingdom for 30 years.
He is a life-joker, who is great at British races, and he is an excellent jockey.
Frank Detori noted this achievement with his brand-name - flying takeoff.
From finishing at wind speed to flying jump, Frankie Detori has been the face of British horse racing for twenty years.
This has been an adventure-filled journey.
He has won countless major races, including the famous 1996 "Great Seven" in Ascot, and has survived an aircraft crash and disqualification for the use of preparations.
Three years ago, it was difficult for him to return after a six-month disqualification, but he demonstrated his strength of character by challenging those who doubted him to return to his best form.
And he could take part in the race for a while - Detori has previously stated that he would like to continue to participate in the race at least up to the age of 50.
Russian President Putin fires the head of the administration Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly fired the head of the administration Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov spent many years in Putin’s closest circle of people.
At present, a 63-year-old politician has been appointed as the Special Representative for Nature and Transport.
The Kremlin's statement said that Putin "decided to release Ivanov from the duties of the head of the Russian presidential administration", without giving a reason.
Anton Vaino, who has been his deputy since 2012, was appointed as Ivanov’s replacement.
44-year-old Vaino is a stabbed diplomat.
Vino was born in 1972 in Tallinn, Estonia, graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MVSAI) and later worked at the Tokyo Embassy.
According to the Kremlin website (in Russian), he later headed the administration of the President's protocol and government employees.
After his appointment, he told Putin: "Thank you for your trust."
In my opinion, the main task of the administration is to support your work in the office of the state president by drafting laws and controlling the implementation of your decisions.
Putin told a Russian broadcaster on Friday that Ivanov himself wanted to leave his post and recommended V<0xC4><0xAB>no as his replacement.
Is the smile convincing?
This move has shattered Moscow.
Sergey Ivanov is an old and close ally of Vladimir Putin and, like Putin, worked in the Soviet security service of the VDK.
In this position, he was one of the most influential men in Russia.
At a meeting broadcast on state television, the two men announced that Ivanov is resigning on his own initiative.
But despite the smiles directed at the cameras, which rarely such an explanation convinces, especially before the parliamentary elections.
Is this the result of the struggle for power?
No one knows.
However, the official claim that the man, who was considered a possible president, suddenly wanted to become a leader of Russian environmental policy, is perceived with great skepticism.
In comments published on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov says to Putin: "It is a fact that at the beginning of 2012 I asked you to entrust me with this difficult job, I could even say, problematic job, four years.
It turns out that I have worked in this position for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
Previously, he was Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former employee of the VDK State Security Service, just like Putin.
In the late 1990s, Putin headed the Federal Security Service, which is a successor to the VDK, Ivanov took over as his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov among the five people he trusted the most.
At the end of Putin's second term, Ivanov was considered a potential candidate for the post of President of Russia, as Putin's re-election to the third term would be unconstitutional.
But then another close ally of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev, became president.
Putin became prime minister, and after three and a half years he returned to the presidency.
The mysterious appearance of fish in a garden in the city of Banff
A man from Banff asks for help to find out what kind of fish appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bain thinks that 75 fish could be sand ducks who left with a water basin.
Mr. Bain, who lives about 500 meters from the sea, posted a video of the fish on the Periscope website, hoping that someone would know how these five-centimeter-sized fish got into his garden.
Crossing of the Queensfera: the bridge is now connected to the Faifa.
The project, currently worth <0xC2><0xA3>1.35 billion, is scheduled to be completed in May 2017.
The engineers have connected the northern part of the crossing of the Queensfera and the viaduct, which means that the bridge is now connected to the Faif.
The first of the four connecting parts is completed, which means that the construction of the bridge is nearing completion.
The construction of the Faifa Bridge is 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tonnes.
It consists of 10,000 tons of steel, 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 supporting cables.
Currently, the project worth <0xC2><0xA3>1.35 billion is scheduled to be completed in May 2017.
Economics Secretary Kate Brown had arrived at the construction site today and was one of the first to climb the bridge.
He said, "This is a symbolic and historic moment in the construction of the Queensfera Bridge."
In this project, we see an unrivalled engineering solution, where more than 30,000 tons of cement and steel are used in the construction of these parts alone.
Despite the enormous weight and size of the bridge, connecting the bridge and the viaduct is an extremely delicate process that requires enormous precision.
In total, more than 79% of the bridge deck has already been built and the last stage connecting the bridge to Rosita will be laid today, which means that all parts of the bridge are ready for laying.
Michael Martin, Director of the Fourth Bridge Connection Project, says: "The first connection is a very important point in the construction of any bridge."
In this fantastic project, the first connection demonstrates top-class engineering.
After installing the last section of the road and connecting it to the support of the northern tower, we were left to connect the northern section of the road to a part of the land or viaduct.
This was done by sweeping the northern part of the access viaduct 700 millimeters to the south.
It was a huge and at the same time very delicate operation.
Huge, as the viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6000 tons and had to be pulled in a slope of about 3%.
Delicate, because the tolerance in both directions with which the team worked was only a few millimeters.
Fortunately, everything went well.
Simona Bailsa wins gold in women's gymnastics.
Forget the tension.
Forget the anxiety.
Simon Bailey is not worried about this.
Dynamic jumps.
Exercises on the bench are performed effortlessly.
Unsurpassed on the floor.
Absolutely flawless.
And finally, the Olympic champion.
On Thursday, a 19-year-old American gymnast won a gold medal, fully demonstrating the difference between herself and the rest of the world on the Olympic stage.
Her total score of 62,198 was higher than the result of the silver medalist and her teammate Aliya Raismane and the result of the bronze medalist Russian athlete Aliya Mustafina.
On Thursday, U.S. athlete Simona Bailsa practiced baloon sports in the individual multi-fight women's final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Bylsa became the fourth American in a row to win the title of multi-fight champion and the fifth best coach, gradually strengthening his reputation as the best coach of his generation and possibly the best coach in history.
When the final result was announced, she burst into tears, as the long journey to this moment was over.
This achievement ranked them next to unbeatable athletes such as Michael Felps, who took his sport to another level.
For the past three years, Bailey has dominated her sport, winning 15 medals at the World Championships, including 10 gold medals, performing such outstanding, precise and ambitious combinations of exercises that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retone called her the "best performer ever".
In Brazil, she was awaited by the final test, where she had to compete largely with the expectations placed on her, not with the other athletes.
She would be disappointed if she returned to her home in Spring, Texas with no gold medals.
U.S. athletes Simona Baills (left) and Alia Raismane are surrounded after winning gold and silver medals respectively in the women’s individual multi-fight final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, held on Thursday.
The first gold medal was won by Bailsa on Tuesday, making a special farewell party for the random coordinator Marta Karolji.
While Bailsa claims that she had not expected anything like this on her long journey to the heights of fame, it is not true.
Part of her free-movement performance, which includes her special acrobatic transition, is accompanied by Latin music, which would perfectly fit on the street next to the Rio Olympics arena.
It's not a coincidence.
A girl who was adopted by her grandparents when she was still an infant and discovered by coach Amy Burman's mother on a gym tour, where Burman's bats took place, has now become a force to be reckoned with.
She has not lost in multi-fight competitions since the summer of 2013, and the series of victories can continue as long as Bailsa wants.
While Mustafina took the lead during the two rotations, it was only an illusion.
Equilibrium beam and free movement - the part of the race where Bailsa will defend his championship title is still just ahead.
She advanced to the front with a score of 15,433 on the bench and strengthened the lead with a score of 15,933 in free movements
Raismane gently hugged her while she waited for the results, which were just a formality, and she poured out joy in tears when the dream she had once recorded in her notebook came true.
Raismane's result was a small revenge for four years of events when she shared third place with Mustafin, but lost the fight for a bronze medal.
This time, a 22-year-old team captain, who the Americans call "grandmother", emerged as a persuasive leader.
After performing in free movements, which dispelled doubts about her return, she was able to devote an air kiss to the crowd.
In the meantime, the 19-year-old Bailey's viral Twitter post r, which she posted this week, has a completely different meaning now.
6-year-old Mahays Brown survives a shooting in Philadelphia.
Police say a six-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, saying he was the second six-year-old to be shot in Philadelphia this week.
The child's grandparents confirmed to CBS Philadelphia's news channel that it was Mahai Brown.
The parents say that Brown was shot several times, including in the forearm, leg, arm and abdomen, but was still conscious when he was taken to the hospital.
His grandmother Delores Melendez told TV: "His little body was just mesmerized by the logs."
I can't believe it.
The boy in critical condition is placed in the hospital and has already undergone several surgeries.
The family informs him that he will definitely recover.
He had to start first grade in the local elementary school.
Brown is one of four people shot to death in the Germantown area.
Three men were also shot: two 29-year-old men and one 32-year-old man.
CBS Philadelphia reports that one of the 29-year-old men is in critical condition, while the other two victims are in stable condition.
The channel says that the child was found in the front seat of the car next to the 29-year-old victim in critical condition.
The other two victims were not found in the car and police are investigating whether any of them were the attacker.
The investigator told CBS Philadelphia that a number of gunmen were likely involved in the shooting.
At the site of the event, gun shells of cartridges belonging to various weapons were found.
Looks like it's been a long-term shooting.
There are shells on both sides of the pedestrian corridor.
“Therefore, it seems that there were a number of gunmen who were actively involved in the shooting,” says Captain Anthony Ginaldi of the Philadelphia Police.
Damage has also been caused to several homes and cars.
No one has yet been detained and police are reportedly inspecting surveillance footage.
On Tuesday, during the shooting, a lost ball struck a 6-year-old girl while she was playing outside her home in the West End district.
She is gradually recovering, but the police are still looking for the culprit.
Why do we need Simon, Gaby, and Laurie?
I call it the Women's Olympic Lightweight Team of the Year for a number of reasons.
First of all, I have been at all of the Summer Olympics since 1984, and the US team has never been so good.
Secondly, there are three lightweight athletes in this team, Simon Bails, Gaby Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, who are inspired by many young girls.
People can be proud that this team also includes Alia Raismane, who is Jewish, and Madison Kociana, who is Catholic.
Finally, this team really represents America.
It has also strengthened the participation of black and Latin American athletes in this sport.
For the past four years, the best exerciser has been an African-American.
Last year, Simona and Gabia took 1st and 2nd place.
These are impressive results.
In the previous Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas became an Olympic champion in a surprising turn, and America was able to cheer.
Now the world has seen incredible exercises performed by triple world champion Simon Bails, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, performing unprecedented but masterful exercises.
On Thursday, Simona became the fourth American in a row to win a gold medal in the women's individual multi-fight.
Her teammate Alia Raismane won a silver medal.
We have seen the best that this sport can give, but in the rest of the country the situation in the gymnastics classes is completely different.
Simona, Gabby and Laurie entered the Olympics just like Alia and Madison.
She is the "Olympic Five" because the next Olympic Gymnastics team will have only four athletes, and this is the last year of coach Martha Carol's coaching.
Gymnastics is actually an expensive sport. Gymnasts are mainly trained in private athletic clubs, and they are maintained by parents who pay for training, rooms, travel, uniforms, hotels (coach, athletes and their families) and other expenses.
Most of these athletics clubs are located in urban areas that can afford this sport.
In these clubs, athletes take all their workouts, and it is an expensive and long investment for lightweight families.
Amy Burman - Simona Baills coach and Maggie Hainie - Laura Hernandez coach have been training their athletes since both girls started to practice athletics.
We need to provide young girls, inspired by Simona, Gabi and Laurie, with cheaper gymnastics training options.
I founded my athletics organization 20 years ago.
My organization is located in Harlem, and we offer more than 15,000 city youth (mainly black and Spanish) free or low-cost gymnastics training. We have also trained national and international champions.
In September, we will open a branch in Detroit (my hometown) to provide local youth with the opportunity to get to know this great sport.
Athletics develops the coordination of strength, flexion and body, as well as taught hard work, discipline and aspiration to the goal.
This combination ensures a long life with good health and success both at school and at work.
This team inspires thousands of young girls to train in athletics and it is fantastic.
Taking part in this sport is very important, especially for young girls.
This is a very exciting time.
Thanks to Simon, Alicia, Gaby and Madison for the great demonstration of "Girls of the Force", winning gold medals at the Olympic Games and motivating countless new, diverse girls of origin to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
After rejecting Jeremiah Hunt's offer, the new doctors plan to extend more strikes.
Ministers hoped to end the controversy by reaching an agreement on changes to the agreement with representatives of the British Medical Association, but this was rejected by 58 percent of the 37,000 new doctors who took part in the vote.
In July, Hunt announced plans to conclude a contract, stating that the NHS is in a precarious position and further delays will only harm workers and patients.
The first young doctors have already signed a new contract, which provides for changes in working conditions in night shifts and weekends to improve working conditions during non-standard working hours.
Yesterday evening, BMA’s representative for young doctors, Dr. Elena Makourta, said that young doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, especially that it will deepen the labor crisis and it does not provide equal conditions for all doctors.
There are eight weeks left until the first group of new doctors signs the new contract, so progress needs to be made, because there is not much time left.
BMA's efforts to resolve the problem through negotiations have faced the government's reluctance to engage and sometimes complete silence.
This happened despite the fact that even last month, Jeremy Hunt said that his door was always open.
Jeremiah Hant must act immediately , stop inactivity and work with new doctors.
If he does not, then the young doctors are ready for new protest actions.
During the last strike at the end of April, more than 13,000 routine surgeries and 100,000 visits were postponed, while nurses and consultants tried to replace doctors who had gone on a picket.
Ministers hoped to end the dispute by reaching an agreement on changes to the agreement with representatives of the British Medical Association.
BMA wants to raise the rate of work over the weekend for 54,000 new doctors covered by the new contracts.
NHS Employment Executive Director Daniel Mortimer urged young doctors not to go on strike.
Mr Mortimer explains that strikes do not solve anything, but only increase pressure on busy workers and worry, create stress and delays for patients, caregivers and their families.
For the last two months, we have spoken to the new doctors’ committee and, together with the Ministry of Health and other institutions, we have answered positively their questions about caregivers and reporters.
Employers hope that active cooperation in other important issues of the Ministry of Health, such as the placement of employees, flexible training, in addition to the training of those returning after a career break, training costs, mutual recognition of training programmes, leaving school and gender pay inequalities in the field of medicine.
Medication for 2 pounds a day can reduce the risk of heart attack.
Thousands of patients who have had a heart attack could be treated with the drug for 2 pounds a day, as the official representatives recommend using them in more people and for a longer period of time.
Ticagrelor, a contraceptive medicine, reduces the risk of recurrent heart attacks in people with heart disease.
This medicine is already prescribed for use 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of recurrence of a heart attack.
NHS representative NICE recommends using this preparation 4 years after a heart attack to further reduce the risk of a heart attack in people with cardiovascular problems.
However, the NHS-run NICE currently recommends using this preparation 4 years after a heart attack to further reduce the risk to the heart and blood vessels.
Every year, about 140,000 people in England experience a heart attack, and a quarter of them experience a recurrent heart attack or stroke.
Heart attack and stroke are caused by the accumulation of fat in the walls of the heart, forming blockages.
If a blockage breaks, it can cause a clot, blocking the blood flow to the heart and causing a heart attack.
In turn, if the thrombus separates from the blood vessel wall, it can get further into the bloodstream and block blood access to the brain, causing a heart attack.
People who have had a heart attack are at greater risk of having a repeated heart attack.
Ticagrelor, manufactured by AstraZeneca, a British company that is marketed as Brilique, reduces the risk of thrombus formation.
The new NICE guidelines, published today, recommend that people take 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months and another 3 years at 60 mg twice daily with aspirin.
Professor Carol Longson, Director of Health Technology at NICE, explains: "Despite the availability of medicines to prevent repeated heart attacks, more than a quarter of people who have had a heart attack are experiencing another heart attack or stroke, often with severe consequences."
Fear of repeated heartbeats can leave a negative impact on the quality of a person's life.
There is evidence that Ticagrelor in combination with aspirin effectively reduces the risk of recurrence of heart attacks and heart attacks in people who have previously experienced it.
With the provisional recommendation of treatment with Ticagrelor, we are pleased to be able to extend the treatment options to thousands of people who are thus beneficiaries.
Given the limited information on the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor, in particular the risk of bleeding when used for more than three years, the draft guidelines do not recommend its use for longer than this period.
The culture of political correctness promotes fraud during elections in Muslim communities
According to the management report, the former mayor of the city of Tauerhamlet, Lutfur Rahman, was dismissed in connection with corruption.
The government report reveals that a culture of political correctness is turning a blind eye to widespread fraud in Muslim communities.
Former government minister Sir Eric Pickle criticises the police, election watchdogs and city councils for ignoring the signs of fraud in the electoral process because they are "fearful of harming ethnic and religious interests."
The former community secretary, who has now become the head of the anti-corruption organization, says that intimidation of voters for religious reasons is so prevalent that police should be allowed to deploy guards at polling stations to protect intimidated voters.
He also recommends that voters should present a person’s proof of identity when they vote to prove their true identity.
At the moment, voters only need to indicate their name and address.
He even recommends marking the fingers of voters with a special ink to prevent double voting.
The rapporteurs should also be given more protection, says Sir Eriks.
He believes that the press should have greater access to Council documents and decisions taken by informal committees and working groups.
He says: "The goal is not only to prevent electoral fraud, but also to protect the local government from the wider corruption and culture of fraud that goes hand in hand with it."
The report was ordered on Downing Street following a scandal in connection with the elections in the city of Tauerhamlet.
Last year, the Special Electoral Court decided to remove Mayor Lutfur Rahman from office due to corrupt and illegal activities.
The court found that Rahman "cynically distorted" his Muslim community's religious views and silenced his critics, accusing them of racism and Islamophobia.
"Rahman has led his election campaign with the view that it is the religious duty of Muslim believers to vote for him."
Approximately 300 votes were forged or questionable because one person had voted multiple times.
Likewise, Sir Eriks points out that there are signs of fraud throughout the country.
He pointed out that fraud in the mail vote is particularly worrying, where senior members of Muslim communities have forced others to vote for their preferred candidates.
Sergey Eriks recommended a number of measures to improve the electoral system, including the presentation of the identity document of persons, in order to establish the identity of the person.
Her report states: "Evidence shows that vulnerable members of ethnic minority communities, especially women and young people, are being forced to vote for the community's elder elected candidates, especially in the communities of Bangladesh and Pakistan."
"There are concerns that the regional institutions are not paying attention to these problems because of political correctness, as it could harm ethnic and religious interests."
Sir Eriks outlined 50 recommendations on how to improve the electoral system, which also includes a ban on political activists working with votes delivered by mail to prevent "vote-gathering".
The report, which is being examined by Theresa May, also calls for a more thorough check of registration to prevent the use of voter lists for fraud in the field of immigration and benefits.
Considering the possibility of requiring voters to present proof of identity before the vote.
Mark the fingers of the voters with a special ink to prevent double voting.
Systematically verify the nationality of a person to make sure that the person has the right to vote.
Set a three-year limit on requests for automatic voting by post.
Prohibit political campaigners and activists from voting by mail and election envelopes for voting by mail.
To provide the police with the power to deploy a guard to the polling stations.
Make changes to the law to facilitate the prosecution of persons for intimidation under the Human Rights Act 1983.
Prohibit photography in polling stations.
Specify the requirement to use only English (except in Wales) in polling stations.
Intensify training to ensure that polling stations staff go to polls one at a time.
Ser Eriks sharply criticizes the Metropolitan Police, expressing his misunderstanding that no charges have been brought in the Towerhamlet case.
He says: "The electoral court only disqualified Lufturu Rahman and his representative for activities related to corruption and fraud."
He was convincingly convicted according to the standard of criminal law evidence on the basis of irrefutable evidence.
He also criticizes the ineffective check-up of voters in the city hall at the polling stations.
Ser Eriks notes: "Last year, the court's decision was a wake-up call.
Our country is known as the homeland of Parliament, but the worrying and hidden spread of electoral fraud and the pretense of institutions that fraud is not a threat to this good reputation.
Cycling Affair - Kate's Companion and Other Rio Olympic Celebrity Companions
Fans of the 2016 Rio Olympics are thrilled about French cyclist Pauline Ferrand Prevot, who has been recognized by fans as extremely similar to the Duchess of Cambridge.
However, the 24-year-old cyclist is not the only athlete to fight for gold this summer, which, according to the media, prides itself on its celebrity companion.
Therefore, in honor of the Rio Olympic Games and all the famous faces that are currently on our screens, FEMAIL has created a list of Olympic Games participants that are far more similar to Hollywood stars.
The hunter and the wolf: Brady Elison, a member of the U.S. archery team, left, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since childhood
With the exception of Kate's companion on the cycling track, many people on the Internet point out that this archer could be the twin brother of superstar Leonardo DiCaprio.
Brady Ellison, a member of the U.S. men's archery team, caused a storm on Twitter when photos were posted where he is very similar to Wall Street Wolf.
In the case of a non-compliance with the provisions of this Directive, the Member State concerned shall notify the Member State concerned of the application of the provisions of this Directive.
"I personally don't see much resemblance except the beard," Brady tells the Huffington Post.
"He's a good-looking guy, so I take it as a compliment."
This year will undoubtedly gain even more popularity with one of the most popular pairs of London 2012 Olympic teammates: the striking resemblance between British broadcaster Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neal Patrick Harris.
Russian athlete Aliya Mustafina, thanks to her large, expressive eyes, is compared to the Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
When it comes to swimming, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgs has been compared for several years to "The Scene Made" star Matthew Morrison.
Changes: This user has noticed that Christmas is the <0x60>sports version<0x60> of the actor of the movie "Inception".
Also, the old companions are tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who have similar eyebrows and lips.
Russian silver medalist, swimmer Julia Efimova and actress Annalyn McCord can boast not only sunburnt skin and blonde hair. Meanwhile, fans believe that the athletic American athlete Nathan Adrian resembles Joseph Gordon Levit.
Scared Women: Football star (left) Hope Solo and actress Jennifer Carpenter (right) in the series "Dexters" have a similar face and eyes.
It is not a single one: one Twitter user was pleasantly surprised to learn that others also see these similarities
Theory: This user believes that there may be a reason why the two look so similar
Recently, a Twitter user was delighted to announce that "other Internet users have agreed that Houpa Solo and Jennifer Carpenter actually look identical."
The American football star and the actress of the series "Dexters" really have a very similar face shape and eyes.
Other popular comparisons relate to Carrie Wallace Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to the smile of actress Laura Linnaeus. Likewise, gold medal-winning athlete Gaby Douglas prides himself on a beautiful, wide smile that resembles "Bring It On Gabrielle".
CBC Olympics commentator apologises for his comment that a Chinese swimmer has "died like a pig".
Bairon MacDonald’s analysis of Ai Yanha’s 14-year-old fourth-place finish in a 4x200 m freestyle relay for women caused a storm of indignation in CBC viewers.
The Canadian channel CBC was forced to apologize after one of its commentators commented that the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer had "flyed away from the race, stinked alone" and "died like a pig".
Commentator Bairon Macdonald thought his microphone was turned off when the 4x200 m freestyle relays for women presented their personal views at the end of the final.
MacDonald, who was included in the CBC comment team to give vigour to the comments, said, "That little fourteen-year-old from China can't keep up."
"Too much running, she flew out of the race, that smelled like a pig and ended up like a pig."
Thank you very much!
14-year-old Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan scored 1:57.79 in the second stage, which is 1.61 seconds slower than Canadian Taylor Rucks score, allowing the Canadians to reach China.
Viewers across Canada immediately reacted online because they were shocked to hear such a tone and expressions.
Emet McFarlane tweeted: "Did a direct CBC commenter just say that a 14-year-old swimmer from China "died like a pig"???".
The idiot did not realize that they were still in the direct ether.
Ai Yanha from China 4x200m freestyle final for women was named as "a little fourteen-year-old from China who doesn't keep up."
Criticism of Bairon MacDonald quickly came into force, as many asked for explanations.
Twitter users couldn’t believe what Bairon MacDonald said.
Twitter user Sarah Paradi wrote: "Oh, #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada, and because of you, we all sound racist.
Shortly afterwards, Scott Russell, who was running the CBC live show at the time, apologized for McDonald's comments, saying, "We're sorry that the comment on the swimming result sounded live."
It was an unsuccessful choice of words and we are very sorry that it happened.
CBC apologized to more than 90 people who had responded on Twitter to this comment.
MacDonald’s colleague Scott Russell had to apologize in his place.
Then CBC recaptured an apology to more than 90 Twitter users who complained about McDonald's comment.
Also, the channel quickly published an apology and a notice.
We very much regret that such comments were made and they came to the forefront.
Yesterday, we immediately reacted and apologized to all the live viewers and social media followers.
For the sake of clarity, Bairon’s comments were made about the swimmer’s performance, not addressed to her personally.
But in any case, these were unprofessional and unsuccessful statements, and Bairon is very sorry for what happened.
On Thursday afternoon, McDonald personally apologized on the direct air and tried to explain that he did not think that his comment would be perceived as a personal attack.
On the CBC Olympics live broadcast, he said: "I would like to take a moment and apologize for the comment I made yesterday after the women's freestyle competitions."
I'm talking about a swimmer's performance, not her in person.
Needless to say, I had no intention of showing disrespect and I am really sorry that it happened.
Primark buyers are shocked by a woman who shamelessly holds on to her underwear in the middle of the store.
Buyers felt uncomfortable when the woman began to undress so that the panties would stick in the middle of the store.
To make matters worse, she held them to make sure they stood up for her and then pulled them off, putting her panties back on the shelf.
She continued to look for clothes at the Folkestone Bouverie Place shopping mall and held four more panties.
The Primark store at Bouverie Place in Folkestone, the place where this woman held her underwear and then put it back on the shelf.
At that time, Jenny Davidson, the mother of two children, was also in the store, who tells that a strange woman, after hanging her underwear, put on her clothes and left the store without buying anything.
She points out that people were not able to trust their eyes.
Standing in the middle of the store, she took her underpants off the shelf, pulled off her socks and pants, and on the spot she pointed them.
She didn’t even try to find a more discreet place to spot them, she just stuck them right there on the spot.
Everyone watched her take off her panties and apparently the woman did not like them, because she just put them back on the shelf.
She wore three more panties until she decided that none of them she liked and left the store.
It didn’t seem to bother her that someone was looking or thinking about the person who would buy the clothes she was holding.
Miss Davidson, 33, from Kent, says: "It's a good idea to buy clothes that have been worn by someone else and then not washed."
The incident took place on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms. Davidson adds: "I assume that after her departure, the store employees removed the above-mentioned clothes from the store shelves - which is also acceptable."
I can't imagine buying a new underwear and finding out that another woman has worn it and then it hasn't been washed.
A spokesperson for Primark said that Primark was aware of the incident that took place on Tuesday, August 9.
Specific clothes have been removed from the shelves of the store.
How to protect yourself from firearms using Krav Maga
The world is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com could make it a little safer.
To find out how to protect yourself in close proximity to attackers with a gun, we spoke to Krav Maga Grandmaster from New York Ron Mizraki.
Whether you’re being attacked from the front or the back, this video shows you how to protect yourself and gain control over the attacker.
Mizraki indicates that if the attacker attacks from the back, then you must first turn to clearly see the attacker and avoid the trajectory of the shot.
Then the gun should be worn between your front arm and shoulder and beat the opponent's face with your free elbow.
Then there is a beating with the cheekbone and until the attacker gets cold in pain, he must take off his gun, walk across his face with a revolver and retreat, continuing to turn the gun against him.
If the attacker approaches from the front, the situation is similar - the trajectory of the shot should be avoided, the weapon should be caught and folded in such a way that the villain can not shoot.
At the same time, pressure should be applied to the weapon and the opponent must be beaten on the chest and finally take off his weapon and retreat, continuing to aim at him.
Does that sound complicated?
Watch the video to see exactly what Mizraki is doing.
But remember, if you're not the master of Krav Maga, then it's safer to return your money to the robber.
The Vandal family demolished the Saltash Cornwall Social House and is laid out on the street.
The Vandal family has been exiled from their homes for terrorising their neighbors, causing damage to the social housing of <0xC2><0xA3>50,000.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner, Shawn Treblewood, are only badly off the property in Saltwater Cornwall, because of a number of complaints about them.
When they were forcibly expelled from the property, shocked housing officials found that the property had been completely demolished.
There were holes in the floors and walls, rubbish was thrown away everywhere, and the walls were covered with graphite.
The family is now dispossessed of the property and most likely lives in some private property.
Donna Makevoi, manager of the Cornwall Housing Service, says that there are concerns that it will not be possible to rebuild the housing.
She says that the people who lived here were extremely difficult and she believes that people cannot live like that.
In this case, a number of factors should be considered, as in the future this property in Cornwall will not have a good reputation.
This family is famous and their name is well known.
The couple had three sons who periodically resided in the property and the police say that their terror was expressed as violence, clashes on the street with baseball bats, intimidation of locals, drug use, sale of drugs, and loud bullying and lambasting.
The 47-year-old Skeldon, on whose behalf the property was owned, was sentenced in June for antisocial behavior.
Waste disposal was found in several rooms of demolished houses.
A number of floorboards have also been carved in a house where drugs may have previously been traded.
The neighbors say that they regularly went to the street and constantly called the police.
The Cornwall Housing Service forcibly expelled them from the property when they were given 11 weeks to leave the house voluntarily.
Desperate neighbors were very happy about the display, because their lives had been an absolute hell.
One said, "They didn't care about other citizens."
We've lived next to them for 20 years, it's always been crazy.
I can't believe how often we've seen the police here.
We couldn't sleep this morning.
We woke up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to it!
Now that they're finally gone, it's going to be wonderful here.
Adam Fitzpatrick, who is the head of neighborhood protection for the Cornwall Housing Service, said the family did not cooperate with local security authorities.
The family has lived here for 20 years and is regularly called the police.
In the garden of the house, various old and unusable items were found.
He also commented: "It is very regrettable that the tenants have shown no responsibility for their behavior, because leaving the house is always the last step considered by the Cornwall Housing Service."
This was a very difficult case because their behavior was extreme and neighbors had been very difficult to observe in their behavior.
I appreciate the work done by my entire team, the police in Devon and Cornwall and the community members, who were brave and cooperated with us in providing the necessary information.
I hope that this event will facilitate the lives of neighbours and show that anti-social behaviour is unacceptable.
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons had lived here at different periods of time, but they were all about 20 years old.
Dirty mattress left on the floor in one of the rooms after laying.
Service employees will now have to clean a pile of waste left in the house.
In 2014, the police raided the house and found more than 70 grams of marijuana, weights, accessories and 1700 pounds in cash.
Skeldone has only been found guilty of storing Class B drugs for the purpose of distributing them.
She insisted that the money was intended for a memorial to her son Lee Sheldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After the installation, it became known that they are currently renting some private property in Plymouth.
Many walls of the house were marked with graphite.
Police say they will continue to expose tenants who violate their lease agreements.
Devon and Cornwall police spokeswoman Angela Crowe points out that this posting is an unmistakable warning to other tenants who continue to violate the rules.
Likewise, she said, "This is a warning to those who feel they can behave as they please and it will have no consequences."
Devon and Cromwell police are unacceptable to criminal and antisocial behaviour, and the police will continue to work with our partners to protect local communities.
Willingness to spend can give an impetus to the economy.

The mayor of Canu has banned burkini swimsuits on the beaches.
The mayor of the southern French resort city of Cannes has banned wearing burkini swimsuits on the city’s beaches, which almost completely cover the woman’s body and resemble a hydro-suit, local officials said on Thursday.
The mayor of Cannes, David Linar, has signed an order that "access to beaches and swimming is prohibited to anyone who does not have a swimsuit that respects good customs and secularism" as a fundamental principle of the French Republic.
"The beach suit, which exemplifies religious affiliation at a time when France and places of worship are the target of terrorist attacks, may pose a risk of disturbance of public order (mobbing, clashes, etc.) that needs to be prevented," the order said.
"We are not talking about a ban on wearing religious symbols on the beach, but about exceptional clothing that is associated with trust in the terrorist movements that are fighting with us," explained the head of municipal services of the municipality, Thierry Miguls.
He added that the burkini swimsuits on the beaches of Cannes have not been seen since July 28, when the member of the center-right party "Republicans" Linars signed this order and it came into force.
This week, the water park in Marseilles canceled a planned private event for Muslim women who would wear burkinis in swimsuits, because politicians from both the right and the left expressed outrage at such a event.
In France, it is forbidden to wear face-covering Muslim women's headscarves, but no religious symbols or appropriate clothing are prohibited.
On 14 July, 85 people were killed in the terrorist attack carried out by the Islamic State group in Cannes, near the resort city of Nice.
On July 26, two attackers, who had sworn allegiance to the Islamic State, brutally killed priests in a church in the northwest of France.
"Jysk" last tumour turnover by 5%
"Jysk Linnen'n Furniture" ("Jysk"), a retailer of household goods, had a tumour turnover of 5% last year, reaching 23.66 million euros, according to "Firmas.lv" information.
The company’s turnover in 2014 was EUR 22.57 million.

The management report states that last year the company reconstructed the existing store in Riga, Slokas Street, and closed the store in Riga, Kurzeme Prospekt.
This year, as in other years, the main task of the company is to continue to increase both turnover and profit.
In the meantime, the profits made last year are recommended to be left untouched.
"Jysk" is an international network of stores that offers goods for home improvement.
"Jysk Linnen'n Furniture" Ltd. was founded in 2001.
The capital of the company is 3 500 264 euros.

The "Kub<0xC4><0x81>na" festival has started in Lucavsala.
On Thursday, 11 August, in the evening, one of the last festivals of this summer was launched in Lucavsala - there until Sunday night "Kubana" will be held.
On the first evening, groups such as "Enter Shikari" from the UK, which was expected last year, but did not disappear from the program, American punks "NOFX", DJ Maxim from the group "The Prodigy" and others.
Also in the next days of the festival there are noteworthy words in the program - "Guano Apes" and "Garbage", the drummer of pankroka "Ramones" Marky Ramon with "Marky Ramone's Blitzkrieg", "Brutto&Lyapis" with Belarusian pankroka leader Sergei Mikhailovich, the leader of the populace "Pankroka"
This is the second year that the festival "Kubana" takes place in Latvia.
Last year it suffered financial failures and huge losses, but it did not deter the organizers from repeating the attempt - they added a longitudinal sign to the name, included a Latvian group in the program (on Friday evening 19:15 on the stage ladder "All Day Long") and announced that the organizers were "symbolized" and that now in the festival
Will these efforts justify, it is too early to judge, because the festival has just arrived, but, as observed in the first evening "Delfi Amusement", at least for the time being huge efforts to attract people did not succeed and the number of visitors was similar to last year.

The President who remained in the shadows: Gustav Zemgal - 145.
On Friday, August 12, 145 years have passed since the birth of the second President of Latvia, Gustavs Zemgals.
Zemgals proclaimed the state of Latvia, but has remained undeservedly in the shadow of the first president of Latvia, J<0xC4><0x81>nis <0xC4><0x8C>akstes, and the last president of the pre-war period, Karls Ulmans.
None of our fellow citizens has defended democracy and the rule of law as much as Zemgals, writes Arnold Auzi<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1> in a book dedicated to Gustav Zemgals published ten years ago.
In conversation with the portal "Delfi" Auzi<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1> emphasizes that Zemgals is one of the few politicians in high positions who have had a sense of humor.
The rest are so stiff, always very correct.
He taught not to be that way, today it could be similar to what Raimonds V<0xC4><0x93>jonis is.
"He was someone who was close to the people," Auzi<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1> says.
Modern politicians know history poorly, they refer to Karl Ulmani as a good leader, but rarely does anyone know how negligent he was.
In the meetings of the government, the only person he did not cry for was General Balodis.
Even if in the pictures he is kind and smiling, by nature he was hysterical.
"Zemgals, with his sense of humor and democracy, leaves the opposite impression," says Auzi<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1>.
Aivars Stranga, Professor of the Faculty of History and Philosophy at the University of Latvia, agrees with "Delfi" on Auzi<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1>'s assessment of Zemgalis as a peaceful and weighted citizen.
He also notes that Zemgals stood out with respect for minorities, regularly invited Jewish representatives to the presidential palace.
“At that time, it was not the usual act, after the Zemgale Presidency, Alberts Kwiesis took over this tradition,” says the historian.
He was such a quiet and weighted man who had long had to be persuaded to become president.
He didn't go after it himself, he just didn't starve for fame.
He was also quite critical of himself because he did not know the French language, but he felt that the President should definitely know it.
"During the presidency, the basics of the French language were learned," explains Stranga.
Zemgals did not allow himself to be re-convened to be a candidate, he did not like his really high posts at all.
In any case, he is a very respectable figure in Latvian history, he was already in a serious position before entering the Presidential Palace - he was a very requested notary.
Zemgals also led the famous Zemgals treasury in Suvorova Street 3, where there was a company of storekeepers and store publishers, in which virtually the state of Latvia became in government negotiations.
He was always in a progressive mood.
He was not a great admirer of Ulm<0xC4><0x81>ns, but he was not opposed publicly.
“In private talks, it has sometimes been said that Ulm<0xC4><0x81>ns’ actions really dislike him,” Stranga says.
Lived a peaceful life, there is no suspicion of illegality or corruption.
How does Zemgale remember today?
It's a shame, but for the most part he only associates himself with some street in Riga.
He was an absolute democrat, his views were centered.
"There were no major shocks during his time, that is, he could associate himself with such a truly stable presidency," Stranga summarizes.
During the presidency of Gustav Zemgala, from 1927 to 1930, there was also a state visit of Latvia to Sweden, which indirectly meant that Latvia at that time had full recognition in the neighbouring country and membership in the family of the democratic nations of Northern Europe.
On May 28, 1929, Zemgals visited Stockholm.
The reply of King Gustav V of Sweden took place in Latvia on 29 June 1929.
The second President of Latvia was born in 1871, but died in perpetuity in January 1939.
Simple ways to help the child cope with the attacks of anger.
I often have to face the fact that the child's anger, the appearance of nickname, parents consider something wrong and abnormal.
When a child openly shows his anger - we do not know how to react, "Econet" indicates psychologist Ekaterina Kesa.
The specialist encourages a small conversation about these natural and human feelings - the anger and resentment that everyone experiences periodically.
Aggression - it is already a physical activity directed at another person, and it usually appears when we feel angry.
When we adults are angry, excited - we usually know what is happening to us and how to deal with it.
We can express our anger and rage in ourselves: to express, suppress, hide, keep in ourselves, tell about it to our friends or other relatives, we can infuriatedly sell a couch, smoke a cigarette (this is not the best way to do something else to spread anger, do it, do it!)
We do not turn our aggression against others, because we know various other ways to deal with these emotions.
Children, when they are angry, do not understand what is happening to them, how to name them and how to live with them.
They can say, "Go away!", "You're a fool," "Bad mommy," "I don't know you," "I won't be friends with you" - and very rarely, when they can say, "I'm angry with you."
Children live in a literal sense, they are completely located right here, at this moment, they are spontaneously and truly in the display of their feelings, and often are also in the grip of various emotions.
It is very important that the parents do not forbid the child to show feelings, including anger, do not be ashamed of it and do not worry, but on the contrary - help the child.
Do we need a break in the relationship?
A long working day where everything hasn’t gone the way you’d like it to, or just a bad mood – there are so many reasons why you’d like to “disconnect” from the world for a while, a day or even longer.
Is it possible to pause the relationship for a moment and take a breath?
But does that mean that each partner has his own way?
There are gentlemen of different ages who share their views.
John (23) is short and basic: "In my view, if you need a break in your relationship, you are not with the right person."
In the meantime, Edward (30) has discovered a scheme that might help someone.
If you feel that your partner is starting to get on your nerves for every little thing, then definitely - this is the right time to paint other hunting fields to understand if you miss her, or especially do not think about her or do not want to see her anymore.
So the answer is - yes, pausing can help save time and understand how important the other side is to you.
Kaspars (29) reveals his theory.
In my opinion, it is necessary to take a break from each other in everyday life, because if you spend time with a person 24 hours a day, seven days a week, then disputes are inevitable.
They are caused by the fact that you notice every little thing that the other person does, and it starts to fall on your nerves.
People start to worry about each other, especially when there’s nothing more to talk about than what you’ve been doing all day.
My personal experience makes me think so, so I haven’t been in a relationship for more than a couple of months.
If you think for a moment that somewhere else or somewhere else is better - then why does this woman with whom you are dating deserve someone who can think that there is not enough good here and there are fields of paradise behind the mountains?
Thinking alone is a small betrayal.
If it's not, it's not.
"I have, so I a little condemn those who do not." said Edmund (46).
Charles (33) has a completely different view.
I think everyone needs a moment to pause.
You cannot look each other in the eye every moment, all the time, from morning until evening, and rejoice in unfailing love.
Atopie!
There are so many things - friends, work, parties.
Everything has its time.
Of course, even a girlfriend or wife, however, if both can maintain their balance between family life and the rest of the world, then it can live up to the edge of the grave.
That's it and that's it.
It is difficult to say whether it is necessary or not, whether it is allowed or not to take a break, but one thing is clear: the initiator has nothing to do with the relationship to the end, something is missing.
If this question arises, then it must be reckoned that in the near future there will be some change - for the better or for the worse, it depends on themselves.
I think that while you are still young and crazy, pause is necessary - all the time, but when everything remains serious and the relationship enters a completely different phase, then there can be no talk of rest.
You decide to spend your whole life together!
"If you can't stand each other's society now and need a place to stay once in a while, then what will it be when you're retired who comment on how passing cats roar or quarrel over which day the garden should be better buried?" explains Kristaps (19).
All the names of the gentlemen have been changed.
With its exciting and exciting personality, Rozent<0xC4><0x81>ls was the first to arouse the interest of the Latvian people in the visual arts.
"In this sense, he was the first love of the Latvian people, which as such will remain forever unforgettable", Romans Suta wrote about the Latvian painter Jani Rozental.
Also in 2016, the opening of a wide retrospective exhibition of the old master in the restored main building of the Latvian National Museum of Art is clear - Rosent<0xC4><0x81>ls is the first love of Latvian art.
The exhibition was opened on 12 August, but from 13 August it is available to visitors and will be on view until 30 October.
Latvian National Museum of Art with wide retrospective in the newly opened Great Exhibition Hall honors the painter Jani Rozental (1866-1916), whose one hundred and fiftyth birthday is included on an international scale in the UNESCO holiday calendar.
The retrospective exhibition, which includes more than 150 works, is one of the central events of the Janis Rosental’s Jubilee Year programme.
The selection of artworks is mainly made from the collection of the Latvian National Museum of Art, which convincingly represents the main stages and genres of creative activity of the classic, stylistic variation and variety of techniques.
In addition, exhibits from the Akseli Gallena-Kallela Museum, the Museum of Writing and Music, the Museum of Liep<0xC4><0x81>ja, the Tukuma Museum and several private collections in Latvia and Finland were used.
The presence of photographs revives the atmosphere of the millennium, the mobile application of the exhibition reveals individual links of works of art with photographs taken by the painter himself with his camera for creative purposes.
While the Finnish-Latvian association "Rozentals-seura", named after the Latvian classic, at the Latvian National Museum of Art also offers the first stop of a small informative travelling exhibition "With a view in Finland, with a heart in Latvia".
A similar exhibition with contents in English, Finnish and Swedish will open in the autumn at the "Work" gallery in Helsinki.
Mets Leblanks is looking forward to returning to the show "TopGear".
In addition, it is important to ensure that the information provided by the European Parliament and the Council is not misleading in any way, and that the information provided by the European Parliament and the Council is not misleading in any way.
So far, nothing is officially happening.
"If there is, then the BBC will report it," Leblanc told television critics.
Doubts about the future of "Gas on the Floor!" arose in July when LeBlanc's partner, Chris Evans, announced that he was leaving the show.
After leaving, Evans admitted that LeBlanc and "Gas on the Floor!" were "like made for each other."
Evans describes the star of the former series "Friends" as "a real and good husband", thus spreading rumors that the friendship between the two was messed up during the filming.
When Leblankm was asked what he liked most about the show, he replied that traveling to other countries such as South Africa, Morocco and Ireland.
The BBC reports that Evans will not be replaced by Evans for the show's new 24th season.

It is expected that the meldonium contained in Mildron<0xC4><0x81>ts made in Latvia could already be excluded from the list of prohibited substances for athletes this year, the director of the Latvian Institute of Organic Synthesis, academician Ivars Kalvi<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1>, said on the LNT broadcast on Friday morning for 900 seconds.
He said he would go to Canada in September to discuss the meldonian issue with representatives of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).
The scientist expressed the hope that the Mildronate will be removed from the "black list" already this year.

In the backstage of the American modeling business, his interpretation gained the gloss of a pervertedly sophisticated photoshoot and the intolerance of a horror film.
Basically - a very provocative, balanced work on sophistication and banal vulgarity, in which the borderlines between European art house films and the territory of the Hollywood genre product are difficult to draw.
The film, starring Vigo Mortensen, focuses on whether parents’ conceptually chosen lifestyles (ecology, vegetarianism, alternativeism and detachment from the stupidity and values of consumer society) bring blessings or destructiveness to their children.
The idealist father of six children after the death of his wife is confronted with questions about the correctness of the choices and the true values.

This survival solo number can be compared to James Frank's showcase of acting in 127 Hours and Ryan Reynolds' play in Apache Alive.
Perhaps the main role is also played by the sculptor Mila Kunis, whose transformations from a role model as a creative resident and a lover of the family values seem only to be created by the fantasies of desperate Hollywood screenwriters.
The Islamic State has captured 2,000 civilians in Syria.
Islamic State fighters fleeing from Menbij, Syria's Aleppo province, captured some 2,000 civilians used as live shields, US-backed Kurdish-Arab alliances and observers announced Friday.
"We didn't shoot them because they took civilians with them when they fled to Jerabulus," a spokesman for the Kurdish Military Council in Menbij said.
After two months of fighting, the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (QSD), a U.S.-backed Kurdish-Arab alliance in northern Syria, announced on Friday that Menbij had been liberated from the jihadists.
The Islamic State seized Menbij in 2014.
QSD has already expelled most of the Islamic State fighters from Menbij last week, but some have resisted and shown strong resistance.
On Friday, however, they left the city, taking prisoners with them.
Islamists go to Jerabulus, which is on the border with Turkey.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), based in London, also reported that the Islamic State had abducted some 2,000 people.
SOHR reported that Islamists abducted the city's residents' cars, forced people into them, and then took them to Jerabulus.
Islamic State fighters have also committed mass abductions in the past.
In January, Islamists kidnapped more than 400 civilians, including women and children, while conquering the territory of Deir ez-Zor province in eastern Syria.
Later, about 270 of the prisoners were released by Islamists.
How many Islamic State fighters have fled Menbij, it is not known.
A spokesman for the Kurdish Menbij Military Council reported that QSD managed to rescue 2,500 people held captive by Islamists in Menbij.
According to SOHR, at least 437 civilians, including 105 children, have been killed in the Battle of Menbij.
299 QSD fighters and 1019 jihadists were killed.
What is the best way to get rid of the virus?
The head of the State Environment Service, Inga Kolegova, has decided to withdraw his candidacy for the post of Director General of the State Revenue Service (VID), the agency was informed by LETA at the Ministry of Finance.
You will be able to find out more about how you are doing, how you are doing, how you are doing, how you are doing, how you are doing, how you are doing, how you are doing, how you are doing, how you are doing, how you are doing, how you are doing, how you are doing, how you are doing, how you are doing, how you are doing, how you are doing, how you are doing, how you are doing, how you are doing, how you are doing, how you are doing, how you are doing, how you are doing
It seems that the real reasons for the debate are related to politicians' visible but more often invisible interests and they have nothing to do with evaluating my professional abilities.
"It's not acceptable for me either," says the candidate for the post of head of the VID.
In the event that her candidacy is confirmed in the government, it is clear that this would not be a convincing vote and it would not allow the necessary changes to be fully worked out and implemented by the SIP, feeling the support of the entire government.
Without it, full-fledged work would not have been possible, concludes Kolegova.
"I have repeatedly publicly stressed that I do not want to be politically dependent, but at the moment the whole process of my candidacy is too politicized," the official explains.
“Thanks for the trust and support shown to me, it is an experience that I value as an advantage,” Kolegova writes in a statement to Reizniece-Ozola.
On Wednesday, the unity expressed that during the meeting with Kolegova "substantial contradictions" were revealed between the candidate's explanations and the information available in the public registers on the costs of dividends of SIA Pallogs, since publicly available decisions of the Pallogs participants' meetings provide for no division of profits.
Currently, the duties of Head of the VID are carried out by Deputy Director-General Dace Pel<0xC4><0x97>ka.
In the L<0xC4><0xAB>v<0xC4><0x81>nas, police are involved in the rescue of two small unattended children, the State Police Administration of the Latgale Region informs.
You will not be able to find out what you are looking for, but you will be able to find out what you are looking for.
They were located in L<0xC4><0xAB>v<0xC4><0x81>nas near the building of the former shop.
The two little girls are immediately handed over to the doctor for assistance.
In addition, a bag with documents and a mobile phone was left in the carts.
In less than half an hour, the guardians found out the possible location of the parents of the children and went there.
When the women arrived at the civilian's house, the police found out that the woman was sleeping because she was under the influence of strong alcohol.
In the first place, it is important to note that in the first place it is important to know that you have a good relationship with your partner.
Already going home after a joint session, the woman decided to leave the children at the store in uncertain circumstances.
The police immediately informed the orphanage court, which will also decide on the further fate of the children.
The Riga Freeport has implemented all the VK recommendations for the Russian island project.
The Riga Freeport Administration has implemented all of the five recommendations of the State Control (VK) regarding the implementation of the project Infrastructure development on the Russian island for port activities to move from the city center, the portal Diena.lv informed the company.
Approval of the project is scheduled for the next meeting of the Riga Freeport Board.
In order to implement the recommendations in accordance with the opinion of the Government, in preparing the documentation necessary for the implementation of the recommendations, the Management Board of Riga Freeway was also guided by the conclusions of the legal and operational audit carried out by the international auditor Deloitte in the Freeport of Riga Freeport and the recommendations given in the future project management session.
Information on the implementation of the recommendations has also been sent to the UK today.
Despite the fact that the Riga Freeport Authority does not agree with the opinion prepared by the UK on the expediency of the implementation of the Russian island project, we are very responsible for the implementation of the project and the donor - the European Commission (EC).
I would like to emphasise that all the construction works planned within the project are fully completed within the stipulated deadlines and to the planned extent.
"To prove to all those involved in the implementation of the project, including the EC, the UK and also the stewards that the main objective of the free port is to successfully implement the project, we have fully implemented all the recommendations of the UK on project management and monitoring issues," says Sanita Cairo, head of the project in the Russian island.
The existing long-term operational plan for monitoring and monitoring the achievement of the project objective was supplemented by the most important planned activities of the parties involved and the necessary decision-making deadlines, the definitions of meetings and regular reports and their deadlines, the monitoring tools of the planned construction process from defining points, as well as
The approved action plan for achieving the project objective by 31 December 2018, in accordance with the recommendations of the Government of Latvia, has been supplemented with performance monitoring activities, thus strengthening the deadline control of the activities of the other parties involved in the implementation of the project on the part of the free port of Riga.
To improve project management and mitigate potential risks, a project management plan has been redesigned, defining the project management areas and specifying the developed documents that provide a control and monitoring mechanism for each of them.
In order to increase the capacity of the project, a project management structure scheme has been developed, which reflects the planned structure, qualifications and functions of the project management team.
In order to improve the communication of the Riga Freeport Administration with the parties involved in the project, a communication plan of the parties involved in the project has been developed, which, in addition to the parties identified in the project action plan, defines the stakeholders for the successful completion of the project, the principles, types and periodicity of information exchange.
In turn, in order to improve the control of the use of financial resources, the need to conclude a service contract or initiate a procurement contract and the rule of law will need to be further substantiated in the future.
Within the framework of the project, a world-standard port infrastructure has been built on the Russian island - four new deep-water docks, railway inlets, as well as engineering communications.
The co-financed constructions of the Cohesion Fund have already been completed and put into operation at the end of last year, resulting in savings of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>10.6 million.
Threats have increased airport security in Slovakia.
After receiving non-specific threats, Slovakia on Friday strengthened security measures at several airports, the Interior Ministry said.
"Given the threats, we have strengthened security measures at international airports in Bratislava, Poprad and Ko<0xC5><0xA1>ice," a spokesman for the Slovak Interior Ministry told AFP on Friday.
“The National Security and Analysis Centre is currently analyzing the information we have received,” he added.
The European Union (EU) will hold an informal summit in the Slovak capital on 16 September with the participation of all bloc countries except the United Kingdom.
The meeting will discuss the consequences of the UK Brexit referendum and discuss the future of the EU without the UK.
Slovakia will hold the EU Presidency until January.
German researchers discuss the number of victims of the Berlin Wall.
According to a new study, the death toll at the communist yoke of the former East German border may be much higher than previously thought, but doubts about the true number of victims are still unclear.
According to data released Wednesday by the Checkpoint Charlie Museum of the Berlin Wall, between 1945 and 1989, 1,841 people were killed by the authorities of the Western Allies and later the Communists of West Germany who tried to escape their controlled territory.
The museum has been investigating border-related deaths for years and adjusting the number of victims from time to time.
Another 11 deaths have been added to the list this year, including among the victims a six-year-old boy who drowned while trying to get his family to West Germany through then-Czechoslovakia and Hungary.
Among the young victims of the Berlin Wall are also Soviet army deserters.
"The final extent of the damage caused by the double evil of communism and socialism has not yet been fully documented," admits museum director Aleksandra Hildebrante.
"Our task is to ensure that the graves of those who died trying to escape from a communist-controlled country are cleaned up and not lost," Hildebrante said in a statement.
However, other researchers have already questioned the new figures.
“The number of 1841 is unconvincing,” Johann Statt, an expert on East German history at the Free University of Berlin, told the Süddeutsche Zeitung in an interview.
He and other researchers at the Free University of Berlin are currently reviewing possible deaths at the border, and so far they have only managed to confirm 260 cases.
Researchers have estimated that 138 people were killed by the Communists at the Berlin Wall alone.
Given the number of people who have died trying to escape through the Baltic Sea or to get to the West through the territory of neighboring countries, according to the State, the number of victims could reach about a thousand.
However, this is considerably less than 1841.
One of the reasons for the different number of victims could be different methodologies.
Checkpoint Charlie Museum also lists all cases of suicide by East German border guards, regardless of whether or not they were directly related to their service.
The museum also lists deaths not related to direct violence.
"If seniors between 70 and 80 years of age die from a heart attack after being reduced by border controls, it must be the consequence of this 'murder border'," Hildebrante said.
However, the State is convinced that a distinction should be made between old people who may have died as a result of their experience of treatment and those whose deaths are caused by prolonged waiting in a hot bus at the border.
Regardless of its victims, it is not easy to count them, because the Communist authorities of East Germany did not collect such statistics, and researchers have to extract documents in various scattered archives, states the State.
However, the <0xC5><0xA0>tata Group has recently developed new documents and could therefore present a new estimate of the number of victims in the near future.
The president of the LPF, Pone, went to Rio with the accreditation of a coach; this is a surprise to him.
In the last days, the President of the Latvian Swimming Federation (LPF), Kaspars Pone Riodejaneiro, has come to the Olympic Games with the accreditation of a coach, but he is surprised by this.
On Wednesday, a wide range of aging was caused by the statements of Olympic swimmer Alonso Ribakovs coach German Jakubovska, who discovered that at the last minute, Pone decided to go to Rio de Janeiro while the coach had to stay at home.
Initially in the list of riders were approved swimmers Alona Ribakova and Uvis Kalni<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1>, coaches Jakubovskis and Dave Collins, as well as the president of the federation Pone.
The Latvian Swimming Federation announced five participants for the Olympic Games, and even before the departure Aldons Vrub<0xC4><0x97>evskis claimed that Germans will be and tickets are being sought for him.
"However, apparently for objective reasons, he did not go," Mr. Pone said, expressing the opinion that it did not affect Ribakov's result.
At the request of the federation, Uvja’s coach took the initiative to help her.
Sir, who is himself a member of the LOK Executive Committee, has sharply criticised the LOK's actions in bringing the blame on the Olympic sports oversight organisation.
In my view, it is unethical to approve five persons and not to remove one of them from the Executive Committee.
“I don’t know why exactly the Swimming Federation didn’t have enough space,” Pone said, adding that the work of the federation and its presidents is not appreciated in society, recalling that the presidents of the federations don’t receive salaries.
He also criticized Jakubovski himself, saying that before the London Olympics, when Ribakov was not approved among the participants, he complained to the International Water Sports Federation (FINA) and called on Latvia not to send any athletes.
The Lord could not tell why he was in the Olympic Games with the accreditation of a coach, who probably had to meet Jakubovski.
"I was applied as the president of the federation ("team leader"), but for unknown reasons I received the accreditation of the coach and now I'm not going anywhere inside."
The situation changed every day, the number of available accreditations changed.
I thought until the last moment that Germans would be, because I didn't have any other information.
According to the information at the disposal of the LETA agency, a few days before the start of Ribakova, she had an eye-to-eye conversation with Poni and after her swimmer had tears in her eyes, however, the President of the LPF himself stated that it was a daily conversation with the desire to tune athletes before the start.
He recalled that the LPF supervises five sports that are in the Olympic program, and four of them are training children also in Latvia.
The President of the Federation stated that issues of demolition are also very important in Latvia and also about such programs he spoke about when Rio de Janeiro has been there for almost two weeks.
He praised the work of the federation and said that in 2018 the World Cup could be held in Latvia.
Staying in Rio de Janeiro is not my vacation, I work here, waste my time and try to implement four-year programs.

During the Latvenergo Fish Resources Renewal Program, more than 600,000 annual salmon and turmeric turmeric turmeric turmeric turmeric turmeric turmeric turmeric turmeric turmeric turmeric turmeric turmeric turmeric turmeric turmeric turmeric turmeric turmeric turmeric turmeric turmeric turmeric turmeric turmeric turmeric turmeric turmeric turmeric turmeric turmeric turmeric turmeric turmeric turmeric turmeric
If you want to be able to make a difference in your life, you need to be able to make a difference in your life, and you need to be able to make a difference in your life.
In the spring and early summer of 2016 will be released larvae of lidaka and nega, in June - siga, in July - single-summer salmon, in August and September - zandari and wimbas.
Latvenergo Production Director M<0xC4><0x81>ris Kunickis said that environmental care is one of the cornerstones of the Latvenergo Group’s sustainable development.
"In the protection and breeding of fish resources, every activity is focused on environmentally friendly activities in close cooperation with the scientific institute Bior, both in the raising and entry of fish cubs in the Daugava basin, and in the realization of other activities", Ku<0xC5><0x86>ick said.
This year, more than 600,000 annual salmon and turmeric cubs will be introduced to the Daugavas playground.
Already in the second year, the young fish are marked by cutting the fat spurs before entering.
Today, the cargo contains 25,000 salmon babies with an average weight of 31.3 grams.
Each year, in the scientifically justified composition of species and in numerical terms, the introduction of fish cubs and larvae into the Daugava and its basin takes place.
The multiplication of fish resources in Daugava and its basin shall be carried out by Bior in accordance with the regulatory enactments, based on an examination of the losses caused to fish resources as a result of the economic activity of Latvenergo and giving a conclusion on what compensatory measures are to be taken to ensure the diversity of fish resources.
On the basis of that expertise, the State Environment Service shall decide on the amount and type of compensation.
The annual amount of compensation for Latvenergo in the programme for the restoration of fish resources is EUR 1 035 000.
In the spring of 2016, Latvenergo in cooperation with the company "We fish" for the fifth year will place 400 artificial fish nest in Daugava near Kaibala and Ik<0xC5><0xA1><0xC4><0xB7>ile.
Collaboration with the association, promoting the natural catch of fish, is an initiative supported by Latvenergo as part of the Fisheries Regeneration Programme.
The placement of artificial nests in the water reservoir is an important measure that contributes to the protection and multiplication of fish resources in Daugava.
The festival "Sansusi Concert Hall" is a country courtyard, forest, cirsma.
Sleeping in a tent, eating like in a restaurant, strolling and listening to investigated chamber music, enjoying the quiet peace of nature - such a combination is offered by the alternative chamber music festival Sansui, which already invites the third summer to Akniste district.
The festival will take place in the courtyard of the former town hall, next to forests and carvings.
In three days - from 12 to 14 August - five stages can combine the exquisite enjoyment of carefree nature and academic music.
Here the theatre and contemporary circus, performances and installations meet with music.
Opera and academic music, especially in its latest expressions, find new listeners in a free and open environment without the stiffness of the concert halls.
The distance from here to Riga is about 150 km, but to the smile on the face and lightness on the feet is only a few minutes.
"Please do not look for a program, because we have deliberately chosen not to publish it in advance, so that people do not go to a specific event or an artist, because the true taste of Sansusi can only be captured by spending all three days in it," invites the festival's initiator and host, Armands Sili<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1>.
The opening of the festival is on Friday at 5 pm, and the first concert is at 7 pm.
Of course, there will be programs on site with all the information.
For those who have to choose one day, we recommend Saturday, because it is the most saturated - from 9 a.m. until the next morning.
"The names of the artists are available on the website www.sansusi.lv", says Armands Sili<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1>.
The magnificent artist’s bouquet includes, for example, the violinist Eva Bindere, cellist Krist<0xC4><0xAB>ne Blaumane, opera star Inga Kalna, clarinetist Guntis Kuzma, trumpeter J<0xC4><0x81>nis Poretis, pianist Reinis Zari<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1>, quartets Quadra and RIX, and even the Estonian air.
The festival is also specially designed for new works.
In the children's show "Kukainis", which was composed by Olesya Kozlovska and Jacob Nimanis for Transformation motifs after the story of F. Kafkas, together with Armands Silis, musicians and actors will participate entomologist (insect researcher) Ugis Peter<0xC4><0x81>ns.
Oskars Herli<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1> has created the first String Quartet, while Anna <0xC4><0x8C>irse - Wooden Opera, a performance, whose main characters in Andra Kalnozola directed by Katrina Neiburga video projections and Andra Egl<0xC4><0xAB><0xC5><0xA1>a scenography will be trees in three small pots in a three-hectare area.
Singing in the voices of Lymas Ledi<0xC5><0x86>a, Dinaras Rud<0xC4><0x81>nas and Zigm<0xC4><0x81>ras Gra<0xC5><0xA1>a, they will enter into romantic relations, just like the Swedish naturalist of the Enlightenment Karl Linnaeus in his study Tree Wedding (1729).
The Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro are starting today with one of the biggest expectations of the Latvian delegation of seven-match athlete Laura Ikaunniece-Admidi<0xC5><0x86>a.
Ikaunniece-Admidi<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1> will start the 100-metre barrier race at 15.35 (Latvian time) and the upcoming high jump race at 16.50 (Latvian time).

Before the Olympic Games, Ikauniece-Admidi<0xC5><0x86>a, who won the bronze medal at the World Championships last year, was named as a contender for the Olympic medals.
Even in May, Latvia set a new state record (6622 points) and won second place in the prestigious seven-match competition in the Austrian city of Gecis.
Ikaunniece-Admidi<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1> also participated in the 2012 London Olympic Games, when with a repeat Latvian record she won ninth place.
In the last year and a half, the athlete has corrected the national record four times.

For Judith, this will be his first Olympic career.
The Agency LETA has already announced that on Thursday, in the weight category of up to 100 kilograms, the Latvian judo wrestler Yevgeny Borodavko suffered losses in his first fight.
He surrendered to Japan's Haga Rjunoski, who later won the bronze.

Reid claims that if Clinton is elected president, then she will appoint Garland as the Supreme Court judge.
The leader of the Senate Democratic Party, Harry Reid, is convinced that if she becomes president, then she will nominate Merik Garland as the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.
The Senate Republican Party has blocked Garland's approval since he was nominated by President Obama in March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced that the next president would choose to replace the current Supreme Court Justice Antoninus Scala.
During his conference on Thursday, Reid announced that he was confident that Clinton would choose Garland.
A spokeswoman for Reid later said that he had not personally spoken to Clinton about the issue and that it was only speculation.
He praised Garland and said that Clinton's team would not want to "swing the boat" with another choice.
Garlands is the Chief Justice of the U.S. District Court of Appeals in Colombia.
Reid said Republicans blocking Garland's nomination are "incarnate" and are acting in the interests of Republican Party presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He also said that Trump is not suitable for the job of president.
Treats announces a nude photo calendar for women and men.
Treats will work with photographer David Belmer to create the 2017 calendar Pirreli in the style of the 1970s.
In its 2017 NU M<0xC5><0xAB>z calendar, it is planned to showcase new supermodels, not nude celebrities.
Earlier this year, Treats President Steve Shaw announced that his erotic art magazine was different from the old-fashioned Playboy because "Playboy is a men's magazine".
This magazine is for women.
He also seems to be talking about the calendar.
In a press release on the creation of the calendar, Shaw says: "We need to return to the indestructible and classic depiction of nudity in pictures, where the body of a woman is not mutilated, but inspired by both women and men."
Women will want to participate in this project, because it is an excellent work of art.
Models can submit their photos electronically or in person to casting sessions in Los Angeles and New York.

Scientists claim that Greenland sharks have the longest life span of all vertebrates on our planet.
Shark researcher Julius Nielsen says the longevity record belongs to a female who could be 272 to 512 years old and five meters tall.
A French court rejects the demand to tear down shops in the Jungle refugee camp.
The French court rejected the Calais authorities' demand to demolish dozens of self-made shops and restaurants in the Jungle camp, home to several thousand refugees.
At a hearing this week in Calais, authorities indicated that the state should destroy 72 self-made stores, where people sell a variety of goods in the camp area, such as cigarettes and energy drinks, offer hairdresser services, tea for 50 cents (40p) and restaurants for simple meals themselves.
The prefect’s office in Kale pointed out that these self-created companies must be destroyed because they form a shadow economy and do not pay taxes, as well as create fire and sanitation risks.
Representatives of the Humanitarian Group explained to the court that these small businesses are important because the food provided by the government and the support groups does not meet the needs of a camp where the population continues to grow.
They also pointed out that self-made shops and restaurants often offer free shelters and food to those who need it most.
The Court of Lille ruled that there is no legal basis for the expulsion of people who have set up 72 self-built stores, but it understands the concerns of the Prefect of Calais.
Judge Jean-François Molla said that food, coffee and restaurants play a bigger role than simply providing food to people who live in "extremely unsafe conditions."
He pointed out that these places are peaceful meeting places for refugees and volunteers.
One of the places at risk of demolition is the Jungle Book Kids café, which provides more than 200 free meals a day, English and French lessons, and provides advice on asylum issues to hundreds of vulnerable unaccompanied minors.
More than 170,000 people have signed a petition to protect the children's cafe.
A letter addressed to the Guardian stated that the liquidation of the café "would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are only 8 years old."
On Friday, two charities, Refugee Aid and L'Auberge des Migrants, announced that the population of the Jungle Camp had risen to 9,000, the highest figure since the rapid influx of migrants in the summer.
Britain wins a silver rugby series 7 in a fight when Fiji's national team masterfully wins the gold.
The impressive performance of the British national team in the rugby 7 series ended on Thursday, when in the exciting final match at the Deodoro Stadium in Rio Fiji, the national team decisively defeated them with a score of 43:7.
Fiji demonstrated a masterclass in the management of the ball, the balls are played with the foot, the support game and the brutal power game, winning the gold - the first Olympic medal in its history.
The defeat brought a respectable consolation prize - a silver medal, which was Britain's third medal at the time. The British team can be proud of their success in the first Olympic rugby-7 tournament, in which they won New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
A heavy fight in the semi-finals, in which the Boxing team suffered a defeat with a score of 7:5 in the first half of the day, may have played in the final for Great Britain.
But in any case, Fiji is currently in its best shape to win the 15 men's team.
While unlikely, a known consolation for Britain could be the fact that at least one British won a gold medal. This is Fiji’s random head coach Ben Ryan – the former England coach from Wimbledon.
It was an exciting adventure for Britain.
Eight years ago, under the leadership of Ryan, they lost all the games in the rugby-7 series stage in Adelaide.
This time they lost only one game.
The defeat is painful, but the growth is amazing.
Fiji started the match impressively, rejecting the techniques of British force for joy.
For Captain Tom Micheal and his teammates, it was like clashing with several buses running in the opposite direction, and the World Series champions emerged in the lead with 5:0, when Osea Kolinisau won the first landing.
In the last four minutes, Jerry Tuwai also increased the lead by landing on the right wing.
The result was 12:0 and the British team did not even touch the ball.
Michelle's excellent power technique prevented the distinctive Leoni Nakaravam from scoring three points, but this only slightly affected the Fiji result.
In the seventh minute of the game, Jasa Veremalua won the landing in the right corner, strengthening the lead over Britain to 17:0.
After the rematch, Nakarava further increased the lead and had more than a minute left until the end... at the end of the first half.
Vatemo Ravouvou avoided some awkward British methods of force and crossed the line, scoring points.
The landing resulted in 29:0.
It looks like Fiji was born to play rugby 7 matches while the British are just learning.
In fact, it is also true.
The British team made a major change in the half-time, breaking the Fijian line... full four minutes, which was good by first-half standards, until Joshua Tuisova, after a fantastic team match, scored a few more points for the Fijian team.
Dan Norton managed to score points for the British team by landing in the left corner and scoring 36:7, but the game had already been lost, while fans of the South Sea Islanders sang, drew their flags and danced in the tribunes.
You can not fail to admire the joyful attitude of Fiji.
Mata Williame made Fiji’s victory even sweeter with another landing at the end of the game.
After the end of the game, Fiji could start celebrating, but the British after defeat could only sit in the grass.
In the first half of the day, Fiji beat Japan with a score of 20:5, while the British were ahead of South Africa, where in a very tough fight both teams won by landing and the South Africans lost by only a few points.
In the first half of the season, Nail Brown led the Boxing team, but in the second half, Dan Norton crossed the line with brilliant craftsmanship and delivered the ball between the poles, giving the British a victory.
Markus Watson, who is the brother of Antony of England's rugby 15 team, gave the team a victory and another silver medal at the end of the game.
The coach’s battle with cancer was inspired by Helen Glover and Heather Stanning’s victory in the wrestling competition.
It will be the most emotional gold medal in these races and it already says a lot.
From the first to the last, the golden moment of Helena Glover and Heather Staning was of particular importance on the Estacio da Lagoa track.
Although there are only two athletes on board, she was accompanied by Robin Williams's tribute, which inspired her to win even the second Olympic gold medal in pairing for women, becoming the first women in British sports history to achieve such success.
They were undoubtedly dominated, for the 39th time they won an unprecedented, unprecedented victory.
Both great athletes with swan elegance sliding over the surface of the water do not fully reflect this triumph.
Behind each gold medal, there is a whole team that works hard to ensure that athletes continuously improve their performance and the greatest contribution to their success was made by a coach who did not know 30 months ago whether he would experience this day because he was diagnosed with cancer.
According to him, it disappeared as quickly as it appeared.
I had bladder cancer, which is one of those that can be operated on and it also happened.
If you do not, it will spread throughout your body.
And the situation would become uncontrollable.
It changes your vision a little bit.
Williams was diagnosed with cancer in December 2013.
This trio was fortunate that William was able to initiate the recovery procedure at the beginning of the 2014 mid-season and to reduce the duration of the break to a minimum, if you can say so.
I needed income, so I had to recover quickly.
It stimulated recovery.
I was in the hospital and I drove 6, 10 and even 15 meters long distances, although the doctor said that a few steps would be enough.
It all started.
It was a challenge in itself, but this time it was even bigger.
After the victory, the first thought was immediately about Williams, who was very anxious all morning and spoke more than usual in the impression of excitement.
Stanning, who served in the Royal Artillery Unit in Afghanistan, said: "This has been an emotionally difficult week, but it means a lot to me."
It only confirms how much it means to us and how much we, Helen and Robin, have worked.
The 3 years spent with Helen and Robin have been great.
Without Robin we would not have achieved anything, so a huge thank you to him, he is the best coach in the world.
I can’t imagine a better training partner or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a single race in five years.
The pair reaches such a huge speed that competitors can not compete with.
Even in the last 500 meters, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to approach, Staning and Glover's dominance was too great.
We felt every moment.
Helen shouted, "Keep the rhythm, keep the rhythm."
It is really important not to lose focus.
We had a good start, but at the same time we did not have high expectations.
On that day, we had no intention of breaking records, but just flying well and winning races, and we did.
A couple of years will rest to decide what to do next.
Next month will be the wedding of Glover and TV adventure seeker Steve Bashal.
For now, she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn’t want to say that this was my last race.
It would have been too much pressure.
In London, it took me about six months to realize that I was an Olympic champion.
It was a new experience and I was very worried.
This time it took about four minutes.
She said, "The feeling is fantastic."

What is the best way to get rid of the virus?
According to him, now Prime Minister M<0xC4><0x81>ris Ku<0xC4><0x8D>inski (Greens and Farmers' Union) and Finance Minister Dana Reizniece-Ozola (Greens and Farmers' Union) are already "principally important" for the approval of the candidate of the Finance Minister nominated Kolegova in the position of head of the SIDA.
Rajevsky argued that both Kuczynski and Reizniec-Ozola's approval of the head of the VID in this government is the "first big decision" that may affect him as a politician.
If he starts now to change his position in the selection of a candidate for the post of head of the VID, then this will negatively affect their image in the public administration.
The agenda of next week’s meeting of the Cabinet of Ministers includes the issue of the transfer of the Head of the VVD Kolegova to the post of Director-General of the VID, according to the agenda of the Government.
The role of the head of the VID was assigned to Kolegovu by the Finance Minister Reizniece-Ozola after the resignation of In<0xC4><0x81>rs P<0xC4><0x93>tersone from the management of the service and when the competition for the post of Director-General of the VID ended without result.
In the case of a non-compliance with the provisions of this Directive, the Commission shall, in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 5(1), submit a proposal to the European Parliament and to the Council.
The Minister of Finance later acknowledged that no other candidates for the post of head of the VID are being considered for the time being.
You will be able to find the best way to get rid of the virus, but you will not be able to get rid of the virus.
In Spain, the possibility of reducing the budget deficit is threatened by the failure to form a government.
On 12 July, the European Commission (EC) came to the conclusion that Spain and Portugal had not taken sufficient measures to reduce the level of budget deficit to the euro area's required 3% of gross domestic product (GDP).
The calculations show that despite the austerity measures implemented, the Portuguese budget deficit at the end of last year was 4.4% of GDP, while in Spain it was 5.1%.
However, the European Commission has decided not to impose economic sanctions on both countries, while at the same time setting fiscal targets for the near future.
However, one of the reasons why the EC has not introduced sanctions against these two countries is the growing Euroscepticism in many countries of the European Union.
Additional sanctions would only exacerbate such a negative mood.
Critics, however, point out that the EC is not consistent in its decisions by agreeing on uniform rules from the outset and then failing to apply them in life.
For example, the President of the German Bundesbank, Jens Veidmann, has pointed out that this is how Europe loses confidence in itself, creating in the public the impression that the rules of the European Union are recommending rather than binding.
The EC has now proposed and all Member States have agreed to extend the deadline for the correction of the budget deficit to Portugal by the end of this year and to Spain by 2018.
The European Commission promises to review the progress made by both countries in the coming months, while at the same time pointing out that both Spain and Portugal should be prepared to introduce further austerity measures if circumstances so require.
Initial forecasts indicate that Portugal's target could be achieved in time and that the budget deficit could already this year be reduced to 2.5% of gross domestic product.
This means that, within the framework of the Stability Programme, the government of that country has to implement austerity measures of 0.25% of GDP this year.
These measures should be included in this year's budget, with an additional focus on controlling the cost of procurement of goods and services.
In the case of Spain, the situation is much more complicated.
This year the budget deficit should be reduced to 4.6%, next year - to 3.1% and in 2018 - to 2.2% of GDP.
In addition, consolidation measures should amount to 0.5% of GDP annually over the next two years.
The fact that for eight months the Spanish political parties have failed to agree on the establishment of a government and the possibility that Spain may have to hold early parliamentary elections for the third time in a year makes it particularly difficult to achieve these objectives.
However, public opinion polls show that even the political landscape of the third election in the country would not change significantly.
The most popular party is still the popular party led by the current Prime Minister Mariano Rahoja, whose election would again get under 33% of the vote.
Only socialists have increased their popularity slightly, while the popularity of the parties "Podemos" or "Together we can" and "Ciudadanos" or "Pilgrims" have declined slightly against austerity measures.
The People's Party wants to achieve socialist and Ciudadanos involvement in the government this month, otherwise it will not be able to adopt and submit the draft budget for 2017 to the European Commission for approval by mid-October.
As stated by Rafael Hernando, representative of the People's Party parliamentary group, if a government fails and parliamentary elections are still held for the third time, Spain will become a mockery of the whole of Europe.
The cleanliness of the beaches in the Gulf of Riga is critical.
When surveying the beaches for the fifth year, the activists concluded that, unfortunately, the amount of waste found is increasing every year, and this is mostly the fault of the visitors to the bathing sites.
The most polluted swimming areas are right in Riga.
The capital’s headquarters explains that bathing areas are being cleaned every day, but it is quite difficult to fight dirty visitors.
In addition, waste left on land can be rinsed in water during rainfall, thus greatly impairing its quality.
With the exception of Liep<0xC4><0x81>ja beach and some places in Kurzeme, the cleanliness of the beaches elsewhere in Latvia is critical.
This announcement was made this week by the volunteers of the "My Sea" campaign.
When measuring the road along the Gulf of Riga for the fifth year, activists concluded that the number of waste left by the population has increased every hundred meters.
Unfortunately, this year, this critical assessment has taken place.
"We see that this will be the year when the number of waste on the beach 100 meters, maybe even can exceed 200 units", says J<0xC4><0x81>nis Ulme, representative of the expedition "My Sea".
When called by Latvian Radio, he was on Tuya beach, where the volunteers will continue their walk along the Gulf of Riga.
This year, between the various household waste and the picnic remains, activists have had to collect even the daylight bulbs left in the sand of the sea.
The participants and the organizer of the walk Ulme say that it is the people who are responsible for the pollution.
"The main source is the beach visitors themselves, because more than half of the total amount of waste is plastic, various waste, starting with bags, plastic pieces that are already in the decay stage, they can no longer be identified, and for debris, bottles, corks," Uzbekistan says.
Among the dirtiest beaches are also swimming areas in Riga.
For example, in Daugavgrí, an average of nearly 800 units of waste are collected every hundred meters, which is a critical amount.
The campaign organizers also explain that I see every step of the way, and not the warning or ban marks placed everywhere.
"The average figures for all three Riga bathing areas together - Daugavgr<0xC4><0xAB>vus, Vakarbul<0xC4><0x81>ls and Vet<0xC4><0x81>k<0xC4><0xAB>s - unfortunately come together large and far exceed the desired goal, to which Latvia seems to be moving, to reduce the number of waste units to 135 units by 2020", concludes the environmental defender.
Cleaning of swimming areas in Riga every day, even twice on the hottest days of summer, explains Ugis Vidauskis, representative of the house.
However, the fight with dirty visitors is quite difficult.
We return to the cultural question of these people.
"With those who fertilize, use alcohol, smoke and do all the things that shouldn't, even special signs don't work," says Vidauskis.
Therefore, Vidauskis invites visitors to the swimming area to report pollutants to the police.
You can call the police, safely point to these violations and thus fight everyone.
There may be some new warnings, but, as I said, it will hardly change the situation radically.
"As everyone should simply turn to and be intolerant of such offenders," he stresses.
In the meantime, water quality measurements have already been carried out for the fourth time this summer by the Health Inspectorate, which can impose a ban on official swimming areas.
This year, however, as in other years, the water quality is good and satisfactory everywhere.
The current situation is that the water quality in all 56 bathing areas has always been good and there are no swimming restrictions.
"For the last time, we will take the analyses at the end of August," says the senior environmental health specialist of the inspection, Normunds Kadi<0xC4><0xB7>is.
During heavy rainfall, waste left on land can be rinsed in water.
This, in turn, can affect its quality, says an environmental specialist.
The rotation of the Russian elite continues - change of leader in the Putin administration.
Do you own the craft?
Vladimir Putin told the Russian media that Sergey Ivanov wanted to leave this post himself and will continue to be the President's special representative on nature protection, ecology and transport.
In announcing the changes, Putin addressed Ivanov in a televised address: "Dear Sergei Borisovich, we have been working with you for many years and we are doing it successfully."
I am pleased with the way you are fulfilling the responsibilities entrusted to you.
I remember very well our agreement not to use you in this presidential administration for more than four years.
Therefore, I understand your desire to change the field of activity.
And I hope that in your new position you will also make full use of your knowledge and experience.
However, it is noted that the leadership of the presidential administration is a very important position and this made Ivanova one of the most influential people in the country.
In view of the upcoming State Duma elections in Russia next month, rumors have surfaced that this step is related to the struggle for power in the Russian political elite.
Ivanov was also called the possible replacement of Putin in the presidential office, so the claim that he himself wanted to take the post of the presidential representative on natural protection and transport issues has raised doubts.
As the Lsm.lv archives show, Ivanovs is the General Colonel of the VDK and the Federal Security Service.
Ivanov has been an old and close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
He started his career in the special services in 1975, where he met Putin.
Later, when Putin became the head of the Federal Security Service, Ivanov became his deputy.
In turn, the first Russian President Boris Yeltsin was appointed secretary of the Russian Security Council at the end of his reign.
In 2000, after Putin came to power, Ivanov's "Doctrine of Information Security" was approved, which included the revival of the mechanisms of state censorship in Russia.
In 2001 Sergey Ivanov became Minister of Defense of Russia, but already in 2005 - as Deputy Prime Minister Mikhail Fradkov and was responsible for the development of Russian defense industry companies and arms exports.
Now, after the resignation of the head of the presidential administration, Ivanov will also retain a seat in the Russian National Security Council, where the new head of the presidential administration, Vaino, will also work.
The guilt comes from the family of the Soviet party in the elite.
The position of the head of the Presidential Administration of Ukraine is recommended by Ivanov himself.
Anton Eduardovich and I have known each other for a long time.
Since the time that we were in government under your leadership.
And for the last nearly five years, we have been communicating practically every day.
"Therefore, I am convinced that, according to all the professional and personal characteristics, he is ready for this work," Ivanov said.
The guilt comes from a family that belonged to the Soviet party elite.
Her grandfather, Karl, took up senior positions in the Estonian Communist Party, including ten years until 1988 when he was its first secretary.
The Internet edition "Meduza" with reference to the book "Estonia's self-determination and independence" writes that at the end of the 80's Karls Vaino had asked Moscow to allow the use of force against the participants of the demonstrations.
However, he received a refusal and soon lost his post.
Shortly thereafter, Vaino has moved to live in Moscow.
Anton Vaino is a graduate of the Moscow Institute of International Relations and speaks Japanese.
However, he has left the diplomatic service to work in the administration of the President's Protocol.
It has already been reported that the latter have been shocked by the detention and even arrest of several high-ranking officials in Russia, including the replacement of governors and federal representatives of several districts.
As political scientists point out, President Vladimir Putin is reshaping the ruling elite before the upcoming elections in 2018.
One of the main features - increasingly at the leading positions become representatives of power structures.
It is also important to note that there is no such thing as a “smart” or “smart” car.
This was a fight in the first round, and the Latvian Judo wrestlers have finished their participation in the Olympic Games, finishing in 17th place.
If you want to be able to make a difference in your life, then you need to be able to make a difference in your life.
He also found out that Judo wrestler had a shoulder injury in the fight.
Markingly, in order to reach the Olympic road mark, Nikiforenko had to start in a different weight category than usual - namely, in the weight category of up to 100 kilograms.
The Azerbaijani wrestling was 25 kilograms heavier.
It has already been reported that Yevgeny Borodavko held up for two-and-a-half minutes in a 100-kilogram fight against Rjunosuki, until the opponent managed a clean victory worth a shot.
This is why the Latvian Judo competition in Rio has ended.
Dreams disappear in the sand of Rio.
What is the best way to get rid of the virus?
Yes, he had a more titled opponent against him, but the ambitious are sometimes able to bring a surprise.
He didn't make it.
For Artur Nikiforenko, the task was even more difficult, because the experience is less and the opponent is also respectable.
The result is similar, although he stayed on the tatami for a minute and a half longer than Borodavko.
Unfortunately, lately, it is the Latvian Jews who lack the most ambition.
Since the federation's leadership, Gun<0xC4><0x81>rs K<0xC4><0xAB>rsons and his financial stud Vladimir <0xC5><0xA0>estakov, Aleksandrs Jackevi<0xC4><0x8D>s left Latvia, there is no longer a "Golden Score", - judo development is going down the downward curve.
Jackevi<0xC4><0x8D>, who advises the Kazakh Jews here, and Vsevold Zeloni do not see the heirs.
But if it doesn’t grow, it won’t.
And that is the prerogative of the federation.
Therefore, as from another galaxy, "Morning Panoramic" sounded the promise of the President of the Latvian Judo Federation, Rio, to win medals.
Flight far from reality.
In the evening we waited with impatience and anxiety for the beach volleyball match Samoilovs/<0xC5><0xA0>m<0xC4><0x93>di<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1> - Evandru/Pedru Solbergs.
Intrigue as already in the group of "death" - the losers of the game is over.
The Latvian duo had a slight departure - could also lose, but not more than four points in two sets.
The tension was further increased in the length of the previous game.
No one wanted to die - this feeling floated over the wind card throughout the game.
For the players, the blazing wind created additional difficulties.
In the beginning, it seemed that this could be our - which is most comprehensive - ally.
But it didn't.
It was quite simple to play against the Latvian duo here.
Serve so on Samoylov and wait for him to break.
In the case of a non-compliance with the provisions of this Directive, the Commission shall take into account the fact that the conditions laid down in this Directive are fulfilled.
The smuggler was able to fish at that time, because there was little work, but when there was, he succeeded in honoring it.
In the case of a non-compliance with the provisions of this Article, the Member State concerned shall ensure that the competent authority of the Member State concerned is notified of the application of the provisions of this Article.
But it was also possible to lose by 0-2, because the deficit in the second set was -4, but also thanks to the wind, managed to win.
The third one was already in the Evandra service sign.
A chain was formed - a service unconvincingly received, the second pass often flies too close to the network and Samoil remained very few options for a successful attack.
If against the Cubans there was a foreign Samoilov in the field, then this time he acted more successfully, and only to bring the loss to the Saxons would be unprofessional.
Craill also made a mistake, and quite symbolically, it was he who hit the last ball in the block.
The team loses.
This time, too, there was definitely a lack of success: in the third set, only two Evander attacks almost flew out of the map, but the ball hit the line.
Two lanes were next to the line.
Also, the contentious episodes of the video decided in favor of the opponents.
In the first two games, Evandro struggled with the servos, then they were very productive against us.
All summed up the loss on the table.
Now it is necessary to calmly analyze the causes of failure.
Perhaps it was necessary for many to live next to the stadium, rather than with the delegation in the Olympic village.
The journey lasted two and a half hours.
Perhaps a bit of self-confidence was given by the seven semi-final series.
Perhaps Cluj-Napoca should not have played, but sooner to come here and better acclimatize.
Maybe there was a problem with finding the top of a sporty shape.
So far, more questions than answers.
The game is over for our beats.
The dream of medals is over.
What's next?
There are still some World Cup tournaments and also Jurmala "Masters".
You will never have friends in your life with Samoil, and you will never have, because there are too many different personalities.
But it is also not necessary.
When the dream of the Olympic medals is shattered, the idea of divorce can also arise, because guilt will be sought not only in himself, but also in the partner.
Deciding is not difficult, but it will be much harder in Latvia to find a worthy partner.
Both brothers play the bully, but John and Tom have already tried and also split up, while Mikhail Samailov is still too green to start conquering the tops of the world.
You can try Harald Reggae, Alexander Solovey, Edgar Toch, to return to M<0xC4><0x81>rtins P<0xC4><0x81>vi<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1>, but it will not be better than this option, which has proven itself not only once in the World Cup stages.
The Kopakabana sand did not make them smile this time.
A certain one.
Of course, it should also be taken into account that beach volleyball is becoming more popular, new pairs are entering the circuit, and only the rare height is less than two meters.
This is not yet a guarantee of success, but it is an essential argument in the fight for victory.
We don't have any longer.
Both athletes and journalists have the opportunity to stay in the venues offered by the organizers of the games, as well as to choose their own.
The US basketball team lives on a cruise ship, some tennis players do not stay in the Olympic Village.
Likewise, some beach volleyball players have found a hotel in Kopakaban.
This time, very exaggerated prices were demanded for the journalists who offered the most modest accommodations.
Therefore, the choice also fell on the apartment for rent.
The risk is, because sometimes they can be uncomfortable from a logistical point of view.
This time the risk is justified.
Together with Vladimir Vladimirovich, we rent apartments on the Kopakabana and Ipanema borders.
Beach 200 meters away, whistle arena half an hour's walk.
The area is quite safe because of the favelas, but you should not lose your vigilance here too.
Vladimir Vladimirovich, however, is not what some immediately imagine, but the most professional sports journalist in the Russian media Vladimir Ivanov.
P.S. It seems that another medal dream was dreamt on Friday morning.
In the 100 meters barrier race and high jump Laura Ikaunniece-Admidi<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1> lagged behind her personal records.
But there are still five disciplines.
After a 10-year break, "Porgijs and Besa" sounds in Liepaja.
In Latvia, the opera "Porgijs and Besa" was first performed in 1973 at the Latvian National Opera.
Since then, the internationally recognized masterpiece has not been re-established.
That is why the organizers of the Cesus Art Festival and Liep<0xC4><0x81>ja Art Forum have decided in close cooperation to give the audience the opportunity to enjoy George Gershwin’s gray.
"We are delighted that after a decade break, when Liep<0xC4><0x81>ja was able to enjoy the opera performance for the last time, this excellent version of George Gershwin's opera "Porgy and Besa" concert studio can be enjoyed with us in the new, newly opened concert hall "Big Amber".
The opera "Porgijs en Besa" is a story about love, its instability, its passion, as well as the tragedies of everyday life and simple pleasures.
It reflects African-American vitality, music and rhythm.
It is this lack of political correctness in this opera, this exclusion of tolerance that makes it so alive.
"And yes, this love story is extremely powerful, extremely beautiful and in some way really deep," says director Viesturs Kairi<0xC5><0xA1>s.
What I like most - listening or playing this opera, there are always such stops - famous tunes, famous motifs, but these transitions from one character to another, highlighting one character or another character, or choir, or orchestra.
"It is the most exciting, this building", the opera is appreciated by the musical director and conductor of the opera "Porgijs and Besa" concert studio Andris Poga.
Visitors to the opera agree that this is a grand event.
They are delighted to hear the world famous opera Gershwin.
You can feel the breath of the world in Liepaja.
"Performance professional", the opera is appreciated by the visitor Edgars Lamas.
The concert study was special in that the orchestra played for the first time in the orchestra pit in the newly opened concert hall "Great Amber" and the opera concert performance took place for the first time.
The area near the Art Museum’s renovated building could be named after Jan Rosentall.
In the opening of the exhibition, Riga Deputy Mayor Andris Amerikis Rosent<0xC4><0x81>ls said that the museum’s own address in the future could not be Kri<0xC5><0xA1>j<0xC4><0x81>nas Valdem<0xC4><0x81>ras street 10a, but Janas Rosent<0xC4><0x81>ls square 1.
The Director of the Museum M<0xC4><0x81>ra L<0xC4><0x81>ce acknowledged that the re-registration of the address will create a considerable bureaucratic burden, but in general this idea is welcomed and therefore accepted the proposal of the local government.
The city of Riga laid the foundation stone for this idea in 1936, when it created the monument to Janis Rosent<0xC4><0x81>l, who stands at the museum.
The director of the museum at the time, Wilhelm Purvitis, was one of the initiators of the construction of this monument.
In this way, this further action could be purely logical.
I am always a little bit heartbroken - but William the Dirty, where will we put his name?!
"But if you, Mr. America, promise to think," said the Bear.
It is reported that the National Museum of Art, after an ambitious reconstruction and modernization, officially opened its doors in May this year.
This week, the reconstruction of the VEF Cultural Palace will finally begin.
You will not be able to find the right person for you, but you will be able to find the right person for you.
It is planned to renovate several palace premises, including two spectator halls, as well as adapt the building to people with movement disorders.
The Riga dome intends to raise six million euros in European Union funds for the project, but Oleg Burovs, Director of the Property Department of the Riga dome, acknowledges that there is no complete clarity on European funds for the project.
"Despite the fact that the political will to start the renovation of the VEF Cultural Palace, attracting the European Structural Funds, there is, we wait for months for a decision, real action from the officials of the Ministry of Finance, will its money be allocated or not," says Burovs.
Last December, we were told that everything depends on Brussels.
Two weeks ago, the Ministry of Finance received a letter from the European Commission stating that you should decide for yourself that Brussels is not taking a decision here.
We are now seeing another round of discussions taking place, so let’s see what we can expect in the coming days.
"It should be said that the Riga House without a doubt guarantees that this process will be started and completed within the deadlines," says Burovs.
It has already been reported that more than a year ago, in March 2015, the VEF Culture Palace collectively held a farewell concert before the immediate, immediately pending renovation of the building.
Although a year has passed, the renovation of the building had still not begun and collectively continued to work in inappropriate conditions.
In the strategy of the Riga House Property Department, the renovation of the VEF Cultural Palace is divided into seemingly independent sets of renovation works, each of which will ensure the implementation of different functions of the castle.
The first is to increase the accessibility of the VEF Cultural Palace and to improve the surrounding area.
It is intended to arrange the surroundings and engineering communications, as well as to restore the facade of the building.
Second - VEF Improvement of the offer of Cultural Palace services.
It plans to improve the interior of the building, the restoration of walls and ceilings, the stage and sound recording studio, as well as arrange the internal engineering communications of the building.
Third - Improving the working conditions of creative amateur collectives, which includes plans to improve workshop equipment, space heating and ventilation systems.
Before the 40th anniversary of "L<0xC4><0xAB>vu", the legendary rock band can be seen at the exhibition in Liep<0xC4><0x81>ja.
The exhibition will examine various objects describing "Livs" - photographs, which are arranged in a timeline to reflect the group's activity from the beginning until 2010, when the group's activity is announced.
The participants’ stage costumes, musical instruments, awards and concert recordings will also be shown, as well as other unseen things to the wider audience, reflecting the creative activity of the group "Live".
The exhibition will be supplemented with objects from the Liepaja Museum.
The visual design of the exhibition becomes in cooperation with the fashion artist and painter Elita Patmalnieci.
You will be able to find the best way to get rid of the virus, but you will not be able to find the best way to get rid of the virus.
"L<0xC4><0xAB>vus" originated in 1972, when a vocal instrumental ensemble, led by Juris Pav<0xC4><0xAB>tols, was created in the Liepaja Culture House.
In its original composition, the ensemble participated in the festival "Liep<0xC4><0x81>jas dintars" in 1972 and 1974, as well as in the sights of the city and the republic.
In 1976, a fateful meeting took place when Juris Pav<0xC4><0xAB>tols got to know <0xC3><0x86>rikus Zigeli and founded a group at the Metallurgical Culture Palace, inviting Ingrid G<0xC5><0xAB>tmani, Andri Kruzi<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1> and J<0xC4><0x81>ni Groduma to join.
Over the years, the composition of the group has grown more than once.
The participants have joined, others have gone their way, some have returned.
However, the most important thing - the desire to prove that Latvian rock music is able to live and exist - has remained unchanged.
"What to see was not missing - jeans, hairy and bearded, these boys were noticeably different from the stereotype of the universally accepted singer of the show," says Klaus Wavere, a music observer for the group.
In addition to the above-mentioned musicians, excellent musicians such as Igo, Vilnis Kriev<0xC4><0xAB><0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1>, Modris <0xC5><0xA0>terns, Valdis <0xC5><0xA0>tarks, Laimis R<0xC4><0x81>cen<0xC4><0x81>js, T<0xC4><0x81>lis Pusbarnieks, Ainars Virga, Aivars Brize, Guntars Mucenieks, Dainis Virga, Tomas Kleins and others have worked in the group.
Entrance to the exhibition free of charge.
The exhibition is open from August 19th to October 30th.
In turn, on August 27, the 40th anniversary celebration of the group "L<0xC4><0xAB>vi" "L<0xC4><0xAB>VIfest 2" will take place in the Liepaja concert garden "P<0xC5><0xAB>t, windi<0xC5><0x86>i".

Zbigniew Stankewicz: Time is coming, and the truth is coming.
Zbigniew Stankevich, the archbishop of the Catholic Church of Latvia, emphasizes in an interview with the Independent that if we want to gain strength in life, the Gospel message must be at the center of it.
For the power of truth is greater than the power of evil.
Many are already on their way to the celebration of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Aglon.
What message will believers receive there this year?
In recent years, the desire to lead the main service in Aglon has been expressed by the nuncio of the Pope.
Therefore, the content of the main message is up to him.
It is also a tradition that the way of the Cross is guided by the bishop J<0xC4><0x81>nis Bullis.
He will make his own message.
I was in charge of the Vigil service the day before.
Last year, I focused on Pope Francis' encyclical "Laudato si" and updated the common house in it, the Earth theme in the context of Latvia.
This year... Of course, I'm watching what's happening in the world, and I'm trying to react to it in my speech.
My approach coincides with what the church recommends that the message of the Gospel should be placed at the center of life.
It must be shown that the Gospel responds to the most painful problems of a person’s life and inspires him on his further journey.
Then it speaks to people.
But in C<0xC4><0x93>sis, in the Lampa debate, you said that 'you have to return to the understanding of the full man'.
What do you understand by that?
Does this mean that a person turns away from the message of the church?
And does the church today have a resource for such a return?
In the Indian capital, a man dies on the side of the road.
In the Indian capital, no one has heard or heard of a man dying on the side of the road - it turns out that he has spent an hour on the side of the road and then still robbed, reports the BBC.
It is reported that the man, identified as Matibul, traveled with a rickshaw during the day, but worked as a guard at night.
Matthew 5:30 in the morning went home on the road when he was driven by a car.
The surveillance footage shows that the driver got out of the car to look at the victim and then left.
After an hour, when no one knew about the bleeding man, he was robbed by a worm.
About 90 minutes after the crash, police arrived at the scene and the victim was taken to the hospital, where he died from injuries.
When referring to his candidacy for the post of Director General of the State Revenue Service (VID), the head of the State Environment Service, Inga Kolegova, rescued the government from the fall, according to Oj<0xC4><0x81>rs Skudra, associate professor of the Faculty of Social Sciences of the University of Latvia.
Kolegova's explanation of the withdrawal of the candidacy in connection with the conflicts in the ruling coalition is due to the fact that she prevented the fall of the government.
In a press conference with LETA, he said that it is difficult for him to imagine that next week at the government meeting "Unity" would support the candidacy of Kolegova.
Therefore, if the Ministers of Unity voted against, but confirmed Kolegova in office, this would lead to the resignation of the government.
The expert also believes that before the announcement of the withdrawal of the candidacy, Kolegova has consulted both Finance Minister Danu Reiznieci-Ozolu and Prime Minister M<0xC4><0x81>ri Ku<0xC4><0x8D>inski.
At the same time, it is also a concession to "Unity", which strongly opposed her candidacy.
When predicting whether he would be able to find a suitable candidate with the help of the competition, Skudra acknowledged that there are two options - either a compromise figure will be selected or the institution will continue to lead Dace Grey as the CEO.
At the same time, he points out that if the Finance Minister has so far claimed that no other candidate is being considered, it is an indication to Greykaya that she should not participate in the competition.
LETA has already announced that the head of the State Environment Service, Kolegova, has decided to withdraw his candidacy for the post of Director General of the VID.
You will be able to find out more about the benefits of this product, and you will be able to find out more about the benefits of this product.
After the government’s decision to postpone the decision, Kolegova confirmed that she is still ready to become the head of the VID.
However, it was later changed - in a Friday submission to Finance Minister Dana Reizniec-Ozola she points out that she is withdrawing her consent to be transferred to the post of head of the HIV/AIDS and this is not an easy choice for her.
Andrei Vaivars, press secretary of the Prime Minister M<0xC4><0x81>ra Ku<0xC4><0x8D>inska, explained to LETA that a new competition will be held for the vacant post of Director General of VID.
In the center of Riga there was an accident involving a police car.
In the center of Riga this afternoon there was a road accident involving a car of the State Police.
The police car with the sound and light signals turned on rushed to the highest category call, until Kri<0xC5><0xA1>j<0xC4><0x81>ns Baron and Dzirnava Street collided with another car.
The police explain the circumstances of the incident, but the initial information suggests that the second suspect did not miss the police car.
There was a woman in the accident.
This year, the population in Riga has shrunk
At the beginning of this year in Riga there were 638 784 inhabitants, which is 0.34% less than in 2015, when the capital was officially registered 641 000 inhabitants, the agency LETA was informed by the Central Statistical Office (CSP).
In terms of population, the capital of Latvia ranks 30th between the capitals of the European Union (EU) countries and large cities, where the population exceeds one million.
According to the data of the EU statistical office "Eurostat", Riga has the highest proportion of women - Latvia's capital is convincingly in the first place among the largest cities in Europe with 127 women per 100 men.
All three Baltic capitals have the highest proportion of women in the largest cities in Europe: in Vilnius there are 123, while in Tallinn there are 121 women per 100 men.
At the LNMM will be placed warning pictograms.
In the coming days, warning signs - pictograms will be placed at the Latvian National Museum of Art (LNMM), the representative of the Property Department of Riga House Baiba Gail<0xC4><0xAB>te told LETA.
The repair of the damage to the museum’s glassed rapidium caused by the activity of skateboarders has now been successfully completed.
In the coming days, there will be a warning icon next to it.
It will tell the people that the cover tends to be slippery during rain and snow, it should not be moved by cars, as well as riding bicycles, skateboards and skateboards.
In addition, the Commission has adopted a proposal for a Council Directive on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the European Parliament and the Council on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data by the European Parliament and the Council on the protection of personal data.
Holidays for children and parents- New children's playgrounds have been set up in Riga.
This summer, the Riga Municipality has set up two more new playgrounds in the city, <0xC4><0xB6><0xC4><0xAB>psala and <0xC4><0x8C>iekurkalns, which are already available for children.
A large, multifunctional toy boat with various climbing elements, bridges, games, trumpets and slides is installed on the beach of Kipsala.
The playground is designed for children of all ages.
The area is also equipped with swings and various balancing elements.
The location of the attraction on the shore of the Daugava with a view of the passenger port and the cruise ships there is perfect for small sailors.
In turn, in the playground between <0xC4><0x8C>ekurkalns 4th and 5th cross-lines there is a playhouse, a trampoline, a step track, a balance bridge, swings, toy balls and other elements of the game, as well as a gym area with circles for strength and coordination exercises, accompaniments, etc.
Under the surface inserted rubber cover in different colors.
A new, colourful pavement has been laid on the street side of the playground.
The reconstructed section of the road has been discovered in Medjugorje.
The Minister of Transport Uldis Augulis, the management of VAS Latvian State Roads (LVC), as well as the constructors of SIA "Binders" and representatives of local governments today unveiled the reconstructed state main road border of Russia (Grebneva) -R<0xC4><0x93>zekne-Daugavpils-Lithuanian border.
Roads are a national business card, especially border roads, so it is a special pleasure to discover a reconstructed section on the border with our southern neighbors.
This is another example of how the co-financing of European Union funds is improving the situation on the national main roads.
"As the forecasts show, the funds available for roads during this planning period will be acquired as early as 2018, and we need to think about how to continue to maintain the most congested roads in very good quality, and also to ensure the mobility of citizens in all regions of Latvia without European Union funding", the symbolic ribbon highlighted.
The Minister of Transport also pointed out that proposals prepared by traffic experts on sustainable financing of Latvian roads in the near future will be presented to the government.
Construction works in the period from Medjugorje to the Lithuanian border (156.4.-163.05. km) SIA Binders started last year and this year they continued after a technological break.
The cost of reconstruction is EUR 13.5 million (including VAT), the project was co-financed by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF).
"In the reconstructed road section, the road construction has been completely restored and next year the repairs will be started in the next phase from Medjugorje to Daugavpils itself, thus the entire road from the Lithuanian border to Daugavpils will be arranged," said J<0xC4><0x81>nis Lange, Chairman of the Board of LVC.
The main roads of the country are the most congested, and by 2018 we plan to make sure that all the main roads of the country are in good condition.
The next task will be to keep them in good quality, ensuring periodic maintenance and replacing the pavement every 7-9 years.
"This will, of course, require adequate funding, and all travelers look forward to the proposals developed by the expert group for the arrangement of the road financing system," Lange said.
Within the framework of the project, road connections and lighting in the Medumu center are arranged.
Significant earthworks were carried out: large-scale refurbishment in four stages and large-scale landslide and landslide works, smoothed road length profile, which until now was very uneven.
Public transport stops have also been restored and a newly constructed turning point for public transport has been rebuilt.
Previously, the road had insufficient load-bearing capacity and the surrounding terrain was not transparent due to the mountainous valleys, as well as the old road common terrain.
In the next construction season, it is planned to restore the road section from the border of Daugavpils city to the reconstructed section (144,80-156,40 km).
This year, LVC plans to carry out various types of work on more than 1100 kilometers of national roads.
Information about all planned repairs in the national road network is available on the LVC website www.lvceli.lv.
"In order to achieve the desired weight loss results, it is very important to choose the right combination of foods," admits Lithuanian dietician Laura Romeraite-Kuklieriere.
In addition, it is easy to do during the summer period, when fresh fruits, berries and vegetables grow in our own gardens.
Combining thoughtful nutritional products can help not only reduce excess weight, but also purposefully promote various processes in the body.
Pasta and vinegar are a successful combination, as they provide a long-lasting feeling of satiety and help fight fat.
Studies published in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition have shown that vinegar has a beneficial effect on blood glucose levels and helps us to feel drowsy.
Cayenne pepper and protein-rich foods, such as poultry meat or protein cocktail, not only create a feeling of satiety, but also reduce cravings for large meals in subsequent meals.
This combination of foods can also increase the amount of calories burned after a meal by up to 35%.
Studies show that Cayenne pepper can help get rid of the fat deposits in the belly area.
The egg contains a nutrient that promotes metabolism - choline, while pepper is a good source of vitamin C.
Taking sufficient amounts of this nutrient can reduce cortisol levels, thus also the accumulation of fat around the middle part of the body.
Oatmeal, which is served with fresh berries, is another delicious and fat-burning breakfast meal that is worth adding to your menu.
Oat flakes and berries contain fiber, which, according to Canadian scientists, controls the sensation of hunger in ghrelin, an appetite-stimulating hormone.
In addition, the berries contain polyphenols, which are helpful in weight loss, as well as prevent the formation of fat.
Vegetables and proteins also have the ability to perform miracles in weight reduction.
Such a combination is capable of creating a feeling of satiety.
Vegetables contain water and fiber, so they contribute to the feeling of satiety.
At the same time, proteins slow down the digestion process and provide a feeling of satiety for a longer time.
At lunch, you can eat chicken with salads or cook a protein cocktail from the ready-made mixture and enjoy it together with your favorite vegetables.
What combinations of products to avoid.
The fruit contains sugars - monosaccharides or disaccharides - compounds of one or two molecules.
On the other hand, starch in vegetables is polysaccharide.
The fruits break down in the stomach mechanically, while chemically they do not break down until they reach the third or fourth stage in the digestive process that takes place in the intestines.
The starch is divided into three different stages, starting already in the mouth.
Therefore, it is essential not to eat a sweet meal immediately after a meal.
When eating a sweet dish immediately after a meal, it is "imprisoned" in the stomach along with other dishes, where it is not chemically digested and begins to bloat.
Do not eat bread, potatoes, peas, bananas, dates or other carbohydrate-containing products along with lemons, salt, oranges, grapefruits, pineapples or other acidic fruits.
The enzyme ptialin, found in saliva, only works in an alkaline environment.
Fruit acid not only inhibits the digestion of carbohydrates, but also promotes their fermentation.
Do not eat eggs and meat, nuts and meat, cheese and eggs or cheese and nuts, meat and milk, eggs and milk or nuts and milk and protein-rich combinations of products at one time.
For their processing, different digestive juices are needed, each of them with different strengths, features and time to get into the stomach.
Watermelon, melon, nutmeg and other melons should always be eaten separately from other dishes.
Melons are not digested if they are in the stomach along with other foods.
Fats in combination with protein-rich products.
Fat forms a successful combination with starch, but the same cannot be said of fats and proteins - fats inhibit the digestion of proteins.
Protein can be combined with a very small amount of fat.
When consuming a large amount of protein-containing products, avoid using fat altogether.
This also applies to freshening - it is not recommended to combine a large amount of nuts (containing protein) with whole avocados (containing fat).
Such a combination inhibits effective weight loss.
How better to cook?
"Cooking, heat treatment causes a significant loss of nutrients - about 15% to 55% of the original nutrient composition of the products," notes the dietitian.
In most cases, nutrients are lost by boiling food in water.
However, the value of certain food nutrients increases by directly boiling.
After boiling vegetables, it is recommended to use the remaining liquid for the preparation of soups - in this case, you will not lose the nutrients left in the water, and you will be able to eat them later.
It is recommended to cook vegetables, even by steaming them.
Thermal treatment significantly increases the bioavailability of the lycopene in the composition of tomatoes.
When tomatoes are boiled for 30 minutes, the amount of lycopene increases by 25%.
Thermal treatment also significantly increases the bioavailability of beta-carotene found in red, yellow, orange plants such as tomatoes, carrots, sweet potatoes and spinach.
Thermal treatment of eggs and meat deprives them of the natural properties of the proteins in them, making them easier to digest.
Likewise, the heat treatment of meat and eggs makes the iron and other minerals contained in these products more easily absorbed by the body.
It should also be borne in mind that the freezing of products can reduce the amount of vitamin C from 10% to up to 90%, however, the freezing of fiber does not affect.
Beans combined with tomatoes can increase iron intake in the body, which in turn provides better brain and muscle performance.
Our body absorbs up to 33% less non-bleeding iron found in plant products such as beans, leafy greens, cereal products than blood-forming iron found in animal products such as beef, fish and chicken.
You can significantly increase the absorption of non-bleeding iron in the body by eating non-bleeding iron-containing products together with vitamin C sources such as oranges, tomatoes and berries.
Vitamin C helps change non-blood-creating iron so that our body absorbs it more easily.
Iron is needed for the production of hemoglobin, which provides oxygen to the muscles and brain.
To get the most out of salads, add healthy fats to them, such as olive or flaxseed oil.
When preparing sandwiches with salmon, add vitamin D-rich salmon or sardines-free yogurt, which is a good source of calcium.
Vitamin D increases the amount of calcium absorbed in the intestine, and it plays an essential role in the process of bone formation.
Oats (as well as other whole grain products) together with sources of vitamin C, such as strawberries, melons, raspberries and other fruits or berries, help stabilize cholesterol levels, as well as avoid blockage of arteries.
Snapchat "Anime" Effect Criticized for Asian Cartooning
Snapchat representatives say that this filter is inspired by animation, but some commentators claim that it is racistly insensitive.
With this lens effect, Snapchat allows 150 million users to change reality in a completely absurd way every day and play with their identity.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog or an image that fits into a painting by Roja Liechtenstein.
The lenses are misty, image-distorting tools that generate more than 30 million modified selfies a day.
Any mistakes quickly become publicly noticeable.
Snapchat lens effects have already been criticized in the past, receiving rebuttals that the app promotes too blackened or light facial skin tones as an ideal beauty benchmark.
This week, new lens effects have been published that allow users to form delicate eyes, delicate teeth and round cheeks, and some critics have called it a racist Asian cartoon – “yellow cheeks”.
The question was also asked whether such contradictions do not indicate that the company has greater problems with diversity.
News and public denial erupted on Wednesday, when The Verge and Motherboard announced that the lens effects had been removed from the app.
The company explained that the goal of the lens is to depict anime images, not to caricature people of Asian origin.
But for people who have experienced racism, these effects were reminiscent of painful stereotypes.
Others categorically denied the resemblance to Anime.
Korean-born American art student Grace Sparapani's Twitter post on the images gained wide resonance. In an email she points out that the lens effects are "excusable and inconvenient, not to mention more".
She added that it is difficult to ignore the obvious similarity between Asian cartoons and lens effects.
This indicates that the lens effect is not simply a yellow face, but a yellow face in the sense of racism.
Snapchat is not the only company that has fallen into these cultural traps.
American culture is also involved in the endless struggle for diversity and inclusion, ranging from corporate meeting rooms to Hollywood and the devices we use on a daily basis.
And Snapchat’s large audience of young people representing different races, unlike the older population, is more sensitive to such things.
If Snapchat lenses create an image that offends users, then "today such things do not go unnoticed", 25-year-old Katie Zhou said in an interview on Thursday.
On Thursday, Zhou, product manager at Medium, deleted her Snapchat app and recommended others to do the same.
In her article "Medium" and in a telephone interview, she explained that in her opinion, race-related problems arise due to Snapchat's employment policy, which does not sufficiently support racial diversity.
Zhou criticized the management of the company, which consists mainly of white men, and then concluded his article with a reference to #DeleteSnapchat.
"This means that there is no racial diversity in the company, so such decisions are allowed. Whether the company employs some representatives of other races, but they do not occupy such a position as to be able to express their opinion safely and comfortably," says Zhou, an American of Chinese origin.
Others agree with her opinion, while Snapchat has not responded to her complaint.
The company does not disclose how many employees are represented by different races, indicating that it is a private company.
Snapchat declined to discuss the origin of its employees, but its representative revealed that the company has hired a personnel specialist who will focus on the company's representation of racial minorities that are not widely represented and will contribute to the company's membership.
Zhou, in turn, will not update his Snapchat account, adding: "It's interesting whether they really need more users like us to understand that it's not right."
The Congressional Chamber declares that military officials have misrepresented reports about the Islamic State.
In a statement issued on Thursday, the House of Representatives noted that representatives of the US Central Command had misrepresented the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria with far more optimism than it actually is.
Central Command intelligence analysts expressed general dissatisfaction with the interim report of the task force set up by the Republican representatives of the Armed Forces Committee, the Intelligence Committee and the Defense Finance Subcommittee, indicating that their leadership had been monitoring reports of American achievements in the fight against Islam.
The Central Command, known as Centcom, is a military base in Tampa, Florida, that oversees US military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
The latest news on this report says that intelligence reports, confirmed by high-ranking Centcom leaders, reflect the U.S. fight against terrorism more positively than it actually is. The facts have been regularly misrepresented, depicting better achievements than other intelligence analysis suggests.
California Republican Representative Ken Calvert says: "Centcom action is unacceptable - our soldiers are the ones who suffer when our policymakers receive false reports."
Centcom management errors are found in the top management of the organization.
This 10-page report details the existing problems in the Central Command’s reflection and analysis of American efforts to prepare Iraqi forces in 2014 and 2015.
While this does not provide conclusive evidence that senior officials in the Obama administration have been allowed to distort reports, it does indicate that the Centcom leadership has put some pressure on analysts to portray a more optimistic view of the Islamic State (also known as ISIS or ISIS).
The report notes that in the first half of 2015, the Central Administration press releases, statements and reports to Congress presented the situation in a much more positive light than it actually was.
For example, Centcom representatives publicly announced that the recovery operation in Mosul could start as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul is the second largest city in Iraq, still under the control of the Islamic State.
Kansas Republican Party spokesman Mike Pompeo said in a report: "A months-long investigation clearly demonstrates this."
Between mid-2014 and mid-2015, US Central Administration chiefs distorted the reports, describing the threats of ISIS in Iraq as weaker than they actually were.
The Republican Party set up a working group, finding that analysts are concerned that information about the Islamic State is being misrepresented.
As the investigation continues, the report published on Thursday will be followed by new findings in this case.
The General Inspectorate of the Ministry of Defence conducts an investigation into the activities of the Centcom Intelligence Service.
Members of the Democratic Party's Intelligence Management Committee published their own report on Thursday, in which they agree with some of the findings of the Republican Party's working group.
In his report, Democratic Representative Adams B. Shifs said Centcom had too limited the preparation of intelligence assessment reports in relation to ISIS and the Iraqi Security Forces between 2014 and 2015.
Mr. Shifa explains that this process "stopped the dissemination of information", worsened the work ethic of analysts and "spread facts that are not true."
But Shif and members of the Democratic Party added that there was no evidence that the White House had put pressure on Centcom analysts to produce reports in accordance with "predetermined or political stances".
The Daily Beast published the preliminary results of a congressional inquiry on Thursday.
In August, The New York Times reported that the Pentagon’s Inspectorate General had opened an investigation into Centcom analysts’ complaints.
Pentagon spokesman Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans said the Pentagon would not comment on the congressional report until further investigation.
He also added that experts sometimes interpret complex data in different ways, and the Ministry of Defence and the Intelligence Administration are calling for a constructive dialogue on vital national security issues.
The investigation is not limited to whether the U.S.-led bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria is successful (a claim made by an increasing number of representatives of the Ministry of Defence).
But last year's accusations cast doubt on whether President Obama can fully rely on reports from the Central Administration on military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan and other hotspots.
Criticism of Islamic State intelligence resembled more than a decade-old events when Centcom intelligence analyst Gregory Hughers published a study claiming that the George W. Bush administration launched the Afghan War, thinking too little about its possible consequences.
Hooker also played an important role in revealing the Islamic State intelligence issue.
Last year, officials reported that Huckabee's team found that, contrary to public reports, airstrikes at Islamic State oil plants did not significantly worsen the financial situation of the terrorist group, as they had built a temporary mill on the market.
The September issue of The Times reported that this discovery did not come outside the walls of the Central Administration.
At that time, the commander of the Centcom, General Lloyd Austin III, received harsh criticism because many lawmakers believed that war reports described the situation too positively.
In April, General Austin retired and was replaced by General Joseph L. Votel.
In the US, in a duel with Britain in women's field hockey, the US wins, thus winning the fourth consecutive victory.
A day after the victory over Japan with a score of 6:1, on Thursday, Cathie Bama won the first two goals for the U.S. women's field hockey team, when the Americans built the Indian team with a score of 3:0.
Five goals in two games is an unforgettable achievement, but 27-year-old Bama said she couldn’t remember if she’d ever succeeded.
She said, "I don't know."
I’m not one of those people who counts their scores.
But she knows that the Americans score at the Olympics is 4:0, which gives them in their group an undefeated with Britain, which remained undefeated on Thursday after a 2-0 victory over Japan.
The United Kingdom and the United States will meet on Saturday to play the last match of the first round.
In the event of a breach of this Regulation, the Commission shall, in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 4(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013, submit a report to the European Parliament and to the Council on the implementation of the Union's common programme for research and technological development.
The winner of the first place will avoid meeting with the strong selection of the Netherlands, which is the leader of the second group for a little longer.
While Saturday’s game will not continue, American women have already evoked a surprise storm, taking the last place among 12 teams in London four years ago.
This team also included Bama.
She grew up in Bluebell, took the field hockey stick in her hands for the first time at the age of 3 (her older twin sisters were already engaged in this sport in Drexel) and joined the national selection when she was 16 years old, becoming the youngest in the selection game.
She did not go to the 2008 Olympics because she did not enter the final.
But 2012 was an unsuccessful year for her and her team.
The following year, the Englishman Craig Parhams was appointed as the random trainer and everything changed for the better.
Bama called it "cultural, mental, and physical changes."
We have not invested as much work in London as we do now.
We have completely changed everything.
Thursday's game Bama opened the score, scoring goals in the first half with a backstroke from close distance.
India started the game without a win in their account, but their selection was very tough and kept a minimum score of 0:1 until the end of the third period, when Bama again won the goal.
She put the ball in the opponents' zone on the left side of the field, then noticed to get to the middle of the field and to throw the ball in the opponents' gates, placing the Americans 2:0.
In the middle of the fourth period, Melisa Gonzalesa scored another goal.
This was the first dry game of U.S. goalkeeper Jackie Briggs, scoring one goal in each of the first three games.
She's on her way in.
And so does Bama.
"We're doing very well right now," Pahams said, "but just how good, the game will show on Saturday.
The most depressing food of the depression period is "Satisfied meal"
In March 1933, shortly after his election as president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat in the oval room to hold a meal.
President Ruzvelts tasted fine culinary delicacies such as goose liver paste or fuagra and Maryland turtle soup.
But at the time, his meal was much more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and dessert - plum pudding.
Jane Ziegelmann says: "It's a way to show solidarity in cooking with people who've been very hard."
Her husband, Andrew Cow, adds: "It's also a message to Americans how they should eat."
A couple of the Brooklyn Heights district are food historians.
Kou’s last book, Vegetable Sauce, describes Chinese cuisine in America, while Ziegelmane’s book, 97 Apples, describes life through food rental in the lower east of Manhattan.
Their new joint work, The Satisfied Meal, to be published Tuesday by Harper, is a story about American food during the Great Depression.
Showing some solidarity in the culinary field, they held a reporter's lunch together at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a simple dining room located in the Flatiron district and operating since 1929 when the Great Depression began.
54-year-old Mrs. Ziegelmane ordered sandwiches with melted cheese and scrambled olives, while 57-year-old Kou ordered turkey, mashed potatoes and vegetable salads.
When a reporter ordered a fake rabbit, the couple admitted that his choice was very appropriate to the conversation about the Great Depression time food.
Mrs Ziegelmane said that the fake rabbit was very popular.
There was a peanut rabbit, a liver rabbit and a bean rabbit.
They were prepared from the basic ingredients and other ingredients that enriched the meal.
Imagine what it's like - eat as many peanuts as possible so that they are in place for lunch.
Mr. Kou was drowsy.
"It probably seemed that the belly was full of lead," he added.
In the pre-depression years, the American dining table resembled the Swedish table, especially in rural areas.
Women were preparing to eat for their husbands-workers and freshly prepared meals were served for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
During the First World War, it was the Americans themselves who sent food to the Europeans. The "smooth meal" describes how the Americans adapted to the conditions when America was suddenly no longer a land of abundance.
"At that time, food became the focus of the American people's daily attention," says Mr. Kou, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write specifically on this topic.
Equally important were the new budget diets: such unknown foods as the fake rabbit and stews became commonplace, stews were "a great way to use surpluses," Mrs. Ziegelmanes noted, as the cooks were able to hide the unattractive ingredients of the ground cream.
Fresh fruits were replaced by cheap dried fruits.
Meat, which for years had been the main ingredient of American meals, has now become an extremely rare luxury item.
At a time when the number of calories and nutritional value of food was more important than taste, new, yet unprecedented formations were born.
In an old cookbook, Mrs. Ziegelmane found a recipe for making peanut butter-filled onions.
Mr Kou adds: "This was not a popular lunch table supplement."
Mrs Ziegelman said: "It was surreal."
Peanut butter and roasted onion are incompatible.
Many homemade recipes applied to difficult times.
Household economists such as Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Household Economic Office from 1923 to 1943, set the country’s eating habits unprecedented either before or after the Great Depression.
By publishing articles and recipes in newspapers and magazines, they advised housewives to become "economists" and accept challenges such as turning pasta and carrot mix into a tasty meal.
"Satisfied Meal" is a slice of historical delicacies.
Particularly interesting is the evidence of the government's treatment of its hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's treatment of "let me eat cake".
Although he publicly told about his simple childhood and eating in Iowa, in fact he ate like the fine millionaire he had become.
Mr Kou says: "He liked European cuisine, like fish with cucumber sauce."
He ate in the almost gilded living room, wearing a lunch jacket.
He was completely detached from reality.
President Roosevelt would have made the same mistake if his wife, Eleanor, had not advised him to set an example with his eating habits.
The book tells that Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who did not teach cooking, so the White House became a place "where not only one of the most disgusting dishes in Washington was served, but also the worst cooked dishes".
As soon as the national economy recovered, most of the culinary signatures of the depression era disappeared.
But we continue to pay attention to calories and nutrition, as well as how to apply science in culinary, Mrs Ziegelmane added.
The couple relates that by writing the book, they gained a greater understanding of Mrs. Ziegelmann’s mother’s eating habits, such as why she was unable to throw food out.
"She was really afraid to throw food out," Mr. Kou said.
Mrs Ziegelman said: "She actually harassed people."
There was once an incident with wind cakes.
When we were eating in Eisenberg’s dining room, a couple of writers pulled a homemade dessert from the bag: a plum pudding that President Roosevelt used to eat at lunch.
"This is plum foaming," said Mrs Ziegelmane, adding that it was a common habit at the time to give modest foods a chic name.
It does not contain foam, only dried plums, a little flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone impatiently soaked spoons in the brown mass found on the plates.
Surprisingly, it wasn’t that bad.
Mr. Kou has added a few more cumos.
Sounding like an experienced "economist," he said to his wife, "I'd like a piece of hazelnut crushed."
Gilead will receive reimbursement for legal expenses in the fight with Merck for the Hepatitis C patent
A district judge has ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc. is entitled to a reimbursement for the legal services it paid in the case of infringement of the Hepatitis C patent against the pharmaceutical company Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was acquitted in a <0xC2><0xA3>200 million fine for breaking two Merck patents that threatened it in connection with the successful Sovaldi and Harvoni tablets when a U.S. federal judge found violations in Merk's activities, such as lying after swearing in and other harmless actions.
At the trial on Thursday, U.S. District Judge Bets Labsons Frymens pointed out that Gilead is entitled to claim compensation for legal expenses incurred in defending it in the case.
Merck is trying to gain market position against Gilead, which dominates the market with the new generation of Hepatitis C drugs, which are effective in 90% of cases of liver disease.
The case was initiated in 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other in an attempt to acquire ownership of the newly developed active ingredient sofosbuvir, which is the main component of Gilead.
U.S.-backed forces claim to have taken full control of the city of Manbij from the Islamic State.
U.S.-backed forces have taken full control of Manbij city in the northern part of the state near the Turkish border and the last Islamic State troops have left the city, a group spokesman said on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDS) is currently clearing the city of the last enemy fighters who have not yet left the city.
They have freed more than 2,000 hostages-civilians who had been captured by militants, Sharfan Darvish of the SDS-allied Manbij Military Council told Reuters.
"Currently, the city is completely under our control and we are conducting a search for fighters," he told Reuters.
Clinton's income in 2015 reached $10.75 million and the couple paid a 34.2 percent federal tax rate.
Hillary Clinton released a 2015 tax return on Friday, showing that the Democratic presidential candidate and her husband earned $10.75 million this year and paid a federal tax rate of 34.2 percent, respectively.
During 2015, the Clintons donated $1 million to their Clinton charity. Former President Bill Clinton earned about $5.3 million by acting as a whistleblower and a former Secretary of State "gained $3 million with the Department of the Treasury for public income"
U.S. Senator Tim Kane and his wife Anna Holtone have published their tax returns for the past 10 years.
In 2015, they paid a federal tax rate of 20.3 percent.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kane continue to set new standards for financial transparency," Clinton campaign partner Jennifer Palmeri said in a statement.
On the other hand, Donald Trump hides behind various excuses and excuses so that he does not have to fulfill promises to disclose his tax information.
Disclosure of paid tax information is a record practice for US presidential candidates, but it is not required by law.
New York businessman Trump and his lawyers cite the State Revenue Service’s audit as a reason not to disclose tax information.
“Your march,” the Democratic Party’s campaign partner, Ian Sams, said on Twitter about the Democratic Party’s tax information.
On Thursday, Trump’s special adviser, Michael Cohen, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to disclose tax information until the audit was completed.
Trump's critics, including Republican presidential candidate Mits Romney and other Republicans, say his resignation raises questions about the true size of his property, the amount of donations and other business obligations, including obligations to Russia.
Clinton set an oil fire on Friday by publishing a video in which a number of influential Republicans demanded that Trump disclose his tax information.
She returned to the issue during an economic speech Thursday in Michigan.
She told the crowd: "He refuses to do what the other presidential candidates have been doing for decades."
Politico reports that during the 1990s, Trump paid very little or no taxes at all for two years, and the author of the New York Times business column said on Friday that many accountants and lawyers believe that nothing has changed today.
Federal tax rates are an important issue in this presidential election.
Clinton, in support of billionaire Warren Buffett's proposal, promotes the idea that everyone who earns more than $1 million a year should pay a tax of at least 30%.
This proposal is also supported by President Barack Obama.
Last week, during Clinton’s speech in Omaha, Nebraska, where his Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate is also located, Buffett invited Trump to exchange tax returns.
Buffett said that he is also being audited by the Revenue Service and Trump is afraid of voters, not the tax authorities.
The Clinton campaign has made tax information public up to 2007.
The Clintons now live in Chappaqua, New York, and have paid an average federal tax rate of about 32 percent and a total tax rate of about 40,5 percent over the period 2007-2014.
A 2015 Clinton tax report shows that unlike most Americans, only $100 of their income is a salary.
Their main investment was a low-cost index fund, from which Clinton received $109,000 in dividends.

A Jewish film director criticizes a hotel in Berlin for unlocking Israel’s teleconferencing code at the request of an Arab - RT News
The director of a French film of Jewish origin said the storm on social media when he discovered that the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin does not have an Israeli teleconferencing code. Hotel staff justify this with the demand of Arab customers.
Claude Lancman, director of the Holocaust documentary Shoah, did not conceal his dissatisfaction with the Berlin-based Kempinski Bristol hotel and addressed an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During a recent visit, Lancman tried to find Israel's phone code in the list offered by the hotel.
However, this country was not included in the list of countries to which you can call directly from the hotel room.
How is it possible that in 2016 in Berlin, the new capital of Germany, Israel was defeated and destroyed?
Lancman's writings.
Instead, the Kempinski Bristol hotel offers to call to this country through its call center.
The director asked for an explanation from the hotel staff.
Lancman writes that the response received "shocked him".
The hotel administrator explained that "this is an informed decision of the hotel management".
The reason for the removal of the code angered the film director even more.
"Most of the guests are Arabs and they requested the deletion of the Israeli code," Lancman quoted a hotel employee as saying.
According to the Suddeutsche Zeitung, Israel’s ambassador to Germany, Jakov Hadas-Handelsmann, called the incident a “great shame”.
We are surprised and shocked by this incident.
The same is a great shame in itself.
And the fact that this has happened in Germany, in this very network of hotels there is even more humiliation.
There is no need for explanations.
The official said: "We hope that the hotel will make the right conclusions."
This event also gained quite a wide resonance on the Internet, where people called it a scandal.
Others believe that the Kempinski Hotel has simply painted for Arab customers.
Another record said "fear" indicating that the hotel is located on Kurfurstendamm Street next to the synagogue.
The hotel itself, according to Der Spiegel, quickly rejected all the upheavals, declaring that it was a "misunderstanding" and apologising to Lancman.
"We have not received a direct order to remove Israel from the country's list of numbers," Kempinski's representative quoted the Suddeutsche Zeitung as saying.
And add that the code has been added to the list again.
Police use rubber balls and tear gas against protesting Brazilian students.
Students and police clashed on Thursday in the Brazilian city of São Paulo, where students gathered in a demonstration against the reforms of the government's education system.
Police used rubber balls and tear gas against students.
Problems began when law enforcement tried to extort students, as a result of which the police applied rubber balls and tear gas.
Hundreds of students took part in the demonstration to show their dislike for reforms in the education system.
The proposal of São Paulo Governor Geraldo Alckmina envisages the closure of almost 100 public schools, while 300,000 students will be transferred to other schools in order to save money.
Some protesters drew graffiti on the walls with messages against interim President Michael Temer.
The protest took place just days after the previous protest, when students gathered in demonstrations to express support for deposed President Dilma Rousseff, for whose impeachment the Senate voted.
Scott Kelum Skinners finishes first, bringing Britain gold medals in cycling
Kelmus Skinner of Scotland finished the first men's cycling team sprint race at the Rio velodrome last night. The British team defended their championship title, which it won at the 2012 London Games.
The 23-year-old athlete from Glasgow played an important role in these races, making the proud Scottish legendary Ser Chris Hoe and marking the victory for the New Zealand favourites.
Four years ago, Britain won an astonishing victory when Hoyt won the fifth of its six Olympic gold medals.
And they also repeated it at the World Championships in London, although Hoyt had already finished his athletic career.
The problems were in the period between the Beijing and London Olympic Games, as they had to be replaced by experienced starting specialist Jamie Staff.
They did it at the last minute.
When Hoyt left, she tried to fill Kians Emadi and Mets Krampton's place.
The British coaches put expectations on Skinner, seeing in him the potential that he later proved.
Hindes, Kenya - champions who started four years ago with Hoi and Skinner, who set the Olympic Qualifying Record, but the best start of the race was for the New Zealand team
However, the British trio won gold medals.
The Hindes were in a tight-knit after their circle, Kenys took the lead and Skinners guarded the lead.
The change of strategy played an important role in the win, as the Hindes drove with more gear to allow Kenya and especially Skinner to drive faster.
Hoyt watched the race as a BBC representative and caught the eyes of Skinner, Kenya, and Hinds at the moment they climbed the honorary pedestal.
The 23-year-old clerk said, "It was an unspeakable honor."
I do my best to defend my name.
In the final, we set the Olympic record and won the World Champions.
It was just unbelievable.
There is no better victory.
After winning with Kenya and Hoi at the 2012 Olympics in London, the Hindes admitted that they deliberately fell on the track after a unsuccessful start.
He later refuted this comment and the British competitors were not in a position to prove otherwise.
This time there were no such incidents.
Hindes said, "British flags in the tribunes recalled London."
In the last 3 months, we have become a united team.
We have lost so many World Championships, so the victory at the Olympics was really special.
One medal will compete for the country, which won seven out of ten gold medals in cycling in Beijing and London.
If this achievement is an indicator of team progress over the past five months, then the next five days will be very exciting.
Given Kenya’s score, he could indeed repeat Hoy’s success by winning three Olympic gold medals.
For Kenya, this would mean six gold and one silver medals. In addition, Kenya was born on March 23 (it seems to be a British holy date, as on this day were also born Steve Regrew, Mo Farah and Roger Banister).
On this date, Hoi was also born.
Kenya's next race is a sprint that starts today and will continue for the next three days.
The 28-year-old Bolton athlete said, "I'm just enjoying it all right now.
A team trip is always the best.
Because then you can win together with the team members.
If you're honest, winning is a little lonely."
Hindes said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be knighted."
It was the only fight for medals that day, but it was not the only good news for Britain.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steve Burke and Owen Dowl showed the fastest qualifying time in the four-kilometre fours.
Their time was 3:51.943
The world record set in London in 2012 is 3:51,659.
The first round and the final will take place today in the second half of the day, where Vigins will definitely be in the spotlight.
Yesterday, before the qualifying trip, he had disagreements with the commissariat when the judges summoned him to measure his height.
In the women’s journey, which will continue and end today, Laura Trot, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavia set a new record time of 4:13,260.
The British delegation hopes that the British cycling team will win the medals in the middle of the Olympic Games.
Remembering the outstanding and unprecedented performance in Beijing and London, everyone expects the same achievements in Rio.
In the meantime, there have been various backstage, after allegations of sexism and insults to dignity, Technical Director Shane Sutton resigned, and the career of Hoy and Victoria Bendletton also ends.
However, at the start of the first cycling races, it seems that the UK will always reach the highest level at the right time.
The future of the Portland melting plant is becoming unclear as the ambitious contract has been terminated.
The future of the aluminum smelter and hundreds of its employees in Portland, Victoria, has become unclear as its main customer, the energy company, has announced the termination of cooperation.
This announcement is based on the Victorian government's plans to stop subsidizing the energy company, which is vital for the company to continue its work.
The 20-year grants will be discontinued in November.
As a result, more than 2000 jobs at the Alcoa Portland plant are at risk.
Up to 2000 direct and indirect jobs could be at risk.
In addition, it will also have unforeseen side effects, as the melting plant consumes about 10 percent of Victoria’s total electricity supply.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry melting site, which led to the interruption of the Anglesea power station.
Alcoa Portland Melting Plant works at a loss and can be closed.
These events were caused by years of speculation about the rise in the value of the Australian dollar and the cost of production of the factory.
The factory’s energy supplier AGL, which supplies energy from its Loy Yang A power plant in Latroube Valley, says the other three owners are likely to also terminate their contracts.
The majority of the power plant is owned by Alcoa and Alumia, in addition to the shares of the company are also owned by the holding companies of China CITIC and Japan Marubeni Corp.
AGL is looking forward to the continuation of the Portland plant, which would mean further energy supply for the melting plant," said its representative.
AGL stated that the contracts are so-called "risk-restrictive contracts" which are intended to enter into force from November 2016.
Contracts have a validity period of 12 months and will therefore remain in force until 2017.
AGL intends to receive revenue from these contracts in fiscal year 2017 as well," said a representative of the company.
With effect from fiscal year 2018, the potential impact on profits is limited by favourable market forecasts for electricity wholesale prices in the future.
AGL claims that it has already estimated losses of $187 million in its forecasts, anticipating that these contracts will be terminated.
Alcoa states that the decision to terminate the contracts will not affect Alcoa's ability to continue its operations or supply energy.
The U.S. company says it signed a contract with Loy Yang in 2010 for 20 years, but it will be terminated in November. The company does not provide explanations for why it will terminate its cooperation.
Analysts have expressed concerns about both the possible closure of the Portland Meltdown in Victoria and the closure of the Tomago plant near Newcastle, due to the weak economy of the sector.
AGL CEO Steven Mikelson said last week that according to analysts, Portland consumes 600 megawatts and Tomago 900 megawatts of energy during the year.
If both of these plants were to leave the energy market, the energy demand would be significantly reduced.
And that would not be good at all.
The Community Legal Centre rejects 160 000 people each year.
More than 160,000 people are rejected each year, and the situation could deteriorate as budget cuts are made.
Three out of five people in Queensland - mostly pensioners, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and those who lack the means to fight illegal extradition - are denied free legal assistance and representation.
The Community legal centre, which is already overburdened, warns that the situation will only get worse as funding declines.
As of June of next year, these legal centers will receive 30% less funding than before.
James Farrell, director of the Queensland Legal Center, said the latest report from the National Legal Centers Association says legal aid is currently being denied to thousands of people who need it.
Mr Farrell pointed out that if this decision is not repealed, the situation will only get worse.
He also says: "The Queensland Legal Center is consistently underfunded, which means that aid is being denied to thousands of people who need it."
People who are trying to end violent relationships, people with deep debts, families who are experiencing divorce, workers who are dismissed unfairly - all of these people have legal problems and this report shows that they are not getting the necessary help.
As of June 2017, the federal government will cut funding by 30 percent, meaning that several thousand more people in Queensland will have to solve their complex legal problems without assistance.
We call on Attorney General and Senator George Brandis of Queensland to immediately halt funding cuts so that people in need of legal assistance can get them.
Last year, the government unveiled its plans to bring the level of legal aid to the national average.
Now is the time to pay attention to the needs of local communities and their customers, and to invest the Palaz<0xC4><0x8D>uk government in this important area.
Donald Trump campaign indicted in court after one of the employees pulled a gun
New York: Donald Trump campaign organizers sued in court for failing to act on reports that his North Carolina operations chief had turned a gun on an employee while they were driving a car in February.
This incident was described in a court suit filed Wednesday in Charlotte Court by Vincent Bordini, the former campaign programmer.
Bordini said he had been waiting for months for an internal investigation of the case to be initiated, but realized that it would not happen.
Chief Earl Philip "drawn his gun, put his right index finger on the cock, and turned the rod against Vincent's knee," Bordini claims in his complaint.
He also claims that when he lodged a complaint with the local and regional campaign management, Bordini learned that at least four more people had experienced the same.
"Weapons do not need to be fired to cause damage," Bordini said in his complaint.
Just two days before the filing of the case, a Republican candidate for the presidency caused a scandal by telling people that the "People of the Second Amendment", i.e. gun owners and enthusiasts, could act if the election were to be won by his side against Hillary Clinton and Clinton.
Trump’s campaign said the media had ripped his words out of context and he had never urged anyone to commit violence.
Bordini with his claim wants to collect compensation from the campaign organizers for negligent surveillance, but from Philip - for the attack, the illegal use of weapons and the creation of emotional stress.
Trump spokeswoman Houpa Hicks did not immediately comment.
Couldn't get in touch with Philip.
WCCB - Charlotte's local news agency reports that Philip has recently left the campaign.
He also failed to call his consulting firm "Innovative Consulting Services".
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has run a controversial election campaign.

A new tradition - parish and sports festival in <0xC4><0xB0>ulcem.
On Saturday, for the first time, people gathered in <0xC4><0xB0><0xC5><0x9F>ulciems for the parish and sports festivals.
After ten years of celebration, it was decided this time that there would be no more Lake Festival.
The new page is now redistributed.
The day began with sports competitions.
This time the race was not in the traditional ways and too serious, because, for example, the darts had to be thrown at a sleeping target, the boot flew, with the human left hand thrown, "bullishing" was not at all in any of the Olympic Games.
However, each participant was able to show how strong, courageous, skillful, and resourceful he is.
After the sports games, everyone gathered at the outdoor stage, where the municipal holiday began.
In the meantime, there was also a "children's corner", where the little ones could burst into inflatable attractions and get a new image of faces in the make-up shop.
The novelty, which could also become a tradition, was a show of trucks, in which both tractors and motorcycles went.
All of them were addressed by Inga Kadi<0xC4><0x8D>e-Skadi<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1>, head of the municipal administration of <0xC4><0xB0><0xC5><0xBB>ulciems, who wished for a nice rest and dry time, although it rained, but it was not able to interfere much.
The festivities continued with the congratulations of the youngest residents of <0xC4><0xB0>ulciems.
It is really good that the municipality has been supplemented with five girls and one boy.
With performances at <0xC5><0xBB>ulciemniks came amateur art collectives from Engures district - spectators very liked the performances of senior dance group "Autumn rhythms", performers of various folk dances "Reds" and young dancers "Golden Pearls".
And it's not a bad thing that someone slipped on the wet scene.
Of course, local people and villagers were delighted by the famous duet of actors J<0xC4><0x81>nis Jarans and Dainis Porgants, who were again Mildi<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1> Nabi<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1> and Skaidr<0xC4><0xAB>te Kr<0xC4><0x81>ni<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1>, as well as B<0xC4><0x93>rzciems attractive wives from the fishermen's farm "Dien<0xC4><0xAB>nas".
The balli was played by the band "Brugis".
Britain must maintain the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow.
Heathrow will not only promote prosperity and growth in the local regions and in London, but also throughout the country.
This, in my opinion, makes Heathrow very attractive, as in 2012 in London, where we invested a huge amount of work so that all the regions of the country would benefit from the Olympic Games.
Stratford-upon-Thames and Isthmus won an extraordinary number of the Olympic Games.
And we will do it again by providing local people and businesses with entrepreneurial opportunities near Heathrow.
For the local communities alone, we will create 10,000 new entrepreneurial opportunities, 40,000 new jobs and finally put an end to youth unemployment in the Heathrow area.
As at the 2012 London Olympics, this time too, there will be people who will think that this challenge is too big and that Heathrow’s enlargement is too ambitious.
At the time, people said that Britain would never be able to prepare for the Olympics and that it would be a global disaster.
Skeptics made a mistake about 2012 and they will not be right about Heathrow either.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow has overcome everything so far.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is an infrastructure project that will benefit the whole society, not individual individuals.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, economic growth of 211 billion, creating ground for both employment and experience at this airport and across the UK.
Heathrow has an excellent team that has created an infrastructure investment program worth <0xC2><0xA3>11 billion, including a time and budget starting with Terminal 5, which has been named the best airport terminal in the world for five years, and finally with Terminal 2, which is built between the two runs more intensively.
Now they are ready to set up a third runway, which will be financed by private investment of <0xC2><0xA3>16 billion.
The 2012 London Olympic Games were a great success, and I am sure the Heathrow enlargement will be the same.
The time has come to revive the Olympic spirit and to expand Heathrow, securing the future of our trade and creating a new employment environment for Britain to be proud of.
Lord Paul Dayton is a member of the Heathrow Board and a former Secretary of Commerce at the Ministry of Economic Affairs.
In Switzerland, a woman jumped on a highway, trying to commit suicide.
The victim wanders on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police are trying to find witnesses to the accident, when on Thursday morning on the highway she crossed over several cars.
The accident occurred on Thursday shortly after midnight on the A1 road near the town of Morges in the canton of Vo.
The canton’s police report said that in a desperate desire to commit suicide, the woman had set out on a road in the dark, where she was driven by several cars.
Unmistakably trying to kill themselves, the victims, a 49-year-old Swiss woman, drove through several cars, including a heavy machine.
She died at the scene.
Several drivers involved in the accident have already testified, but the other involved have not yet been ascertained, police say, calling for the recall of the drivers involved and witnesses of the accident.
A criminal investigation has also been initiated in the case, which is a logical step in this case, lawyer Gilles Hofstellers told Le Tribune de Genève.
However, it is not yet known whether any of the drivers involved will be punished.
Was it possible to avoid a collision?
Hofstellers adds, "Too clear prosecutor."
Two similar incidents that have occurred in the last 5 years indicate that none of the drivers will be held accountable.
In both cases, the pedestrian had gone to the highway in the middle of the night, so it was decided that drivers could not predict that a pedestrian would be on the highway in the middle of the night, the newspaper reports.
Last year, a policewoman was acquitted of murder in disregard when in August 2014 she was driven by a man who slept on the A1 road near Paijernes in the middle of the night.
The court found out that the 22-year-old victim had been drunk and later noticed falling asleep on the road.
The court concluded that the policewoman who was on her way to the scene of the accident was driving in a manner appropriate to the circumstances and the judge acknowledged that the sleeping man on the road was "completely unpredictable and an emergency".
Any person who has information about Thursday's accident near Morges is invited to contact the police by phone 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
The Internet collects signatures for the holding of a new VID manager’s position.
The petition portal "Avaaz.org" started the collection of signatures for the organization of a new post of Head of the State Revenue Service (VID).
The petition addressed to the Ministers of the National Association (NA) and the Greens and Farmers’ Union (ZZS) indicates that the public wants a transparent and professional process for the appointment of officials.
The petition was created on 10 August and is currently signed by 55 people.
The process of appointing Ingas Kolegova, a candidate for the post of Director General of the VID, is opaque and unprofessional.
This recalls the best official traditions of the Soviet Union.
This discredits the government and once again causes the public to despair in government and politicians.
"There is a need for a competition with clear criteria against which all candidates should be evaluated," the petition's text states.
Its author J<0xC4><0x81>nis B. pointed out that the public does not know the criteria for how Kolegova was chosen for the post.
It is also not clear what are the candidates' intentions for employment in the VID.
The petition states that the State Chancellery should set up a new open competition in which professional candidates are actively addressed, staff selection specialists are attracted and an appropriate remuneration is offered.
The Minister of Finance Dana Reiznieces-Ozola formally appointed Kolegowa as head of the VID last week, this week the government was supposed to approve him in the new position, but all the ministers of the Unity party voted against, so the question for the week was postponed.
Samoilov: If we lost, then I played badly.
If you are not satisfied with the quality of the product, you will not be able to use the product, but you will be able to use the product if you are not satisfied with the quality of the product.
One of the world's strongest pairs of beach volleyball on Thursday in the final and decisive game of the sub-groups tournament with 1-2 (16:21, 22:20, 7:15) lost to Brazilians Evandra Gonçalves Oliveira and Pedro Solbergas Salgados, finishing their participation in the four-year event.
In the three sub-groups, Latvian athletes won one win, but the same ratio was for two more pairs.
In the following, the ratio of three pairs of small points to each other was counted, which was the most unfavourable for the Latvian duo after this strong loss in the match.
In the first set, we were in the lead, but from 16:15 onwards we also remained on 16 points, <0xC5><0xA0>m<0xC4><0x9B><0xC4><0x8D>in<0xC4><0x97>s recalled during the game.
I don’t even know how the rest of the set went without points.
You can't play that.
After that, in the second set everything was in order and the set managed to break the game at the top of the set, in addition, it had to be a good basis for the third set.
It started similarly, but after we switched sides, the result grew for only one team.
We made too many mistakes in the attack.
In the subgroup, all teams were similar, almost all matches had three sets, so small points were important.
“We should have played more similarly, rather than repeatedly giving back 3-4 points in a row,” the athlete said.
We knew that Evander could be saved.
“In the first set, we ended it, in the second we scored 1-2 points, but in the third at +4 he had already left the game,” recalled <0xC5><0xA0>m<0xC4><0x93>di<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1>.
We tried to show the best game.
Sometimes we meet, sometimes we don’t.
I did not look at the situation before the match, but I knew that as many small points as possible were needed.
“If we lost, I played badly,” Samoilov said.
We were expecting a good service from Evandro, and in the first sets we were also quite good at it, but in the third one he opened the service and it was difficult to form an attack.
In turn, I made a lot of mistakes in the reception right at Peter’s service, but it had to be dealt with.
Samoilov said that unlike the previous match, today the athletes were not nervous.
"We went, we played, there was also protection, but we needed a better service reception," said the athlete.
"They played well and at the end they got to the urra."
You will be able to see the results of your research, and you will be able to see the results of your research.
We also had a chance to fight for first place, but we were not even out of the group.
"All of us were waiting for a medal and we were waiting for ourselves, but then there was no difference - 25th or fourth place," said Samoilov, who predicted that the duo would continue to play together in the future.
I think there will be no question and we will continue to play together, because this is only one tournament.
Samoil Riodejaneiro was already in his third Olympic career, since he started in 2008 in Beijing with Martins P<0xC4><0x83>l<0xC4><0x83>vini, but four years ago in London he played with Ruslan Sorokin.
In the meantime, <0xC5><0xA0>m<0xC4><0x93>di<0xC5><0x86><0xC5><0xA1> was the second start in the Olympics.
"Latvenergo" follows the process of opening the gas market also from the position of a potential trader.
The state energy company "Latvenergo" is following the process of opening the gas market both from the position of the consumer and potential trader, said the press secretary of the company Ivita Bidere.
"The decision on whether Latvenergo will also join the gas market in the future as a trader will determine what gas market model and legal framework will be created."
"Therefore, on our part, we are actively involved in the drafting and commenting of regulatory acts, as well as submitting our proposals," said Bidere.
The Agency BNS has already written that the Ministry of Economy (EM) in cooperation with the Commission for the Regulation of Public Services and the energy company "Latvijas G<0xC4><0x81>ze" has developed the draft regulations of the Cabinet of Ministers "Regulations for the sale and use of natural gas" that will change the free use of the existing natural gas market for the use of natural gas.
Working on the new regulation of the natural gas market, EM aims to make the natural gas trading process as simple and user-friendly as possible.
Therefore, as the most efficient and user-friendly service solution chosen "trader's central model", in which all activities related to customer service are provided by the dealer - one contract, one invoice and one place of information provision and customer service, leaving the question of the distribution system operator in the natural gas distribution system.
A similar solution is currently being implemented in the field of electricity trading.
We remind you that the gradual opening of the market is intended for household users - even after April 3, 2017, those household users who do not want to choose another natural gas trader will be able to continue to receive natural gas from the existing trader at a regulated price, thus becoming related users.
"In this case, the obligation to supply natural gas to related users at a regulated price is imposed on the public trader," the ministry said.
In turn, traders will have to choose a natural gas trader with whom to conclude a natural gas trade agreement.
Until the conclusion of the natural gas trade agreement, the natural gas trader will provide for a certain period of time for natural gas trader at a fixed price.
The draft regulations of the Cabinet of Ministers detail the rights and obligations of the natural gas trader, the system operator and the users.
The rules determine the procedure in which the users are supplied with natural gas and stop the supply of it to the users, the requirements of safe use of the natural gas system in the case of supply, the rights and obligations of the owner of the system operator, the user and the gaseous object in the case of supply and use of natural gas; the procedure in which the goods are delivered to the users, the order in which the supply is carried out

Oil prices continue to rise; stock indices in the U.S. and Europe, as well as the value of the U.S. dollar, are on the rise.
Oil prices in the world continue to rise on Friday morning, positively affecting the investor mood of Saudi Arabia's oil ministers, which reinforces expectations that the major oil-producing countries will act to stabilize the world's oil markets at the upcoming OPEC meeting in September.
Three major U.S. stock indices reached record highs on Thursday, which had not been seen since 1999.
The main positive factor in the market was the rise in oil prices and the strong financial performance of several large companies.
The rise in oil prices and strong financial performance of several companies on Thursday were also the reason for the rise in European stock indices.
The value of the US dollar rose on Thursday against the euro, against the British pound and against the Japanese yen.
In e-commerce on the New York Stock Exchange, the price of crude oil delivered by the WTI brand rose by US$ 1.78 to US$ 43.49 per barrel on Thursday.
The price of Brent crude oil for deliveries rose by $1.99 on the London Stock Exchange in October to $46.04 per barrel.
The turnover of the canned producer "Blue Lagoon" fell by 33.8% last year.
Canned producer Blue Lagoon’s turnover last year was <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>4,202 million, which is 33.8% less than the previous year, while the company’s losses decreased 5.7 times – to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>904.7 thousand, according to the annual financial report published in the Lursoft database.
The management report of the company states that in 2015 the company worked with losses caused by a number of reasons, including in connection with the permanent shortage of working funds, caused by the departure of Unicredit Bank from the Baltic market, terminating the previously valid credit line option, and leaving them without the possibility of "Zilo".
As a result, the company did not have sufficient resources to purchase cheaper raw materials in large quantities and to receive a volume discount.
The departure of the relevant bank from the Latvian market also prevented the company from implementing EU Structural Funds support projects that would have allowed the plant to purchase new production equipment and modernize infrastructure.
Likewise, the company’s financial creators were negatively affected by the rise in raw material prices and the customers’ reluctance to pay more than the company’s manufactured goods.
“It was only in the second half of July 2016 that customers acknowledged price changes and were ready to buy goods at the new – the highest – prices,” the company’s management said.
Likewise, in 2015 "Blue Lagoon" began negotiations with potential investors, including valuation of the company's movable and immovable assets.
Investors have already been to the company's largest creditor, Unicredit Leasing, where the parties have met and discussed possible investment plans.
At the same time, the company’s activities and development were positively influenced by the implementation of the restructuring and optimization plan started in 2014 and 2015.
This plan encompassed the improvement and optimization of technological processes, which allows to achieve greater production productivity and capacity.
"Only a number of equipment have been purchased, which ensures a higher production speed," the company's management said.
The management of "Blue Lagoon" notes that the purchased equipment in 2016 will allow the company's production plant to fulfill orders that were not possible until now.
The first batch of production, which will be produced on this equipment, will be ready in August.
Since the intentional protocols for the sale of the product have already been signed, all produced will be sold in accordance with the intentional protocols.
The new product will increase turnover by about 300,000 euros per month," the company's management said.
The company also plans to sign a cooperation agreement on the supply of fish products to Iraq in August 2016.
The Blue Lagoon has sent the first experimental container to Israel in 2016, has expanded the sales market to Cyprus and will sign a cooperation agreement with a new supermarket chain in the USA in September this year.
As a result of all the above measures, the company plans to increase its turnover.
In 2014, "Blue Lagoon" worked with a turnover of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC> 6,347 million and losses of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC> 5,113 million.
"Blue Lagoon" was founded in 1997 and its capital is 1,156 million euros.
The company is owned by two Latvian individuals - Mihail Kaidanov (89.11%) and Igor <0xC5><0xA0>ir<0xC5><0xA1>on (10.89%).
Welcome to pl. 15 at the museum to attend the cinema diva Zara Leanderi and to participate in the press conference.
Riga can be considered the starting and inspiration city of the beloved cinema diva Zara Leandere.
In 1924, Sara Lendere’s visit to her mother-in-law Ruth, who was the Swedish ambassador to Latvia, became destiny in Riga, because it was she who discovered the unusually low contralta to Sara Lendere’s wife, whom she attempted to debut on the theatre stage at the Riga booth.
Perhaps it was the accidental accident in Riga that turned into a fateful turn on Sara’s creative path towards world fame.

The insurer shall pay compensation on Wednesday to the passengers of the cancelled airline at the airport.
If Insurance paid travel insurance to a family for the cancelled flight at Riga Airport on Wednesday, 10 August, which forced them to refuse to attend the planned music festival.
On August 11, If Insurance received a claim for compensation from a client.
The family had planned to go to a music festival in Belgium, but as this was not possible due to the cancelled flights at the airport on Wednesday, the client was charged for booking accommodation, which could no longer be cancelled, as well as for the festival tickets purchased for 204 euro.
In turn, the airline has promised to reimburse customers for the money spent on airline tickets.
If Insurance has paid compensation for travel interruption or cancellation on average 15% of all travel insurance reimbursements.
“These times are reimbursed for the purchase, return or exchange of tickets, as well as for the reservation of accommodation,” says Dagnija Rutka, head of insurance product risk of Insurance Persons.

As a result of the repair of the neighbor, the man gets to the broken ceilings and is forced to leave the house.
In the LTV show "Studio 4" Dmitry Saidyashevs, whose neighbor has started major repairs in his apartment, and since then Dmitry has been plastering from the ceiling and is not sure that staying in the apartment is safe.
The problem is that my neighbors carried out arbitrary construction and the ceilings in my apartment are damaged.
Then I informed the construction authorities of Riga, the house manager and other organizations.
The construction authorities said that we are not any operational service and we have no expert.
"The owner of the apartment has to go to the Latvian Union of Engineers, and from there there will be some expert," Dmitry says.
The invited expert arrived, recorded what had happened and admitted that the overlap was in an unsatisfactory state.
However, a month has passed since Dmitry’s first application to the building administration, and until the beginning of this week, no one was able to answer whether being in an apartment is not life-threatening.
The building administration said - such is the legislation, wait, if you are not satisfied, write to everyone in a row.
"Then I wrote to the house of Riga, but they sent the house to the manager, then the manager of the house again to the building, and then there is a roadblock," says Dmitry.
After examining all the pile of paper, it is clear that the construction work has been suspended, although from time to time it may be heard that someone is working there.
Within two more months, an examination must be carried out and within six months, the owner of the apartment, who performs the repairs, must correct all these defects.
The independent expert has drawn up his opinion, but the construction authorities consider it incomplete and superficial.
The expert has not indicated whether the metal grating in this support structure is affected, hence there is no certainty that the owner of the lower apartment poses a threat.
“That’s why we’ve asked for an additional explanation from this expert,” says Ilze <0xC5><0xBD><0xC5><0xAB>ka, representative of the construction authorities in Riga.
Despite the ban on any repairs to the upper apartment, we still hear from there that construction is continuing.
The penalty for arbitrary construction without a building permit is from 70 to 700 euros, but in the specific case the penalty can be much more severe.
While awaiting the expert opinion, the construction authorities have decided that both apartments should not be operated - both in which the construction work is taking place and Dmitry's apartment.
"This is not a case in the practice of the construction industry when in this way, due to their ignorance or simply reluctance, the citizens may have created a threat not only to their own property, but also to the owner of the lower property, as a result of which this owner cannot exploit his property," says the representative of the construction industry.
Now it is up to Dmitry to look for another place to live - with relatives, friends, in a hotel or to rent another apartment.
But the resulting losses Dmitry can try to recover from the neighbor in civil law, which can take a lot of time.
Due to the arbitrary construction, it is currently forbidden to stay in both apartments until the construction engineer gives his conclusion, and it may take up to three weeks to wait.
The resulting losses will have to be covered by the owner of the apartment in which the repairs took place.
The owner of this apartment is also threatened with imprisonment for up to six months because the construction authorities have not taken into account what is said.
Take it now!

The establishment of the hotel is the first stage of the restoration of the former <0xC4><0x8C>emeri sanatorium.
The second phase will be the wellness clinic, which is planned to open in 2022, while the opening of the hotel is scheduled for May 2018.
The turtle notes that the exact cost of the clinic is not yet known.
However, she points out that it will be located in the building of the former <0xC4><0x8C>emeri resort polyclinic, which covers an area of about 12,000 square meters.
The clinic will be located on three floors.

In October 2014, the auction “Park Hotel <0xC4><0xB6>emeri” confirmed its readiness to buy a set of belongings of the sanatorium belonging to the insolvent “Ominasis Latvia”, but a month later the auction was declared as not happening, because the winner had not paid for the purchase within the specified time.
The sale price was determined according to the starting price of the last non-auction - 2.86 million euros.
As the agency LETA informed the representative of the city council Ieva Aile, the municipality, when signing the protocol, confirmed that with the support of co-financing of the European Union Structural Funds, the adjacent infrastructure will be restored - the historic <0xC4><0x8C>emeri park will be restored, an interactive nature tourism site will be created, roads and roads will be arranged.

In 2009, Antonenko made his debut in the Metropolitan Opera in the role of Prince "Nar<0xC4><0x81>".
In 2011, Antonenko sang the title role with Richard Muti and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra at the Othello Opera in Paris, at the Covent Garden Opera he sang Luigi "Apmet<0xC5><0x86>a" in the new studio, as well as in Stockholm he took part in the Kristof Loja in Stockholm.
A year later, Antonenko sang the role of Otello at the London Opera House in Covent Garden with great success.
Russian hackers hacked the e-mail of former NATO commander Bridlov.
Hackers who hacked the computers of the U.S. Democratic National Committee (DNC) may have carried out a number of other cyberattacks, including hacking the emails of former NATO European Force Commander Philip Bridlewood and the Open Society of George Soros Institute's business servers.
The information obtained by the hackers was published on the site "DCLeaks.com".
Among other things, Bridlov’s letters and news about the work of the Soros Institute are also included.
The computers of the Hacker Institute have been available for a whole year.
According to Bloomberg, these cyber-attacks were carried out by the same hackers associated with Russian intelligence, who hacked DNC emails.
The Wall Street Journal reports that President Barack Obama’s administration is currently considering the issue of imposing new sanctions on Russia in response to the hacking of DNC computers.
In order to implement sanctions, the administration will officially have to charge the servers of the Democratic Party with hackers supported by Russia or the Russian authorities in the cyberattack.
In July, WikiLeaks reportedly published about 20,000 e-mails from the DNC computer system, which indicate that the Democratic Party leaders were trying to harm the nominee of the party's candidate Hillary Clinton's campaign for the former vice-president.
As reported by U.S. press sources, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which conducts an investigation into hacking of Democratic servers, as well as other U.S. intelligence agencies, believe that Russia’s connection to the cyberattack is unquestionable.
McCartney: Joko Ono's presence was threatened by The Beatles.
Paul McCartney admitted that the presence of Joko Ono created a sense of danger from the legendary band The Beatles.
The 74-year-old rock star currently maintains a "good" relationship with the widow of Lieutenant John Lennon, but when she went to the group to visit the recording studio, McCartney scared her because Ono was the only female member of the group - George Harrison, Ringo Starr - between McCartney and Lennon.
When the singer was asked about both relationships, he replied to Rolling Stone magazine, "They're really good."
We felt threatened at the time.
While we were recording, she sat on the amplifiers.
The majority of the group could not tolerate it.
We were able to do this, but not quite successfully, because we were very tight.
We were not sexists, but the girls usually did not come to the recording studio, they allowed us to operate.
When John began to meet Joko, she was not sitting in the control room, but in the middle of us four.
The author of Yellow Submarine also acknowledged that he is now in regular contact with the former band member Ringo, and from time to time approves the recording studio's Apple work plans, but otherwise The Beatles have "finished up".
Asked if he was still dating the other only living member of the legendary rock band, McCartney told Rolling Stone magazine: "Often no."
We meet at social events and parties.
But I don’t go to the meetings, I feel a little detached.
I left Apple during a difficult divorce.
In my place, I sent John Trueman to the meetings and said, "Tell me what everyone is saying, because I can't stand sitting at his table."
It was too painful, as if to see my pet die.
The company now works in such a way that I just listen to all the recordings.
I am part of the approval process.
NASA climate model: Venus was once a habitable planet
Based on NASA’s latest climate models, Venus has ever been a habitable planet.
Scientists at NASA’s Institute for Space Research have developed a model to explore Venus’ history using tools and algorithms that climate scientists use.
The model was developed to determine whether on Venus, whose surface is hot, where there is no water, and whose atmosphere consists almost exclusively of carbon, there have ever been Earth-like conditions.
Scientists have previously suggested that the slow speed of Venus can be explained by the dense atmosphere.
However, recent simulations suggest that there was once a plane on Venus, an Earth-like atmosphere, and it was rotating slowly.
The model also looks at Venus's earlier topography.
There were more dry areas on the planet than on Earth, but there was enough water and geographic diversity on it to allow life to form and prevent water from evaporating.
In early Venus, the sun was 30 percent brighter.
In a simulation of the GISS model, the rotational model of Venus reveals that the bright part of the day lasts for 2 months, explained GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release.
This process heats the planet’s surface and causes rain, which in turn forms thick layers of clouds that act as a umbrella, protecting the planet from the sun’s heat.
As a result, a moderate climate temperature is formed, which is actually a few degrees lower than the temperature on Earth today.
The model depicts the history of Venus, which is similar to the theory of evolution developed by scientists in their hypotheses.
Although once habitable, Venus has been subjected to excessive heat and ultraviolet rays for billions of years.
Its oceans evaporated, and ultraviolet rays lit up the vapors.
When water completely evaporates, only a thin atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse gas remains over it - Venus, as we know it today.
The scientists published the results of the new Venus climate model in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigns from the Avalanche coaching post
On Thursday, Colorado "Avalanche" coach and Vice President of Hockey Operations Patrick Roys filed a resignation, citing insufficient influence in the team's decision-making process.
Colorado Vice President and General Manager Joe Sakiks confirmed the news and said the club would immediately start looking for a new coach.
"For the last three years, I have energetically, passionately and purposefully fulfilled my duties as head coach and vice-president of the Colorado Hockey Club operations," Roy, 50, said in a statement.
During this summer, I have been thinking a lot about how I could improve the team’s performance to give it the brilliance it needs and achieve a higher level of results.
To achieve this, the visions of the head coach and the vice president of hockey operations must fully match the visions of the organization.
He should also be able to influence decisions related to team performance.
These conditions are currently not met.
Sakik, who hired Roy on 23 May 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
Sakik said Patrick informed him of his decision today.
We appreciate everything he has done for the organization and wish him all the best in the future.
In his first season with the Avalanche team in 2013-2014, Roy was recognized as the league's best coach and received the Jack Adams Award.
He helped the club reach 112 points and first place in the Central Division, but in the first round of the elimination games, the Colorado team was made up of Minnesota hockey players. Since then, the club has not entered the elimination games for two years.
"Avalanche" finished the 2015-2016 season with a score of 39-39-4 and left five points behind the "Wild" team, without obtaining the second special invitation of the organizers of the Western Conference.
Famous goalkeeper Roy won four Stanley Cups in his career - two with the Montreal Canadiens and two with the Avalanche.
Workers on the North Sea oil platform resume talks and postpone strike
Workers' strikes on the remuneration of workers on the North Sea oil platforms have been carried out as negotiations between the two parties to the dispute resumed, the negotiating leaders say.
Periodically strikes are being held against the oil processing company “Wood Group” on the oil platforms of the North Sea, where the company “Royal Dutch Shell” operates.
The joint statement states that the trade unions of Wood Group and Unite and RMT have agreed to resume negotiations on the settlement of the dispute.
A number of full-day meetings are scheduled to take place in the coming weeks and will begin at the beginning of next week with the aim of re-examining the problematic issues.
The trade unions announced that their recent measures, organized after a break of more than 25 years, are aimed at reducing their planned wages by 30 percent.
As a result of negative market pressure, the Wood Group cut wages for workers in the North Sea by 9 percent this year.
Already in 2014, the company reduced the salaries of land workers by 10 percent.
The company explains that additional wage reductions would allow the company to survive the market downturn.
Shell, meanwhile, has already cut salaries for several thousand people and announced plans to discontinue oil and natural gas operations in 10 countries to optimize its work in preparation for a large-scale merger deal with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to falling oil prices, and the UK's decision to leave the European Union is making the situation much more difficult.
Earlier this week, Scottish MEP Dave Anderson met with workers' representatives to discuss one of the most important issues - the North Sea strike plans.
He said that the North Sea is vital to the economy of the region.
In his report, he explains that the North Sea and the country as a whole need an economy that benefits everyone, not individually.
In 2016, new projects in the North Sea are expected to invest nearly $1.4 billion, compared to $7 billion invested over the last five years.
Kepler measures the rotational speed of the stars in the Pleiadian star.
The latest Kepler telescope mission has helped astronomers compile the most complete catalogue of the rate of rotation of stars in the Pleiades.
New data help astronomers understand why the stars in this star rotate at different speeds, as well as how the rate of rotation of stars is attributed to the formation of planets.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other stars, we will get more detailed information about the relationship between the mass of stars, age and even the history of its solar system," Luisa Rebula, a scientist at Pasadena Caltech Infrared Process and Analytical Center, said in the news release.
The star of the Pleiades is located 445 light-years from Earth.
Many stars in this star are just beginning to grow, reaching an age of about 125 million years.
They rotate at maximum speed.
When cutting at maximum speed, these rising stars release a large number of stars from the wind.
When the winds enter the magnetic field of the stars, they brake the stars.
As the stars age, their rotational speed decreases.
Kepler measures the rotational speed of each star by determining the time between the appearance of a recognizable star region, such as a sunspot.
The latest catalogue of star rotation speeds shows that larger stars rotate more slowly than smaller stars.
Rebels compare stars to dancers, larger-sized dancers perform pirouettes more slowly than small-sized dancers.
Rebuls says that the "ballet" of the Pleiades shows that slow-rotating objects are larger and more massive, while the faster-rotating objects are very small stars.
Due to the fact that the Pleiades star is so close, it serves as an excellent space laboratory, where you can compare the characteristics of the stars with the rotational speeds.
Rebul says that the Pleiades star helps to form theoretical models for the rotation of stars in both directions for both older and younger stars.
We still have a lot to learn about how, when and why the speed of rotation of the stars slows down and about their complete stopping process.
Rebul and his colleagues presented in detail the analysis of the speed of rotation of the Pleiades stars in three new publications, which will soon be published in the Journal of Astronomy.
