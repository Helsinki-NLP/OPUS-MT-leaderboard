The black box in your car?
While American road designers are struggling to find money for repairs to the collapsing highway network, many are beginning to see a solution in a small black box that easily fits into your car’s dashboard.
The devices that monitor every mile the driver drives, and that transmit this information to the authorities, are at the heart of Washington’s controversial efforts to renovate the outdated system of financing U.S. highways.
Typically, the fading design of highways at once spurred intense debate and the formation of a variety of associations.
Libertarians met with groups of environmentalists and lobbyed for the government to use these small boxes that would record the kilometers taken and maybe even where you’re going – and then that information would be used to compile a tax return.
The tea party is terrified.
The U.S. Civil Liberties Union is also deeply concerned and has mentioned a number of privacy issues.
And while Congress can’t agree on whether to continue, some states aren’t expecting anything.
They find out how they can move to a system where the driver pays per kilometre of the road they are driving on over the next decade.
Thousands of motorists have already taken the black boxes, some of which have GPS tracking, for testing.
This is a real necessity for our nation.
“It’s not a matter of when we have the power to choose,” said Hasan Ikhrata, executive director of the Southern California State Administration Association, which plans to start tracking the mileage of every California motorist in 2025.
The way we pay these taxes will change.
This technology is used for this.
The impetus is the fact that the Road Trust Fund, funded by the taxes Americans pay at gas stations, is at the bottom.
Americans don’t buy as much gasoline as they used to.
Cars drive a lot more kilometers per gallon.
The federal tax itself, 18.4 cents per gallon, has not increased in the past 20 years.
Due to the current high price of gasoline, politicians are reluctant to raise taxes even by a single penny.
“A gasoline tax is simply not sustainable,” said Lee Munnich, a transport policy expert at the University of Minnesota.
His state recently placed a tracking device in 500 cars to test this pay-per-kilometre system.
“In the long run, this seems to be the most logical alternative,” he said.
Experts call it a user fee based on the number of kilometers taken.
It’s no surprise that urban liberals like this idea, as taxes can be used to change drivers’ behavior patterns, which can help, for example, reduce traffic congestion and create greenhouse gases.
Californian designers look at this system when planning strategies to meet the goals set out in ambitious global warming laws.
But Republican Bill Shuster (Representative of Pennsylvania), chairman of the Transportation Committee, said he also sees it as the most functional long-term alternative.
Free market representatives from the Reason Foundation are also inclined to the idea that drivers will pay for the kilometers taken.
“It’s not a tax that disappears in a black hole,” said Adrian Moore, vice president of strategy at Reason.
People pay directly for what they get.
The initiative is also supported by two former U.S. transport ministers, who in 2011 urged Congress to move towards pay per kilometre.
Last year, the U.S. Senate approved a $90 million pilot project that was to include about 10,000 cars.
However, the leadership of the House of Representatives rejected the proposal and did so because of the concerns of rural lawmakers representing the constituents of the population, whose daily life often means insulting many kilometers for work outside the city.
However, several states and cities are still moving forward on their own.
Oregon is the most zealous state in the world, with 5,000 drivers involved in the largest experiment in the country.
These drivers will soon start paying the state a tax on the kilometers taken, instead of a tax on gasoline.
Nevada has already completed the pilot project.
New York is investigating the project.
Illinois is trying to do this to a limited extent with trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes 17 state transport ministries, along with coastal states in the east (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Florida) is studying how they can implement this change.
However, this concept does not have only advocates.
In Nevada, where about 50 volunteer cars have recently been fitted, drivers have been concerned that the government is able to monitor their every move.
“The Big Brother surveillance and similar issues were a big problem,” said Alauddin Khan, who heads the strategy and operations management at the Nevada Ministry of Transport.
It wasn't something people wanted.
As the trial project continued, the American Civil Liberties Union of Nevada warned on its website: “It would be very easy to turn these devices into full-fledged tracking devices.”
There is no need to build an enormously cumbersome technological infrastructure that will inevitably expand to record the daily departures and arrivals of individuals.
Nevada is one of the few states trying to find available technology that would allow the state to track how many miles a car is driving, but not exactly when and where.
If you can do it, Khan said, the public will be calmer.
The search for such a technology led some state agencies to a small company in California called True Mileage.
This company was originally not involved in the action to assist the government in taxing drivers.
She wanted to break through the emerging market of legal liability insurance, where drivers would pay based on how much they would bite.
But this device, which he tries, attracts the attention of road network designers, because it does not use GPS and only supplies a limited amount of information, which is regularly uploaded using a modem.
“People will be more willing to do it if you don’t track their speed and location,” said Ryan Morrison, CEO of True Mileage.
There have been a number of major errors in some of these pilot programmes.
There are much cheaper and less intrusive ways to do it.
In Oregon, designers experiment with giving drivers a choice.
They can choose devices with GPS or without GPS.
Or they don’t have to take any facilities and instead decide to pay a flat fee based on the average number of kilometers taken by all residents of the state.
In other places, they hope that a cautious public will approach this concept if the facility can do more, not less.
In New York City, traffic officials are trying to develop a tax facility that would be equipped to pay extra parking hours, provide mileage-based insurance, and collect speed data from other drivers so motorists can avoid traffic jams.
“The motorists will be willing to get involved because of the value of the benefits offered to them,” the city’s projection document states.
However, some transport designers would like to know if all the discussions about paying per kilometre are not just a big problem.
Officials from the San Francisco Bay Area Metropolitan Transportation Committee say Congress could easily solve the problem of a bankrupt Road Trust Fund by raising gasoline taxes.
A one-off or annual tax could be imposed on drivers of hybrid or other cars that do not consume a lot of fuel, so they will pay a fair share.
“There is no need for radical surgery if you are rich enough to take aspirin,” said Randy Rentschler, director of the Committee on Legislation and Public Affairs.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of drivers will be worried about their privacy and many other things.
Sobotka is negotiating for the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD.
Social democracies are crumbling, people and Babis talk together and plan a common course of action.
If the social democrats come to terms within a few weeks, they will sit down at the negotiating table with perfectly matched partners, who will put on the table a ready-made list of demands, including ministerial posts.
The <0xC4><0x8C>SSD envoys will then either swallow the sour coalition grapes, or nod to the roaring minority government.
Bohuslav Sobotka came across for the first time after four days on the wave of sympathy.
Yesterday, he failed to master the political body and, above all, to force the convicted liars to resign.
Only he is a confirmed negotiator for the party so far, the other team members will be allowed only after the key meeting of the Central Executive Committee (CEC).
I apologized to the members of the committee and now to the citizens.
He should not lie, in his personal life or in public.
"It was a mistake," said Michal Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek, the closest leader of Social Democracy.
He added that he did not sleep in the post of first vice-president.
"I will announce my decision on November 10 at the <0xC3><0x9A>VV," Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek said.
Similarly, the vice-president of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, Zden<0xC4><0x9B>k <0xC5><0xA0>kromach, and the head of the parliamentary club, Jeronym Tejc, spoke.
He said he had been elected only two days ago.
The two MPs then said they would do everything to make the 50-member club of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD sound with one voice.
Michal Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek put the crown on the absurd theatre with a sentence: "I have been a member of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD for fifteen years, I have always been loyal to its brand and respected the decisions of the party authorities."
Or another lie in a live broadcast.
Or, in calling for Sobotko’s resignation and his expulsion from the negotiating team, did he forget that the August presidential election with 57 percent decided that Bohuslav Sobotka is the party’s candidate for prime minister?
The head of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, however, by convening the <0xC3><0x9A>VV, made a powerful army of enemies until next Sunday.
His opponents have ten days to flood the emails of 192 members of this body and the media with a meeting of various gossip and rumors, possibly to recall the real mistakes of Sobotko's political career.
The dirty laundry will be heavily washed, there will be signs of dark alliances between the coal-fired Zden<0xC4><0x9B>k Bakala and the Sobotk wing.
The friendly relationship between Bohuslav Sobotka and the influential lawyer Radek Pokorn<0xC3><0xBD> will be discussed.
They erupt disputes in the South Moravian or Moravian Silesian organization <0xC4><0x8C>SSD.
The mayor of Ostrava and Sobotka’s ally, Peter Kajnar, said: “I signed Charter 77 so that the country would not be ruled by idiots.”
If the VVV had already met this weekend, the liars would probably have been forced to ritually sacrifice their functions.
The traitors will sprinkle their heads with ashes and stay.
And the currently winning head of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD then ends with the nickname Bohuslav Pyrrha.
Martin Doctor on problems with the Olympic Games in Sochi: Communication with the Russians is difficult
The corners of his mouth hint at a slight smile, and then he exhales deeply: "It's difficult."
According to Martin Doktor, working with the organizational team of the 2014 Olympics in Sochi is a bit more difficult.
What happened at the last Olympics, we can forget.
"Nothing works the same," says the head of the Czech Olympic mission.
What exactly is going on?
A lot of things work slower and not so accurately.
It's so confusing.
From the point of view of invoices, they are relatively fast, from the point of view of providing information about essential things, not so much anymore.
For perhaps three months, we have been looking forward to receiving information on how the individual villages will be officially labeled, so that we can do a lot of things accordingly.
We're still waiting and they're still saying they're communicating this thing.
They are still communicating in a lot of things.
Is there an Olympic Village at least?
But this is no longer a catastrophic situation.
A month ago, we walked through empty rooms.
Fortunately, the houses are worth it.
What does it mean that they are empty?
Are the floors ready?
Just basic concrete, so that was the state a month ago.
But they still have time.
Although there is a danger that by January 26th we will be arriving there as a forerunner, there will still be adhesive.
And if they don't, what will happen?
Do you think President Putin would have pushed the army there?
That's how it's gonna work.
Just so it's not that the Olympic villages = potemkin villages.
Rather, they are at risk of failing, for example, to adjust the roads, not to finish the details.
Maybe they'll have roads in such a state that we'll have to take the London Games heels with us.
But I believe they're going to put it all together somehow.
How many Czech athletes could go to Sochi?
Now there are about 78 of them, although depending on the nomination criteria, that number changes.
Maybe the skaters will probably ride in the three of them.
There is no doubt about the speed skater Martina Sáblíková either, but otherwise it is in development.
Are you still on your way to Sochi?
No, if nothing happens, I should fly there until January 26.
What the houses in the Olympic village will look like, we know.
We even measured some things ourselves on the subway, so we don't just believe in sketches.
We are also preparing a number of other things, including transport.
And what does the chief of mission do a hundred days before the Olympics?
I am preparing for the annual evaluation of the individual Olympic sports and I am doing a regular agenda in terms of communication with the organizing committee in Sochi.
Putin has promised an ecological Olympics, his plan has huge secret landfills
Fans of winter sports are already cutting a metre before the start of the Olympic Games in Sochi, others are increasingly concerned about their preparation.
The Russian Olympics, however, will not start until February, is facing another scandal.
The Russians seem to fail to fulfill the promise that the preparations and holding of the games will not disturb the nature of the Krasnodar region at the foot of the Caucasus, where thousands of athletes and tens of thousands of visitors will go in four months.
After the Olympics in Vancouver, the Russians had a bar built very high, and the Canadian Games were the most environmentally friendly in the history of the Olympics.
However, it seems that the commitment of Russian President Vladimir Putin to organize games with "zero waste" has long been taken for granted.
AP reporters last week discovered a huge landfill of construction materials in the village of Ach<0xC5><0xA1>tyr near Sochi.
Thus, a landfill full of building materials, tyres, canisters and insulation foams was found already in August by environmentalists, which they immediately reported.
The Russian authorities have stumbled and the landfill has disappeared.
But only for a moment.
Last week, reporters were given a glimpse of a landfill the size of three football fields.
She is not the only one, several such places have arisen in the area, described the British newspaper The Times.
The Russian Railways, a state monopoly, are working on the site, which is building an approximately sixty-kilometre route between the airport in Sochi and the sports resort.
The company, which has already swallowed 280 billion rubles, was run by one of Putin’s close associates, Vladimir Jakunin.
In August, the railways were prevented from setting up the landfill by one of the subcontractors.
The locals are already desperate.
According to residents of Achstyr, trucks full of waste material have been running around the village for three months, day and night.
According to experts, the waste threatens to contaminate the local Mzymtu River, other streams and eventually the Black Sea.
“The water from here will contaminate Sochi’s water springs for the next ten to fifteen years,” Vladimir Kimayev of the EWNC told the British newspaper.
Illegal landfills are not the only problem of the Russian organizational committee and the government.
The most expensive Olympics in history, according to the opposition, are one big tunnel.
For comparison, the Sochi Games will cost $51 billion, while the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics went to $43 billion.
Last year’s London Games cost just 19 billion and the Vancouver Games just nine billion.
In addition to corruption scandals, project delays and fears that there will be enough snow in the end, there have also been reports that human rights are not being respected when working on the exhibition of sports facilities and infrastructure.
Last month, one of the workers sewed his mouth in protest that he had not been paid for two months.
Many are also worried about how Russian organizers match up with a new law that bans the promotion of homosexuality during the games.
Some visitors are going to support Russian gays at the Olympics.
A young couple has grown up to live with their parents, a new house offers privacy for both generations
The Japanese studio Tai and Associates has been tasked with designing a house on a plot that lies on the corner of two streets, while the plot itself is somewhat weighed.
The request also stated that there would be two generations living in the house who would like to live together, but each should have its own clearly separated space.
The younger couple also needed a small office.
The house stands on the corner of two streets and on a slightly sloping plot.
Therefore, the architects decided to place each house in one of the floors of the house.
"In creating the design, we respected the family ties, history and memories associated with the place."
"Three different functions of the house are connected in several ways through the exterior of the object, so everyone is aware of the presence of others, but they have their own privacy," the designers explain.
The home of the parents is on the level of a garden with an old pine tree, to which family traditions and memories are attached.
The individual parts of the house are easily recognizable from the outside, because they differ in the different final finishing of the facades.
While the main segment of the building is made of concrete, the surface of which was shaped using board panels, the part where the office is plastered white and the remaining elements remained in pure concrete design without further modifications.
Many walls of the house are completely glazed, thanks to which the interior of the house is very connected to the exterior.
The home of the parents, more precisely the kitchen, dining room and living room, surrounds a small garden with a tree, which is of great importance to the family.
The connection of the interior with the exterior is underlined by the side wall, which begins in the garden and continues to the living room.
Kitchen space in the home of a young couple.
The young couple enters the house by the main entrance to the hall and from there they climb the stairs to their rooms.
It is the staircase that dominates the interior of the house.
Their construction allows a lot of natural light to pass through them cascadingly.
This is how the architects tried to distinguish the house from others and impress it with something unique.
The home of the young couple is treated as one open space with a kitchen area, dining room and living room together.
Only a glazed wall with sliding doors separates it from the terrace.
Living area with dining and kitchen area in the home of a young couple.
The second floor is composed as one large open space, which passes freely to the terrace, from where there is a nice view of the Gulf of Tokyo.
The office itself on the top floor is conceived in a pure combination of white and black.
The staircase is the dominant element of the interior of the house.
The young couple enters the house by the main entrance, finds themselves in the entrance hall and then climbs up the stairs from there.
Defend academic liberties, this applies to the Zemans and the ODS.
In recent months, I have repeatedly called on students, educators and the leadership of high schools and universities in several regions to defend academic freedoms against the election campaign conducted by President Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Zeman at schools.
I've met with more or less success.
The rector of Masaryk University in Brno, who refused the lecture of the honorary president of SPOZ - Zemanovci in the pre-election period, even received retaliation in the form of no invitation to celebrate the national holiday of the Czech Republic.
Here is a list of the representatives of schools that were no longer so brave and made Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Zeman’s visit possible: Technical Higher Education in Brno, Hladnov Gymnasium in Ostrava, Business School in Ostrava, Business Academy in Cologne, J.E. Purkyn<0xC4><0x9B> University in <0xC3><0x9A>stí nad Labem.
Now in Pardubice we are meeting with the continuation of the promotion of politics at universities.
Simeon Karamazov, a newly elected member of the ODS, dean of the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Pardubice, refuses to resign from his academic position and, moreover, it seems normal to him.
Professor, it's really not the same as if you were to stay, for example, as mayor of a small town.
Would you like to join the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD hetmans, who at the same time forge the function of MP and hetman and, like them, degrade both professions?
This is because you tell people that you can handle both of these demanding functions with the left back.
I know, we have an example of Michal Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ka, who can even handle dozens of functions at once.
But this is not exactly an example of the person you should follow.
We will also find the opposite and positive example of MUDr. <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>pánka Fra<0xC5><0x88>ková, who prefers to leave the parliamentary post, so that she can fully devote herself to the management of the city of Pardubice.
The main reason for my recommendation to leave the office of Dean, however, is that you violate the apoliticality of the academic grounds of the University of Pardubice.
The management of Pardubice ODS sees your current activities in both positions as an advantage for the University.
However, you will be able to help your "school" even without remaining a dean.
I think your students will have the same opinion as I and the Rector Miroslav Ludwig.
Therefore, consider your resignation and keep your face.
Otherwise, it may happen that the voters will count for you in the next election.
And it doesn't have to be long.
In Kunovice, the bubbles of cabbage, they do not add chemistry to it
More than a thousand tons of sauerkraut will be produced in Slovak Fruta Kunovice, which belongs to the Hamé food group in the coming months.
The season started here in October and will last for about six months.
Healthy delight here since 1925 is still produced in the traditional way, that is, by stepping directly in the big dances.
In modern industrial times, this is a rarity.
Our employees will find a 10-kilometre route in return.
Fifteen to thirty tons of cabbage will fit into each of the ten tanks, filling one takes three shifts," said Slovak Fruit Director David Kladroba.
The heads of cabbage are transported directly from their fields to the premises of the company, mainly from Ostro<0xC5><0xBE>sk and B<0xC5><0x99>eclavsk.
Fruit employees then clean the vegetables, remove the buds and throw them into the round machine.
From here, already chopped cabbage falls into pools six meters deep, where treadmills dressed in white clothes and heels work tirelessly.
This expels unwanted air.
The last stepped layer of cabbage is covered with canvas and loaded with water.
"The yellow currant then matures for six to eight weeks for spontaneous milk fermentation without any addition of fermentation-promoting substances," the director of Kladroba stressed.
The natural process corresponds to the production in domestic conditions, individual layers of workers sprinkle salt and cumin.
After fermentation, the cabbage travels to the filling line.
It is packaged in a sweetened infusion into bags or glasses and undergoes sterilization.
Hamé supplies sauerkraut mainly to the domestic and Slovak markets.
Interest is also registered in some other countries, such as the United Kingdom, Ireland and Canada.
Snowden is willing to "cooperate" with Germany in connection with US surveillance
Edward Snowden, a US intelligence whistleblower, said he was willing to go to Berlin to hand over evidence to the German parliament if the U.S. National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander were unable to provide answers to questions about their activities.
German MP Hans-Christian Sträbele met with Mr Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he was granted asylum, and discussed with him the possibility of testifying in Germany.
In a letter to the media in Berlin on Friday, Mr Snowden said: “Although the result of my efforts has been demonstrably positive, the government continues to treat the opposition as gangsters and is trying to criminalize political speeches with heavy lawsuits that don’t make room for it.”
But telling the truth is not a crime.
In this letter, Mr. Snowden said he believes that support from the international community could persuade the U.S. government to withdraw charges of crimes against him.
The charges brought by the U.S. Department of Justice include espionage and theft of state property.
German Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich told Zeit Online: “If Mr. Snowden is ready to speak to German officials, we will find a way to make it possible.”
Tensions between the U.S. and Germany began to rise when claims surfaced that the NSA was listening to Chancellor Angela Merkel’s phone.
Thomas Oppermann, a member of parliament who heads the parliamentary panel that oversees the news, said that if there was any opportunity to question Mr Snowden as a witness “without exposing himself to danger and completely destroying relations with the United States,” it should be done.
Mr Sträbele, a member of parliament for the German Greens, posted a photo of him and Mr Snowden on Twitter.
Two German journalists accompanied him on his way to Russia.
Mr. Sträbele said that according to a former NSA contract lawyer, Mr. Snowden would not be able to return to Russia if he left once.
If Mr Snowden were to testify in Germany, he would need assurances that he would be “safe there,” a member of parliament said.
Mr. Snowden said in his letter that he was facing a harsh and persistent campaign of persecution that forced him to leave home.
But he said the world’s reaction to his “act of political expression” gave him courage.
Citizens across the country and senior officials – including those in the United States – appreciated the discovery of an unreasonable system of ubiquitous public service surveillance.
The letter includes an offer to cooperate with the German authorities "until the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved."
We're sorry to kill you, but we're innocent, Khmer Rouge officials say.
Nuon Chea was number two in the Khmer Rouge hierarchy and Khieu Samphan is a former head of state.
Under the Khmer Rouge government, which relied on a mixture of Maoism and nationalism between 1975 and 1979, more than three million Cambodians, or at least a quarter of the population at the time, were killed as a result of exhaustion, hunger, disease, torture and execution.
The commander of the infamous S-21 prison was sentenced to life imprisonment by the International Criminal Tribunal for Cambodia in 2010.
Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan are charged with genocide and crimes against humanity, including torture, enslavement and murder.
Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan defended themselves by believing that they acted in the best interests of the nation and did not know what the real extent of killing was.
"It's easy to say that I should have known everything, understood everything, and therefore intervened and corrected the situation," Khieu Samphan said in a statement.
Do you really think I wanted this to happen to my people?
The reality is that I had no authority,” he added.
Nuon Chea said he had never ordered the Khmer Rouge cadres to "treat people badly or kill them, deny them food or commit genocide".
But he admitted "moral responsibility" for the dead.
"I would like to sincerely apologize to the public, to the victims, to their families, to all the Cambodian people," he said.
Fifty-five-year-old Bin Sivla, who lost eleven relatives under the Khmer Rouge regime, told AFP she could not accept Nuon Chea’s apology.
"He lied to us."
"He just wants to be acquitted."
"She doesn't care about the others," she said.
"If he had not given orders, his subordinates would not have been killed," she added, saying the leaders of the Khmer Rouge were "worse than monsters."
He was also to become the "Foreign Minister" of the Khmer Rouge regime, Ieng Sary, who died in March this year.
In September 2012, his wife Ieng Thirith, then Minister of Social Affairs, found the court incapable of prosecuting him for dementia.
The leader of the Khmer Rouge Pol Pot died in 1998.
Frontier Airlines to pay for carry-on baggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to $100 for hand luggage on board during its flights.
Frontier Airlines plans to introduce a fee of up to $100 for carry-on baggage and $2 for coffee or soda, although in their announcement on Wednesday they said passengers will be able to keep the entire can.
The new carry-on baggage charge applies to luggage in the upper storage compartment, so small baggage under the seat will continue to be free of charge.
Frontier says it will charge $25 if the fee is paid in advance, and $100 if passengers with payment will wait until they arrive at the gate.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O’Malley said the $100 fee was intended to encourage passengers to take care of the payment in advance.
"We would not like to collect this fee," she said.
The airlines began charging for the first and second baggage in 2008.
Passengers tried to avoid these charges and cd in hand luggage hidden in the storage space as much as they could, so there was often no room in this space.
Fees are one way for passengers to learn to take less stuff on board.
O’Malley said that the purpose of this new fee is not really to get more money.
The fact is that Frontier’s most loyal customers have made it quite clear that finding a place in the upper storage space is becoming increasingly difficult.
Passengers who purchase tickets on the company’s website will not pay.
This means that one passenger in the queue at Frontier’s gate can bring baggage for which he will not pay anything, while the other passenger in the queue will pay $100 for the same baggage.
O'Malley said the website and check-in procedures will be modified to ensure passengers are aware of the fee before they arrive at the gate.
Frontier’s new carry-on baggage charge will not be in effect until the summer, but a date has not yet been set.
Passengers often complain about baggage fees and other fees, but airlines love them.
They claim that handling baggage costs money, and passengers who request this service should pay for it.
Many on Wall Street see the additional baggage charge as a sign that airlines are trying to raise enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.
Most, however, did not reach the baggage allowance.
Spirit Airlines was the first to charge for carry-on baggage three years ago, and another low-cost airline, Allegiant Air, followed suit later.
The only company that also has such fees is the Hungarian Wizz Air, says airline advisor Jay Sorensen, who closely monitors the additional fees.
In his December 2011 report, he estimated that Spirit’s carry-on baggage charge would amount to $50 million per year.
Sorensen, a former Midwest Airlines executive, recently flew with Spirit and was amazed by what he saw at the gate when passengers encountered an unusual Spirit baggage charge.
“Embarking on an airplane was the smoothest thing I’ve ever seen in my aviation career,” he said.
I was expecting to see a gnashing of teeth and a quarrel at the gate.
The plane was full, he said, "and the embarkation took place in an instant."
Frontier will also charge fees for coffee, tea, soda and juice, following the Spirit model.
Frontier said passengers who get lemonade or juice can keep the whole can and coffee will be added free of charge.
Water will continue to be provided free of charge.
US Airways briefly attempted to impose beverage charges in 2008, but after passengers complained about it seven months later, it withdrew and no other major airline imitated it.
Frontier’s last move to charge for carry-on baggage unless a passenger buys a flight directly from this airline is its last attempt to direct customers directly to its website.
Airlines pay online travel vendors, such as Orbitz, from $10 to $25 for each ticket sold.
This has given all airlines an incentive to get passengers to buy directly from them, rather than through online travel agencies.
Frontier, however, has gone further in this area.
In September, she began giving customers who bought through an online travel agency only half a mile under the loyalty program.
On Wednesday, she cut the mileage reward to 25 percent of the route.
So a 1,000-mile journey with Frontier bought through an online travel agency means a 250-mile reward.
The company also allows customers to choose their seat in advance only if they make a purchase directly through Frontier’s website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base in its hometown of Denver, but its business is shrinking and losing money.
According to financial results reported on Wednesday by company partner Republic Airways Holdings, sales fell by 9% and transport capacity fell by nearly 13% in the first quarter.
With the sale of this airline, Republic is also trying to solve the financial problems of Frontier.
The NSA is not blaming hackers for the collapse of its website, it is blaming it for an “internal error.”
The secret National Security Agency said last Friday that its website fell for a few hours last week because of an internal error, not because of an attack by hackers, as some claimed on the Internet.
"The NSA.gov site was not accessible for several hours tonight due to an internal error that occurred during the regular update," the agency said in an email statement.
The problem will be resolved during this evening.
The claim that the failure was caused by a DDoS (distributed denial of service) attack is not true.
Earlier this evening, online server sensors detected that the NSA’s websites hadn’t worked for at least six hours, and the pages were still unavailable to some users.
Earlier, an NSA spokesman told ABC News that the agency’s internal sensitive networks were “not at all” at risk.
The spokesman said no classified information was at risk.
At least one group of hacking activists on the Internet claimed to be responsible for shutting down NSA sites through a DDoS attack.
DDoS attacks are designed to flood the target website with information until the servers are overloaded and the page crashes.
This cybernetic tactic is relatively simple and the purpose of the attacks is not to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
Former NSA super-secret agency, once nicknamed No such agency, in recent months has become the focus of public attention after a string of revelations of foreign and domestic surveillance programs and the target of biting criticism, summarizing the product of stealing NSA secret files from the agency.
This growing controversy surrounding the agency has sparked earlier speculation that today’s accident was the result of a targeted cyber operation.
Bombardier's profits declined as a result of a drop in supplies and orders
Canadian aircraft and train maker Bombardier reported a 15 percent drop in net profit on Thursday due to smaller orders and deliveries of aircraft in the third quarter and contractual problems in the train unit.
Bombardier, which is based in Montreal, has also not released any aerial test data for its new CSeries aircraft, nor has it offered up-to-date information as to whether the aircraft will comply with its ambitious plan to start commercial operations from next September.
After the launch test flight about a month and a half ago, the aircraft flew only three times, raising the question of whether the test phase was going well.
The results did not meet the estimates and the Toronto Stock Exchange fell by 8 percent.
State-owned bank analyst Cameron Doerksen on Thursday downgraded the rating from a "higher yield" to a "sector performance" with the expectation that the stock market will experience limited growth in the next quarter or two.
“While we mostly expected smaller aircraft deliveries, the profit margin in the transport sector has significantly disappointed us,” Doerksen said in a report to clients.
As the trial program continues, we believe Bombardier will receive new orders for CSeries aircraft.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect the market to be more skeptical about this program.
Bombardier hopes that CSeries aircraft will penetrate the bottom area of the market, which is now dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test plane was discovered in March, and after a few months of delay, the first flight took place in September.
However, the number of binding orders for CSeries aircraft reaches a modest 177, as potential buyers are waiting for the test flight results to be able to verify the company's claims regarding the low consumption and cost savings of this transport aircraft.
Currently, there are a total of 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and operators.
CEO Pierre Beaudoin expected Bombardier to reach its target of 300 binding orders when the first aircraft was put into commercial use.
On Thursday, analysts and the media also assured that the program is proceeding as planned.
"The test aircraft did not stay on the ground longer than expected," Beaudoin said in a conference call, noting that ground tests and software updates were scheduled during the aircraft's shutdown.
Each manufacturer plans to do it differently.
We decided to take the first flight and then focus on updating and that’s what we did.
This will take place throughout the flight schedule.
According to Bombardier, the second of the five test aircraft is expected to take off in the coming weeks and the others soon after.
Analysts are skeptical that the first customer could start operating a CSeries aircraft 12 months after its first flight.
Bombardier claims that it has evaluated its plan to put the aircraft into service and will provide updated information in the coming months.
“This slow pace of flight testing – although in line with Bombardier’s internal plan – is likely to reinforce our view that commissioning will be postponed to the first quarter of 2015,” Doerksen said.
Of $172 million, or 9 cents per share in the previous year, Bombardier’s net profit fell to $147 million in the third quarter ending September 30, or 8 cents per share.
Adjusted earnings per share remained unchanged at 9 cents.
Turnover fell marginally from $4.2 billion to $4.1 billion.
According to Thomson Reuters’ IBES system, analysts expected a return of 10 cents per share and a turnover of 4.56 billion.
The fourth largest aircraft manufacturer said it had delivered only 45 aircraft in the quarter compared to 57 aircraft a year earlier.
Net orders fell from 83 aircraft to 26.
Non-performing contracts in the Air Division amounted to 32.9 billion as of 30 September, which remains unchanged as of 31 December.
“The results in aviation were in line with our outlook, but the low order receipt and overall market condition disappointed us,” Beaudoin said.
Revenue in the aviation industry fell by 13% to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world’s largest train manufacturer, said revenue in this division rose nearly 11 percent to $2.1 billion.
Unfulfilled contracts in transport amounted to 32.6 billion as at 30 September, which is marginal growth compared to 31 December.
The profit margin in the transport division was influenced by problems with the implementation of several large contracts.
Leaders said new outlooks will be provided in the fourth quarter.
Bombardier shares, which also announced the arrival of Google Chief Financial Officer Patrick Pichette, fell 8.5 percent during trading on Thursday afternoon to $4.83.
Brazil's Embraer SA, the third-largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and Bombardier's closest competitor, announced a 10 percent decline in quarterly profit on Thursday.
Cocaine Addict Lawyer Warning Mafia of Police Investigation Is in Prison
Basharat Ditta, 42, was to pass information to the king of the underworld, Neil Scarbrough.
The lawyer was worried that his drug addiction would turn out.
The Liverpool Crown Court sentenced him to three years in prison.
A top lawyer who informed the drug mafia about a major police investigation because he feared his drug addiction would be revealed was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, had, after becoming a suspect in cocaine use, handed over sensitive information to Neil Scarbrough, the head of the underworld, about an investigation into his drug smuggling activities.
A lawyer whose nickname was "Bash" (the party) and who was criminally acclaimed as the best attorney, was arrested at his home in 2011 after police tracking Scarborough, whom he represented in previous drug cases.
Cops saw Sarborough, 32, as he left three bags of cocaine in his Blackburn, Lancashire, lawyer’s house while he was having dinner with his colleagues at the Law Society.
Based on tests that found traces of cocaine in his hair, on his wallet and on his credit cards, the investigation revealed that Ditta was a regular Class A drug user.
During the eight-month period, from January to August 2011, he tried penitently to obtain information about the arrests of two men in favour of Scarborough and his associate.
All four suspects were tracked at the time as part of a large investigation into the trafficking of heroin and cocaine in the areas of Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
After police seized heroin and cocaine worth around <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million during a series of raids, along with <0xC2><0xA3>200,000 in cash, another 32 people ended up in jail.
Ditta, 42, was passing on information to criminals for fear of his cocaine addiction.
Today, Ditta, who works at Forbes Solicitors, a Blackburn-based law firm, experienced a shameful moment before the Liverpool Crown Court when he was found guilty after a three-week trial of having defended the enforcement of justice in two cases.
During the hearing, he confessed to possession of cocaine.
The lawyer's fall came after Scarborough's police investigation revealed that he was in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two detectives followed the suspect, recorded his arrival at Ditt's house, and saw him place 60 percent clean drugs under a lawyer's basket in a black golf glove.
Subsequently, Scarborough was in regular telephone conversation with Ditta, who was having dinner at the Blackburn Rovers football stadium in Ewood Park.
The lawyer returned home, where he found the drugs, and there were nine interviews between the two people.
The court heard that there were traces of Class A drugs in his hair, his wallet and his credit cards, and that Ditta was a “regular user” of cocaine.
Ditta was later arrested, but denied cocaine use, saying he had spoken to the suspected dealer because he was his client, arguing that their conversation falls within “confidential communication.”
During his arrest, Ditta took his wallet and tried to get a few credit cards out of it, but all were detained and hair samples were taken from him.
During the police interrogation, he said that he operated an office both at his home address and at the workplace, and that clients visited him at home because of work issues.
However, the court heard that after the key arrests, he contacted major players in the drug supply chain, some of whom he previously represented, to tell them what detectives know about them.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said: “Anyone else is more aware of the fact that they must not violate the law than a lawyer in the criminal justice field.”
Mr. Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a legal representative and of getting into too close contact with a particular client.
The relationship we're talking about here isn't just about a drug dealer, it's about a drug dealer who supplies his own lawyer with drugs.
Some of his interviews were undoubtedly legitimate because he was his lawyer.
But it went far beyond the usual lawyer-client relationship.
The police investigated as much as they could to allow them to continue their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta did not bring good reputation to his profession, but rather dishonored it.
He was too close to certain of his clients, especially Scarborough, and allowed his independence to be violated.
Ditta refused, stating: “If I were a corrupt lawyer who I am not, and I wanted to pass on the information to Mr. Scarborough, I would not wait 15 hours, but I would do it immediately.”
After hearing the case, Lancashire Police Inspector Lee Halstead said: “Mr. Ditta himself became a criminal attorney when he began acquiring drugs from organized criminals.”
His addiction to cocaine made him hopelessly weak and vulnerable to the intentions of leading members of organized crime groups, who tasked him with collecting valuable information about police investigations.
Legal representatives must abide by the highest principles of integrity and must inspire public confidence and a sense of trust in them.
Mr. Ditta betrayed this trust and tried to hide behind the cloak of his profession.
The Lancashire Serious and Organized Crime Unit has been conducting an investigation against Mr. Ditt, which also convicted him of three cocaine possession cases and now for obstructing justice, demonstrating our commitment to bring criminals to justice.
This case should serve as a warning to all criminals that no one is outside the reach of the law.
We'll find you and bring you to our courts.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after being convicted of colluding to supply heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Thirty-five other people involved in trafficking were arrested for a total of 153 years for drug offences.
On his website, Ditta held an online interview about himself, in which he said that his dream job would be to legally represent clients from the U.S. death row, as a guest at dinner, and as a motivation for the job, he would wish Muhammad Ali to be an inequality.
He was negotiating government with Klaus and <0xC5><0xA0>pidla.
Now the folks sent Jan Kasala against Babi<0xC5><0xA1>.
The people won fourteen deputies in the elections, that is, only a third of the number of Social Democrats or representatives of the ANO.
But they are entering into government negotiations with at least one advantage.
The team, which has already begun to argue about the outlines of a possible coalition, has Jan Kasala - a man who, as a populist, adjusted the conditions for government participation in 1992, 1996, 2002 and 2006.
Neither the Social Democrats nor Andrei Babi<0xC5><0xA1> have such a matador on their side.
This time it will be reminiscent of the first negotiations in 1992, when the ODS was also a completely new party.
"The experience was minimal at the time," Kasal estimates how this year's talks will develop.
Kenya's press is outraged by controversial media law
“It’s a frightening news and it’s time to ask what will stop Parliament from simply sweeping the independence of the judiciary tomorrow,” the newspaper said, calling the bill unconstitutional.
“This law is strict and very repressive and we reject it,” said Cyrus Kamau, CEO of Capital Group, which also includes CapitalFM, one of the most recognized independent radio stations and news websites.
He said the new media tribunal "will always be pre-empted because it is an extended hand of the government" and that restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya's position in the global economy.
"I hope the president will hear us, and we will ask him to reject this bill and return it to the MPs," he said.
According to the Star newspaper, the bill effectively passes the government “full control of the media” and Standard newspapers say that democracy and freedom of expression in Kenya “have sustained a hard blow,” and criticize the bill as “strict.”
The bill comes amid a series of measures aimed at strengthening national security right after the September attack by an Islamic gunman in the Westgate shopping mall.
Kenyan media turned their anger when they broadcast a security camera footage of soldiers allegedly robbing a luxury goods store at the scene of the attack.
The police director responded by summoning two journalists and a chief media officer for questioning, but the summons was later withdrawn under pressure from the media.
According to the new bill, media companies can be fined up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and individual journalists up to one million along with the risk of being "dismissed" or denied official journalistic accreditation.
The court also has the right to confiscate the property of the offender if the fine is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, “a single fine is enough to wipe out most of the radio stations.”
It is also stated that these measures may have a liquidating impact on what is called the Kenyan “living blogosphere”.
Politicians know that when the media is silenced, they can do what they want with impunity.
“You never know what can happen,” Nation journalist Mutuma Mathiu wrote, describing the Kenyan media as a key source of a system of mutual control and balance in public life.
“If we leave it to the politicians, they will lead the country to bankruptcy and throw us back to hunting and gathering,” he wrote.
Lawmakers in Kenya have been the subject of public criticism in the past.
In May, they voted to abolish the cuts ordered by the national wage agency and to restore their fat wages to around 532,000 untaxed shillings a month, which ranks among the highest in the world.
Young Czechs know that they have to save.
Most of them don’t even know what the interest rate is.
More and more Czechs are putting money aside.
However, they do not reach the champions in savings in the region.
Austrians save the most money, saving an average of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>181 a month.
The Czechs save a little more than the people in Slovakia.
This is according to a survey of the Erste Savings Barometer in Central and Eastern Europe.
It also showed that the mood of the contractors is improving and two-thirds of the respondents plan to put more money on the sidelines.
While the Czechs are roughly in the middle of the staggering list, in Romania and Serbia people still use very little of the savings products.
For example, almost every other Serb, according to the survey, saves himself at home "under the pillow".
In the country this year, the number of those who save higher amounts per month has increased.
Last year, between <0xC2><0xA3>1,000 and <0xC2><0xA3>2,000 a month was spent on various types of savings by 26 per cent of respondents, this year it is five per cent more.
The average monthly storage in the year-on-year comparison, however, fell slightly to 2078 crowns.
The biggest hit among savings products is pension supplements.
This favors 54 percent of Czechs, while three years ago it was the most popular way to evaluate savings for only 36 percent of people.
On the contrary, the popularity of building savings is declining, as compared to last year, the interest in investment funds has also declined significantly.
Only 16 percent of respondents use it, compared to nearly a quarter last year.
The survey also found that although people consider it important to save money, most of them do not know what returns they make on individual products.
Especially young people under the age of 30 do not know how their money is paid.
On the contrary, the oldest group of respondents has the best awareness of the profitability of their saved money, among people over fifty years of age, it is known by 73 percent of respondents.
In the international comparison of the Erste Group, Czechs lead in the use of online banking, which is regularly used by 44 percent of people.
This is followed by the Slovaks and Austrians with a 12% gap.
The United Nations celebrates the new goals of the fight against poverty
The United Nations is immediately beginning to work on a new set of Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) that will replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) that were introduced 12 years ago to tackle global poverty.
Prior to the UN Summit on Sustainable Development, which started overnight in Rio de Janeiro, Australian diplomats played a key role in advancing the “Sustainable Development Goals” to replace the 2015 MDGs.
They were included in the final concept of the document, which will be approved by world leaders, including Ms. Gillard, during the summit.
U.N. Secretary-General Pan Ki-mun said overnight at the summit that now is the time to “raise above national interests.”
“I am pleased that the Member States have agreed to launch and take over the process to implement the overall Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs),” he said.
The SDGs will build on the progress achieved under the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the post-2015 development agenda.
I will make every effort to fulfil the mandate given to me by the Member States and to implement our vision of the Sustainable Development Goals, which builds on the success of the MDGs.
Mozambique's security concerns escalate due to conflict of strong personalities
Under the statue of Samora Machela, Mozambique’s founding president, thousands of people gathered in the center of Maputo to call out peace slogans for a rare public demonstration.
“We want peace back; we want stability,” said Vanessa de Sousa, CEO of the investment firm.
Fearing for the future of her country, she traded corporate clothing for a T-shirt adorned with the inscription “we demand security” in Portuguese and joined the crowd at Independence Square in the capital on Thursday.
For two weeks, reports of conflicts between government forces and the Renamo party came almost daily, one of the worst clashes since the peace agreement more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once an infamous rebel movement, originally backed by the white government in Rhodesia and then by the apartheid government in South Africa as part of efforts to destabilize the country's independent government.
After a peace agreement in 1992, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe that an open conflict is unlikely to erupt again in the country, but recent events have scared foreign investors and locals.
The fast-growing economy is at stake, as discoveries of extensive coastal oil and coal reserves in the northwest may bring in more than $50 billion in investments over the next few years from companies such as Brazil’s Rio Tinto and Vale, Italy’s Eni and the US’ Anadarko.
The ruling Frelimo party, a dominant political force since 1975, and Renamo blame each other for the tensions that have arisen.
The Renamo Party claims that the government sparked the latest conflicts by launching an attack on their members on September 17 in Sofala province, the traditional bastion of the Renamo Party.
The violent assault on former rebels subsequently culminated when government forces attacked the Renamo party base and attempted to kill Afonso Dhlakamu, the group's leader, Renamo's spokesman Fernando Mazanga told the Financial Times.
The government accuses Renamo of launching conflicts because it allegedly attacked soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has sought to alleviate fears of instability.
Guebuza told AFP on Wednesday that Dhlakama saw himself as a “defeatist” who wanted to use “whatever was left of his strength to try to prove that he could direct the government to make his own decisions.”
Both Frelimo and Renamo say they want to avoid war.
But fears grew when Mr Mazanga was quoted as saying that Renamo was withdrawing from the 1992 peace agreement.
He told FT that he meant that Frelimo no longer respected the agreement.
"Our goal is to return to the negotiations, but with seriousness," Mr Mazanga said.
Previous talks between these parties have done little to alleviate tensions between these parties, stirred up by a series of clashes this year.
It’s a rift between two great personalities (Guebuza and Dhlakama), said Joseph Hanlon, a lecturer at the Open University and Mozambique expert.
Neither of them is a good negotiator and neither of them is ready to make the necessary concessions.
The Renamo party, which has sought electoral changes, has already said it would boycott municipal elections scheduled for November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators interpreted the use of force as an effort by the dying movement to gain benefits and financial benefits from the government.
Renamo's electoral share has been declining since 1992, while the newer Democratic Movement of Mozambique (DHM), which was founded by a former member of the Renamo party, is expected to improve its electoral position.
Mr. Mazanga says that Mr. Guebuza – who will end his second term next year – wants to destroy the democracy of this country.
“He doesn’t want a multi-party democratic system, he doesn’t want transparent elections, he doesn’t want peace because he doesn’t want to let go of the presidential office,” Mazanga said.
It is unclear what options the Renamo party has, but it has carried out disastrous terrorist attacks on police stations and vehicles on the key road between north and south.
Most of the clashes took place in the province of Sofala, several hundred kilometers away from the capital Maputo, but where the city of Beira, the port on which mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, rely in their coal exports, is located.
In June, Rio suspended the use of the railroad for about a week when Renamo threatened to attack the line.
Mr Mazanga did not want to comment on the question of whether Renato would repeat his threat.
Renamo wanted to “warn the international community that the situation in Mozambique is not good,” Mazanga said.
Instability has increased frustration from the government, says Fernando Lima, head of independent media company Mediacoop, and many people are also concerned about corruption, the slow pace of development and the recent flood of kidnappings.
“People think that the responsibility for the future of the country lies solely with the government and the president, and that it is he who is supposed to find solutions to the problems,” he said.
Demonstrator Omar Sultane says people just want stability.
“No one cares about Renamo or Frelimo, people just want peace again, they want free access to the roads,” he says.
Children should learn myths and legends as “models for the way of life,” the author says.
Stories of Thor may show that "coarse power cannot be equal to clever cunning", while Arthurian legends reveal how important it is to have a dream.
Much of the myth would be “too wild to teach at school, too scandalous, and in some cases too obscene,” said Crossley-Holland, who advocates careful selection of age-appropriate works.
“I think it’s great that myths and folklore are already part of education,” he said.
I've been defending this plan for 20 years.
He added that “openly instructive” authors and teachers are among the captivating stories with a “under-threshold” message for children as a “switch-off.”
Crossley-Holland, who translated the Beowulf epic from Anglo-Saxon and also writes the Norwegian Myths (Penguin Book) and the British National Fairy Tales, says: "You can have good intentions, but you can do better by keeping them for yourself."
Perhaps the biggest difference between an adult author writing for adults and an adult author writing for children is the need for a sense of hope.
Not that everything has to be simplified or end in a happy ending, but there must be a natural sense of good and evil.
And it must be subconscious; revealed through the story, not openly established.
The old truth is that it is better to show than to describe.
Brno Observatory Takes Visitors to Space in a New Digitary
At first glance, it is obvious that the hall of the large planetarium has changed in the last six months.
There is a new stage, visitors can plunge into new comfortable seats and over their heads has a 17-metre-diameter dome-shaped projection area from the American company Spitz.
In the middle of the hall is its most important part, a new projector from Japan.
To make the picture perfect, other smaller projectors are scattered around the hall.
Another important part of the whole facility is hidden behind the walls of the hall.
"These are twenty-one computers that generate the image," said the director of the Brno Observatory, Ji<0xC5><0x99>í Du<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
Computers ensure that the image from several projectors does not overlap, but gives a holistic impression.
"Computer performance is thirty to forty times higher than that of conventional personal computers," said Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Hladík, a technician at the observatory.
Digitarium can create a very realistic and plastic model of the night sky, the human body or the bottom of the ocean.
The spectators will thus dwell right in the middle of the universe or the human brain.
Other similar facilities are closest to Warsaw or Hamburg.
The management of the observatory plans to project the purchased shows and its own creation in the hall.
There are two programs on the program on Saturday.
The first is called Astronaut and is intended for adults.
In it, people learn about the training of astronauts, fly into space, turn on centrifugation, and then on visual examples, they will see how the astronauts face the harsh conditions in space.
The second show is for children and is called The Magic Reef - Kaluoka'hina.
It tells the story of a cliff whose colorful inhabitants lived a peaceful life until the eruption of a nearby volcano.
The entire digitarium cost about fifty million crowns, which was paid mainly by the Ministry of Education.
With smaller amounts, the city of Brno and the Observatory contributed from its budget.
The projection area was worth ten million crowns, the projector twelve million.
"The rest was swallowed by audio-visual technology and computers," Du<0xC5><0xA1>ek explained.
The digital installation followed the reconstruction of the entire building, which the observatory underwent two years ago.
According to the director of Du<0xC5><0xA1>ko, 25,000 to 30,000 visitors could come by the end of the year.
We've studied 11 THOUSAND ANNOUNCEMENTS!
We know where they want you to work!
In November of last year, the analysis caught over 11,000 job offers, of which 4,300 were published in the daily press and 6,800 (62%) on the Internet.
The Internet is thus becoming the most important medium for the publication of job offers.
In 2005, when the survey was first conducted, its share was 26 percent.
In the last two surveys (2007, 2010) it stood at about 60 percent.
According to the analysis, the advertising of job opportunities in itself largely reflects the current situation on the labour market.
An example could be a simple comparison of the number of advertisements published during the period of economic prosperity and in times of economic crisis.
For example, in 2007, almost 25,900 ads were published in the same period, less than half in 2012.
The job offer on the Internet is oriented towards a narrower, especially more qualified group of professions.
On the other hand, the job offer in the daily press covers a wider range of professions, including those of the workers, said the author of the analysis Pavlína <0xC5><0xA0>tastnová.
The rate of representation of selected professional groups is different in both media.
On the Internet, ads looking for managers and executives, business representatives, programmers and financial experts were attracted to the top spots.
The position of programmers or managers of small businesses appeared only on the Internet.
In the daily press, the share of these professional professions is significantly lower, on the contrary, the large representation belongs mainly to the service and labor professions.
Of course, education is one of the most common requirements that employers express through an advertising offer.
Other areas studied included the knowledge of foreign languages, especially English.
In the daily press, the requirement for knowledge of a foreign language was stated in three percent of advertisements, on the Internet in 37 percent.
In just two percent of the ads, employers demanded active knowledge of two foreign languages.
Claims for “computer literacy” appeared in 40 percent of ads (in the daily press 11 percent, on the Internet 57 percent).
Practice in the industry was demanded in 54 percent of ads.
Requirements for practice are generally associated with qualified professions.
These are mainly production managers and other managers.
Workers' professions are mainly mechanics and repairers or manufacturers and processors of food products or repairers of electrical appliances, adds study author Ji<0xC5><0x99>í Tillner.
Employers also specify the characteristics and skills requirements of potential candidates in half of their ads.
As the most frequently requested skills, communication skills have been emerging in advertising in the first place for a long time.
Furthermore, employers demand flexibility, adaptability and dynamics, independence, responsibility, organizational abilities and reliability.
Ben Greenman: 10th Anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
It could be argued that New York City is the place where a solo comic performance was born in America: almost a century ago, a variety artist Frank Fray, who worked as the president of ceremonies at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began telling jokes to the assembled people by the method of conversation.
Fay’s innovation has expanded over the years, most recently through the New York Comedy Festival.
Founded and directed by Caroline Hirsch, founder of the Carolines solo comedy institution, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year – along with more than sixty performances in small clubs and large theatres.
“Most of these titles have appeared in Carolines and have become so successful that they are too big to play at the club,” Hirsch said.
We created this festival as an opportunity to continue working with them.
This year's event includes performances by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin, and Bill Maher, as well as "Stand Up for Heroes", an annual musical comedy benefit show at Madison Square Garden featuring Bruce Springsteen, Jon Cowart, and Bill Roger.
As the festival expanded, so did the world of comedy.
Several comedians taking part in this year’s festival have emerged from unconventional channels such as shows in smaller radio or television companies, such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll has moved up with his sitcom (the fun spicy "League" on a fantasy-football theme on FXX) and now has his own comedy show on Comedy Central station.
Jenny Slate was a member of both "Saturday Night Live" and "Parks and Recreation", but she was most famous for the rapidly expanding series of videos "Marcel the shell with shoes on".
Both Kroll and Slate, as well as other young comedians with clearly recognizable voices (surreally pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, drifting, race-focused W. Kamau Bell), are the product of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the biggest draws of the festival will be an interview: David Steinberg will talk to Larry David.
Steinberg began as a solo comedian, but became a successful television and film director, as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he hosted a TV Land show called "Sit down comedy with David Steinberg".
The meeting takes place at Town Hall in downtown Manhattan.
“This city is definitely in the comedy DNA of Larry’s entire work,” Steinberg said.
He told me that when he's here, he walks through the alleyway between two buildings sometimes, and he thinks, man, if I lose all the money, maybe I'll live here.
The price of oil fell to $96 per barrel.
Oil prices continued to fall on Friday as concerns about high stocks were balanced by a report that showed a strengthening of China's energy-hungry manufacturing sector.
The U.S. oil index for December supplies during the late morning declined in European e-commerce on the New York Stock Exchange by 14 cents to $96.24 a barrel.
On Thursday, the decline was 39 cents and for the month of October it fell by 5.8 percent.
Rich oil reserves in recent weeks have weighed on the price.
The U.S. Department of Energy said on Wednesday that U.S. stocks increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
In five weeks, stocks have increased by more than 25 million barrels.
On Friday, however, two reports on Chinese production came to spur higher demand, which showed growth in activity.
This suggests that China’s economic recovery could continue to strengthen after growth, which rose to 7.8 percent in the third quarter after two weak decades.
Brent oil, an international oil indicator also used by U.S. refineries, fell 26 cents on the London International Trade Exchange to $108.58 a barrel.
Not so, Mr. Haask.
We have a unique opportunity to tell politicians that this is not the case.
There is a need to exert such pressure that Martin Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek is stripped of all political functions and leaves the parliamentary mandate.
Any other solution will reduce the level of political culture that is already so fading.
Martin Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek is shielded by the promise he made, but each and every politician in particular must be aware of the consequences of the promise and consider very much what can be promised.
Trust is the only capital that a politician has (Mr. Babi<0xC5><0xA1> also has the material one, but the question is whether he is a politician).
A better program promoted by a liar is untrustworthy.
In politics, you don’t apologize, in politics, you give up.
Mr. Ha<0xC5><0xA1>k, if you mean well with this country (and your frequent statements confirm me in this, if you did not lie - here you see how difficult it is to lie), you will leave politics alone as a man.
People will then accept your apology as an expression of a man who has made a mistake and is responsible for it.
Otherwise, you will be perceived as a backless weakling whose words and deeds cannot be trusted.
Either you want to be proud, be a flawed person or a lifelong sketch.
It may seem unfair to you that I speak only to you, but you are the leader, and they are just misguided sheep.
And you're a leader, and you always wanted to be.
I understand that now you're trying to fold your ears for a moment, regroup your forces, settle the shame, and then attack again, but that's how partisans or outsiders behave.
You are, I repeat, in your eyes the leader, the alpha male, so behave.
Take responsibility and get out of politics.
The court blocked the regulations on the procedure for arrest and search of persons by the police department in NY
The federal appeals court on Thursday blocked a court order requiring changes to the arrest and search program at the New York police department and dismissed the judge from the case.
The second U.S. federal appeals court said Judge Shira Scheindlin’s decision would be postponed until the city’s appeals decision.
The judge ruled in August that the city violated the constitution by implementing its program of stopping and interrogating people.
The city’s conclusions and its corrective regulations were challenged, including the decision to allocate oversight to help the police department change its procedures and its training program associated with them.
The Court of Appeal heard arguments on Tuesday for the postponement requested.
The appeals court said the judge must be removed from the case because she was in conflict with the rules of conduct for the judge, in that as a judge she did not act according to the request to avoid appearing to be submissive, partly because of a series of interviews with the media and a public statement to which she openly responded to the criticism.
The judge ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people when they wrongly targeted blacks and Hispanics as part of their arrest and search program.
It has set up an independent oversight to oversee major changes, including reforms in procedures, training and oversight, and has ordered a pilot program to be launched to test cameras worn on the body in some areas where people are stopped most frequently.
In August, the city of New York agreed to end the retention of the names and addresses of people whose cases were rejected after a police search.
Oral justification of the city’s appeal is sometimes scheduled after March 14, 2014.
The tactics of stopping and searching people have been criticised by a number of civil rights defenders.
In some form, people have been stopped and searched for a number of decades, but the recorded searches under the administration of independent mayor Michael Bloomberg dramatically increased to a record number of 684,330 in 2011, in most cases blacks and Hispanics.
In 2004, four men, all of whom belong to minorities, filed a class action lawsuit.
Proponents of changes to the arrest and search program carried out by the NYPD argue that the changes will end unfair practices, increase the credibility and effectiveness of the police corps, and may affect how these practices are used by other police departments.
Opponents argue that the change will reduce police morale, but not crime, and that it will waste money, but it will not solve a broader problem when the police force is under pressure after its numbers have been reduced by several thousand people in the last decade.
The judge noted that she had not ended the practice of stopping and searching people, which is constitutional, but had reformed the way the NYPD had introduced searches.
One-fifth of shopping malls face low traffic
This is based on data from real estate consulting firms Cushman & Wakefield and Jones Lang LaSalle.
The Krakow Shopping Centre opens to the public in Prague Bohnice, it will be the 19th Prague shopping centre.
There are now a total of 90 major shopping centers in the Czech Republic.
Unsatisfactory performance affects about 20 percent of medium-sized and large centers.
The main problems are the inadequately large center vis-à-vis the location and poor layouts, i.e. too many floors or complicated and opaque arrangement of passages, or dead spots of the centers," said Michal Soták of Cushman & Wakefield.
Also, according to Jones Lang LaSalle’s head of retail real estate, Sylvie Samadi, about a fifth of shopping malls face low traffic.
The main reasons include poor transport accessibility, low income category of locals or oversaturation of the market in a given place.
Some projects opened almost entirely, but their results were mostly unsatisfactory at first.
Today, customers are somewhat conservative and do not like to change their shopping habits.
New business centers must make more efforts to “attract” their customers to new brands in the market, entertainment, services and marketing events,” Samadi added.
The occupancy of shopping centers is generally stable, according to Soták, even in some centers is rising, because the landlords were willing to discount the rent in the crisis and rent out some units.
“It is true, however, that some projects have recently opened, which are not fully occupied and thus reduce the average occupancy (for example, Breda & Weinstein in Opava, <0xC5><0xA0>antovka in Olomouc),” added Soták.
According to Sylvie Samadi, shopping malls that have opened in the past two years are promoting themselves very slowly in the market.
There is room for new projects on the market.
The number of places suitable for building a successful project is very limited.
For example, in Prague we see a space for the construction of a project that would serve the residents of Prague 6.
There is certainly space on the market for the construction of smaller local projects, so-called ‘convinience centres’, focused on the purchases and services of daily necessities for the population living in the immediate vicinity,” said Samadi.
Also, according to Soták, there is room for other shopping centers on the domestic market.
Both for small 'service' centers and for large projects in Prague, or medium-sized projects, or extensions in regional cities.
"Cities like Kladno, <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice, Brno or Pilsen have room for further growth," added Soták.
In Prague, he sees a space for a prepared business center on Victory Square, furthermore, according to him, Na P<0xC5><0x99>íkopá street and Wenceslas Square have a clear potential.
"Intensive expansion of retail parks is developing, which allow merchants to cover and expand to smaller cities for favorable rental and operating costs, the space is also in some locations for smaller local or residential shopping centers, respectively.
There are currently 90 modern shopping centers in the Czech Republic with a total of more than 2.2 million square meters of gross leasable space.
A quarter of all these shopping centers are located in Prague.
Among the 20 largest shopping centers, according to the number of tenants, nine of them are in Prague, according to data from Incoma GfK.
In the number of shopping parks, the Czech Republic is below the EU average, compared to the values from Britain and France, the Czech Republic is about 50 square meters behind per thousand inhabitants.
Coulson broke into the phone to check the tip
Former editor of News of the world (NotW) Andy Coulson allegedly used “telephone burglary, surveillance and confrontation” methods to confirm a deceptive tip on the love relationship that then-Interior Minister Charles Clarke was supposed to be involved in.
Attorney General Andrew Edis at Old Bailey Court said News of the World caught false news in May 2005 that Clarke had been seen with her “attractive special counsel” Hannah Pawlby.
The papers commissioned private investigator Glenn Mulcair to break into Pawlby’s voicemail and penetrate her privacy, but the court heard that Coulson had called her and left her voicemail.
“The Attorney General suggests that Mr. Coulson, who is now the editor of NotW, is not the person standing in front of the house hoping to catch people outside, but the person who likes to tell people stories to see what they say about it,” Edis said.
He said the NotW newspaper used three ways to explore stories: hacking into the phone, watching and confronting.
The editor is personally involved in the third method.
Obviously he knows about the other, watching, he has to know about her.
What about the first one?
Does he know about the phone hack?
He says no, we say, “But of course he knows.”
Fames about Clarke’s love affair were first captured by the NotW Newspaper Reporting Department when a source who was sexually interested in Mrs. Pawlby was told, “You’re just wasting your time, she’s with Charles.”
A recording with voice messages taken from her phone on at least three occasions was obtained at Mulcair's house in August 2006.
Investigators also found records on a private investigator’s computer where Mrs. Pawlby and her sister were labeled “Projects.”
While Mrs. Pawlby was being investigated, her grandparents received anonymous phone calls asking for information about her, Mr. Edis said.
Meanwhile, former chief rapporteur Neville Thurlbeck and former rapporteur James Weatherup supervised the monitoring of Mrs Pawlby's movement.
On June 18, 2005, Coulson left her a voicemail in which he told her, "I've got a story we're going to publish tomorrow and I'd love to talk to Charles about it."
Mr. Edis says Coulson’s involvement in the story was modeled on the same model as other prominent figures, including former Interior Minister David Blunkett.
On Thursday, the court heard that Coulson was confronting Mr. Blunkett over a love affair with a married woman, while he himself was seeing co-accused Rebecca Brooks, who was then married.
Coulson and Brooks denied association with others for hacking into phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup confessed to breaking into the phone.
NSA Discovery Increases Social Paranoia of State Watching
One peaceful day at the end of August, a German police helicopter rushed over the US consular office in Frankfurt, the capital of the German economy.
On the orders of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), the German domestic intelligence agency, the purpose of the mission was to take photos of the roof of the American forward patrol, which is located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
German media say the BfV hoped to be able to identify the presence of interception antennas, and this action triggered an exchange of views between the US and German foreign ministers in Berlin.
In September, James Clapper, the U.S. Director of National Intelligence, again insisted that the United States did not use its foreign intelligence capabilities “to steal the trade secrets of foreign companies for the benefit of U.S. companies, thereby strengthening their international competitiveness or increasing their profits.”
But since Edward Snowden, who has become an informant, has begun to uncover his valuable secret surveillance collection by the United States, European governments, and leading entrepreneurs, they no longer know whether to believe the CEO’s words.
Following reports that the U.S. National Security Agency was spying on a Brazilian oil company and gaining access to data held by U.S. cloud providers including Google and Yahoo, the general paranoia over state surveillance has reached new heights.
The last drop came with the revelation that Chancellor Angela Merkel’s phone had been intercepted for perhaps ten years.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be the target, then the leading entrepreneurs are certainly the potential target.
Snowden has made clear the intense collaboration between U.S. intelligence agencies and companies.
I would say that it is possible that these data are used for mutual benefit.
“Germany needs to wake up,” said Oliver Grün, president of BITMI, which represents small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
According to a survey released in July by EY’s consultancy service, German companies are convinced that when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, the US now poses as much risk as China.
However, there is no evidence in all the documents revealed by Mr Snowden that the United States has passed the trade secrets of foreign companies on to its own companies.
Politicians expressed concern that the EU lacks certain IT and Internet capabilities, saying it should try to limit its dependence on the US:
Entrepreneurs are skeptical of this.
There are voices from the German parliament that we should make a German Google.
All I can do is close my eyes and slowly open them again.
This is not the way, says Hasso Plattner, chairman of the German software company SAP.
If anyone wanted a strong European IT industry, he shouldn’t have died 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subsidized, from coal to cars and farmers.
Everything except the IT industry.
The scale and technical elaborateness of the US spy agencies revealed by Snowden is shocking for some companies, who so far thought China was the biggest threat from surveillance.
There is a major turnaround in cloud computing, where European officials on a broader scale have realized that data stored in the U.S. is under U.S. jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to a survey conducted by the business community Cloud security alliance, about 10 percent of non-U.S. members canceled plans to use a U.S.-based cloud provider after the discovery of the U.S. Prism data mining program.
Jim Snabe, one of SAP’s CEOs, says: “We have a new question for customers that wasn’t here a year ago – where is my data stored and can you guarantee it will stay physically in this jurisdiction?”
Many German senior officials argue that the latest reports are just a confirmation of what they already knew: that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and that these data must be protected at all costs.
Economic espionage is not a surprise.
It's always happened.
“This has been a critical topic for many years and has not changed significantly even during the current discussion,” says Kurt Bock, CEO of BASF.
Americans are spying on us at the business and industrial level, just as we are spying on them because it is in our national interest to defend our businesses.
Generally, business leaders do not want to brag about the countermeasures they have taken to avoid giving the attacker an advantage.
In the case of large companies, it has long been remembered that taking a free USB drive at the fair or leaving an unprotected laptop in a hotel room is at least unreasonable.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of Audi’s board of directors, says that for many years it has been common practice to collect mobile phones before a board meeting so that they can’t be used as an eavesdropping device.
The German BfV advises executives to consider whether to use simple prepaid mobile phones on foreign travel due to the risk that smartphones may be misrepresented.
Subscribed mobile phones will then be discarded.
However, there are concerns that small and medium-sized enterprises will continue to be vulnerable to hacking and surveillance.
In Germany, many of these companies are the leading representatives of the global market in their specific areas.
"Small and medium-sized enterprises often lack the experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect business secrets from unauthorized access," the BfV said in a statement.
The U.S. warns its own companies of economic espionage by other countries.
According to the Washington Post, U.S. National Intelligence Estimate documents in February listed France alongside Russia and Israel in the second rank of perpetrators involved in hacking for economic intelligence, right behind China.
A member of the council in the German risk-free society concluded that when it comes to economic espionage, “the French are the worst”.
Bernard Squarcini, former head of the French internal intelligence agency DCRI, said this month in one of the interviews: “The services know perfectly well that all countries, even as they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, are spying on their allies.”
The parents of a young Georgian boy who died in a strange accident believe he was murdered
The parents of a minor boy from Georgia, whose body was found inside a wrestling ghost in his high school gym, believe their son was murdered, the family's lawyer said Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson of the city of Valdosta, Georgia, was found on January 11th in a straight line behind the stands in the gymnasium of the high school he was attending.
Sheriff's investigators from Lowndes County County have concluded that Johnson died by accident, but the family of a 17-year-old boy denies it.
"They are clearly convinced that their son was murdered," Benjamin Crump, a lawyer representing Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, told FoxNews.com.
They never believed that he died as the sheriff said.
“They are convinced that this is contrary to logic, to physical laws and also to common sense,” Crump said.
They believe that this is to conceal what really happened in order to protect the person responsible for their son’s death.
“As usual, they sent their son to school and he returned in a bag for the corpses,” he said.
Attorney General Michael Moore said on Thursday he was conducting a routine investigation into Johnson's death, noting that several key questions remained unanswered.
What was the cause of death?
Was his death a result of a crime?
Mr Moore said at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I will follow the facts wherever they lead me.
My goal is to find out the truth.
"I believe there is a sufficient basis for normal investigations," he said.
Moore told reporters that the original autopsy indicated that Johnson had died as a result of “positional suffocation.”
However, according to Moore, the second autopsy indicated a different cause of death.
“There are several questions that need to be answered or confirmed,” he said.
Moore added that if he reveals enough evidence in the case of Johnson's death to warrant an investigation into a crime or civil rights violation, he would ask the FBI and execute him.
The sheriff's deputy from Lowndes County was not immediately available for comment on Thursday.
A South Georgia judge on Wednesday ordered authorities to make available all the video footage from surveillance cameras that the investigators viewed.
The teenager’s parents hope that the videos will contain a clue leading to the discovery of how their son died.
The CDC has issued guidelines for schools on allergy in children
The Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC) has issued a set of guidelines to help children with food allergies at school.
This is the first set of such directives issued by the U.S. government because the number of school-age children suffering from food allergies is rising.
One in 20 children in the United States has a food allergy.
The CDC found that the incidence of food allergies in children increased by 18 percent between 1997 and 2007.
The guidelines provide information for schools on how to inform teachers and staff about child food allergies and how to respond to an allergic reaction, if any.
It also recommends that schools have adrenaline at their disposal – the most commonly used EpiPen auto-injector – to be able to respond to potentially life-threatening hypersensitivity.
State lawmakers have recently updated the rules that allow schools to store adrenaline more easily.
The report also includes a list of typical symptoms that appear in conversations with children who have an allergic reaction.
The child may say, “It’s like someone is pissing on my tongue,” “I feel like I have hair on my tongue,” or “My tongue is itching.”
Parents of intersex children may choose “indefinite sex”
Germany became the first European nation to recognize the third gender in children born with a ambiguous sexual system.
Newborns will no longer be categorized as male or female.
The new law does not require parents to specify any gender for such children, and allows them to list the gender on their birth certificates as "unspecified" or "unspecified".
The goal of the law is to stop pressuring parents to make a sudden decision about their child’s surgery to determine their gender, and to fight discrimination against intersex people.
One intersex person, according to the BBC, said after many years, “I am neither a man nor a woman.”
I'll remain a doctor's-created mess, strangled and scarred.
Every year, an estimated 2,000 children are born who are neither boys nor girls.
They are intersexual, part of a group of about 60 facts that fall within the diagnosis of sexual developmental disorders, covering the term for those who have atypical chromosomes, genital glands (ovaries or testicles), or unusually developed genitals.
Wallis Simpson could have been intersex.
Determining the gender is not yet fully understood, but most experts in the United States say that when it is not possible to determine the gender, it is better to use the best available information and determine it, rather than to wait and monitor the psychological and physical development of the child until surgery is performed, if at all.
New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in gender issues, said the new German law “looks like a good thing.”
Intersex children are an ethical dilemma.
“Some people are in a life-threatening condition that requires surgery, but most children don’t,” he said.
Gender determination can be done without surgery, and then you can wait for the identity to evolve.
Knowing how a child's sexuality develops is not very accurate.
No one can answer the question of why this is happening.
It's like a mystery why some people are gay.
A report sent to the European Committee in 2011 described intersex people as different from transsexual or transgender people because their status is not gender-bound, but their biological structure, which is not exclusively male or female, but is typically composed of both and cannot be clearly defined as one.
These traits can manifest in secondary sexual characteristics such as muscle volume, hair growth, breasts and figure, in primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals, or in the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
This report also provides an overview of the discrimination experienced by intersex and transgender people in the workplace, as well as the level of harassment, violence and prejudice.
Boys who don't fit any gender now have a special camp.
Australia and Nepal already allow adults to identify in official documents male, female or "third sex".
Norrie May-Welby, a 52-year-old Australian, became the world's first recognized "sexless" person in June when she won a court appeal to retain her "indeterminate" sex status for the rest of her life.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, German passports, in addition to M (male) and F (female), will also have a third sign, X, for intersex persons.
In neighbouring France, according to a news report on France 24, gender issues are still controversial.
In 2011, dozens of French lawmakers from this heavily Catholic country signed a petition to remove “gender theory” from school textbooks.
The American Catholic Online website also outlined the German law and wrote: “With the world being drawn into a new state where sex is a matter of choice but sexual activity not, we are about to overturn the other two pillars of civilization.”
A Maryland newborn mother also told the Baby Zone that she would rather see the babies be assigned gender at birth.
“Parenting itself is stressful without any other restrictions, especially if you don’t know your child’s gender,” she said.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, both male and female children were called hermaphrodites, according to the handsome Greek, who had a double sex.
And about a decade ago, the medical community thought that sex was something like a board that could be erased and redesigned.
But now many question the ethical basis of surgery with the fact that sexuality is a complex matter, and doctors can sometimes make the wrong decision, because they do not know how children will feel about their sex when they grow up.
“In the mid-20th century, it was called a psychiatric emergency,” Drescher said.
When these children were born, you didn't call a psychiatrist, you called a surgeon.
Persistent theories on how to treat children with ambiguous sex were presented by Dr. John Money at Johns Hopkins University, who held the view that sex is subjective.
He created a new concept of “sex” and argued that the social causes and influences of the environment – how parents raised their child – influenced child genes and hormones and shaped the child regardless of whether it was identified as male or female.
But in a 1966 case known as “John/Joan,” his theory became controversial.
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis was damaged due to poor circumcision to have his child completely castrated, remove his testicles and raise him as a girl.
“The media presented this case as a successful case of transformation, but the reality was different,” Drescher said.
When the boy was 15 years old, he underwent surgery on the boy and married a woman.
At the age of 38, he committed suicide.
Drescher said that some doctors “use this model” to this day.
But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, survivors of these operations appeared to be “dissatisfied with the result.”
This was also the case with Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with male chromosomes but an ambiguous genital system.
Doctors were not sure whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis, and were convinced that as a man he could never live a “satisfactory life.”
So shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce was surgically removed from his external organs and testicles and raised as a girl.
At the age of 12, he was given female hormones.
"I knew I wasn't a girl," he told ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was very hard to ask.
At 18, he was sent to the vagina for plastic surgery.
But because he was depressed and knew something was wrong, he asked for medical records.
What he found was terrifying.
When I was born, I was sterilized and no one ever told me anything.
Bruce was born with a sexual development disorder (DSD), which prevented the body from producing enough testosterone to properly develop its genitals.
After learning the truth, he changed back to a man, took doses of testosterone and had his breast removed,
The surgery caused his infertility.
Today, he represents others in an organization called the Interface Project and tries to normalize the perception of those who are intersex.
However, Anne Tamar-Mattis, director of the California-based advocacy group Advocates for Informed Choice, fears that German law “calls for stigma and stigma.”
“Many activists fear that the German law will get them to encourage parents to make quick decisions and choose ‘indefinite’ for the child,” she said.
We're afraid it'll call for intervention.
We believe that it is better to assign male or female gender and then wait.
But we don't know what the law will look like in the end, so all we can do is speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said her organization supports Australian law because it “allows adults to choose to be included in the third sex.”
“Adults should be able to make their own decisions about the legally valid sex,” she said.
German law is about to assign it at birth.
This is a battle that a little child should not be seduced at this time.
When they grow up, they can make their own decisions about their own body.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a Pittsburgh-based chest radiologist who has a daughter with a sexual developmental disorder and helps hundreds of others in the support group, said the German law would "grant powers" to both parents and children.
Baratz's daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but she has a DSD called androgen insensitivity syndrome.
Because her androgen receptors are defective, Katie developed female traits.
She has a vagina, but no uterus and ovaries.
Katie, 29, is now married and is studying at the University of Pennsylvania as an intern in child psychiatry.
Although infertile, she hopes to become a parent through adoption or surrogacy.
“The law gives parents some space to not rush their decision,” Baratz said.
It gives them time to take certain tests and change their minds, and it gives them time to write “man” or “woman.”
In this respect, everything is fine – you raise your child and you love him.
You have a wonderful baby and are happy about it.
You don’t have to rush into an operation that is irreversible.
“It brings the opportunity to involve the child in decision-making and removes the anxiety that binds parents because they are not sure they are doing the right thing,” she said.
Eventually, the child decides which gender he or she is more likely to identify with – and that’s a great thing.
It gives children the power to make their own decisions.
The drunken man poured gasoline into the house: he threatened to burn it down with his own family!
The tension was rising, the fear was escalating.
The man threatened to set the whole house on fire.
Therefore, all available police patrols in the area, as well as a fire brigade from Mladá Boleslav and a volunteer fire brigade, arrived at the scene.
A police negotiator arrived at the scene, trying to explain his irrational behavior to the men.
The man threatened to set the house on fire.
The house had to be invaded by an intervention unit, which dismantled the man and tied him up.
The aggressor then ended up undergoing an examination at the Mladoboleslav hospital, from where he was transferred to an anti-alcohol detention station.
The firefighters eventually filled the gasoline-filled house with sorbent, which they later cleaned.
In addition to the people, all pets were rescued from the house.
The man did not give the police negotiator, so the command came after him.
Obama's Campaign Considers Swapping Biden for Hillary Clinton
President Barack Obama’s closest adviser, according to the New York Times, was secretly considering replacing Vice President Joe Biden for Hillary Clinton as the 2012 candidate.
This revelation is the most significant sensation of the eagerly awaited 2012 campaign book by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann "Double down: Game Change 2012."
The Times obtained a copy of the upcoming book and announced on Thursday evening that the president’s top associates had held intensive group meetings and surveys at the end of 2011 to gauge whether getting rid of Biden would help revive Obama’s fading hopes of re-election.
According to the national-political correspondent for the Times, Jonathan Martin, the book offers a thorough record of the efforts of senior officials inside the campaign and in the White House, namely former White House chief of staff Bill Daley, to gauge the impact a minister would have on the election.
The potential change was a strictly guarded secret within the Chicago infrastructure of the campaign and within the Oval Office.
Only a few of the president’s closest advisers – including Daley, former Obama campaign chief Jim Messina, and former White House chief advisers David Axelrod and David Plouffe – knew that this change was being considered.
The book “Double down” claims that Daley was a representative of efforts to replace Biden, despite their close personal relationship, until they ultimately decided not to make the move, when data showed that adding Clinton to the nominee “would not significantly increase Obama’s chances.”
In an interview with Martin Daley, he confirmed that the administration was really considering replacing Biden Clinton.
"I've been looking at a lot of things, and this was one of them," Daley said.
You mustn’t forget that the president had terrible prospects at the time, so we were like, “Jesus Christ, what are we supposed to do?”
While Daley characterized the research as "due care," Martin told CNN's Anderson Cooper that the re-election campaign had made considerable investments to see if the move in the election would pay off.
“There is no money spent on elections and qualitative research in campaigns unless something is really seriously considered,” Martin told AC360.
It is unclear, however, whether Obama knew that his team was considering this exchange.
Martin told CNN that he had asked Daley if his boss at the time was aware of this potential card interference.
While Daley said he did not think the president was “conscious” of the potential changes, the former head of the office admitted that it was “possible” that Obama knew about them.
Martin added that the book “Double Down” definitely doesn’t answer the question of whether the political probe has reached Obama’s table.
Cooper asked Martin if he really thought Obama was unaware of the investigation into Biden’s removal from the nomination.
"Maybe," Martin replied.
Fantastic ice cream that shines in the dark?
A British businessman made the first ice cream that shines in the dark – using jellyfish.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of this marine animal and developed a luminous lampshade.
The idea came when he read an expert treatise on jellyfish, and convinced scientists in China to chemically make a protein that causes lightning.
This ice cream reacts with the consumer’s tongue – it increases the pH level in the protein and subsequently causes its radiation.
Chris says the ice cream shines when it reacts with the warmth of your mouth, and therefore the more you lick, the brighter it shines.
Charlie, founder of the ice cream company "Lick me I'm delicious" says: "It's an amazing substance, but when it comes to production, we're at the beginning, so for <0xC2><0xA3>200 you get about 2 g of this substance."
The protein we use in ice cream reacts with your tongue at a neutral pH.
So as your mouth warms up the protein, the pH level rises and the ice cream begins to shine.
We have tested it over the past few months and it seems to be a great idea to celebrate Halloween because it causes this fantastic glowing effect.
It’s probably the most expensive ice cream I’ve ever made, because jellyfish lightening is four times more expensive than gold.
And so each hill costs me about <0xC2><0xA3>140.
But it tastes great.
Charlie’s Bristol-based experimental company is known for its unconventional flavours of beer, cheese, beef and gold leaves.
But his next product is supposed to be even more ambitious.
He says, "I'd really like to make an invisible ice cream."
Basically, it's impossible because of the breakage of light caused by the ice crystals that make the ice cream, but I'm counting on you to find some way to do it.
The ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of jellyfish, artificially made by Chinese scientists.
Halloween 2013: According to the numbers
When I was a kid, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were able to eat sweets, stay up for a long time, and show our neighbors in disguise.
Today I feel like I've become a caregiver.
After two years there was no candy in my apartment and this year it probably won’t be any different.
However, statistics show that when it comes to Halloween, I am a black sheep.
According to the State Retail Federation (NRF), most Americans will celebrate Halloween this year – in fact, 158 million of them – and spend a total of $6.9 billion on sweets, costumes and decorations.
But what I look forward to every time about Halloween is trends.
According to the NRF, out of $6.9 billion spent, $1.2 billion is expected to go to costumes.
This year's latest fashion shots are sexy inanimate objects.
Sexy foods like pizza, hamburger and carrots can be sexy.
As for the men, I expect that thanks to the parade of the dead, we will see a lot of zombies, and I bet the spacemen from Daft Punk will pull it into our Instagram channels this year.
According to Google, the most sought-after costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I guess there's nothing wrong with following the tradition.
Last year we dressed our dogs in costumes and to my amazement we were not the only ones.
In fact, according to the NRF, Americans will spend $330 million this year on costumes for pets.
So you will see a lot of funny dogs.
When it comes to sweets, we don’t waste time.
According to Nielsen, Americans will spend $1.9 billion.
That's about 300 million kilograms of Hershey's tables, licks, Milk Duds and Twizzlers sweets, and a Clark stick.
That's amazing news for the 41 million calendar workers who, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce, are about to raid our neighborhood.
In fact, during Halloween, we buy, and believe me, we consume, 45 million kilograms of chocolate.
The only thing we don’t want are corn candies, and yet, according to the National Association of Candy Stores, nearly 16,000 tons are sold around Halloween.
That's about 9 billion individual corn candies.
That's a secret I've never solved.
There's nothing more typical of Halloween than the haunting houses.
They have the best names, such as "Terror behind the walls," "Howl-O-Scream," and "The house of shock."
In fact, there are 1,200 officially dedicated spooky houses in the U.S. that have $500 million in revenue, according to the American Spooky House Company, and that includes those amazing photos you're pissed off and your friend puts on Facebook, and you can't take them off, and the person who takes the photos for you, can't take them off.
And finally a little bit about pumpkins.
When we were little, Charlie Brown introduced us to the Great Pumpkin, and carving a pumpkin lantern is like decorating a Christmas tree – we’ve been doing it since we were little.
Fortunately for us, the “baby in the pumpkin” trend started with the Pinterest app only last year, so most of us grew up carving a stick instead of sitting in it.
This year, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, Americans will spend about $106 million on pumpkins.
A pumpkin lantern with a flickering flame on your front porch probably comes from Illinois, where 245,000 tons of pumpkins have grown this year.
If you're looking for something extra, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon from Napa, California, and try chopping up their pumpkin weighing almost a ton.
Announced series of racing Land Rover
The interior has racing seats and six-point seat belts as well as intercom equipment.
You can choose from advanced brakes, a service package providing access to Bowler Works mechanics, logistical support and vehicle storage between different plants.
Drew Bowler, the technical director of Bowler Motorsport, said: “The racers who come to Bowler have changed.”
Not all are experienced racers, but they are people who want excitement and adventure and also an achievable path to world-class races.
We are delighted to be able to offer them this journey in partnership with Land Rover and MSA, and we believe that this format offers a new way to experience the different racing disciplines in the UK and overseas, and that it will prepare the competitors for the toughness and reality of the Rally Raid races.
We really enjoyed the development of the Defender Challenge – it will be a really exciting competition.
The Defender Challenge will also offer a training and testing day in February, as well as the opportunity to compete in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East.
Schwarzenberg: We have early elections in two years
TOP 09 Chairman Karel Schwarzenberg expects another early election soon.
A week after the last ones in an interview with Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz, he said that there is no other way out, and every government that emerged from the vote last Friday and Saturday is an impossible blind man.
"It can't last long," said Karel Schwarzenberg, estimating the life span of the incumbent's term to be two years.
Opposing that voters will hardly choose otherwise next time, they disagree: “I think it will be a bit more balanced decision making.”
At the same time, the TOP 09 president does not admit that his party could lose voters like this year in the next election (compared to 2010, it lost about 300,000 votes).
Schwarzenberg estimates that if it is clear within two months that there will be an early election, it will strengthen the YES 2011 movement of Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1>.
Otherwise, according to Schwarzenberg, Babi<0xC5><0xA1> will lose.
The turbulent situation in the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, where President Bohuslav Sobotka, after a secret meeting of the party leadership, declared that either he or Michal Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek will remain in the leadership of social democracy, comments Schwarzenberg in his own words:
“Leading Democratic Party officials like little boys go to the head of state to allow them to overthrow the party.”
"I thought Mr. Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek was smarter and smarter."
"Because I've never seen anything so impatiently done stupidly in my life," TOP 09 said.
And towards President Zeman (whom he met in the fight for the presidential office), he said: "The role of the head of state is clear: he wants to take over that party."
The first law has already been introduced by TOP 09.
What was the biggest surprise of the election for you?
The TOP 09 has already formally submitted its first bills to the House, including the Fars Treaty Register, which was discussed by parliamentary committees before the elections, but fell under the table with early elections.
The Chairman of TOP 09 in an interview with Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz argues that such speed is due to the fact that "these laws are necessary".
At the same time, the TOP 09 clearly wants to outperform similar experiments from other parties.
For example, the election leader of the ANO movement Martin Komárek accused the TOP 09 in the pre-election struggle of “stealing” the ANO movement’s program by introducing a register of contracts.
The TOP 09 has now taken advantage - it has just dusted off a proposal that had already advanced to the second reading of the House.
Firefighters have come to rescue a lost puppy that was stranded 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous protrusion in a quarry
Cochrane Ruby escaped after a small car accident.
Three days later, he was seen in a quarry by a man who was beating a dog.
Firefighters jumped on the rock wall to save the dog from certain death.
The puppy was liberated by firefighters who came to rescue him after he somehow trapped himself on a dangerous protrusion in a quarry 15 meters above the ground.
The nine-month-old Ruby escaped after a small car accident on Sunday afternoon, and survived for three days on his own until he was released from the quarry on Wednesday.
Its owners Scott Alderson (25) and his girlfriend Becky Hall (20) were at the Flappit quarry in Denholm, West Yorkshire, to meet Ruby again and to thank the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
After escaping, when he got into a small accident, they feverishly searched for their lost dog and placed challenges on social networks.
On Wednesday, at about 2.15 p.m., a bright-eyed dogman saw Ruby stuck on a protrusion in a quarry 15 meters above the ground.
A technical rescue team rushed to the site from the Cleckheaton fire station and came down to free Ruby, using an animal carrier bag to pick him up from the rock.
Andy Clayton, the technical rescue team’s expert commander, said: “The dog was in a dangerous situation.
It was right in the middle of the rock wall – 15 meters from the top and the bottom.
He did not move his eyebrows during the rescue – he was completely frozen.
He's okay now.
Then he got cookies.
It was a very unusual trip.
The fact that someone saw the dog is unbelievable.
Peter Lau, the technical rescue team’s expert commander, said: “Ruby was very lucky during his escape.”
There was a possibility that he would be seriously injured or worse.
Ruby was taken to the vet for a check-up, and besides exhaustion and dehydration, he was fine.
Ms. Hall, from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said, "I was afraid to watch the rescue."
Above all, I couldn't believe how he got there.
It was wonderful to hold him in my arms again.
The veterinarian said that if he was too exhausted and collapsing, he would probably have fallen.
The firefighters did a great job.
What they did was very courageous.
We are very grateful to them, they were all just amazing.
Mr. Alderson of Keighley added: "We were afraid he might fall, but he stayed there."
The firefighters were great.
We just still don't understand how he got there.
Mick Jagger says after that 18-year-old Katy Perry definitely did not go out.
During an interview for an Australian radio show this week, the pop star said she sang accompanying vocals for Jagger's 2004 song "Old Habits Die Hard".
Perry said that when she was 18, she had dinner with this rock veteran and he went after her.
And she added, "It was a long time ago and now he's very kind to me."
In a statement Thursday, Jagger’s 70-year-old spokesman said he categorically refused to make any suggestions by Katy Perry.
The agent said, "Maybe you're messing with someone else."
Perry was one of the guest singers who appeared on the Rolling Stones concert string this year.
Her new album "Prism" debuted in first place this week.
George Kerevan: Divided Europe gives Scotland a choice
Another day, another scary story of independence.
This time there is a warning that a prerequisite for the accession of an independent Scotland to the EU would be its accession to Schengen.
This gave rise to stories of passport controls in Berwick and barbed wire along the Hadrian's wave.
The truth is that the Strathclyde newspaper mentioned the possible economic benefits of free movement with the rest of Europe, but – as was to be expected – this was not reflected in the newspaper’s headlines.
No one also mentioned that EU Member States spend a lot of time adapting their official laws if they like.
Given that Scotland is not currently in Schengen, the offer of continued disagreement would be a cheap concession for Brussels in return for anything they really want from the Scots.
So it's a pretty weak story.
In addition, so old that it became an excavation. A journalistic duck that "independence means passport controls", I heard at least 40 years ago.
However, there is an interesting idea hiding in this bearded tale.
Why should an independent Scotland be expected to obey Europe at all?
Why exchange the London humour for the Brussels humour, especially now?
This is the true European story: the great post-war plan to unify Europe has finally failed.
As a result of the euro crisis, the so-called Project Europe is officially dead.
Across Europe, parties dedicated to resistance to the EU or the abolition of the euro as a common currency are gaining influence.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Alternative for Germany party – founded this year – came as if from nowhere and already looted nearly five million votes in the September federal elections, essentially “sweeping” the Free Democrats (the equivalent of the British Liberal Democrats) out of the Bundestag.
At home there has always been opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis has become a decisive moment.
The austerity dictated by Germany and the European Central Bank, together with the lingering cap worn on the national economies through sticking to the common currency, has led many people to believe that the Europe project has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with the fact that national governments are managing a high budget deficit – this was true only in the case of Greece.
Rather, it is the euro system that blocks its members at exchange rates favorable to German exporters – and that is what German politicians want to keep.
Without the possibility of devaluation of the domestic currency, southern Europe has a disadvantage in the area of domestic production compared to Germany.
The only way to help is to cut revenues and public spending – which is what Germany is urging.
Behind the current problems with budget and currency is the deeper cause of Europe's poor performance.
As a result of the “green” energy policy supported by Brussels – a code to support French and German companies at the expense of consumers – European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times as much for gasoline as it does in the United States.
This is a paralyzing cost disadvantage, as we have already seen in the case of Grangemouth.
Neither would any freezing of wages in the world deter the flooding of the European petrochemical industry with cheap shale oil from the US.
The result is a circumstantial uprising, especially in France, a once-enthusiastic supporter of the EU.
After the war, the political elite in France saw the EU as an instrument that would keep Germany at bay and allow Paris to stand up to Washington in the world.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a proof of political legitimacy, and it has enforced its own economic policy in Europe and left the worn-out French economy to its fate.
The result: Marine Le Pen’s right wing, the anti-European National Front, has just won crucial additional elections and pushed the ruling socialists to third place.
The front is now the most popular party in France, with 24% of the votes – an early warning to British Labour that they cannot assume that the split of the right will automatically turn positive on the left.
How is Le Pen dealing with her newly gained popularity among the white working class?
She would like to take advantage of the European elections next year to create an anti-European bloc across the European Parliament against the common currency.
If anti-European parties lead well in these elections, which is likely, such a bloc could dominate the European Parliament for the first time in its history.
I think that in the foreseeable future, the growing anti-European sentiment and anti-communist stance will unite and the euro will perish.
The EU will not disappear, but rather be transformed into something freer in the sense of “Europe of (sovereign) nations”, which General de Gaulle preferred.
Germany and several of its satellite economies may retain the euro, but France and southern Europe will renew their own currencies.
I expect the United Kingdom to distance itself from this project and stick to the United States.
However, Washington’s increased interest in the Pacific indicates that Britain will be left to the Atlantic cold.
Where will Scotland be?
We can choose to be an area (in principle) of Little England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests – this includes the opportunity to let Berlin and Brussels know when to let us go.
I assume that Scotland would be doing well in a relaxed Europe, provided it retains its own currency.
Cooperation with other similarly thinking countries would be easier in a non-federal Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should take the example of Norway and maintain our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland is – surprisingly – the most successful non-enforcement austerity political movement in Europe, which won a large majority in 2011 thanks to the opposition stance against cuts planned (and implemented) by Labour Chancellor Alistair Darling and the following coalition of Conservatives and Liberal Democrats.
It would be ridiculous if Scotland now voted for independence only to adopt austerity measures dictated by Berlin and Brussels.
Early Puberty: Early Adults
Research has shown that African Americans and Hispanics reach puberty earlier than their white peers.
Physical changes do not mean that puberty is approaching.
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are behind this.
Experts say that one of the triggers of early puberty may be an epidemic of obesity.
The trend of early puberty is not so noticeable in boys.
Former CNN reporter Pat Etheridge is a journalist who specializes in children’s health and family issues.
Should a mother be frightened when her daughter starts growing breasts and shaving hair at 7 or 8 years old?
At the annual American Academy of Pediatrics conference this week in Orlando, Florida, pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these physical changes are quite common among American girls and represent a new standard.
“I spent a lot of time reassuring my parents that this is usually not a sign of rapid development towards full puberty,” Kaplowitz said.
Visible signs of development, such as growth of the breast, hair on the underarm and in the armpit and body odor, appear earlier in girls.
In the last forty years, however, there has been only a small shift in the age at which the first menstrual period occurs.
In the United States, the average age is now 12.5 years compared to the age of 12.75 years in 1970.
“When breasts begin to develop, it will be at least two to three years before the first menstruation occurs,” said Kaplowitz, who is also the author of “Early puberty in girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This Common Problem.”
The most reliable test of how puberty will continue is time.
There is debate about what activates the actual onset of puberty, but if breast growth is accompanied by a growth spurt before age 8, the girl is considered “premature.”
In most cases, the process slows down or stops – which pediatricians can monitor carefully.
Faster growth may be a reason for an endocrinologist to perform tests to rule out serious problems such as a tumor or cyst.
There are treatments that delay early menstruation and prevent other consequences: premature aging of the bones, which can eventually lead to stopping growth and stiffness in adulthood.
Recommendations about medication and hormone therapy depend on the age of the child, the rate of development, the rate of growth and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
When it comes to drug use, Kaplowitz is cautious, but recognizes that “repressing puberty can alleviate a girl’s behavioral problems and her feelings of being different from her peers.”
Understandably, there is another big problem: Parents simply don’t want their very young daughters to have menstruation.
“They’re worried she might get pregnant, or how she’ll handle hygiene,” Kaplowitz said.
“It was a shock,” recalls one woman whose daughter began menstruating at the age of 10.
Although there were indications and we talked about menstruation, she was not emotionally prepared.
She came home from school frightened and angry that she was the first of her friends.
There are many well-known theories about the causes of premature puberty.
However, there is no consistent set of evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment, or sexual messages in the media are at fault.
Boys, like girls, reach puberty earlier.
Kaplowitz argues that the most serious reason is the obesity epidemic.
In 2001, he helped conduct a study on girls between the ages of 6 and 9 that linked body fat to the timing of puberty.
Other findings support this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.
In this country, African Americans and Hispanics tend to reach puberty earlier than their white counterparts.
The explanations are different.
From a global perspective, early puberty patterns seem to be influenced by everything from economic conditions to climate to genes.
Another riddle: Although hair loss in the face and on the cheek appears in boys at a young age, the trend towards full flowering of early puberty is not as clear as it is in girls.
Other doctors attending the American Association of Pediatricians (AAP) conference added additional complexity to the topic.
Acne and hair loss are common even in infants and toddlers.
“We need to be careful about how we identify the actual onset of puberty,” said Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at Gorieb Children’s Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to get instructions from their pediatrician on how to talk to their child.
“It could mean having to talk to the baby before you know it,” Kaplowitz advised.
If you stay calm, your child will likely respond well.
Girls who develop earlier need to be assured that although this happens prematurely, this process is a common part of life.
Nadia Konvalinková in the role of hospice.
Does he have a new job?
Actress Na<0xC4><0x8F>a Konvalinková (62) appeared behind the scenes in the role of a hospice and she was able to do it.
That maybe a favorite Czech actress would plan to change her profession and go on business in a pub?
Nadia Konvalinka appeared at the James Joyce Irish pub and made beer there.
I did it for the first time in my life and I was able to do it right away.
Even my boss offered me a job and I could feed myself by spinning beer.
But I refused, I’d rather stay with what I’m doing today, with acting,” said Konvalinková, who was a guest on the 20th anniversary of the Irish pub.
"I like Irish beer and I'm going to have Irish whiskey here," the actress said.
Nadi’s long-haired friend and colleague Pavel Nov<0xC3><0xBD> also appeared at the event.
I am after death, and in this new life I cannot drink.
I’m allowed one beer or one drink a day, and I’m trying to stick to that,” he added.
Aircraft manufacturers are arguing about the width of seats, large orders are at stake
A dispute over the width of second-class seats on long-haul flights has erupted among leading aircraft manufacturers, sparking a bitter exchange of views at the Dubai Air Show this month.
The subject of the dispute is the width of the seats provided for long-haul flights for the economy class – not exactly the one that airlines would normally have preceded, but whose allocated space is the key to the efficiency claims for the latest aircraft offered by Airbus SAS and Boeing.
Airbus this week called for industry standards that would offer at least 46-cm-wide seats in the economy class, but Boeing’s main US rival says it’s up to airlines to decide.
The dispute arose at a time when aircraft manufacturers are competing to sell the largest version of their two-engine long-haul aircraft with a potential record number of orders expected during the event from November 17 to 21.
The way in which the rear of the aircraft is arranged – especially if there are 9 or 10 seats next to each other – is the basis for the economic performance demands on the design of new “mini-jumbo” aircraft.
Boeing says the improved “777X” will carry 406 people in economy seats with a width of more than 43 cm spread out by 10 in each row.
Airbus says the competitive version of its A350 will carry 350 people in 46-cm-wide economic seats spread over 9.
Giant planes often attack each other on technical issues through advertisements in professional media.
Airbus is now appealing directly to the public ahead of the Dubai Air Show, where the 777X is expected to gain the upper hand with more than 100 orders.
Recently, he previewed what could be the start of a new advertising war when he showed financiers a picture showing three people sealed in a restaurant with the headline “Would you like it?”
“Boeing is promoting long-haul flights in seats narrower than they are in regional turboprop aircraft,” said John Leahy, chief sales officer at Airbus.
As the eating habits change, people are larger, but the seats in the airplanes have not changed radically.
Since the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747 jumbo defined modern long-haul aviation, by the turn of the century, according to data from the U.S. Department of Health, the weight of the average American aged 40 to 49 has increased by 10 percent.
According to American health statistics, the average American in the 21st century has a waist of 100 cm.
Airbus claims its rival is sticking to the 1950s seat concept, when the average seat width of the newly-baptized aircraft was lower.
Airbus says it has conducted research that suggests extending the seat by 2.5 cm will improve sleep quality by 53 percent.
Boeing rejects Airbus seat dimensions and says it is not up to aircraft manufacturers to decide how the airlines are exporting fees and equipment.
The company also says that research shows that the experience in the cabin depends on more than just the width of the seat.
“It’s really about giving airlines the flexibility and enabling them to do the things they believe they have to do to be successful,” said cabin space expert Kent Craver.
They don't want us to dictate what makes them profit.
They know their business better than anyone else.
More space for elbows is essential for passengers, but for suppliers it is a growing problem that can affect revenues.
Behind this controversy is a race in aircraft orders with an estimated trade in the coming decades worth at least $700 billion in catalog prices, enough to bypass the weights of American and European exports.
As Reuters reported in July, the layout of the seats is exactly what drives the battle between the last planes.
Both Airbus and Boeing say they are achieving 20 percent more efficiency in their latest designs of two-engine long-haul aircraft than the market leader in this segment, the 365-seat Boeing 777-300ER.
Boeing’s performance demands depend in part on comparing the design of the 777X with 10 seats in a row and the 777 concept with 9 seats in a row.
Profit in unit costs is weakened compared to the 10-seat concept.
“The reason Boeing is doing this is to boost more seats and make its aircraft more competitive than our products,” said Kevin Keniston, Airbus Europe’s head of passenger comfort.
On the other hand, analysts say that the 10-seat cabins in a row for the existing 777 models are consistent with the fact that many passengers are for denser layouts that can go hand in hand with lower fees.
“A forty-five-centimeter-wide seat would be great for passengers, but the reality is that from an Airbus business perspective, the design is driven by the threat of the 777,” said Mary Kirby, interior expert at the Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not sell seats, but offer airlines a catalogue of suppliers to choose from.
Traveling aircraft vendors even carry a measuring band with them to check the competitive layout.
While boasting comfort, all manufacturers also offer high-density layout aircraft for low-cost companies and regional travelers.
Airbus offers an A350 with 10 seats in a row, but says it hasn’t sold it yet.
Until recently, Airbus had stressed the need for a larger adjustment of the cabin by offering wider seating in the alleys for some of its aircraft.
Experts say that without the support of one more major modern aircraft manufacturer, the challenge to new industry standards will remain unheard of, but may discourage the wave of sales of the 777X.
The number of people infected with HIV in Prague exceeded one thousand
In the Czech Republic, the number of infections is increasing every year.
For example, in 2002, tests confirmed the infection in 50 people, five years later there were 121 and in 2010 there were 180.
Last year, 212 people were infected, a record number.
"There is no doubt that the total number of newly diagnosed cases will exceed 200 this year," said Miroslav Hlavat<0xC3><0xBD>, an expert on AIDS, who led the Prague House of Light for patients for years.
According to him, there were 165 HIV patients in the country from January to September last year, 176 of them in the same period this year.
From the beginning of the follow-up until the end of September, tests confirmed HIV in 1,710 men and 353 women, with the most infected being in Prague.
The number reached 1005 in September.
In the Central Bohemian Region, there were 206 infected residents.
The diagnosis was also heard by 156 people from the South Moravian region, 130 from Moravian-Silesian and 116 from <0xC3><0x9A>stí.
The fewest of the infected are from the Highlands, there were 19 of them.
A total of 88% of patients were infected during sex.
Fourteen people have been infected with blood transfusions in the past.
However, such a case has not appeared in the Czech Republic since the beginning of testing, i.e. in more than a quarter of a century.
Six children were also born with HIV, which was transmitted to them from their mother.
The nonsense in the movie Gravity is, but the look is beautiful, experts say
A fantastic film from the Gravity universe sold out cinemas in the Czech Republic some time after the premiere.
In October, according to the Union of Film Distributors, he was seen by nearly 150,000 viewers and earned over 26 million crowns.
Most reviews rate the image positively.
Others, however, find some inconsistencies in it.
Server Lidovky.cz asked experts from astronomers and astrophysicists about how they liked the film and if they noticed any nonsense that appeared in the film.
Ji<0xC5><0x99>í Du<0xC5><0xA1>ek (director of the Brno Observatory and Planetarium): I like science-fiction films, which I consider to be modern, dreamy fairy tales.
The film Gravity does not exclude, although it is portrayed as a "physically real" performance.
He's not, but that doesn't mean he's bad.
I enjoyed it a lot.
You may notice Sandra Bullock’s hair, which doesn’t float in a weightless state.
The Hubble Space Telescope and the International Space Station are moving along significantly different orbits, so they cannot be seen in one shot.
Some viewers of the film blame the unrealistic effect and the whole behavior of the fire in a state of weightlessness.
They also say that scaphands would not be able to withstand such wounds.
Heroes in the film Gravity often collide with different objects and suits without any major difficulty can all withstand.
Criticism was not spared, nor the plot.
Such a massive tragedy in the Earth’s orbit is unrealistic, according to some debaters.
In addition, they wonder why the doctor was sent into space to repair the technique.
People are also arguing on forums about the "unrealistic" behavior of ropes.
It looks like it was designed for bungee jumping.
Marcel Grün (Director of the Observatory and Planetarium of Prague): I have only seen him on a wide canvas so far, but I can clearly say that I was enchanted.
I'm glad it wasn't a documentary, it was science fiction.
And in such a story, the author has a right (almost an obligation) not to adhere consistently to reality.
"More than the inconsistencies you mentioned touched me, how the space station with degrading levels of technology (last Chinese) is shown three times."
"China will only be at the end of the decade and it will probably look better than it is in the movie."
Vladimír Karas (Director of the Institute of Astronomy of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic): In the computer-generated scenes, the authors very successfully try not to violate the laws of physics, and so the naturalistic-oriented spectator will appreciate that in various cosmic collisions, the moment of the event is quite rightly preserved by the cosmic collisions and collisions.
Inequalities will certainly be found in a more detailed examination.
In addition, for example, when reading the comments, I found that the preferred direction of the orbit of various space debris in orbit seems to be reversed in some scenes than it should actually be (from west to east).
Ji<0xC5><0x99>í <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>pán (employee of the Institute of Astronomy of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic): Some things have been adapted to their needs, but no fundamental and heavenly sins against logic or natural laws I have not recorded in the film and in comparison with other films of the same kind.
From moments that make no sense, it is worth mentioning the fact that the Hubble Space Telescope orbits an otherwise inclined orbit other than the ISS.
As a result, there is a significant difference in the speed of each other and the rescue operation could therefore not actually take place as shown in the film.
Further, at the moment of the separation of Clooney and Stone, I did not notice that the entire ISS would rotate, so there is not even a clear origin of the force acting on Kowalski, which forces both actors to let go at the moment when they are no longer moving towards each other.
A new nicotine vaccine can take away the pleasure of smoking
Scientists have developed a nicotine vaccine that can take away the pleasure of smoking cigarettes.
A single dose of the vaccine was able to protect the mouse from nicotine addiction for life.
Before testing on humans, more tests need to be done, which will take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of the Weill Cornell School of Medicine in New York says the first indications are good.
"We firmly hope that this type of vaccination strategy can finally help the millions of smokers who have tried to quit and exhausted all the methods available on the market today, but have found that their nicotine addiction is so strong that it can overcome all current approaches," Cornell said.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been assembled to carry genetic information to create anti-nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects liver cells, which then begin to form a flow of these antibodies.
Antibodies chase all nicotine molecules in the bloodstream and neutralize them before they get into the brain, preventing a smoker from getting nicotine.
In the tests of vaccinated mice, which were additionally supplied with nicotine, they continued their normal activities.
But mice that were not vaccinated “calmed down,” the researchers said, a sign that nicotine had gotten into their brains.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
The injections had to be given so often to maintain adequate levels of antibodies that they proved expensive and impractical.
The cost of a new vaccine should be much lower, as it transforms liver cells into factories to produce antibodies.
Professor Crystal said that if future vaccines are completely safe for humans, they could be given to children before they have a craving for cigarettes to try, thus avoiding nicotine addiction.
However, it is much more likely to be used by smokers to stop smoking.
“They’ll know that if they start smoking again, they won’t enjoy it because of the nicotine vaccine, and that will help them get rid of this habit,” he said.
British scientists said the results were interesting, but pointed out that further research is needed.
Tripodi denies that she would be influenced by Obeid
The former Labour minister of New South Wales (Australia) will be investigated by the State Committee for Corruption Surveillance.
Former New South Wales minister Joe Tripodi has denied changing the coastal lease policy at the request of his political adviser Eddie Obeid, who had hidden interests in three government-controlled properties.
The Independent Anti-Corruption Committee (ICAC) on Friday expanded its investigation into whether Mr. Obeid lobbied several ministers to lease him on Circular Quay, where the Obeids owned two restaurants and a café, revived without having to attend after his trial expired in August 2005.
The Committee is now investigating the allegation that Mr Tripodi was aware of Mr Obeid's covert interests in these properties, on the basis of evidence submitted on Thursday by Mr Tripodi's former deputy head of office, Lynne Ashpole.
During the years of talks started in 2005, the government pushed for leases to go to public competitions.
The tenants were against it and also wanted longer term terms.
In 2009, rentals for businesses in Circular Quay, which brought the Obeids $2.5 million a year, were renewed without the need to participate in a public competition.
Mr Tripodi, who was Minister of Ports from February 2006 to November 2009, was originally a proponent of public competitions.
But he denied that the changes were made at the request of Mr Obeid, who, as Mr Tripodi admitted, urged a shift in government rent policy.
The transcript of the calls submitted to ICAC showed calls from August to September 2007 between Mr. Obeid and Mr. Tripod and Steve Dunn, a senior official who came to the port resort after working under Mr. Obeid in the Fisheries Department.
“Was the topic of the talks during these phone calls the development of the policy of commercial rentals?” asked Assistant Commissioner Anthony Wheala of Mr Tripodi.
"No," said Mr. Tripodi.
I can't remember what we talked about, but definitely not this one.
Definitely not between me and Mr. Obeid.
Israeli military jets attack target in Syria, official says
Israeli military aircraft struck a target in the Syrian port of Lazikia on Thursday night, a senior official of the administration told Fox News.
This responsible official did not specifically state what the target was, but said there was at least one.
According to the Associated Press, the target was a Russian-made SA-125 missile.
At least twice earlier this year, Israel carried out an airstrike on the delivery of missiles in Syria.
A lot of things have moved, and it's different.
Perhaps the commentator of Pe<0xC4><0x8D>inka spoke in such a way that it was possible to agree, while the chairman of <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>ch instigated the quarrel.
Heytman Chovanec was my suspect as soon as he was elected to the presidency, and he confirmed it.
President Sobotka has always been, and continues to be, a symbol of <0xC4><0x8C>SSD poverty.
The other gentlemen showed their weaknesses.
Senator Dienstbier is principled and legible and unusable, Vice-President Zaorálek made himself impossible by the most talk on television.
On this basis, I do not see a better option than for the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD to propose to the Vice-President of the Senate Gajd<0xC5><0xAF><0xC5><0xA1>ková as prime minister, the only one should not have an initial handicap and I think that it would perform a standard performance.
It's such a good solution that hardly anyone in the leadership will support it.
I add that this solution is the only way to forget what has been done and to continue without splitting the party.
Alena Gajd<0xC5><0xAF><0xC5><0xA1>ková could without fear form a minority government with the mere blessing of President Babi<0xC5><0xA1> and without the populists, but with the populist health minister Hovorká, who is in fact a believing social democrat.
This minority government would have great stability, as it would enforce a proper referendum law, and President Dawn Okamura was committed to supporting it.
President Babi<0xC5><0xA1> would eventually reconcile himself with the progress of taxes, because he is clever and he will see that it is not possible without it.
People wouldn't bring trouble, because Talk is the bearer of the best they have, and otherwise they wouldn't be in government.
The same is true of YES, even here a valuable minister would be found, but if they reasonably do not want to enter into risky government participation, but will provide support, also well.
Let’s take the courage of Alain!
Foreign workers with visa authorization may be subjected to the “legitimity” test
As the government plans to expand police interventions, it is considering a “legitimity” test for foreign workers with a visa authorization of 457.
The test, if accepted, will be applied through criteria to prevent the 457 program from being used to fill unskilled jobs, or as a backdoor for relocating family and friends to Australia.
When a government discussion paper was released today, former Labour MP Maxine McKew condemned the government’s rhetoric about foreign workers, saying it could offend Australian neighbors.
“The loud statements ‘foreigners at the end of the queue’ and ‘work first for Australians’ are a very unpleasant remnant of a time when unions demanded a protected labour market,” she told the Australian-Indian Institute.
Historically, this meant that the white workforce had to be protected – and I wouldn’t be surprised if anyone in the region had noticed the echo of this historic artifact.
The article discusses 12 measures previously considered by former immigration minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration minister Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday, where he is dealing with officials for smuggling people, implemented five of the recommended changes and the others remain to be considered.
If the criteria for ‘eligibility’ are adopted, visa applicants may be examined in detail whether ‘the nomination is justified in a situation where the candidate is in a relationship or personal relationship with the owner or relevant person of the sponsoring undertaking.’
After previous experience with companies that intended to sponsor a small number of workers but then employed hundreds of them, companies may also be required to justify the number of visa holders 457.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan man seeking asylum died on suspicion of a heart attack after arriving on an asylum ship to the Christmas Islands this week.
The man’s 9-year-old son travelled to Australia with him, and after his father’s death on Wednesday, he was comforted by an adult cousin who was also on the ship.
Australian authorities rushed with a man to the Christmas Island hospital where he died.
The UK government has announced a study aimed at increasing the benefits of the HS2 rail project for Scotland.
HS2’s work suggests that high-speed services for Scotland and Northern England will begin as soon as the first phase is launched in 2026.
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said the project “connects the UK together.”
Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was “enthusiastic” about working with the British government on the plan.
The first phase will consist of a new high-speed train line between London and the West Midlands.
Upon completion of Phase Two, the line will run from Manchester to Leeds.
In June, the government reassessed the estimated cost of building a high-speed line between London and Northern England from <0xC2><0xA3>32.7 billion to <0xC2><0xA3>42.6 billion.
The British government, which had interviews with the national transport office Transport Scotland, commissioned HS2 to identify additional railway capacity and the possibility of improving travel times for northern England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of possible travel times from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London corresponding to three hours or less.
Baroness Kramer said: “Our goal for HS2 is really a national network that better connects the UK and its cities.”
We gave the SH2 green because the benefit it will bring is huge.
Without it, we are facing a crisis in the capacity of our railway network.
But it’s also a connection – HS2 will make 18 cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, better connected across the UK.
Scottish Minister Alistair Carmichael added: “Today’s announcement is good news for Scotland.”
On behalf of the Scottish Government, Keith Brown called on Mr Carmichael to "unambiguously" support Scottish integration into HS2.
Mr Brown said: “The high-speed route has the potential to bring Scotland immense economic benefits, but it also adds to Scotland’s economic weight in the overall case of high-speed rail across Britain.”
We are therefore excited to work with the UK Government to explore the possibility of bringing high-speed rail to Scotland to bring benefits to all and to supplement the Glasgow-Edinburgh line, which the Scottish Government is planning anyway.
I look forward to reviewing the report on this study together with the British ministers next year and to jointly deciding on the next steps.
Inspection and analysis of anti-corruption police arrested together with Bárta
Information about the arrest of Vít Bárty began to spread on Thursday evening, when the message was brought by the server Prvnízpravy.cz.
MF TODAY suddenly found out that the case was taken over by the General Inspectorate of Security Corps (GIBS), her people were to arrest Bárta in the center of Prague.
This happened in front of the Four Seasons hotel.
The inspection shall deal with cases where they are among the accused police officers, but its competence shall also apply to civilians.
According to MF DNES, one of the officers of the anti-corruption police - the chief analyst and computer scientist Jan Petr<0xC5><0xBE>ílek - is among those arrested.
He used to work for the Security Intelligence Service.
Anti-corruption police spokesman Jaroslav Ibehej, however, refused to comment on the information, saying that the media must turn to GIBS in this matter.
Even her spokeswoman Radka Sandorová did not want to say anything about the case, she referred to the Prague City Prosecutor’s Office.
"We will not comment on this question with regard to the protection of classified facts," said spokeswoman <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>pánka Zenklová.
Also from this inaccurate reaction it can be deduced that the event took place, but it is in a mode of secrecy that does not allow the speaker to say anything specific.
Bart's lawyer Old<0xC5><0x99>ich Poverty is in a similar situation.
He told the media that he represented Bart "in this case too," but since it is classified information, he cannot confirm or refute Bart's arrest.
Some media initially speculated that Bart’s arrest may be related to former police president Peter Lessy.
He was promoted to the office by Bárta together with former VV president Radek John, who sat at the head of the Ministry of the Interior.
The dispute that erupted between ex-premier Petr Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as and VV even had to be resolved by then-president Václav Klaus.
I have no idea where this connection to my person came from.
No one contacted me, I was not interrogated.
"I really don't know anything about it," Lessy said.
In January 2011, Lessy became Chief of Police.
It was officially enforced by Radek John, the true leader of the party, but it was Bart at the time.
Bárta was now running for the <0xC3><0x9A>svit movement, but the parliamentary mandate was narrowly escaped - by 175 votes.
Dawn leader Tomio Okamura said he had no idea what it was about.
"Seeing Bart was one of the many candidates of many parties on our candidacy and, as I have repeatedly said before the elections, he was not and is not a member of the Dawn of Direct Democracy of Tomi Okamura," he distanced himself from Bart Okamura, who before the elections said that he had given Bart's ex-candidate room.
Vít Bárta was in court in 2012 with his former colleague from VV Jaroslav <0xC5><0xA0>kárka.
Rules on the use of electronic devices in aircraft will remain in force in Australia for the time being
Passengers of Australian airlines will continue to have to turn off their tablets and smartphones during take-offs and landings, regardless of changes in the U.S., in order to mitigate regulations on these devices.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has given U.S. companies room to change their practices so that passengers will be able to read e-books, watch videos or play games on their devices during critical phases of flight if the devices remain in "air" mode.
Passengers can already do this during most of the flight, but many people are annoyed that they cannot access their e-books during takeoff and landing.
Australian carriers are examining this decision, which requires a lot of work from American carriers to meet the requirements, but they have indicated that they do not plan to change their practices anytime soon.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) also said it had reviewed the announcement, but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices at critical stages of flight are still in force in Australia.
"Casa currently has no specific regulations governing the use of electronic equipment on board aircraft," he said.
This issue is covered by regulations that require aircraft operators to ensure that safety is maintained at all times and that passengers act in accordance with the safety instructions they receive from crew members.
Virgin, which has already spoken to CASA about extending the use of its on-board entertainment Wi-Fi system, was in favour of the change, but announced that it would be subject to a regulatory decision.
“We would welcome CASA to conduct an analysis of the authorization to use electronic devices, because we really think that now that we have [wireless on-board entertainment], it would improve the customer experience,” the spokesperson said.
Qantas has announced that it will comply with current regulations for the time being.
"Our current policy is that electronic devices should not be used during take-off and landing, and we do not intend to change that in the near future," he said.
The FAA regulations apply to U.S. airlines.
However, we continue to be interested in regulatory developments that may be useful to our passengers, and we are certainly thoroughly considering the FAA decision and the reasons behind it.
In the case of US carriers, the impact of the regulations will vary from company to company and will depend on the age of their fleet.
Carriers will have to prove that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference from mobile phones, as well as revise manuals, training materials, hand luggage programs and information for passengers.
“Once the airline confirms the tolerance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use portable and lightweight electronic devices such as tablets, electronic readers and smartphones at any altitude,” the FAA said in a statement.
In rare cases of low visibility, the crew will order passengers to turn off the equipment during landing.
The group also recommended that the heavier equipment be safely stored under the seats or in a storage space above the head during take-off and descent.
With the growing misery of the middle class, the stalls in Singapore are experiencing flourishing
Janani Amirthalinga stops at the Bendemeer shopping mall in Singapore with a gold bracelet, ring and earrings to pay her daughter's tuition.
“My husband and I just bought a house and I gave all my money to it,” says Mrs. Amirthalinga.
Although she receives $2,400 each month as an administrator (SGD 3,000) and her husband also works, family monthly income is insufficient, she says.
Demand across areas in Southeast Asia – where household debt is rising – is indeed such that ValueMax, where the woman is carrying out her transaction, has become the third stop on the Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
Stopping jewelry is not only a quick way to lend cash – SGD 1,300 in the case of Mrs. Amirthalinga – but it is also almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
Singapore’s stalls typically apply an annual percentage rate of 17 percent, just above the 15.4 percent rate offered by United Overseas Bank, a local bank with a branch in the same mall.
However, stalls have the advantage that they do not require person verification (payment history) or proof of receipt, and can provide a loan faster than banks.
And therefore, with families feeling pressured by rising living costs and rising household and consumer debt, millions of people across the region are turning to stalls.
After five years of strong growth from the global financial crisis and cheap credit backed by loosening monetary policy in advanced economies, low- and middle-income families are turning to the bars to cope with the deteriorating financial situation.
This week, credit rating agency Standard & Poor’s cited rising use of credit in households mainly because of rising rents as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
She said Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest debt of households in Asia in terms of gross domestic product.
Malaysia is at the top of the ranking with a ratio of 80 percent of GDP, up from 60 percent in 2008.
Economists were also concerned about the high levels of consumer debt in Thailand, which just got out of the technical recession this week.
On Thursday, the data showed continued weak exports and weakened consumer demand.
“It’s important that with rising costs, people from middle to low [income scale] will try to supplement their income wherever they can,” said Song Seng Wun, an economist at the Malaysian bank CIMB.
Historically high gold prices over the past two years have contributed to people stalling their personal belongings and taking advantage of the opportunity to exchange their family jewelry for cash.
About 70 percent of the items stopped at 200 city stops are made up of gold.
People say the price of gold looks good, we stop Grandma's gold necklace and get it back next month.
EasyMoney, Thailand’s largest operator, has seen a 20 percent increase in the number of customers using its pawn shop in recent months.
ValueMax, the operator of a branch in the center of Bendemeer and 15 similar in Singapore, plans to expand not only to neighboring Malaysia – where it has four branches – but also outside Asia, said ValueMax CEO Yeah Lee Ching.
The company will fund this by using 60 percent of the SGD 66 million it gained this week on the Singapore Stock Exchange.
While some discount lenders have come under fire for high interest rates, Ms. Yeah says the bond offers not only lower rates than other lenders, but it also doesn’t directly raise debt.
“Customers stop items they already own, and monetizing personal property doesn’t increase household debt,” he says.
In the company, the asset guarantee is increasingly accepted as a means of securing short-term, secured financing.
Moreover, among those who use the stalls, it is not just people in financial distress.
Rich people from Singapore also use ValueMax branches when stopping gold bars or Rolex watches, and can thus reach up to 60 percent of the purchase price in cash.
Our customers come from all possible backgrounds.
“These include wealthy individuals who need short-term borrowing because of their bold trades or investments, or small businesses that need help solving problems in their cash flow,” says Ms. Yeah.
Sometimes they just need the money as quickly as possible.
Rescue package worth $325 million for Tasmanian health care
The federal government insists that the $325 million bailout for Tasmania’s dying health care package includes tough conditions to ensure the state government does not waste funds.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Australian Union is taking “rapid measures” to reverse the crisis caused by the island’s aging population, higher numbers of chronic diseases and systemic disorders.
Funding for four years was decided after government consultations with independent Tasmanian MP Andrew Wilke.
"The government has come up with an emergency rescue package that we believe will solve the specific problems the state faces," Plibersek said today.
The $325 million package contains $31 million for surgery at the request of the patient.
Another 2,600 surgeries, including orthopedic surgeries and grayscale surgeries, will help eliminate debt.
The money also goes to open-access clinics in Hobart and Launceston, improved postoperative care, training of health specialists, mental health services and the introduction of personal electronic health records systems in local hospitals.
“These investments are responding to the thoughts that the leading clinical doctors have told me that they will best help the Tasmanian health system,” Plibersek said.
The Minister stressed that the Tasmanian government must require a strict reporting regime and accounting obligations.
The state will have to maintain the current level of funding to receive Australian Union money, and report monthly on where the additional funds have been spent.
A three-member committee will be set up to ensure that the State delivers services as efficiently as possible.
Mr. Wilkie said today that $325 million would be useless “until real reform is followed to lay a more sustainable foundation for Tasmania’s public health system.”
Nevertheless, he praised the government for responding to his request for urgent assistance, which he first raised during talks with the prime minister in early May.
“I believe that the federal relief package will be able to free the state of public health from a critical state,” Wilkie said.
According to the state government, these additional elected procedures will significantly reverse recent cuts.
Federal opposition health spokesman Peter Dutton believes today’s statement is just “a patch.”
“The reason I’m here is because the Labour government has taken $430 million out of our health care system,” he told ABC TV.
You can't have a state government that takes away nearly half a billion dollars, and an Australian Union that donates 300 million dollars, and pretend that's good news.
Mr. Dutton urged Ms. Plibersek to ensure that not a single dollar of the bailout would be spent on higher bureaucracy.
Guillaume Nicloux adapted Denise Diderot’s novel, which brings an exceptional film journey and the embodiment of time, but is also more boring than it should be.
Set in the 1960s in France, it tells the bleak story of Suzanne, a young noblewoman who is sent to a monastery with her family.
When he rebels, he experiences extreme cruel treatment from a criminally perverted mother represented and becomes an object of sexual passion for another.
The film never slips into obscenity or sensuality, and that’s his problem.
The ceremonial nature of this story leads to the fact that even the viewers will experience the torment of wearing a dressed shirt.

Syria Has Destroyed Its Chemical Weapons Manufacturing Equipment, Says Surveillance Authority
Syria has destroyed essential chemical weapons and ammunition equipment with toxic gas, the Committee for Global Chemical Weapons Surveillance said on Thursday, as fierce conflicts broke out in the north of the country, not far from one of the places where the toxic substances are believed to be stored.
On Thursday, a Syrian activist group said more than 120,000 people had been killed since the start of the civil war nearly three years ago.
The announcement of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons came the day before November 1.
the date set by this Hague-based organization in Damascus for the destruction or exclusion from operation of all chemical weapons production facilities and chemical mixing machinery for the production of toxic gas and ammunition.
Completing this basically initial phase of destruction is a significant milestone in an ambitious timetable that aims to destroy all chemical weapons in Damascus by mid-2014.
The destruction of equipment means that Syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons.
Damascus, however, has yet to begin the destruction of existing weapons and supplies.
It is estimated that this country has about 1,000 tons of chemicals and weapons including yperit and sarin nerve gas.
The announcement came as fighting raged in the city of Safira on Thursday, which experts refer to as the headquarters of a chemical weapons factory and warehouses, the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.
A group of activists who monitored the total number of casualties through a network of activists in Syria said on Thursday that 120,296 people had died.
There are 61,067 civilians, including 6,365 children.
The government side is expected to include 29,954 members of Bashar al-Assad’s armed forces, 18,678 pro-government fighters and 187 Lebanese Hezbollah militants.
Among those killed are 2,202 government runners and approximately 5,375 opposition fighters, many of whom are foreigners.
On July 25, the United Nations estimated that 100,000 people had died in the conflict since March 2011.
Since then, this number has not been updated.
The conflict forced about 2 million people to leave the country.
Assad’s forces fought in Safira against the rebels, many of whom are linked to al-Qaida, for weeks.
The observer said Thursday that the losses were on both sides, but did not have specific numbers.
The fighting has underlined the dangers faced by chemical weapons inspectors who, in their mission to rid Syria of its chemical arsenal in the midst of the ongoing civil war, have to deal with tight deadlines.
A statement from the OPCW office, which is working closely with the UN, said his team is now “delighted to have verified – and monitored – the destruction of Syria’s declared essential manufacturing and mixing/filling equipment.”
He added that “there are currently no further control activities planned.”
Earlier this week, inspectors said they had completed the first round of verification work when they visited 21 of the 23 places declared by Damascus.
Inspectors said they were unable to visit the two sites due to security concerns.
On Thursday, the OPCW said the two sites had been “abandoned and ... the items of the chemical weapons program it contained were moved to two other declared sites that were being inspected.”
It was not immediately clear whether the facility in Safira was one of those places that OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria has agreed to a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which must be approved by the OPCW Executive Committee next month.
"I swear by the courage and courage you have shown in carrying out this most demanding mission that this organization has ever had," Director of Observers Ahmet Uzumcu said in a statement issued by the OPCW.
Now, in its third year, mainly Sunni Muslim rebels and the Assad government with their security forces, which are full of members of the Alawite sect, are facing each other in the civil war.
Regarding further developments, the head of the Observatory, Rami Abdul Rahman, said there was a strong explosion inside air defense facilities in the Syrian coastal province of Lazikia on Wednesday.
He said the cause of the explosion was unknown.
Anger over the verdict on the founder of the Bali bombing
Survivors and relatives of 202 people killed in the 2002 Bali bombing responded furiously to the verdict on the last of the founders who were put to justice, saying that Umar Patek should be executed.
Patek, who spent nearly 10 years on the run as one of the most wanted people in Southeast Asia, was sentenced yesterday to 20 years in prison for building explosive devices that were used in the bombing.
In 15 years, he could be released on parole.
The 45-year-old man was found guilty of mass murder in an attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist area of Kuta, which left 202 people dead, including 88 Australians, and many injured.
He was also found guilty of several other terrorism-related charges, including a series of bombings of churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve 2000.
The prosecution demanded life imprisonment, although it may have insisted that a man nicknamed "Demolition man" be sentenced to death because of his reputation as an explosives expert.
This decision revived the painful memories of June Corteen, a mother from Perth, who lost her 39-year-old twins Jane and Jenny in a devastating attack launched by Patek and other founders nearly a decade ago.
With tears in her eyes, she said that Patek was to be sentenced to death.
I really think he should follow in the footsteps of the others.
For the AAP agency, Ms. Corteen said, “It should be placed in front of the execution squad.”
Every day I have to live with the fact that I will not see other grandchildren and my daughters.
Sari Club was compared to the ground when a heavy load placed outside a parked van was set off shortly after 11 p.m. on 12 October 2002.
Peter Hughes was at the Paddy bar, where just 20 seconds earlier, a suicide bomber set off a backpack filled with explosives.
As a result of the explosion, he fell into a coma for a month, and while kept alive, three times doctors "died".
Mr Hughes said Pateka should face the same fate as the other three members of the Jama Islami terror cell responsible for the massacre – Amrozi, Muchlas and Imam Samudr – who were executed four years ago.
This guy should get the death penalty like no one else.
Keeping him alive... there's no reason to keep him alive, it's just not.
Getting 20 years for killing 202 people and injuring hundreds more isn't that much.
Patek was the last of the Bali attackers in court.
He avoided arrest for nearly a decade, but was eventually captured in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad in January 2011, where less than four months later US forces killed former al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden.
During the trial, an FBI agent said in his testimony that intelligence reports revealed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet with bin Laden in an effort to re-establish ties between terrorist groups from Southeast Asia and Al-Qaeda.
"He didn't give up voluntarily," said Mrs. Corteen.
To this day, he has not felt remorse for how much sorrow he has caused others.
The verdict comes ahead of the 10th anniversary of the attack later this year, which will include ceremonies in Bali and Australia.
"We're going to see a lot of tears this year," Mrs. Corteen said.
Patek can still appeal the verdict.
FAA: Air passengers can now use technology gains on airplanes (but can’t make calls from their mobile phones)
Passengers of airlines will be able to use their electronic devices “from door to door” – in addition to calling from their mobile phones – to read, play games, watch movies and listen to music based on the eagerly awaited new rules issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on Thursday.
Passengers should not expect changes to occur immediately.
How quickly the change will be introduced will vary according to the airlines, FAA director Michael Huerta said at a press conference.
Airlines will have to prove to the FAA to what extent their aircraft comply with the new rules and that they have updated the flight crew training manuals and equipment storage guidelines to be in line with the new rules.
The FAA said it had already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices in aircraft.
Among the companies that have already submitted the plans are Delta and JetBlue.
“Depending on the status of such a plan, we can improve the widespread use of electronic devices very quickly,” the FAA said in a statement.
Passengers are now required to turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the aircraft’s doors close.
They cannot turn them on until the plane reaches a height of 3 kilometers and the captain issues a permit.
Passengers are expected to turn their devices off again when the plane drops to land, and not turn them on until the plane is on the ground.
Under the new rules, airlines whose aircraft are properly protected against electronic interference may allow their passengers to use their equipment during take-off, landing and commuting, the FAA said.
Most new transport aircraft and other aircraft, which have been adapted to allow passengers to use Wi-Fi at higher altitudes, are expected to meet these criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Association of Professional Stewards, welcomed the changes.
“Once the new rules are put in place safely – and we will work closely with transport companies on this – it will be a success,” Glading said in a statement.
To be honest, we are tired of looking like “guardians.”
However, surfing the internet, sending emails and texting or downloading data will continue to be prohibited below 3 kilometers above sea level, the agency said.
Passengers will be notified to switch their smartphones, tablets and other devices to air mode.
So still no Words with friends, an online scrabble game played by actor Alec Baldwin on his smartphone in 2011, when he was, as is well known, thrown from an American Airlines plane because he refused to turn off his device when the plane was parked at the gate.
And heavier devices like laptops will have to continue to be stored because of fears that they might hurt someone if they fly over the cabin.
Mobile phone calls on board will continue to be banned.
The rules for the use of mobile phones are not set by the FAA, but by the U.S. Federal Telecommunications Committee.
The FAA may lift the ban on some electronic devices during take-off and landing.
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the State Transportation Safety Committee, a national transport safety expert at CBS News, said mobile phones continue to be considered a risk.
“Mobile phones are really a problem, not only because they can potentially create interference with navigation devices, but from FCC data we also know that in the air they can cause interference to broadcast towers,” Rosenker said.
A specialty advisory committee set up by the FAA administration to examine the issue proposed last month that the government allow wider use of electronic devices.
The FAA has been under pressure in recent years to ease restrictions on their use.
Critics such as Senator Claire McCaskill, a Democrat from Missouri, argue that there is no legitimate security reason for this ban.
Restrictions are also increasingly difficult to enforce, as the use of such devices is ubiquitous.
Some studies suggest that up to a third of passengers forget to turn off their devices or ignore them.
The FAA began restricting the use of electronic devices by passengers in 1966 in response to the disruption of navigation and communication equipment when passengers began carrying FM radios, a technical gain of the time.
New airlines are much more reliant on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed, and approved by the FAA administration, to be resistant to electronic interference.
For several years, airlines have been offering passengers the use of Wi-Fi at travel altitudes.
Plans adapted for Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to interference.
The vast majority of airlines should adapt to greater use of electronic devices under the new rules, Huert said.
Current electronic devices generally emit much less intense radio broadcasting than those of previous generations.
For example, electronic readers only emit a minimal broadcast when turning the page.
But broadcasting is stronger when devices download or send data.
Among those pushing to release restrictions on the use of these devices by travelers is Amazon.com.
In 2011, representatives of the company loaded the transport aircraft with their electronic Kindle readers and conducted a test flight, but no problem appeared.
Members of the FAA Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings as to whether these devices pose any risks.
Douglas Kidd of the National Air Passenger Association said he believes disruption from these facilities is real, even if the risk is minimal.
Other committee members have stated that there are only fragmented reports from pilots that are intended to support the fact that such devices can cause disruption to air systems, and most of these reports are very old.
However, the committee recommended that the FAA allow pilots to order passengers to turn off the equipment while flying under low visibility instruments.
The Travel Industry Group has welcomed these changes and considers it to be a reasonable practice for the traveller public, who is making the most of the technology.
“We are delighted that the FAA has acknowledged that a pleasant travel experience is not at odds with safety,” said Roger Dow, executive director of the American Travel Association.
The bird was airlifted from a drilling rig in the North Sea and released back into nature
The bird was transported to the coast after it was found exhausted on an oil platform in the Black Sea, and released back into the wild.
One was taken to Aberdeen last month by helicopter after being treated by the Scottish company SPCA in a rescue center until he recovered.
Colin Seddon of the Operations Center said: “This thunderstorm probably migrated from northern Europe when it was caught by a strong wind over the North Sea.”
Apparently he ran out of strength and found refuge on an oil platform.
Mr. Seddon added: "He was unable to take off again, so they contacted us for help."
At the time when he was released, he was in good condition and in good health.
Is the European elite ready to trade with Britain?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with a promise to merge businesses and define what changes UK entrepreneurs and job-creating companies want to see in their relationship with the EU.
To this end, we commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey in which we asked leading British entrepreneurs their views on the UK, trade and the EU.
YouGov surveyed 1,000 leading entrepreneurs representing UK companies of various sizes and from different sectors and regions.
The results of the survey will be a surprise to many.
We found that the overwhelming majority of businesses are now trying to export outside Europe, focusing on countries that are modernising and growing while EU countries are stagnating.
They want to see how the government prefers new trade ties with countries like China, India and Brazil, rather than getting caught up in the long and strenuous process of reforming the mysterious European institutions.
When asked about their views on specific policy areas – from monopoly regulations to product laws – most entrepreneurs expressed the view that control of these key competencies should be returned to Westminster.
There was general dissatisfaction with the single market and entrepreneurs said that the costs of the Brussels regulation now outweigh the benefits of being part of the European business area – consent was expressed by even 40 percent of large companies, that is, traditionally the most pro-European companies.
And in the end, our survey of top companies revealed the most eloquent knowledge, namely that a clear majority wants the UK to seek to change the treaty and relationship with the EU, which should be based on trade, not politics.
The findings, with which companies of different sizes and major business groups have identified themselves, show that the business sector is pushing for a ‘meaningful change’ that will bring the impact back to the UK.
A lot is at stake – achieving a treaty change and a better deal for the UK could mean a gain of up to 16% in the referendum on staying in the EU.
The Prime Minister should not hesitate: this survey shows that British trade supports his plan to amend the terms of British membership in the EU.
This also shows that the business sector expects this change to be a significant shift from the current balance of power back to Britain.
A better deal for the UK is possible, and as the euro area embarks on the path of a closer economic and fiscal union, it is increasingly necessary.
Jobs and growth in the UK must be a priority, and as the results of our survey show, for businesses this means a re-focus on trade and a fundamental change in the Brussels regulatory approach.
John Kerry has admitted that espionage has gone too far.
The United States has sometimes gone “too far” in spying, U.S. diplomat John Kerry admitted during a video conference between Washington and London.
According to the minister, the collection of information was used to deter terrorist attacks.
The "First Washington Confession," according to AFP, sounded amid a fierce controversy on both sides of the Atlantic over scandalous revelations about mass surveillance by the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA), targeted by U.S. allies.
“In some cases, I admit, as President [Barack] Obama did, some of these actions went too far and we make sure it doesn’t happen in the future,” Kerry said.
In the interview, however, he defended the current practice.
It considers the collection of information to be necessary to fight terrorism and prevent attacks such as the September 11, 2001 attacks in the United States, the Madrid attacks in March 2004 and the London attacks in July 2005.
“We prevented planes from falling, buildings from exploding, and people from being killed because we were able to be informed on time about the secrets,” Kerry said.
However, he reaffirmed that the collection of information "in some cases has gone unreasonably far".
The US intelligence affair, which allegedly followed hundreds of millions of phone calls, broke out in Europe this month.
Among other things, it turned out that the Americans were also watching German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s mobile phone.
European leaders did not hide their resentment, and some of them called on the European Union to try to reach an agreement with the United States that would prohibit or significantly restrict surveillance.
Alexei Miller of Gazprom says pipeline in Bulgaria is launching a new gas era
The construction of the South Stream gas pipeline in Bulgaria means the launch of one of Europe’s largest energy projects, the director of Gazprom said.
“Today we are witnessing a milestone: construction began on the Bulgarian part of the South Stream gas pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe,” Gazprom President Alexei Miller said in a statement.
This project is a key element of the energy security of the entire European continent.
The South Stream pipeline should add diversity to the routes of Russian exports across Europe.
A contractual dispute between Gazprom and its partners in Ukraine, which brings most of Russia’s gas to Europe, adds to the risk of conventional routes, officials say.
Miller says direct connections to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, mean that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are “always” eliminated.
Once the entire project is operational in 2015, Bulgarian consumers will get gas from the South Stream gas pipeline at a discounted price.
Gazprom says construction is expected to begin in other countries towards the end of this year.
The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.
Hezbollah has deployed thousands of militants to Syria.
A decisive battle awaits.
The Lebanese Hezbollah movement deployed 15,000 of its fighters north of Damascus in preparation for a decisive battle for the Kalamun mountainous region.
According to clarification reports, Israel destroyed missiles aimed at Hezbollah in Wednesday's strikes at two locations in western Syria.
This Lebanese Shiite organization is fighting in Syria on the side of the Syrian army.
Its programme is also to fight Israel, which is not involved in the Syrian conflict, but it has made it clear that it will prevent the transfer of arms to the hands of Hezbollah in Lebanon.
Reports of Wednesday’s Israeli strikes on weapons stockpiles in western Syria are still being clarified.
Israel did not comment on the attack, but US sources confirmed it.
According to the Syrian website Dampress.com, rockets fired from the Mediterranean region hit the Syrian missile base Snubar Jabla south of Latakia.
The Al-Arabia intelligence station says two warehouses were hit, in which the missiles were ready to be transported to Lebanon.
According to her sources, it was a Russian-made SA-8 missile.
Israel declined to comment on the report, but military analyst Ron ben Yishai said Syria is continuously trying to supply Hezbollah with missiles and the Syrian air force is teaching members of the armed section of Hezbollah how to handle missiles.
The SA-8 is an outdated missile that the Syrian army has had since the 1980s.
They are placed on a movable chassis.
Although they are quite primitive, thanks to their mobility and small dimensions, they can be easily hidden.
They are equipped with a radar, but it turns off after firing the missile, so it is difficult to target them.
Latakia is located in western Syria, in an area inhabited by the ruling Alawites.
It is a well-guarded area and Hezbollah has been involved in fighting in western Syria in the past.
He claims to be helping to protect the Syrian Shia community to which the Alawites belong.
Now 15,000 of his fighters are reportedly ready to help recapture the army of Kalamun.
Along with Hezbollah, the Syrian army is also strengthening its forces there.
Kalamun lies between Damascus and Homs, the third largest city in the country.
The battle is said to be a retaliation for the recent attack by the opposition on the command of the Syrian Shiite brigade Abu Fadl Abbas in the Shiite part of Damascus.
Hezbollah helped the Syrian army to retake the city of Kussair near the Lebanese border this year.
Many insurgents from Kusaira have just gone to Kalamun.
Until recently, it seemed that the majority of citizens in the Czech Republic wished for early elections.
Corruption, money laundering for overpriced purchases and public procurement, tax hikes and last but not least government scandals have been cited as reasons.
According to the results of the elections, it can be concluded that the majority of citizens met this condition.
That they did not really care and with the state that was there (the theft and indebtedness of this state), they were actually satisfied.
Otherwise, I cannot explain that 3,413,497 voters did not come to the polls, 596,357 voters voted TOP 09,384,174 voters voted ODS total thus 4,394,028 actually supported the original government coalition, which represents 52.16% of all eligible voters.
That's a half majority.
When 1,016,829 <0xC4><0x8C>SSD voters were added to the above parties, then with the old order (because all the parties mentioned participated in the "theft" and indebtedness of this state), then 64.23% of the rightful voters actually agreed with this state.
In fact, the majority of voters have shown that there is no theft and over-indebtedness of this state to punish the culprits.
Or do you think that the members of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, who participated in it, will adopt appropriate laws?
Is there anything we can do to help?

The Royal Commission has learned that two employees of the Christian Young Men’s Association (YMCA) have been charged before the lawsuits against Jonathan Lord.
The Royal Commission on Sexual Abuse of Children found out that before charges were filed against child educator Jonathan Lord from Caringbah in 2011, two employees of the Christian Young Men’s Association (YMCA) in New South Wales had sex.
But it was reported to the commission that in its opening statement to the commission, the association stated that they had never dealt with a case of sexual abuse of a child in their organization.
Executive Director Phillip Hare was questioned on the case where one of the YMCA employees was charged with child pornography offences, and on another case where a Caringbah gymnast from the YMCA was convicted in 1991 of sexual harassment of children he had in his care.
Mr. Hare told Gail Furness, the commission's advisor, that he knew about the first case, but not the second.
He admitted that the YMCA’s opening statement was also inaccurate when it stated that the YMCA was conducting external audits that valued the organization as a leading advocate of children’s rights.
The evidence submitted by the commission indicates that the YMCA was alerted to the fact that in the August audit of the Ministry of Education and Society it received the second lowest of the four possible assessments.
Mr. Hare, who started working with the YMCA when he was 21, admitted that his own downward direction failed when he accepted Mr. Lord without making sure that the staff were aware of their duty to report violations of the rules of child safety.
Earlier this year, Lord was convicted of sexual harassment of 12 boys, which he committed during two years while working for the YMCA.
He was imprisoned for at least six years.
Mr. Hare, however, rejected the claim that the YMCA had a cultural problem that prevented staff from reporting Mr. Lord's violation of children's safety.
Staff members provided evidence that they witnessed such violations, including that Lord was alone with the children, caring for them privately, letting them sit at his lap, telling them he loved them, and letting them play with his cell phone.
Danielle Ockwell, who was Lord's subordinate and asked for training in children's safety because she was concerned about his behavior, testified that Jacqui Barnat, the head of child services at the YMCA in Caringbah, who was Lord's superior, was "very intimidating and often difficult to deal with".
The CEO said he did not accept staff evidence that they felt unconscious should they contact their superiors and report their actions.
Instead, he said that their friendship with Lord had darkened their judgment, so they did not report the problem.
Hare said he told the New South Wales YMCA board that the lesson from the “Jonathan Lord case” for the organization was that the staff “didn’t submit any report,” and the board agreed.
Mr. Hare said the decision to have staff sign confidentiality agreements shortly after the allegations surfaced was made by Liam Whitley, YMCA’s child services general manager.
He said the goal was to avoid distorting the evidence, but it was “excessively zealous” and poorly executed.
Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University told the committee that the YMCA in New South Wales was not a child-safe organization between 2009 and 2011.
He said there were serious problems with recruitment, verification, recruitment, training and management of staff.
The hearing was postponed until December 20.
Tony Blair said he would seize the opportunity to return to the post of prime minister, but admitted that the return is unlikely.
In a nightly interview on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of his resignation, the 59-year-old politician expressed his views on various areas of domestic policy.
Since his resignation in June 2007, after ten years in leadership, Mr Blair has mostly avoided talks on British politics, limiting his comments to foreign affairs and his role as envoy of the Near East Peace Quartet.
When asked if he would return to the post of Prime Minister, the London newspaper Evening Standard quoted his reply as follows: “Yes, of course, but it is probably hard to do that, so...”
While crowds of horse show experts gathered in Cardiff to fight for the Horse of the Year award, it was clear to everyone that the competition would not be easy.
But no one was prepared for three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
Although he is not in school yet and only a few months ago he made his first steps, this boy and his pet, the Shetland pony Toffee, smoothly crawled through three wheels to finally win the main prize and leave behind 30 dragging adult rivals.
This inseparable couple – of the same height – was praised for their appearance, behavior and style at the annual competition run by the Sunnybank equestrian centre in the village of Rudry near Cardiff.
He stood up against the gentlemen and ladies in elegant hats, tilted his beret to a cheerful angle, and let his two-year-old Toffee walk around the circuit.
Fenton was praised by the jury for his natural ability to control horses far beyond his age.
And Toffee got top marks for insight and personality.
Fenton Toffee was given his third birthday in March and has been practicing with this Shetland pony daily ever since.
His mother, Donna (30), said, "Fenton and Toffee work together very well."
They didn’t have much hope, but eventually they left with a golden cup and a bouquet.
It was only the second time he had competed with Toffee, and when he won, we were thrilled.
Everyone thought he was phenomenal and completely strange people wanted to take a picture with him.
A boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale in South Wales follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been performing horses for more than 10 years.
Mrs Howells says: “There was an exciting atmosphere and everyone was cheering and applauding.”
He ran through the sand along the length of the arena, and although he was so tiny, he did a great job.
Fenton is obsessed with animals – he loves horses, tractors and a farm and has two chickens in his care.
Given how he started, he’ll be back in the Horse of the Year competition soon, and I’m sure he’ll be doing well.
A spokesman for the annual horse show competition said: “Fenton is only three, but he already knows how to control the pony.”
They make a great team together.
The jury picked up Fenton and Toffee for their excellent speech and for the way they performed on the competition circuit.
They always watch how good the teamwork is between the pony and the one who runs it – and Fenton and Toffee were the best at the oval.
I'm sure Fenton's lovely clothes helped too, he really fit in there with him.
Too much news should be investigated.
The Chinese newspapers that requested the release of a reporter accused of libel on the front page will be thoroughly investigated, a press official said.
The New Express newspaper, based in Guangzhou, has made a rare public request for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
However, Chen later admitted on television that he was taking bribes to invent stories about a company partly owned by the state.
The manager said that the New Express newspaper will now make a “full correction.”
The "correction" order came from the State Administration for Press and Publications, Radio, Film and Television in Kuang-tung Province.
The preliminary investigation showed that between September 2012 and August 2013, the New Express newspaper of the Yangcheng group Evening News published several false reports about the alleged company Zoomlion.
“The editorial management of the New Express newspaper was disorderly,” the administrator said in a statement.
He said he had to decide “to impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou in the form of the cancellation of the journalistic license.”
He also “ordered the Yangcheng group Evening News to carry out a comprehensive correction of the New Express, and recommended that they investigate the relevant officials at the New Express and immediately change the management of the New Express.”
Mr. Chen wrote several articles for New Express regarding financial irregularities in the company with construction equipment called Zoomlion.
After he was detained, his newspaper published two requests for his release on the front page, claiming he was responsible for his journalistic work.
Mr. Chen then appeared on state television and admitted that he had given false stories in exchange.
"In this case, I have caused damage to Zoomlion and the entire media industry and its ability to gain public confidence," he told state-run CCTV.
I did it mainly because I was looking for money and fame.
I realize I've done something wrong.
After Mr Chen's apology, he issued a New Express letter on the front page of an apology stating that he had failed when he did not carry out a sufficient check on his reports.
Recently, several closely watched suspects have made a confession on television.
Experts say confessions are still regularly enforced, despite a change to this year’s law that prohibits authorities from forcing anyone to blame themselves.
A tunnel for drug smuggling between the U.S. and Mexico with its own railway was found
One of the most sophisticated drug smuggling tunnels between the U.S. and Mexico has managed to emerge, complemented by its own lighting, ventilation and electric railroad.
The U.S. authorities have described the tunnel, which measures about one meter at a time, as one of the most sophisticated secret corridors they have ever discovered.
The tunnel, which spans nearly six football fields, connects warehouses near Tijuana in Mexico and San Diego in the United States.
This area is full of indefinite warehouses, where trucks can be easily hidden before they are loaded with drugs.
Authorities said the tunnel was closed before drugs could have been transported unnoticed.
Along with the discovery of the tunnel, authorities also detained eight and a half tons of marijuana and about 150 kilograms of cocaine, according to court records.
Three men who reportedly worked as drivers were charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine in order to distribute them.
In case of conviction, he faces imprisonment from 10 years to life.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers penetrate vast drainage channels.
The Tunnel is the eighth largest corridor discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered in October after a marijuana harvest in central Mexico, which poses a challenge to drug cartels to get their product to consumers as quickly as possible.
In 2010, authorities found a 650-metre-long corridor equipped with rails that led from the kitchen of one house in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.
The economy and the center connect management.
For example, they offer joint advertising.
The new integrated newsroom of Economia in Prague.
Economia has taken another step towards transforming the Centrum holding company into its media house.
Since Friday, the Economy and the Center have shared top management.
"The unification of the organizational structure and the personnel union are essential for the integration of the two publishing houses into a common media house," commented the changes made by Vice-Chairman of the Board of Directors of Economy and Commissioner General Kamil <0xC4><0x8C>ermák.
<0xC4><0x8C>ermák, which will lead the unified management, will be complemented by Andreas Demuth, CEO of Centrum Holdings.
Pavel Vopa<0xC5><0x99>il was appointed as the new joint director of the business, to whom the advertising director of both companies, Zuzana Tyl<0xC4><0x8D>erová, is also subordinate.
The new head of information technology was <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>pán Burda.
The joint editor-in-chief is Vladimír Piská<0xC4><0x8D>ek, whose team also includes Jakub Unger, director of transformation.
The newly established position of Marketing Director was entrusted to Adela Pitts.
The separate corporate communication department is newly managed by V<0xC4><0x9B>ra Lhotská.
The joint financial director is Karel <0xC5><0xBD>alud, human resources management for both publishing houses is led by Petra Slabá.
"The new organizational structure will allow us, among other things, to come to the market with a common offer of advertising products, to better connect the creation of the content of all issued titles and, last but not least, to significantly streamline the business management of the company," added <0xC4><0x8C>ermák.
Economy, owned by financer Zden<0xC4><0x9B>k Bakala, entered into an agreement to buy Centrum Holdings and its Czech subsidiaries at the end of April.
The portfolio of Centrum Holdings consists of the servers of Aktuáln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz, <0xC5><0xBD>ena.cz, web portals, an extensive e-mail base under the brands Centrum.cz and Atlas.cz and SMB agency Najsiro or a portfolio of nearly two dozen other smaller websites.
The company Economia is the publisher of Hospodá<0xC5><0x99>ské novin, the news server IHNED.cz, the weekly magazines Respect and Econom and a number of printed and Internet B2B titles.
Among Czech publishers, it has long been the most successful in selling digital versions of its main titles.
In June this year, the publishing house moved to newly built modern premises in Prague’s Karlín.
CME targets the television business.
It will release nearly a quarter of people.
The CME media group will be dismissed.
By the end of the year, he wants to slim down a thousand people.
Osekat intends all the side activities and wants to focus only on his main business, television broadcasting.
The group, which owns Nova TV in the Czech Republic and also operates in Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Slovenia, employs a total of around 4,500 people.
Nearly a quarter of people will lose their jobs.
The media group operates television in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Slovenia.
Part of CME is CET 21, which holds licenses for broadcasting TV stations Nova, Nova Cinema, Nova Sport, Fanda, Smíchov, Telka and the Czech version of MTV.
How much savings will affect the Czech Republic, where the group employs about 650 people, and what this will mean for the domestic television channel TV Nova, is not yet clear.
"It's premature and we really can't comment on it," Novy's communications director Josef Koukoli<0xC4><0x8D>ek said.
According to MF DNES information, the significant dismissal of the Czech Republic will certainly not be avoided, but by far the biggest impact on the staff of the CME branches in Romania and other countries.
Both Novy’s new bosses, Christoph Mainusch and Michael Del Nin, who took over after longtime CEO Adrian Sarbu, spoke during a conference call Wednesday with analysts about wanting to limit all activities that are not directly related to the television business.
It is therefore very likely that it will significantly reduce the costs of producing its own shows, filming and production activities.
A cooling tower burned in the industrial complex of the <0xC4><0x8C>KD in Prague at night
A large-capacity storage tank was burning in the industrial complex of <0xC4><0x8C>KD in Prague, according to firefighters, apparently a cooling tower.
"The firefighters had already started the fire on Thursday before eleven o'clock in the evening, and this morning they were still blazing the fire," said a spokeswoman for the Prague firefighters, Pavlina Adamcová.
The amount of pollutants in the surrounding air measured did not exceed the permissible limits.
The extent of the damage and the cause of the fire are unknown.
Approximately five dozen firefighters arrived on Kolbenov street.
"It's a large-capacity tank fire, probably a cooling tower," Adamc said.
"There is no functional hydrant network in the area, so we are switching off using a transport line from the tanks," she added.
According to tn.cz, extinguishing the malfunctioning network of hydrants made it difficult, so firefighters had to transport water from elsewhere.
The fire brigade has declared a second stage of fire alarm.
There are a total of four stages, in the most serious situations a fourth one is declared.
The chemists also went to the site to check the amount of dangerous substances that could get into the air in the fire.
"But they did not measure the amount of harmful substances in the air that would exceed hygiene standards," a spokeswoman for the fire department said.
British police handed over notice of extradition to Assange
British police have handed over a notice of extradition to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who found refuge at the Ecuadorian embassy in London, where he applied for asylum.
Scotland Yard said it had delivered a "extradition notice" to the 40-year-old Australian, asking him to appear at the police station and that if he does not, he could face arrest.
Assange has exhausted his options under UK law when the Supreme Court overturned his appeal against extradition this month, facing extradition to Sweden on charges of sexual crimes.
Fearing that Stockholm would extradite him to the United States, he sought refuge on 19 June at the Ecuadorian embassy in London, where he asked the South American country for asylum.
Scotland Yard "delivered a notice of extradition to a 40-year-old man asking him to arrive at the police station on the day and hour that were assigned to him," the spokesman said.
Assange continues to violate bail conditions.
The embassy refused to comment on the delivery of the extradition notice.
Assange fears being extradited from Sweden to the United States, where he may face charges of espionage because he published 250,000 US diplomatic documents on the WikiLeaks website.
The driver was fined <0xC2><0xA3>1,000 for driving over 200 km/h with a hot drink between his legs.
The driver was fined <0xC2><0xA3>1,000 for driving up to 210 km/h with a hot drink placed between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, from Tiptree, Essex, was spotted on May 27 in his Mercedes Benz on the A120 road in Braintree.
When the police stopped him, she found that he had a cup of drink between his thighs.
At the Colchester police court, Howie confessed to the accusation that he was driving carelessly and carelessly.
Seven points were added to his account, resulting in a six-month ban on proceedings.
Howie was also ordered to pay the cost of <0xC2><0xA3>90 and a surcharge of <0xC2><0xA3>100.
As a result of the tax on foreign property owners, the London bubble bursts
The Ministry of Finance has provisionally calculated the income tax on financial assets, but is awaiting the final decision of Mr Osborn, who in the 2012 budget introduced a 7% transfer fee for buildings over <0xC2><0xA3>2 million and annual fees for buyers who own real estate within the company, not as an individual.
Revenue from the real estate transfer fee in the Westminster and Kensington and Chelsea districts, which reached <0xC2><0xA3>708 million in the 2012/13 tax year, already exceeds the total for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, Northeast, Northwest and Yorkshire and Humber combined.
Mr. Cook said: “Given the increase in the transfer of high-value homes and the introduction of related legislation to avoid tax evasion, it is very difficult to argue that high-value assets are little taxed regardless of the effect of the outdated tax system.”
He added that “this move could have caused some foreign investors to hesitate to buy properties in London, or to hesitate to sell existing owners.”
Top real estate – the top 5% to 10% of the housing market by price – in the rich belt ranging from Fulham to Wimbledon saw a record 11.8% increase last year.
Mid-London prices continue to grow steadily 5.6 percent year-on-year, but have been overshadowed by a thriving “home market” where, according to a survey by the Savills real estate agency, southwest, north (7.4 percent) and east (6.5 percent) have experienced growth.
Scientists have further illuminated how tail movements are related to the mood of the dog
Previous research has shown that happy dogs swing their tails more to the right (from the dog’s point of view), while nervous dogs swing their tails mostly to the left.
Now, however, scientists say that other dogs are able to detect and respond to these subtle differences in tail movement.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neurobiologist at the University of Trento, said: “People are well aware that the left and right sides of the brain have different links to stimuli that trigger positive or negative emotions.”
We tried to do the same with other species.
He added that, as with humans, the right side of the brain is responsible for left-handed movements and vice versa, and that these two hemispheres play a different role in emotions.
In an effort to get more information about how dogs respond to the disproportionate drilling of other dogs’ tails, the researchers monitored the animals who watched movies about other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of these animals and analyzed their behavior.
Apparently, it won't be long before we understand why their tails sometimes go to one side, and sometimes to the other.
Professor Vallortigara said: “We gave dogs films about dogs – whether in the natural version or in the form of a silhouette – to get rid of any confusing stimuli, and we were also able to adjust the movement of the tail and depict it more to the right or left.”
When the animals saw the otherwise inconspicuous dog moving his tail to the right (from the point of view of the dog waving his tail), she remained completely calm.
However, when she noticed the tail spinning predominantly to the left (again from the perspective of a dog waving the tail), their heart rate increased and the animals acted insecurely.
Professor Vallortigara said he did not think that dogs would communicate with each other through these movements.
Rather, he believes that dogs have learned from experience what movements they need and do not need to pay attention to.
He said: “If you meet the dogs several times and the movement of their tails in one direction is repeatedly linked to more friendly behavior and the movement of the right produces less friendly behavior, you will react based on this experience.”
Researchers say the findings can help dog owners, veterinarians, and practitioners better understand the emotions of their animals.
John Bradshaw, a dog behavior expert at the University of Bristol, said this was not the first study to examine whether the left and right sides are important to dogs.
Last year, a team from Lincoln University found that dogs turn their heads to the left when watching an aggressive dog, and to the right when looking at a cheerful dog.
And in another paper from the University of Victoria in Canada, he said: “Dog robots were more likely to get acquainted with dogs when they swinged their tails left than right, when they were becoming more uncertain – just the opposite of the Italian study.”
The difference can be given by the fact that in these different studies, dogs did not interpret animals in movies or dog robots quite like dogs.
He explained that it could help studies on how dogs respond to real dogs.
“Although there is clear evidence in the case of many different mammals that both sides of the brain are used for different purposes, many details still need to be clarified – and dogs are no exception,” he said.
But given how easy it is to record their behavior, it will probably not take long for us to understand why their tail sometimes goes to one side and sometimes to the other.
Arctic Monkeys postponed concert in Glasgow due to Alex Turner's illness
The Arctic Monkeys moved the concert to Glasgow after the lead singer was diagnosed with laryngitis.
The Sheffield group was scheduled to perform at the Hydro City Complex on Friday.
The illness of lead singer Alex Turner forced her to move the performance.
The group’s announcement came after it was similarly forced to postpone Thursday’s performance at the LG Arena in Birmingham.
In a statement on its official website, the group said: “After the decision to postpone today’s performance at the LG Arena in Birmingham and on the basis of medical advice, the group must also postpone the performance at the Hydro complex in Glasgow scheduled for Friday, November 1.
“Alexis Turner has been diagnosed with laryngitis and will unfortunately not be able to get out.”
The performance at the LG Arena in Birmingham will take place on November 20 and the performance at the Hydro complex in Glasgow on November 21.
All tickets for these shows will remain in force.
We would like to apologise to all those who bought tickets for the inconvenience caused to them.

Pope Francis Appoints First Cardinals in February
The Vatican announced on Thursday that Pope Francis is appointing new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time on February 22.
The cardinals hold the highest position in the clergy of the Catholic Church immediately after the pope and are the ones who elect the pope, so Francis will establish his first group of men who will eventually help to choose his successors.
There are now 201 cardinals.
But once the cardinal reaches the age of 80, he can no longer participate in the election of the pope – the group is reduced to 120 elected cardinals.
In a statement announcing the news, Father Federico Lombardi, a spokesman for the Vatican, said that before the solemn elevation of the new cardinals, a meeting of the current cardinals, known as the Consistory, will be held.
"Pope Francis has decided to announce his decision to convene the February Consistory in advance to facilitate the planning of other assemblies that require the participation of cardinals from different parts of the world," Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said the number of cardinals elected by February is likely to fall.
He said that the pope usually appoints as many cardinals as it takes to raise the number of voters back to 120, and as many cardinals over the age of 80 as he wants.
The Consistory next year will be significant because it will be the first since Francis was elected in March this year, Valero said.
At the moment, there is a certain orientation towards Europe, Europe and, above all, Italy.
“It will be interesting to see if the new pope nominates cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance,” he said.
Forty percent of Roman Catholics are in South America, but they have only a small number of cardinals.
It will also be the first election of cardinals since Francis established the Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from around the world tasked with finding ways to reform the Church.
In the past, the Pope decided everything for himself.
“Now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him,” Valero said.
He said it was "quite possible" that the pope would ask these cardinals for advice.
We haven’t been in this situation before – it’s completely new.
Valero said that the popes have traditionally promoted bishops from large places to the position of cardinals, but Francis is "full of surprise - so we don't know who he names."
GM is downloading some new light trucks in the U.S. to repair seat backrests
According to a Friday announcement from the U.S. Automotive Safety Authority, General Motors is downloading nearly 19,000 of its new (2014) Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra light trucks to fix a manual tilting backrest fault.
For some of these vehicles, the tilting mechanism of the front seats may have a malfunction.
As a result, seat backs do not comply with federal car safety standards for headrests.
A statement posted on the website of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) says that “if a car gets hit in the back, the head restraint may not protect passengers properly, which increases the risk of injury.”
The downloaded models were produced between August 1 and September 10.
GM launched the delivery in June, and for this leading American car maker, this is the most important launch of the vehicle since its restructuring after bankruptcy in 2009.
GM informed the delivery owner of the failure in the first half of October.
The NHTSA could not review the notifications to the owners due to a 16-day malfunction of the government, which weakened the growth of car sales in October.
Silverado and Sierra deliveries, which were reworked for the 2014 models, rose to around 20 percent in the first 10 months of this year, GM said on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado and 16,503 Sierra models.
Stocks on the New York Stock Exchange rose 1.4 percent on Friday afternoon to $37.47.
The desperate cry of Obama’s voters
I voted for Obama twice – I shared the hope for a possible change
He says Obama’s sincere efforts have been thwarted by the Republican Party’s obstruction.
The obstruction policy cannot apologize for the pain of Obama's health care website or the attacks of drones
The memoirs of Obama's 2008 campaign are a sad reminder of what could have happened
Nathaniel P. Morris is studying medicine at Harvard for the second year.
I am reading a very sad book these days.
I thought about this book that during the gloomy days of my second year in medical school it would encourage and restore a pinch of hope in me.
It is called "The Audacity to Win" and is a memoir of Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.
When I finish patient testimonials tonight and go to bed, the book brings me back to a time when politics inspired millions of people and speeches took your breath away.
The election ended with a crushing victory, and television news forced us to reflect on the historical value of this moment.
My classmates were crying with joy, and my parents were hiding the newspapers they had.
A young team of visionaries headed to the White House and the nation was ready for change.
At the time of his inauguration in 2008, Obama had 82 percent support.
And here I close the book.
Going into the present is a harsh awakening, like waking up from a dream.
It’s hard to remember these optimistic days – they seem to be distant memories, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
In the years after I threw my first ballot, there really were changes.
It was definitely nothing like what I imagined.
I recognize that Obama has achieved a number of great and diverse achievements – from the Affordable Care Act to the removal of our troops from Iraq and the end of the policy of “don’t ask for anything, don’t say anything” after the assassination of Osama bin Laden.
In addition, I am convinced that the party obstructions have reversed so much effort to move our nation forward: among other things, it is immigration reform, the public’s ability to choose health care and the closure of the Guantanamo base.
But after many situations in which I defended the Obama administration from colleagues and friends, I have reached the absolute limit in terms of the explanations they can provide.
I was in a place of political hopelessness.
The obstruction of the Republicans cannot explain their consent to intercept foreign leaders or to raids by drones that kill innocent children overseas.
They cannot explain that the National Security Agency is collecting data on Americans’ private lives, nor that it is harassing those who reveal government misconduct.
They cannot be held accountable for the execution of Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, without due process of law or for limiting public contributions and spending during presidential campaigns.
They cannot justify findings of a report that says the White House’s efforts to silence the media are “more aggressive ... than the Nixon administration.”
And most recently, they cannot even apologize for not being able to create a simple website more than 3 years after the signing of the law on accessible care.
I don't know if something like this could have been expected.
Whether I should have guessed at the age of 18 that government power might be at odds with the political campaigns that preceded it.
The elected function obviously has no predictable course, and our public talks will be shaped by an opposition political party and random events such as the Newton Massacre.
However, all the examples I have mentioned above seem to be largely the result of the administration's own decision.
And that's what bothers me the most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was excited about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney presented a confusing and unbiased alternative, and it seemed that he could not consolidate his policy or position.
I felt that the second term of office for Obama, freed from the pressure of the next election, would fill the hopes we once heard of.
Still, the return to 2008 – with Obama’s support falling below 45% this week – is becoming more and more difficult through this book.
It makes me remember the series of promises that have vanished.
This week I read a chapter in the book about how Obama suffered a crushing defeat with Clinton in the Pennsylvania primary.
At an additional meeting during the campaign, he told his staff that he had to get back to the pace and stay true to his mission.
"I want our magic back," he said.
We must not forget who we are.
Five years have passed, Mr. President, and I totally agree with you.
The views expressed in this commentary are solely the views of Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer Says Prime Minister Tony Abbott Is In Conflict of Interest Over Parental Leave Program
Billionaire and lawmaker Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott is in conflict of interest over a parental leave program because his daughters can get pregnant and benefit from it.
The mining tycoon, who is leading a dispute over the $6 million tax bill on coal, made the claim as he tried to remove the question of whether it was in conflict of interest.
The Palmer United Party can control up to four votes in the Senate, which play a crucial role in deciding whether to collect taxes on coal and mining activities.
But Mr. Palmer claimed that only ministers could be in conflict of interest, adding that Abbott’s daughters were in a position where they could benefit from the policy.
“He got into a big conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave, because if any of his daughters got pregnant, he would have a direct interest in whether or not she would get parental leave,” Palmer said.
Two months after the election, the Electoral Commission officially declared Palmer the winner in the battle for the seat for the Fairfax district in the Sunshine Coast region thanks to 53 votes.
Mr Palmer called for a review of the election results to speed up the process.
Daughters of Tony Abbotta Frances and Bridget.
Should these elections be decided two months after the closure of the polling stations?
"We have to have a better system," he said.
Why can't we have a system where you can come in, type details into your computer, vote immediately, and have the results at half past seven?
Mr Palmer also criticized the use of pencils to mark ballots.
The point is that the results can be erased if someone does not like them?
These days and at this time, the use of pencils seems incredible.
The Electoral Commission has been studying the possibilities of electronic voting and has recently made a joint contribution to the discussion with New Zealand.
Mr Palmer, 59, said his political agenda also applies to the Sunshine Coast airport and that he would take his new job “very seriously”.
A public office is a public service.
“We are not seeking any reward except that we can serve the society at this critical time,” he said.
Wash your hands?
Scientists have discovered that washing your hands will change your mood as well.
The experiment involved 98 people, divided into three groups.
The first two were tasked with solving an unsolvable task.
Of course, both failed.
But the group that failed to wash their hands seemed much more optimistic than the one where the participants did not wash their hands.
Also, the group "with washed hands" did better in the next test than the other.
Nonetheless, those who washed their hands achieved worse results in other tests than those who did not wash their hands.
The results of the "washed" were at the level of the third group, whose participants did not register any previous failures.
The results of the test indicate, according to psychologists, that physical cleanliness eliminates really negative feelings after failure.
At the same time, however, the motivation decreases, the tests need to focus much more on other tests.
If we were to transfer the research results to the Czech Republic, we would probably be the most optimistic after returning from the toilet.
After using the toilet, not only one percent of Czechs and Czechs wash their hands, but after using urban transport, it is already a fifth.
They usually stick to hygiene even after working in the garden or in the workshop, when 85 percent of people wash their hands.
Pet caressing motivates 78.7% of people to wash their hands.
Recent research has revealed that there is a difference in the perception of Czechs and Slovaks, how much it is necessary to wash your hands after laying hands on a stranger.
In this situation, 28.8 percent of Czechs and 40.3 percent of Slovaks wash their hands.
Research has shown that both nations wash their hands about ten times a day.
"Although it would have been in place, I'm afraid the reality is different and people are trying to make themselves a little better," said dermatologist Claudia Komárková.
RBS suspends two foreign exchange traders
According to two people familiar with the situation, the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) is suspending two traders in its foreign currency division, which is another indication that global investigations by supervisory authorities into suspected currency market manipulations are becoming more frequent.
Some of the world’s largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are working with competent authorities on investigations into the world’s largest financial market, where they change owners every day for $5.3 trillion.
The two traders mentioned would be the first employees of RBS suspended as part of an expanding investigation that will respond to the LIBOR (London Interbank Rate) manipulation scandal.
The bank declined to comment on the suspension, but confirmed it had received a request for information from authorities this month.
“Our relentless investigation into this matter continues and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and our other authorities,” the bank said in a statement.
Last month, people close to the event said RBS had handed over records of emails and instant messages sent from accounts and to the former trader’s accounts to the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority.
This trader, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010 and is expected to have been released from his current position as European Foreign Exchange Trading Chairman at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, the European president of cash trading at Citi, took a break this week, while Matt Gardiner, the former head of currency trading at Barclays and UBS, was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders have been charged with any offence.
Mr. Usher’s group for sending out quick messages included bankers from Barclays and Citigroup, people said dedicated to the event.
UBS said this week that after the Swiss regulator Finma announced that it was investigating suspected foreign exchange manipulation in several Swiss banks, it had taken steps against some of its employees.
At least six authorities worldwide – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss antitrust agency Weko, the FCA, the U.S. Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are investigating allegations that these bankers have teamed up to move with the currency market.
People familiar with the situation said that HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse had also launched an internal investigation or received a request for information from the competent authorities.
Banks have been scanning for years with fast messages and e-mails to find cases of violations.
Reports of investigations have alarmed traders in an area that has been one of the biggest engines for making profits in investment bank closures in recent years, but that has been disrupted by small currency volatility limiting opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to reduce the severity of the situation by arguing that with a large and highly liquid foreign exchange market it is essentially impossible to manipulate, but high-ranking traders say that this may not necessarily be true.
A high-ranking trader said that despite the significant volume of daily foreign exchange trading, shrinking liquidity between different trading platforms and banks increasing the use of their own internal platforms means that “you can start to have an impact on the market at relatively low prices.”
The report came on the same day that Credit Suisse announced it had fired a trader from its stock trading division this week, which caused a loss of nearly $6 million at the end of last year.
The Bank shall immediately notify the competent authorities and shall cooperate with their supervisory authorities.
“We believe that this trader acted on his own and that this problem has been solved,” Credit Suisse said in a statement.
The number of HIV-infected in Prague exceeded a thousand
Doctors in Prague have already recorded more than a thousand people with HIV.
From the beginning of the follow-up in 1986 to the end of this year’s third quarter, tests confirmed the disease in a total of 1005 people from the metropolis.
This is according to the statistics of the National Reference Laboratory for AIDS of the State Institute of Health.
According to her, 2,063 people have been infected in the whole of the Czech Republic.
In 396 diseases, immunity failure has already erupted.
198 people died.
The number of people infected in the Czech Republic in the last decade is increasing every year.
In 2002, tests confirmed the infection in 50 people, five years later there were 121.
In 2009, 156 new infections were detected, and in 2010 180 were detected.
Last year, the number dropped to 153, but last year it was a record.
According to the lab, there were 212.
"There is no doubt that the total number of newly diagnosed cases will exceed 200 this year," says AIDS expert Miroslav Hlavat<0xC3><0xBD>, who led the Prague House of Light for patients for years.
From October to the end of 2011, tests detected the disease in 39 people and last year in 47, Hlavat<0xC3><0xBD> said.
In September, the doctors recorded 21 new patients and three patients.
From the beginning of follow-up to the end of September, HIV tests were confirmed in 1,710 men and 353 women.
AIDS has spread to 161 men and 37 women.
The most infected were in Prague.
If you really want to get to know a city, you should go to a cemetery.
His visit will reveal more than a stroll through the cathedral centre with monuments, churches and galleries, more than a Bedekr would reveal.
Many people “read from the tombs.”
Slowly they wander the cemeteries and gain an intimate insight into the local reality.
They find out what kind of people live here, what nationalities, what faiths, how large and cohesive families they belong to, at what age they die here, how rich they are, how important their titles and professions were to them.
The way they express their social status, the way they like it.
And from the condition of the tombs they will also find out how they take care of their dead survivors.
Supreme Court upholds Obama's health care law
The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the health care bill signed by Barack Obama is in line with the constitution, a crucial victory for the Obama administration.
With a 5:4 vote, the court ruled that the individual regulation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act – which orders citizens to buy health insurance by 2014 – otherwise they risk paying a fine – does not contradict the constitution on the basis of the government’s tax authority.
The president of the court, John Roberts, stood on the side of four more liberal members of the court, while the judges, Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy, were in opposition.
The court also supported the remaining parts of the 2,700-page law and further ruled that the statutory requirement for health care, which orders states to expand the possibility of obtaining sickness insurance, otherwise threatens to lose all funding for sickness insurance from federal sources, is not coercive and contradictory.
26 states and the National Federation of Independent Enterprises have filed a lawsuit to block this law.
During the 2012 primaries, the law was vehemently rejected by each of the main Republican candidates, including the presumed proposed candidate Mitt Romney.
"Mugabe is a sluggish donkey" no longer threatened with imprisonment, court repealed the law
So far, Zimbabweans have had to pay close attention to how they speak in public about the eighty-nine-year-old Mugabe, who has ruled the country since the early 1980s, and since the end of 1987 has been at the forefront of it.
According to section 33 of the Criminal Code, a fine of $100 could be imposed for a period of up to one year.
"Prosecutors should not zealously accuse people who comment on the president in pubs or other public places," the Constitutional Court said in a statement.
Nine judges unanimously agreed that the law undermines freedom of expression.
It is likely that the government will appeal against the court’s decision, the British BBC reported.
A number of injured Zimbabweans, including Tendai Danga, who was arrested by police two years ago for allegedly insulting the president in a bar fight.
In May, an opposition activist appearing in Mugabe’s public office ended up in prison with a slap in the face.
In August, the prosecutor accused a 26-year-old man of using a poster with Robert Mugabe’s face as toilet paper.
The court also ruled that it was an unconstitutional law restricting the freedom of the media.
"The state cannot punish people whose statements later turn out to be untrue," Deputy Justice Minister Luke Malala said.
Until now, Zimbabwe’s law allowed a person who published false information to be sentenced to 20 years in prison.
"The existence of a law allowing someone to be criminalized for false statements has a chilling effect on the right to free speech," Malala said.
Despite the fact that Mugabe has ruled the country with a hard hand for more than 33 years, Zimbabwe adopted a new constitution with broader civil liberties on the basis of a referendum in March.
Small steps away from the one-man dictatorship of the country took place in 2009, when an agreement between Mugabe and the opposition took Morgan Tsvangirai to the Prime Minister's seat.
However, the country continues to suffer from the economic crisis and, until 2008, the world's highest inflation rate, which exceeded 100,000 percent.
In 2009, the government abolished the national currency altogether.
Nowadays, Zimbabwe only uses the currencies of other countries.
The impoverished economy is on the verge of Mugabe’s reckless agricultural reform.
In 2000, he redistributed the land of white farmers among his supporters and war veterans.
Most of them, however, had no experience with farming.
Central Banks to Maintain Swap Lines Permanently
Interim and bilateral agreements between the European Central Bank (ECB), the US Fed, the Bank of England and the central banks of Canada, Switzerland and Japan will become a permanent instrument that will allow banks access to global currencies whenever they need it.
This was stated by the banks in their joint statement.
“It’s a very sensible move,” said Julian Callow, chief international economist at London’s Barclays Bank.
“So far, all transitional instruments of this type have gradually become permanent, so this is no surprise to me,” adds Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch Benda, chief economist at BH Securities.
Central bankers are strengthening the ties that began to form in 2007, when the international credit market first shrank.
Central bank agreements have allowed access to the euro, dollars and other currencies to anyone who needed them.
The central bankers’ decision comes at a time when the U.S. Fed is preparing to end its program to support the U.S. economy, which could push the price of money in the global market even higher.
A swap contract is used as a standard to overcome a liquidity shortage of one currency while the current liquidity surplus of another currency.
It can be understood as a deposit of one currency and a loan of another currency.
The ECB is launching a third attempt to restore confidence in the European bank.
The EU has agreed on banking supervision, the ECB will oversee 150 banks.
How Tipsport (not)deletes personal data.
More than a year ago, I registered on Tipsport.cz.
However, I did not finish there, because there was someone sitting on the branch that could not complete the registration from the Internet.
And because I didn’t want to go to another branch, registration failed, then I moved and thanks to that, my address and ID number changed.
When I wanted to complete the registration later, I was told that I couldn't because I have a different OP number, address and that I just can't complete it and that I have to ask for data deletion and make a new registration.
I did so and on 24.10.2013 I wrote to the technical support that I request the deletion of all my personal data from the database according to the applicable law on personal data protection.
On that day, the technical support wrote to me that I should complete the registration at the branch.
This started a marathon of e-mails for technical support, where finally after the 4th ordinance on 25.10. they wrote that personal data had been deleted at my request.
So one would think that he could make that new registration and here the problems started again first it wrote to me that my username is already occupied (I understand it was not deleted - it is not a personal data, but in the end they turned this off too).
So I used a different username and it occurred to me that my personal data is already stored to complete the registration at the branch (how can they have stored something that they claim to have deleted?), so I contacted the technical support again.
When I was asked how it was possible, I was told that personal data was actually deleted on 25.10. and to send an e-mail with that error.
I did this (yesterday around 3 p.m.) and today I was notified that I registered the same day (31.10.2013) at 13.22 and that it is not possible because I used the same name and date of birth.
I have been in contact with technical support for a week and I am still not able to deal with them.
And what about the fact that if it were true what they say (as it is not) no one could register with the same name or the same date of birth if this is already registered.
Just by the way at those 13.22 I actually registered, on the same name and date of birth, but I used a fake email and phone number and the world of wonder, the page appeared to me that they sent me an email link to complete the registration.
But how is it possible if you cannot register for the same name and date of birth?
Probably because Tipsport ties the registration to an e-mail and phone number, and the data simply did not come out as it claims.
So I told the tech support again that they’re just lying (either intentionally or not knowing what they’re writing) because what they’re writing is not true.
I have submitted several screens that the problem with registration was already before 31.10. so "false" registration does not affect this.
Tipsport wrote me a strict sentence - I'm sorry, but since you're already registered again, we can't verify your claim.
And the communication ended.
The respective repeats repeatedly the same sentence that the registration relates to the name and date of birth.
They can’t even accept the fact that the registration was not completed by clicking on that link in the email and so it didn’t even happen.
So if I summarize it, Tipsport not only hasn’t deleted the data as it claims, but it’s still lying when it claims otherwise.
Worse, it’s easy to prove how they lie and try to make it look like the fault is on the customer’s side.
By the way, after putting this issue on my personal blog, things got a little moving and there was an email from the Technical Support that they would pass the issue for verification and I would be informed (after a week of urgency and controversy and notification of the same error).
There is music playing on the bridge.
The Prague Transportation Company (DPP) has launched the Music in the Metro project.
The first vestibule, where instrumental music is played continuously during the operation of the subway, is the Bridge of the A line on the exit to Wenceslas Square.
The test operation will take six months.
Michal Horá<0xC4><0x8D>ek presents his new double album, band and three singers
Texter Michal Horá<0xC4><0x8D>ek brought to the hall of the Cologne City Hall not only his brand new two CD Czech Calendar, but above all in the show Between us singers Lenka Nova, Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek Segrad and Ondra Ruml accompanied by the excellent Orchestra Mat<0xC4><0x9B>ja Benka.
After an introductory intro and an acting study on the late musician, Michal Horá<0xC4><0x8D>ek gradually invited all three singers to the stage, he himself came with a candle in his hand and recalled the story of the last time they played in Cologne and in the theater and throughout the city.
"Otherwise, two kinds of cards were produced in Cologne, with which I had a lot of contact," he recalled.
He also recalled the birthplace of President Zeman.
"Maybe we could do a tour of Zákolany or Dúbravka near Bratislava," he joked about the parents of other presidents.
Several times in the evening, Horá<0xC4><0x8D>ek, who did not leave the stage and, if he did not speak, sat at a table with a glass of wine, touched his new musical act.
The calendar was also made by Josef Mánes, who put it on a watch, about ice hockey, but at the time he did not know anything about how we meet in those squares and we chant, who does not jump, is not Czech.
That’s the name of one of the songs from the Czech calendar, but we won’t play here today,” he said.
Ondra Ruml, however, said that from this record he sang for him a very suitable Sleep in the day, singing at night and accompanied himself with her on the guitar.
Otherwise, if he did not sing, he played percussion, then all three singers were accompanied by a band composed of keyboards, cello, guitar and double bass.
The three singers sang a little chorus together into the side of the heart, which immediately stirred the spectator.
"I'm glad that you were interested in the song, which did not surprise me in the city of Kmoch," said Michal Horá<0xC4><0x8D>ek.
After remembrance of Peter Hapk, I heard in the presentation of Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek Segrad, in the original by Richard Müller rewarded with huge applause, Hana Heger again remembered the song Dad liked Lida Baar and with Horá<0xC4><0x8D>ka's explanation of the communist Baar ban and West.
The composer Michael Kocáb was reminded of the song Sebastián, Segrado then sang a beautiful song Prague with Jardá Svoboda, a sad native and a former Kolí<0xC5><0x88>ák.
But that was the conclusion, the applause in the stands and the addition in the form of an optimistic song We live in a wonderful time.
One more addition was added to the playlist, but the fans were no longer applauded.
Almost immediately after the concert, the whole four of them sat at the table to sign not only the Czech calendar, but also the older CD, Michal Horá<0xC4><0x8D>ek’s books and even the cover from the legendary LP and with possible interested parties.
Berdycha with <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>pánek complements Rosol and Hajek
In the final of the Davis Cup against Serbia, the non-playing captain of the Czech tennis players Jaroslav Navrátil nominated four Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Berdych, Radek <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>pánek, Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Rosol, Jan Hájek.
The Czech representatives defend the trophy, but they go to play on the opponent's field in the Belgrade arena, where the match will take place on a hard surface from 15 to 17 November.
The Czechs are in the final for the third time in five years.
“We know we’re going to hot ground, it’s going to be wild and we have to focus on our performance as always.”
"We will go there with only one goal - to score three points and sell the best," said <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>pánek, who scored the winning point in last year's final with Spain.
Secret wars: Syria, Libya and Iran.
Training for Obama on how to bomb Syria.
U.S. Command in Libya.
TOP GUN in the Persian Gulf.
The Israelis have shown exactly what the bombing of Syria is supposed to look like.
Without unnecessary rumours, threats, and millions of statements, they sent planes, they hit the target and returned.
They do not allow themselves to be hampered by the official removal of chemical weapons in Syria.
They refuse to confirm the entire action and no longer comment on it.
The exact opposite of confusing and bigoted, acts of undeniable Obama’s Syrian policy.
And the most satisfying thing about the whole attack was what the Israelis bombed.
Don’t be confused by the media’s claims that a “Syrian base” or “consignments for Hezbollah” were bombed.
Recently I wrote here that while US aid to secular insurgents in the country remains only on a rhetorical level, Russia happily continues to supply weapons to Syria.
And it was the fresh delivery of Russian missiles landed in the port of Latakia that became the target of the Israeli airstrikes.
That's a clear message.
And notice, Israel once again bombed the Assad regime, not the insurgents, although according to popular internet theories it should be the opposite.
The U.S. government has awarded two members of the Space Force, probably the Delta Force.
It was not known until now that they were distinguished during the attack on the US consulate in Benghazi.
It is known the heroic death of two former SEALs who defended the CIA campus in the city, in my opinion they were members of the secret CIA command, which is made up of former soldiers.
It has long been speculated what the SEALs were doing at the consulate or even at another CIA residence.
Now it's clearer.
In any case, the information that the CIA has its offices in Libya protected by machine-gun nests (on one such site both members of the SEALs were killed after a mortar attack) is quite surprising.
But even more surprising is the information about those two previously unknown heroes.
They were part of the U.S. command in Tripoli, and as soon as they received the report of the attack in Benghazi, they volunteered to intervene and, together with five private contractors, made their way to the CIA compound in Benghazi.
Obama’s administration is blaming the fact that during that attack, the commando was not deployed officially and completely, and that it was simply hesitant to do anything.
Commander Command, so without orders, apparently will release these volunteers.
In any case, the fact that the country operates not one-time, but permanently US command, CIA agents and private contractors is quite interesting information.
This is because until recently nothing of this kind was officially admitted, and even now there is only talk of a NATO advisory mission in Libya.
But it is good that the US, even though half of it is trying to fight terrorism in Libya.
Although it would help much more to resolve the nationwide situation.
The last place of secret and permanent conflict that I want to write about today is the coast of Iran.
It’s not so long ago that the media has almost sung the Iranian air force for pursuing US drones.
However, little is known about how Americans effectively protect their drones.
Of course, if you happen to find your drone in the air, there is nothing you can do about it.
However, if an Iranian drone is discovered in international space, the situation is completely different.
And so it happened that the Iranian F-4 Phantom was chasing an American drone in international space above the sea, when perhaps the first sharp deployment of the American F-22 Raptor super fighter jet in history took place.
He succumbed to Phantom’s attempt to visually verify his weaponry without Phantom recording him on the radar or simply noticing him, and then when he suddenly appeared at his side and called on the Iranian pilot to return home, he listened without hesitation.
No wonder when the Phantom is an American-made aircraft, but remembers the war in Vietnam.
He can't compare himself to the Raptor.
We want to show that Pilsen can still win, promises Rajtoral
It's kind of a paradox.
While his team has not been successful in the last few years, the defender or defender of Viktoria Plze<0xC5><0x88> Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek Rajtoral has a form that brought him back to the national team after a year.
He also succeeds in shooting, hounds with activity, after surgery, a fine kick was ordered against him in the match in Teplice.
Viktoria scored in the last two rounds against Slavia and in Teplice after the victory, but in the end she took only one point out of these two duels.
Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek Rajtoral believes that his team will break the unpleasant series in a match with Jablonec.
We want to show that we can win.
"I believe that we will defeat Jablonec at home," promises Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek Rajtoral.
The team is carefully preparing for a tough match with the North Bohemians, who play offensive football.
Everything is geared towards a match with Jablonec, the coach prepares us well, as we always draw a lot from the video analysis of the opponent’s game.
"I believe it will be a great match on Friday night," the Czech representative attracts fans to the Doosan Arena.
Pilsen's last games didn't go as well as she wanted, but the word of the crisis of the defender Victoria refuses.
That’s how it goes in football, sometimes you’re in good shape and sometimes worse.
But I wouldn’t talk about the crisis.
"I believe we will win on Friday and it will be good again," said the defender of West Bohemia.
The Victorian team will once again rely on the support of the fans.
"It's on Friday night and I'd like to invite our fans who are great."
"I believe we will repay them with a win," adds Rajtoral.
Jana Pet<0xC4><0x9B>ová: A step back.
So I decided to take a step back, but when I think about it, it’s not really a step at all, it’s a big leap – a leap back a few years, into memories, into my childhood.
It's a memory of what it was like to have no worries and just come out of school and wash dishes, luxuriate and do homework.
Although these "duties", it was mostly just a theory, the wishes of parents.
The practice was completely different - to run out of school, to throw a bag in the corner and to run out.
Play with other kids ball games, jumping a drink.
Then, during the series, Helena and her boys embroider a festive napkin for grandma for her birthday.
And only after a few warnings finally wash the dishes, luxuriate, in the winter apply wood to the tile stones and do the tasks until after dark under the lamp (or rely on a fellow student and instead of the tasks to write love poems addressed to school love).
Breakfast in the morning with homemade strawberry jam (from real fruit, not the kind of jams that are sold now, the content of which was not even lying next to the strawberries) and drink it with tea from the dried herbs that my mother and I so loved to collect.
I also remember those magical evenings when there was a graveyard silence in the room, when my sister and I were recording songs from the radio on tapes that rolled loudly in the old tape recorder of my mother.
And then we flipped the tapes on the pencil and played the same song all the time, our favorite, and drank it with a siphon.
Or we phoned over the desk using tins that were tied together by a string - and when we were talking on the phone to hear each other better, it was necessary to thoroughly clean our ears, at that time the earplug was syrup + cotton wool.
The minimum wage was more than three times lower than it is now, and my parents were able to live from it so that we lacked nothing.
We didn’t need any of those iPhones, iPads, or even phones and laptops or branded clothes.
Clothing has been inherited from generation to generation and the best "accessory" to the wardrobe was a batiked T-shirt made at home using SAVA.
From the electronics, we were satisfied with my mother’s tape recorder and, at most, Walkman, which we shared with our sister and which, by the way, we used only on the train on the school trip.
We found it more interesting to play with Aunt Hat Hop or Man, do not be angry, or as I mentioned to go "just" out.
When I was a little older, we got a video player under the tree, my parents probably saved a long time on it, but unfortunately it did not warm up for a long time.
My younger sister shoved a shotgun into it, said he was so beautifully papping the tapes, so she tried to see if he slept and shotgunned.
Unfortunately, he slept, but it was his last meal.
Well, and he still has this incident, poor guy, on his dish from dad all the time.
She says that when Lenka was little, she squirmed into the video and thought she would play the recipe and didn't lose it, so she still can't bake it today.
I remember how we all managed to communicate, make arrangements without a cell phone, a computer.
My sister and I agreed with our neighbor’s granddaughter on our grandmother’s holiday, when we would meet again next summer at grandmother’s – and so it was, so it was.
We're meeting.
Promise me that you’ll see me in a year’s time!
I also remember the winter when we ran outside with the whole village, built snowmobiles, riding on a snowy hill near the church on sacks stuffed with hay.
Then we had dinner with the whole family and talked about the past day.
Of course, my sister and I heard the notorious phrase before dinner: "Go wash your hands!"
Yes, this is still true today, but you certainly do not have soap attached to the tap in the bathroom in a lemon mesh.
After dinner, when my dad in the garage was “working” beer with Jarda from the village, my mother and I lay down on the floor, leaning our feet against a tile stove, opening the door and looking at the flames and listening to the cracking of the wood that came out of the stones.
We were closer - really - we didn't count how many friends we had on the social network, we knew how many friends we had, the real ones!
We communicated together - we talked - we didn't write messages to each other every day through various chat rooms, text messages.
There was nothing like that, and yet we knew much more about ourselves.
And I could go on like this for a long time.
It is nice to remember, especially if I complement these memories by looking at the albums, where the black and white photos are neatly glued with black corners.
And if I didn't happen to know how old I was then, the back of the photo is always written the year of taking the picture.
I see that although the cuts by the pot did not suit us very well and in addition we had pants by the cousin by two numbers larger, no one laughed at us before, it was so normal (not IN).
And I'd rather go back to that step forward - into reality.
Until 2013 and I will wait for what the modern age will invent for my children.
What I know for sure is that these memories are now for the young teenage generation at least somewhere "one hundred years behind the monkeys" and I think they lose a lot that they won't experience this "too much" time either.
I wish they could!
Google, Samsung and Huawei sued over Nortel patents
The group, which owns thousands of expired patents for Nortel, filed a patent infringement lawsuit on Thursday against mobile phone manufacturers including Google, a company it had auctioned off in the bankruptcy of Nortel.
The Rockstar consortium, which bought Nortel's patents for $4.5 billion, sued Samsung Electronics, HTC, Huawei and four other companies in Texas for patent infringement.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google has been charged with infringement of seven patents.
Patents include technology that helps link the terms searched on the Internet with the relevant ad, the lawsuit states, which is at the core of Google’s search business.
Representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not immediately available.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC are manufacturing phones that run on Google’s Android operating system, which is fiercely competing with Apple’s and Microsoft’s mobile products.
In 2011, Google made a $900 million initial bid for Nortel’s patents.
Google has increased its offer several times, eventually offering up to $4.4 billion.
After being defeated by Rockstar in the battle for Nortel's patents, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, which was partly driven by Motorola's patent group.
“Despite failing to obtain patents at auction that are the subject of dispute, Google has infringed and continues to infringe on patents,” the lawsuit said.
Rockstar is seeking increased compensation from Google because it claims that Google is infringing the patent intentionally, as the lawsuit claims.
Miloslava Cejpková: The November Smile
It came from outside, from 4 degrees Celsius, which we're not used to yet.
At first she put a smile on her face, the one she was always giving in to as a defense against the pleasures of friendly surroundings.
This relieved her greatly, because it was a mask that she decided not to put off in public.
He was honest at home only on the days when she was grandmother and had grandchildren Elinka or Adika around her.
And, of course, when her sons phoned her.
She remembered the lesson from the endless courses of business skills very well.
Now they're really fitting.
Not to hurt your loved ones.
Then he flew into the corner.
Like a disguise.
November, or any other month, can’t do the miracle of smiling really, like when they were on a trip with someone who hasn’t been here for almost three years.
Egypt announces first freely elected president
Muhammad Mursi has taken an inaugural oath, but his triumphal day will hardly end the political unrest in Egypt.
ISLAMIST Muhammad Mursi promised “new Egypt” when he was inaugurated as the country’s first freely elected president, after Husni Mubarak, who had been deposed 16 months earlier.
In his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Mursi also became the first freely elected Islamic president in the Arab world and the fifth Egyptian head of state since the overthrow of the monarchy about 60 years ago.
He took an oath in front of 18 judges dressed in black plates in a mansion built overlooking the Nile, reminiscent of the ancient Egyptian temple.
"We are striving for a better tomorrow, for a new Egypt and for a second republic," Mursi said at a ceremony broadcast live on state television.
“The Egyptian people have laid the foundation for a new life today – absolute freedom, true democracy and stability,” said Morsi, a 60-year-old engineer studied in the United States and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that has been the target of sharp attacks by governments for most of 84 years since its inception.
When Mursi arrived shortly after 11 a.m. local time in a small column of cars, hundreds of soldiers and policemen were guarding the building.
Only a few hundred supporters gathered in front of the courthouse to celebrate the president, and unlike the presidential glamour of Mubarak’s period, the transport was only briefly stopped so that the column could travel along a normally busy road connecting the city center with the suburbs in the south.
Mursi’s personal prestige, ridiculously referred to as the Muslim Brotherhood’s non-charismatic “reserve tire,” has grown sharply since his victory and his Friday speech, which aimed to present him not only as a candidate for Islamists, but also for all those who want to bring the authoritarian to the end of the rebellion.
"Egypt is a civil, national, constitutional and modern state today," Mursi, dressed in a blue social suit with a red tie, told judges in a wood-clad chamber where he swore an oath.
Mursi later traveled to the University of Cairo, where he was to give an inaugural speech.
While he was on guard, he received an official welcome from the military band, which played the national anthem.
Military commander Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi was present.
His arrival was accompanied by chants of “an army and a people are one hand” from the mouths of hundreds of people gathered in the university’s main lecture hall.
The University of Cairo was founded in 1908 as a center of secular education and later in the 1970s became a bastion of Islamic student movements.
Mursi made a symbolic oath on Friday in Tahrir Square, the birthplace of the revolution that ended Mubarak’s authoritarian rule last year, and solemnly vowed to recapture the presidential powers seized from his office by the military council, which seized them from the exiled.
But by agreeing to make an official oath before the court, rather than before parliament, as is customary, he yielded to the will of the army, suggesting that the struggle for power will continue.
Mursi’s speech in Tahrir Square was full of dramatic populist gestures.
In the ghettos will probably be police specialists, they have to relieve the tension
Police specialists should be working in the ghettos in the Czech Republic in the future.
They'd spend up to half their walks here.
They would supervise the order and solve the problems.
Thanks to their knowledge of the environment, they should contribute to the reduction of tensions between people from poor places and the inhabitants of the surrounding area.
In its proposal to reduce security risks, the Ministry of the Interior takes this into account.
According to him, to improve the situation in the country would help mainly "accelerated social housing security".
The document was discussed by the government.
According to the analysis, there were about 300 poor houses and neighborhoods in the Czech Republic a few years ago.
There were 80,000 people, mostly Roma.
Adults in ghettos were out of work, families were dependent on benefits, children ended up in "special" schools.
It's a yellow squirrel.
According to the experts of the problem sites, in the meantime, it has increased by a hundred.
Relationships between them and others are becoming stronger.
Anti-Roma marches took place in several places.
People from the surrounding area also joined the extremists.
According to the interior, it is often difficult for the police in areas with ghettos to maintain security and order.
A key condition is the "consistent application of equal treatment in law enforcement".
It is impossible to achieve this without a detailed knowledge of the place and people.
The specialist would go for walks in the ghetto, where he would spend up to half of his service, the rest would serve in his district.
In a troubled location, he'd be overseeing order.
He would also know the locals, so he could better deal with problems or offenses.
“Thanks to the trust, specialists will be able to prevent a number of illegal acts more easily,” he said.
Specialists in ghettos would receive extras, namely 500 to 1000 crowns per month.
The deployment of special police officers in problem areas is to be paid from Norwegian funds.
The budget is around 600,000 euros (now about 15.5 million crowns).
The Czech Republic pays 15 percent of the amount, the funds 85 percent.
Preparations began this year, now a detailed proposal is being worked out.
The project is expected to last until 2016.
The authors were inspired by their neighbors.
This mechanism has been successfully applied for several years in Slovakia, where the problem with socially excluded sites is incomparably higher than in the Czech Republic.
"There are so-called Roma settlements here," the report's authors said.
How many specialists there should be in the Czech Republic is not yet clear.
The answer is to give an analysis that determines where a special police officer would be needed.
It will also depend on how much money the police will be able to spend on these members each year after the project ends.
According to the draft of the project, the first selected police officers will complete an internship in Slovakia.
This training should be attended by five dozen people a year.
The most suitable candidates will come from them.
There should also be special training for police officers who will work in ghettos.
According to the authors, social housing would help to improve the situation.
It should motivate and lead to integration.
According to the interior, it should have three categories.
The minimum standard would meet hostels with precisely defined rules, such as the number of people per room.
The average standard would be in smaller apartments.
A higher standard would be social dwellings that would be comparable to ordinary housing.
The tenants would have to implement an integration plan that would be compiled with them by social workers.
They would have to abide by the rules of accommodation, take care of their health, send children to schools, retrain and actively look for work.
If they tried to integrate, they would move to a higher standard of living.
The housing system should be operational for at least 30 years, according to the interior, until the next generation grows up “in a pro-integratively motivated environment”.
The model of social housing is prepared by the resorts for local development and work.
They have to propose it by the end of the year.
Karel Drábek: Kohler Mountain - one of our youngest volcanoes.
Uhlí<0xC5><0x99>sk<0xC3><0xBD> vrch is a striking hill 3 km southeast of Bruntál.
Along with several others, the evidence of volcanic activity in Lower Autumn at a time (from a geological point of view) is recent.
The last eruption here was at the beginning of the fourth.
Viewed from a greater distance, a striking white plastered baroque pilgrimage church of the Virgin Mary Help, built in the years 1755 - 1765, is located on the top of the Uhlí<0xC5><0x99>ské vrch.
He replaced the original wooden pilgrimage chapel.
The inn that stood next to the church did not behave.
Shortly after the completion of the church was planted an alley of four rows of lip, about 1 km long.
The crossroads on the Uhlí<0xC5><0x99>ské vrch is already the third version, the original one stood here after 1916, the second one, from 2001, lasted only until 2004.
At fifteen stops there are wooden plastics made by local carpenter Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek Nedomlel.
He used different types of wood from the Lower Autumn area.
Similarly, the pedestals made of rocks from the area here form an interesting geological exposure.
The name of the sponsor is also indicated on each stop.
The Coal Peak is a remnant of a young volcano.
Although data from radiometric age measurements vary somewhat, the last eruption here was about 1.5 million years ago.
It is therefore younger than the Great Roudn<0xC3><0xBD> (older than 3.3 million years) and older than the Venus volcano (older than 0.8 million years).
The volcano was born with an explosion.
In it, she threw out a significant amount of volcanic ash along with fragments of rock from the substrate, which by burning acquired a reddish-brown color.
At the end of this phase, lava leaked to the surface - today, it is a layer of porous masonry up to 13 meters powerful.
The second eruption ejected red, brownish-red and spots up to black tuffs.
Their layer is powerful up to 50 meters and part of it is accessible in the quarry wall.
In the tufts there are striking volcanic pumps up to 1 meter. Even the second eruption was completed by the discharge of lava.
At the end of the activity, lava leaked from the volcano, which today forms a 50 m thick layer of scrub.
Volcanoes, where the ejecting of volcanic ash with lava discharges alternates, are the most common type of volcanoes.
Because they are actually composed of layers, they are called stratovolcanoes.
The original volcanic cone was gradually eroded.
However, it was only threatened by the mining of rocks in the quarry on the south side.
The most intensive mining took place here from 1953 to 1962.
Tufts were added to the concrete, which was then lighter and had better thermal insulation properties.
Under the pressure of experts and the public, the mining was stopped and thus this unique place was preserved.
The problem, however, is in the porosity and small cohesion of the rocks, which are rapidly venturing, breaking down and sliding down the slope.
Fragment disappears quite quickly.
To make the situation even more complicated, the warm, south-facing slope is an ideal place for some rare species of plants and animals.
Correction is therefore problematic, but over time it will be necessary to select and maintain a characteristic geological profile.
This is nothing new, similar profiles are maintained in a number of important locations.
You can get to Uhlí<0xC5><0x99>sk<0xC3><0xBD> vrch by the green tourist marker from Bruntál or from Silesian Ko<0xC4><0x8D>ov.
Motorists can use the free parking at the beginning of the Lipova Alley, where a short learning trail begins.
She moved from the villa to the panel.
Ivana grew up and spent most of her life in a house with a garden and a swimming pool in one of the most beautiful Prague villa districts in O<0xC5><0x99>echovce.
However, the original owners of the house got it back in restitution and the tenants had to move with a small distance.
Therefore, Ivana was quickly looking for a replacement housing for herself and her then-old mother.
From acquaintances she received a tip for an apartment 3 + kk in an older panel house on the opposite side of Prague.
"At first it was a shock, but the view from the fourth floor of the vast forest park and dam on the other side impressed me," recalls Ivana from the first impression.
At first, I thought it would be a three-year interim.
“We have been living here for more than 13 years now, and not only for the sake of gradual reconstruction, I would not change,” the owner adds.
The mother and daughter then moved from a one-hundred-and-twenty-meter apartment to a smaller one with an area of 62 m2, and almost all the equipment was distributed.
The action was not easy, things were stored with friends and the gradual arrangement took almost a year.
The new apartment was in fairly good condition, but the necessary adjustments had to be made, for example, painting the doors or changing the windows.
The previous owner broke the core, but the owner was most troubled by the impractically solved and unnecessarily large hallway, and conversely a small bathroom.
By connecting the two rooms, a multifunctional living space was created.
The architects used gypsum board to define the individual zones and divide the room, which allowed the new placement of lights.
The first thing she decided to do after a few years was to remove the partition in the living room.
This changed the layout of the apartment to 2 + kk, but the room gained airiness and opened a panoramic view of the surrounding greenery.
The next step towards the partial improvement of the standard was to replace the PVC floor with the laminate floor.
With the bathroom, Ivana did not know the advice.
For years, I’ve been taking away housing magazines and looking for inspiration.
In one of them I recently discovered an interesting realization.
Therefore, on recommendation, I addressed young architect Kamila Doud<0xC4><0x9B>rová.
"It was actually the most important step in the future," Ivana says.
Thanks to the renovation of the bathroom, it was also possible to adjust the layout of the hallway.
The architect combined the toilets and bathrooms and replaced the two doors with opening wings with one sliding one, saving space.
The bathroom is timeless and also sufficiently barrier-free.
High-quality tiles imitate sandstone, in the shower there is a comfortable seat, in the toilet a bidet shower.
Successful cooperation with Kamila Doud<0xC4><0x9B>rová continued.
As part of the program How to build a dream, a rapid but fundamental transformation of the living room took place, in which the architect Martin <0xC4><0x8C>en<0xC4><0x9B>k also participated.
Into the space created by the combination of two smaller rooms, we had to get three functions, dining room, living room and bedroom, without the help of the classical principles of optical division, for example, half-walls or Japanese walls.
"This would violate the openness and unity of the space as a result," the architect explains.
Originally, it was possible to separate the bedroom and the living room.
It was enough to turn the back of two sofas and build a custom made diaper box between them.
The dining area defines the shades of the floor and the paintings.
On the floor in the kitchen and dining room, the architect used quality marmoleum, the sliding door was revived with wallpaper with a pattern.
The kitchen corner, if necessary, is covered by sliding panels with wallpaper.
The new floor made of anti-allergic marble has a number of advantages compared to the previous one made of laminate: a softer non-slip surface without joints and better sound insulation.
The system of niches and ceilings made of plasterboard highlighted by color is an example of how it is possible to work with space in the panel.
I left the colors on the architects, I wish it was joyful.
"I like orange, I had the same shade in the previous apartment," says Ivana.
A graphoglass cladding with a motif of flowering magnolia is practical and creates a distinctive aesthetic element.
To a warm, energetic tone, the architects chose white, which underlined the modern functional style.
In a small apartment it was possible to store books, among other things, in the room under the window sill.
Everything is within reach, the lights are comfortably controlled remotely.
In the redesigned interior, the contrast of the new with the old works perfectly, for example, with a decades-old crystal mirror and with high-quality art objects that Ivana collects all her life.
The kitchen was the last to come.
The cabinets were previously placed on both sides, and the owner felt a bit like a tunnel.
The architect took their number and relocated the layout.
Furniture in a simple design is made to order, the white area is softened by a slightly pearly surface.
They fit into a small space thanks to the imaginative solution of the washing machine, dryer and dishwasher.
The appearance of a small kitchen has been revived by the all-glass cladding of the walls above the worktop.
The unique graph glass with a digitally printed motif is attractive, in addition, it is excellently maintained.
Ivana chose the flowers of magnolias, which remind her of her favorite neighborhood, where she lived for years.
She seems to be happy here as well.
In the original bathroom there was a small bathtub and washbasin, the new owner chose a neutral shade of tiles.
The large shower has a Ronal glass door.
The task was to create a clear, simple space from a given environment, in which functions and devices will be in harmony.
We unified the interior materially and colorfully and tried to give it an elegant, cozy, not too crowded look.
"Another condition of the assignment was a barrier-free solution with a minimum of obstacles and the possibility of easy movement around the furniture and the availability of daily necessities," adds Kamila Doud<0xC4><0x9B>rová.
The Supreme Court ruled: Time cannot be prosecuted.
The Supreme Court ruled that former Prime Minister Peter Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as could also be prosecuted for possible crimes he could have committed before the August dissolution of the Chamber of Deputies.
It was protected only by procedural immunity, which applies to speeches in the House.
In the case of former ODS MPs Ivan Fuksa, Mark <0xC5><0xA0>najdra and Peter Tluchor, he decided that they could not be punished for any criminal offences until they surrendered their mandate last November, Supreme Court spokesman Petr Knötig said.
By this decision, the court rejected the proposal of the prosecutor Iva I<0xC5><0xA1>tvan, who wanted to continue the criminal proceedings with the MPs.
According to him, they accepted bribes in the form of lucrative posts in state companies for giving up their mandate and not making trouble in passing laws.
On the contrary, it is possible to further prosecute the former prime minister, who offered them these posts.
An anti-corruption police officer has also been detained with Vito Bárta.
Bart's lawyer Old<0xC5><0x99>ich Poverty, who also represented him in the case of alleged corruption of VV MPs, also did not want to comment too much on the case, but said: "Yes, I represent the client in this case too, but in view of the protection of classified facts."
According to information, the case is handled by the General Inspectorate of Security Corps (GIBS).
The tn.cz server said that Bárta could have bought classified information from the police.
According to prznizpravy.cz, the case may have been related to the case of former police president Peter Lessy, whose appointment he allegedly sought.
The latest information, however, shows that the detention of Vít Bárta has nothing to do with Petr Lessy.
The spokeswoman of the police headquarters, Eva Kropá<0xC4><0x8D>ová, refused to comment on the case, saying that the Prague City Council is dealing with the case.
"We will not comment on this question with regard to the protection of classified facts," said <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>pánka Zenklová, a spokeswoman for the Municipal Prosecutor's Office in Prague, on Friday.
It is there that the prosecutor oversees the case of Bártov, and it is therefore indirectly apparent from her words that the case or criminal proceedings are conducted under a regime of secrecy.
Reporter Novinek was able to reach his wife Vít Bárta Kate<0xC5><0x99>ina Klasnová in the morning before their residence in Prague Klarov.
She just loaded her suitcases in the car and left.
She refused to comment on the whole event.
On Friday morning, Tomio Okamura, the leader of the <0xC3><0x9A>svit movement, commented on Bart’s arrest.
He says he has no idea what the case is about.
"Seeing Bart was one of the many candidates of many parties on our candidacy, and as I have repeatedly said before the elections, he was not, nor is he, a member of the Dawn of Direct Democracy of Tomia Okamura," he added.
Vít Bárta, who in the past early elections to the House in the Pilsen region unsuccessfully ran for the Aurora of Direct Democracy movement of Tomi Okamura, is known for his corrupt cause of paying MPs for Public Affairs.
In April 2012, he was wrongfully sentenced to 18 months with a delay of 30 months.
The verdict was subsequently changed and Bart was acquitted.
I want a contract in the NHL.
I still have juice, desire and enthusiasm
For Prospala, the family always came first, which is why he wants to submit to her at the age of 38.
Either he gets a job overseas and extends his career, or he definitely quits hockey.
"I want to play the role of father and husband."
"I'm really looking forward to it," says the hockey player, who is still waiting in vain for an offer.
Despite the fact that he's a prolific worker who never screws up anything.
Despite the fact that he always leaves his heart on the ice and is able to smash his teammates.
And also despite the fact that he was the most productive player of Columbus last season.
"But the desire to show everyone in me is still there," he says resolutely.
The New York Rangers have reportedly failed to enter the season and have injured two supporters - attackers Rick Nashe and Ryan Callahan.
What does it look like coming to the Rangers?
They're just speculation.
Until I have something on paper, there's no point in dealing with it.
I know an article in the New York Post said they should sign me, but that's it.
Nowhere has it been delivered that it really happened.
Unfortunately, I would like to announce myself that I have a contract, but it's just not so.
You haven't heard from the club yet?
Such communication in the NHL takes place on a daily basis.
It is about getting into a situation where the contract really comes into play.
When, for example, a player is injured or someone is not able to do it and the manchaft does not step.
There are a lot of different factors that have to come together to get the contract.
But in New York, the same thing happens, right?
Rick Nash is injured with Ryan Callahan and the team hasn't been able to enter the season, so there's a certain chance, don't you think?
Of course, there's always a chance.
The second thing is that you always need two sides.
I'd take a lot of offers today, but I haven't received any yet.
This is the reality in which I have to live.
If you're flying to America on Friday, are you expecting something to work?
I’ve had those expectations since July 5, when the free players market opened in the NHL, and still nothing.
Are you going to New York City to remember?
Definitely not. I'm going to Tampa for the kids and my wife.
I look forward to the sun and seeing you again.
Do you have your program planned?
This is given by the fact that I am a father and a husband, and from this all proceeds.
I'm not a hockey player at the moment - I don't have a contract and I don't play games.
So I'm going to play the role of dad and husband, and I'm really looking forward to it.
On Sunday, Vasík has two hockey matches, this is a holiday for me and my whole family, when we can go to support our children in what they want to do.
Are you thinking that you could do this in full-time quotation marks?
Sure, you can think of a lot of things.
This can happen too.
I tried it three years ago, when I missed 50 games for knee surgery.
And I liked it so much.
One day it will get to such a stage that all the goals, wins and passes will not replace what you have at home.
Because family and children, that's the meaning of life.
You get the job you want.
I had a job that was the most beautiful thing that could happen to me besides my family.
You’ve had a lot of offers from Europe: do you have it that you want to play the NHL just because it’s the NHL, or is it because of the family that you want to be in America?
Since I am a hockey player, the first place - besides the family - is also sports success.
The NHL is the best competition in the world.
This also leads to family life.
My kids, I'm sorry, our kids -- my wife and I -- grew up in the United States, they started going to school there, and so on.
And we would be very happy if they continued in this trend.
Because what we're going to talk about is that there are possibilities somewhere else in America.
That's the chance we should give them.
Do you plan to stay in America permanently?
We will practice it as before.
This means that in the summer we will be in Bohemia on Hluboká and in the vicinity of <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice.
And in the winter again in Tampa or where our steps lead us.
It’s ideal to be warm all the time.
I've been very lucky in my life.
It can be said that I went in front of him, it cost a lot of strength and resignation, and it took me a lot of things that I missed.
But hockey offered me a lot of options in return, and this is one of them.
That my wife and I could choose where to live.
There are a lot of people in the world who crave this so they can choose what to do and how to live.
How long will you have the will to dig, train hard and wait for an offer at your age?
Yeah, so that's a question I can't answer.
I still have it in me today, the juice, the craving, the enthusiasm, the passion for the sport, the desire and motivation to prove to people that you still have me at the NHL, that I'm still better than anyone else.
But I can't tell you how long it'll stay there.
That can't be planned.
So it can be said that this season you will wait for it to come out and then you will decide what to do next?
I am in a phase where I go day by day.
Recently, the CEO of <0xC4><0x8C>EZ announced that the decision on the construction of the 3rd and 4th blocks of the Temelín power plant is postponed until the end of 2014 or 2015.
He justified this by waiting for the new State energy concept and by agreeing to Contracts of difference by the government.
For these reasons, the current leadership of <0xC4><0x8C>EZ is trying to transfer its responsibility to the government - that is, the majority shareholder.
However, a qualified manager should give a recommendation to the shareholder, not hide behind it.
Grandma: I'm only with Sobotka.
Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1> is beginning to reconcile that his ANO movement will not have time to learn the political craft in the opposition and that he will have to go directly to the government to create one at all.
The President of YES admitted this in the interview for the Law, which will be released tomorrow.

Police evacuated part of Los Angeles airport after shooting
Shootings were carried out at Los Angeles International Airport in the morning.
Police evacuated part of the airport, which was reportedly terminal three.
Reuters, citing California media, claims that law enforcement officers shot a gunman with a gun.
The Los Angeles Times, citing police, said there was a shooting in which two to three members of the Transportation Safety Administration were injured.
How many people were injured and whether there were any casualties is still unclear.
Firefighters are talking about an event with more people injured.
CNN: Israel bombed a military base in Syria.
The target was Russian missiles for Hezbollah.
Israeli military planes allegedly bombed a military base near the Syrian port of Latakia on Thursday.
With reference to the unnamed U.S. government official, it was announced by CNN.
The Israeli press reported the explosion in the alleged rocket depot, but the Israeli government did not confirm the attack.
A spokeswoman for the Israeli army told CNN that she refused to comment on the raid.
"We do not comment on foreign media reports," she said.
The target of the Israeli strike was, according to a US government source, missiles and related equipment that, in the opinion of the Israelis, could be transported to the militant Lebanese Hezbollah movement.
The AP, referring to another U.S. security official, reported that the target of the Israeli strike on Syrian territory was Russian SA-125 missiles.
The second Israeli TV channel reported that the target of the attack was allegedly a highly modern Syrian air defense system.
According to the DPA, satellite images of the attack area showed a battery of Russian S-125 Neva missiles.
In addition, they were said to have seen batteries of SA-3 missiles, including a command center with radar for tracking missiles and their targets.
According to Israeli television, the missiles are 35 kilometers long and could carry 70 kilograms of warheads.
Israel has reportedly bombed missile supplies inside Syria at least twice this year, CNN and AP said.
The Israeli military has never responded to such reports, but has repeatedly stated that it will strike any supply of weapons intended for Hezbollah or other groups designated as terrorists.
Is the internet the end of travel agencies?
The Flight Centre seems to be successfully resisting this trend.
The company has updated its annual earnings estimate and expects record earnings from vacationers in Australia and the UK.
The travel agency now expects its annual base profit before tax to range between $325 million and $340 million compared to $305 million and $315 million from the previous forecast.
If current developments are maintained, this will represent a 12 to 17 percent increase from the record profit of $290.4 million from 2011/12.
CEO Graham Turner said Flight Centre made an eight percent profit in the first half and began the second half with sharp growth mainly in Australian and British off-business travel.
“To date, our 10 countries are profitable and several are heading for record annual profit before interest and taxation,” he said.
This includes Australia and the UK, which have traditionally been our biggest profit makers.
Businesses with recreational activities rose in Australia during the second half of the year, compensating for a slightly weaker domestic business travel market.
Similarly, in the UK, Flight Centre did well in the recreational area, while business clients spent less.
The U.S. trade has recovered after a loss during the seasonally weaker half-year and is expected to bring in year-round profits for the third time in a row.
Flight Centre’s shares were 3 cents higher at USD 38.20 yesterday.
Greenpeace activists detained in Russia transported to St. Petersburg
Environmental activists detained since September in Russia for protesting the planned oil extraction in the Arctic have been transported from Murmansk to St. Petersburg.
This was reported today by AFP, referring to the international environmental organization Greenpeace.
At the same time, it claims that the original allegations of piracy by its activists have not yet been withdrawn.
“Greenpeace International learned from diplomatic sources that thirty men and women detained in Russia after a non-violent action against an oil platform in the Arctic were transported from a correctional facility in Murmansk to a prison in St. Petersburg,” the organization said in a statement.
The reasons for the relocation of detained activists are unclear; according to the DPA, it was a planned relocation.
Ecological authorities first charged them with piracy, which threatened them with up to 15 years in prison in the event of conviction.
But they announced last week that they would replace the allegations with a milder riot, threatening a lower sentence with a maximum of seven years in prison.
In a statement, Greenpeace said the piracy allegations had not been lifted as promised.
This means that the detainees are now charged with two criminal offences.
The Mighty Committee of Inquiry last week announced that it would replace piracy charges with riot charges.
But when 30 inmates stood before the committee this week, the piracy charges were not lifted.
Instead, new accusations have been made against everyone," Greenpeace said in a statement.
The Russians detained three dozen members of the Greenpeace movement from 18 countries at Gazprom’s oil platform in mid-September.
Ecologists were on the Arctic Sunrise, which sailed under the Dutch flag.
Since then, they have all been held in detention, which they have appealed against, but the court has rejected them all.
Environmentalists are complaining about the prison conditions.
Greenpeace chief executive Kumi Naidoo said the move to St. Petersburg would facilitate meetings with families and consular workers.
But there is no guarantee that conditions in the new prison will be better than in Murmansk.
"In fact, they could be worse," he warned.
One of the detained activists, Faiza Oulahsen, asked Dutch King Willem-Alexander for help.
In a handwritten letter published today by Algemeen Dagblad, she urged the monarch to speak about their situation during a planned meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
He claims that Maliki has a large share in the resumption of sectarian violence in Iraq, which is said to be part of the fighting in neighboring Syria.
Schools should focus more on mathematics, spelling and grammar
At least one Shakespeare play, a novel from the 19th century, romantic poetry, and contemporary British literature will have to be studied in English literature from 1914 onwards.
The test will also include ‘hidden text’ to motivate deeper reading;
Combined English literature and language courses will be cancelled.
Starting in 2015, students will be required to take a language proficiency exam, and they will be encouraged to choose English literature as an optional subject.
The Ministry of Education is expected to issue new curriculums for English and mathematics tomorrow – the first subjects to undergo radical change.
For other key subjects, changes are expected next year.
In a separate step, the Office of Ofqual, which oversees the graduation exams, will reveal changes in the structure of the graduation exams, together with a new graduation system and a smaller volume of projects for students.
In a speech last summer, Education Minister Michael Gove said there was “a broad consensus as to whether we need to reform our testing system in order to regain the trust of society” and that it was necessary to insist that the graduation test be “more demanding, more ambitious and more rigorous”.
The study shows that English schools devote less time to mathematics – 116 hours a year or three hours a week – than most other countries.
For comparison, schools in Australia spend an average of 143 hours a year on mathematics, and in Singapore about 138.
Although there will be no official requirement to devote more time to mathematics, coalition sources have said that a comprehensive graduation exam in mathematics—along with more emphasis on this subject in the scoreboards—will likely encourage schools to provide extra teaching.
The curriculum will focus more on "real-world problems", including financial mathematics.
Mayor of Ostrava Kajnar: Cancer in <0xC4><0x8C>SSD is not me
Before the elections, a long-running dispute between two wings fighting for influence within the Ostrava <0xC4><0x8C>SSD burned out.
It all culminated when the mayor of Ostrava, Petr Kajnar, went to court for undemocratic nominations.
However, the actors of the cause did not want to express themselves too much in order not to harm the party even more before the elections.
Voters’ votes are now counted.
The leadership of the Ostrava <0xC4><0x8C>SSD urged the mayor of Ostrava to step down as soon as Monday evening, and will apparently press for him to lose his position.
Petr Kajnar wants to fight.
What the disputes are about and who is on whose side, he described in an exclusive interview for Diník.
How do you see the election result?
<0xC4><0x8C>SSD certainly expected a much better result.
Did it hurt her that there were disputes within the party before the elections in the media?
I can imagine that social democracy could have a better election result.
But on the other hand, it corresponds to the state in which the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD is now.
It is a party that has its internal problems, is internally ill and people feel that everything is not right in it.
They made it clear in the election.
What are the internal diseases of <0xC4><0x8C>SSD?
I think the ODS has been declining for some time, and unfortunately, things like this are now taking place in social democracy.
It is so that lobbyists, influential people who previously expected to find their way to the ODS, have moved to the people in the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD and have influence on them.
This is due to the fact that the police go to the offices of the Magistrate of Ostrava and collect computers.
This shows that the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD is not only made up of people who would like the good of everyone else, but many of them are primarily thinking for their own good.
The <0xC4><0x8C>SSD is divided into two irreconcilable camps in Prague, as can be seen in the current power struggle between Ha<0xC5><0xA1>kovci and Sobotkovci.
But this has been prepared for a long time.
What happened before the elections in Ostrava was only a foreshadowing of what is happening now in Prague.
The Hague wing gradually occupied positions, so that after the elections it could create a situation that would weaken Sobotkov’s wing.
In politics, people are in a situation where they sometimes have to compromise.
But everyone has an internal boundary where those compromises can no longer be made, and that is my case.
Initially, I did not want to run for the Chamber, but when I perceived the whole thing inside the party, I agreed with Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> Zaorálek that I would try to get to the regional candidate to strengthen Sobotkov’s wing as mayor of Ostrava.
But the wing of the hawk left a mark on it.
Why are you standing on the side of Bohuslav Sobotka and not Michal Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ka?
In my opinion, Slavek Sobotka is a person who always talks primarily about the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD program and, to a certain extent, also about visions for the party and for this country.
I have to admit, I haven't heard anything like that from the other side.
Michal Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek is only fighting for power.
I do not understand how the Presidency, which is a lower body than the Central Executive Committee, can begin to appeal to the President of the Party.
This is a struggle for power regardless of everything and against the party’s statutes.
In my opinion, with what Michal Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek has now shown in Prague, he has ended his political career.
How did you feel that the Ostrava leadership of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD did not approve you as a candidate?
The political parties are based on the competition, which of their members will be placed.
This competition should be largely based on programme visions and on the abilities of these people to fulfill those visions.
Of course, people who do not have a lot of abilities or vision are also eligible for this competition, but the political party is for them an elevator to money that they would not get elsewhere.
The problem is, when these people begin to come to the fore by being ruthlessly breaking the rules, breaking the party's statutes.
With their practices they make political parties of the mafia and in my opinion they also violate the laws of the Czech Republic.
To point out this problem is more important to me than to take into account whether any Kainar has a political future.
It is important that the parties begin to respect the statutes.
Therefore, before the elections, did you submit a motion for a preliminary measure against the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD candidate in the Moravian-Silesian region?
The current district executive committee of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD in Ostrava consolidates its power by being able to abolish organizations that do not suit it, purposefully establish new organizations, gradually dismissing uncomfortable members of the party.
An example is that they wanted to exclude Richard Bedna<0xC5><0x99>ík from the club of representatives, but he filed a lawsuit against it, and they then canceled the resolution on his exclusion.
This shows that demanding compliance with the party’s statutes through the courts is the last option, but when the other methods and control bodies within the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD have ceased to function, it is the only option.
The effort of the leadership of the Ostrava <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, headed by Member Adam Rykal, is to remove you from the position of Mayor.
It is a public secret that the mayor of Poruby, Lumír Palyza, is responsible for this post.
That's right, Adam Rykala and Lumír Palyza are trying to do everything they can to get me out.
They promise people positions, win votes, and for those votes then consolidate their power in the party.
When I go back to the past, everything that happened around the football club Baník Ostrava and the purchase of Bazala stadium was just an excuse for them to attack me.
It was artificially staged so that they could label me a person who gives money where it doesn’t belong.
At the same time, the city bought a property that is strategically of great value to it.
So how do you see it going with your tenure as mayor?
The District Committee has already called on me and other people on Monday to consider our stay in the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD.
But I think it's like when a thief shouts, "Capture a thief!"
When we look at the results of my work over the last eleven years, I see no one in Ostrava's social democracy who initiates and promotes, sometimes against members of the party, the emergence of so many developmental issues, such as industrial zones or the expansion of the science and technology park.
Still, everything is getting uncomfortable.
I don't read it any more than to prevent others from breaking into the places they want.
Will you continue to fight against these efforts?
Because if this republic is to function well, political parties must also function well.
I can hardly believe that any party will be able to effectively manage the state if it is not able to manage itself.
So I don’t think I’m leaving the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD right now, because I think it’s not me who is causing cancer on this side, but these people who are trying to make me angry.
Olomouc opens a public skating rink in the historic center
The organizer of Olomouc Christmas markets and winter skating Pavel Spálen<0xC3><0xBD> said that the preparatory work on the skating rink was started on October 26 and since Wednesday the ice production unit is in operation.
The ice sheet is already seven centimeters strong and by Friday morning the area will be ready for the first visitors.
The slide has an area of 375 square meters, the podium took 358 square meters.
Skaters and passers-by will also have two booths with punch.
"We have expanded the floor area, enlarged the space in front of the booths and almost the entire area of the podium is covered so that skaters can comfortably navigate," he said.
The streets of Olomouc are already reminiscent of the approaching Christmas.
Last year, the skating rink was installed directly in front of the main entrance of the town hall on the Upper Square due to the repair of the Lower Square.
The repair of Dolní nám<0xC4><0x9B>stí was completed at the end of the summer, so that the ice sheet could return to its original place.
For the first time, people were able to skate directly in front of the town hall in 2009, when the skating rink was in operation from January to March.
The ice sheet then became an integral part of the city’s Christmas markets.
The Christmas markets, which are part of a rich cultural program, will be opened at Horní nám<0xC4><0x9B>stí a month before Christmas Day.

The brutal murder of an elderly man in Zlín will be dealt with again by the district court
The district court acquitted a 25-year-old Slovak and a 22-year-old Czech for lack of evidence.
The men refused the blame.
They face 15 to 20 years in prison or even an exceptional sentence.
The spokesman, Petr Angyalossy, confirmed that the Supreme Court overturned the district’s decision and returned the case to the district for further consideration.
The judge refused to comment on the grounds that the decision had not yet been served on the parties.
According to the indictment, the young men assaulted a seventy-seven-year-old man in his house.
Senior died of a tragic death.
According to the prosecution, the men choked him, beat him and kicked him all over the body, and also planted about three dozen blows in his head with a metal object, apparently a gas gun.
The man suffered serious injuries, such as fractures of the skull bone, swelling of the brain or bleeding into the brain, which he suffered at the site.
The youths allegedly took away about 3,000 crowns and jewelry worth about 14,000 crowns from the house.
According to the district court, they were the only, moreover, indirect evidence against the accused odor marks, which the expert assessed as not fully ascertained within the meaning of the statutory instructions.
Smell traces from the crime scene and on other matters, although in more than a dozen cases, coincided with the defendants, however, the police initially treated them as factual and not olfactory traces.
In addition, there have been some errors in handling them.
According to the Senate, the guilt of the defendants was not proven without doubt.
However, the court acknowledged that the police had very difficult conditions.
A dead senior with a broken head was found by relatives who thought he had apparently fallen and injured himself.
The doctor who was called by the rescue service did not even notice the violent death.
Forensic investigators contacted doctors after a few days, who discovered signs of a violent death during the autopsy.
Police were no longer able to work with all traces of the crime scene that the relatives had cleared.
No DNA of the defendants was found at the scene.
The young Slovak lived in Hungary.
He is now serving an 8.5-year sentence, which was confirmed by the Olomouk Supreme Court last year.
According to him, the man was the head of an organized group of six young men who have been accused of robbery of gold mining.
The robberies occurred in October and November 2011, shortly after the murder of a senior in Slopné.
The youngest of the accused in the murder of an elderly man lives in the Hungarian town of Hradi<0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC4><0x9B>.
He was released from prison in August after 11 months.
Znojmo begins reconstruction of the stadium
In early November, the reconstruction of the football stadium will begin in Znojmo.
On Thursday, the stadium was taken over by the builders who will carry out the reconstruction of the lawn.
The reconstruction of the city stadium in Znojmo is divided into four stages in order to meet the standards for the first football league.
Living Legend Wayne Shorter Closes Dock of the Week Autumn Strings
Saxophone giant and legend of the jazz scene Wayne Shorter will make the point next Wednesday for the 18th edition of the Autumn Strings Festival.
Shorter will perform on November 6 in the Grand Hall of Lucerne together with his quartet of Danilo Perez, John Patitucci and Brian Blade.
In the second half of the evening Shorter will be joined by a spontaneous jazz improvisation PKF - Prague Philharmonia under the direction of Martin Kum<0xC5><0xBE>ák.
In Shorter's arrangements for the symphony orchestra, Pegasus will be heard from the novelty album Without A Net, as well as his earlier tracks Lotus and Prometheus Unbound.
Although he celebrated his 80th birthday in August this year, Shorter is still full of strength, which also proves that the Prague concert at Strun<0xC3><0xBD> in autumn will kick off his world tour.
Wayne Shorter entered the world of music more than sixty years ago.
The list of performers he worked with ranges from Miles Davis to Herbie Hancock, Joni Mitchell to Carlos Santana.
On his musical journey he also met the Czech musician Miroslav Vitou<0xC5><0xA1> and the Viennese native Joe Zawinul, with whom the legendary Weather Report for more than a decade indicated the direction of a new style of fusion.
For the past 13 years, he has performed with the Wayne Shorter Quartet.
The afterparty after the festival will be Spotlight Club Night, which will take place on November 9 at the Roxy/NoD Club.
Alongside the charismatic singer Andrey Triana, the Manchester trio Go Go Penguin, with its jazz-influenced electronics and young jazz talent Ian Mikyska, will introduce the electro-jazz formation Deep Bass inspired by dance styles.
UEFA has banned women from publishing penalties for referees.
Dagmar Damková, chair of the arbitration committee of the Football Association of the Czech Republic, has stopped publishing penalties for the judge.
This is forbidden by UEFA rules, she said in an interview with the newspaper Pravo.
Otherwise, there would be a threat of punishment.
Damková also refused to leave Pilsen’s footballers where they came from in her capacity.
These speculations are really nonsense.
It is true that I live in Pilsen, but the other members of the commission are from elsewhere, for example from Prague.
So in the case of the vote, I can lose 1:6," Damkova said in response to criticism, which was upset after Pilsen recently played twice as many penalties as other league teams.
Thus, although FA<0xC4><0x8C>R has stopped publishing penalties for arbitrators in recent months, Damkova assures that the judges are pying for their mistakes.
"Believe me, if the commission finds out that the referee made a mistake, it will restrict his delegation, no matter what the match," Damkova said.
The reason why the penalties are not published is according to the Women's ban from the European Football Union.
"UEFA prohibits the disclosure of such information and punishes the violation severely."
"We're very suspicious, and we're looking for something for every mistake."
“We published the restrictions, but I received two very strong warnings that if we don’t stop, there will be tough sanctions,” Damkova said.
Other countries respect the ban.
"We were really an exception," she added.
If the information continues to be disclosed, the commission could lose money from UEFA for the education and development of the referees.
"And these are very important to us."
"Without them, we would not be able to implement the arbitrator education program," Damkova added.
Bárta’s arrest is related to Janou<0xC5><0xA1>ka and Bém: Is it worth escaping the wiretaps?
The head of public affairs, Vít Bárta, was arrested by police on Thursday.
Together with him, Jan Petr<0xC5><0xBE>ílek, head of the department of analytics and computer science of the anti-corruption police, was arrested.
The detention relates to the interrogation of lobbyist Roman Janou<0xC5><0xA1>ek and former mayor Pavel Bém (ODS).
Information about the wiretapping, which came with the server Novinky.cz, confirmed a reliable source to the Czech Press Office.
Janou<0xC5><0xA1>ka and Béma's phone calls, published last March by Mladá Fronta Dnes and in which the two men call each other "Mazánka" and "Kolib<0xC5><0x99>ík", show Janou<0xC5><0xA1>k's influence on the actions of the city under Béma's leadership.
The newspaper said they were acquired in 2007 by the Security Information Service (BIS), from which two years later they escaped to the ABL security agency.
It was Bart's place at the time.
Server Novinky.cz warned that the detained criminalist Petr<0xC5><0xBE>ílek worked for the BIS before he joined the anti-corruption police.
Petr<0xC5><0xBE>ílek switched to the anti-corruption unit, which was subsequently intercepted, at the same time they were published.
"With regard to the law on the protection of classified information, I cannot confirm anything at all or say anything at all," said prosecutor Michal Muravsk<0xC3><0xBD> from the Prague City Prosecutor's Office.
He also refused to confirm that he was overseeing the case.
The case does not want to comment on the inspection for the same reason.
Six out of ten companies are preparing for the new Civil Code.
Six out of ten companies are preparing intensively for the forthcoming entry into force of the new Civil Code and the Business Corporations Act as of 1 January 2014.
Only eight percent of respondents said they had not addressed the issues related to the two key codes in their company at all.
This is according to a survey by Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal, which surveyed the opinions of 108 Czech firms.
With both key codes coming into effect, it is only now at the last minute that a number of managers are beginning to realize what a significant impact they can have on the business of their companies.
The biggest changes in private law in the last 50 years will, in our opinion, affect all citizens and companies in the Czech Republic.
Due to the lava flow of politicians, the business sector has long been uncertain as to whether or not revolutionary changes will eventually take place.
"But now they only have a few weeks to make the transition to the new law for their companies without complications," said Jan Spá<0xC4><0x8D>il, Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal partner.
Of the 61 percent of companies that are intensively engaged in new codes, 26 percent said their companies have already taken all the necessary steps to get them ready in time.
A further 35 percent of these companies are set to take the necessary measures in the near future.
On the other hand, one in five companies has not yet dealt with recodings, yet they have a concrete idea of how to prepare for them.
A total of 11% have no opinion and cannot judge the issue.
Only 8 percent of companies admit that they have not yet resolved issues related to recoding.
The most important legal issue related to the new civil code is for the largest number of companies surveyed the conclusion of new contracts (21 percent), followed by the resolution of business conditions (16 percent) and further changes in the property register and liability for damages (after ten percent).
In the case of contracts, one of the most important innovations of the whole recodification will take place, namely the unification of the regulation of contracts only within the framework of the new Civil Code.
The current parallel regulation in the Civil and Commercial Codes will be abolished, as a result of which contract law should become more transparent for citizens and entrepreneurs.
"In the case of entrepreneurs, the new arrangement will offer many novelties with an emphasis on greater freedom of arranging relationships," said Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Poddan<0xC3><0xBD>, lawyer at Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal.
In the context of the Law on Business Corporations, almost a quarter of companies consider the issue of increasing the responsibility of statutory bodies as the most important topic.
Next are topics related to changes in the convening and running of the general meeting (15 percent) and representation of the company (14 percent).
The new legislation means tightening the obligations and possible impacts for statutory bodies, especially in a situation where a company is at risk of bankruptcy or enters it.
"In practice, this means that if board members and company executives do not act with the care of a sound economy and do not reverse the impending decline of the company, they can lose the benefit gained from the performance of the function in the last two years," he added.
Pierre Rainero: I’m trying to develop Cartier’s style as a living language
My task is to preserve tradition while leading our brand to modern things so that it does not remain dusty relics, explains Pierre Rainero, Director of Style at Cartier, in an interview with HN.
This French luxury house was founded in 1847.
Travels through mud, river and jungle and provides free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free medical care in villages in Cameroon.
Bwelle and his team treat hundreds of patients almost every weekend
There are not too many doctors in West Africa; only one in 5,000 people.
Vote here or via your mobile phone.
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the top 10 nominees for the 2013 CNN Hero of the Year award.
In the CNN Hero of the Year 2013 competition, you can vote for him or any of the top ten candidates.
The winner will receive $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle has been watching his father fall unconscious again and again and driven to hospitals that were not equipped to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident in 1981 near the capital of Cameroon, Yaoundé.
At first, he was treated only with a broken arm, but then he developed an infection that spread to the brain, and there he developed a hematoma that caused him problems all his life.
“There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon,” says Georges Bwelle.
We'd have to take him out of Cameroon if we had the money.
Instead, Bwelle spent years transporting his father to crowded clinics and hospitals, where he received treatment that was simply available.
"It's not easy," says Bwelle.
You can leave the house at five in the morning, rush to the hospital to be there first, but you're not the first.
There are a lot of patients.
Some people die just because they have to wait.
Since Bwelle's father died in 2002, the situation hasn't changed much.
According to the World Health Organization, there is only one doctor per 5,000 people in Cameroon.
Just for comparison, the ratio in the United States is one doctor per 413 population.
And even if the Cameroonian doctors could visit, many would not be able to afford it.
Two out of five people in this country live below the poverty line, and nearly three-quarters of healthcare spending in this country is private.
“The only problem they have is poverty,” says Bwelle.
Because of poverty, they cannot enjoy life.
When Bwelle saw his father and many of his compatriots suffering, he decided to do something about it.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers performed 700 surgeries for free last year.
He himself became a vascular surgeon at the central hospital in Yaoundé.
And he founded the non-profit organization ASCOVIME, whose members visit rural areas on weekends where they provide free medical care.
Since 2008, he has helped nearly 32,000 people with his group of volunteers.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 people rush to deliveries, attach medical supplies to the rooftops, and travel through rough terrain to villages in need of help.
They are not always accompanied by happiness.
Many times, vehicles have to push through the river and mud.
But when they arrive, they get a welcome like real heroes: a banquet, singing and dancing and the best accommodation the community has to offer.
In these villages, free medical care is really a reason to celebrate and Bwelle – with his wide smile and unbounded energy – is very willing to engage in local joy.
The next day, the team begins to treat hundreds of patients.
“We have 500 patients on each mission,” says Bwelle.
They come to the village from a 60-kilometre radius, on foot.
During each of these weekends, doctors provide different medical care.
Many are treated with malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasitic diseases and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others can get beads or gifted glasses or a free birth certificate – a document that the school requires, but that many impoverished families simply cannot afford.
In the evening, the team performs simple operations under local anesthesia.
Surgery is usually done in the school building, in the town hall or at home; after the operation, the patient gets up and goes to the recovery site to free up space for the next patient.
Using the light from the generator, the operating room and the sanitary equipment, Bwelle and his volunteers work until early morning.
It’s exhausting, but the village musicians usually help the team not to lose motivation.
“To stay awake and continue to work, they play drums all night long,” says Bwelle.
On Sunday, the team heads back to the city, tired but proud of their work.
This group – made up of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students – performed 700 surgeries for free last year and realizes that their help can mean a lot to the locals.
One man said he'd be able to work again after the hernia surgery.
"This will change the future of our family," the man said.
In addition to organizing these weekend clinics and working as a surgeon at Bwelle Hospital, he also works at night for private health clinics around the city of Yaoundé.
He says that it is this second thesis that finances about 60% of his non-profit activities; the rest is covered by private contributions.
“I’m not sure when she’s actually sleeping,” says Katie O’Malley, a second-year medical student at Drexel University in Philadelphia who works as a volunteer for the Bwelle group.
He’s always in the hospital or trying to raise money for the organization to do these campaigns.
For medical and nursing students like O’Malley who have come from the United States or Europe to join Bwelle on his mission, it’s a great practice they wouldn’t get at home.
“We thoroughly washed Dr. Bwell’s hands and removed blood stains or held his tools,” O’Malley says.
You will never experience that as a medical student in your second year in America.
Volunteer students usually pay for their trip to Cameroon themselves and often arrive with donated medical supplies.
But as soon as they arrive in Yaoundé, Bwelle provides them with food, transportation and study.
“He’s a hero,” O’Malley said.
This organization gives its life and its desire to help the people of Cameroon is endless.
For Bwelle, a constant clamping is not a burden.
Helping others live happier lives, fulfilling the promise he made to his father, is something that brings him great joy.
"I'm so happy to do this job," Bwelle says.
And I think of my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
To make people laugh, to alleviate their pain – that’s why I do it.

Minister Holcát renews the position of Head Sister for the Czech Republic
The main nurse for the Czech Republic should represent the interests of nurses, whose number in the Czech Republic exceeds 100,000.
"I think it is essential that this function is clearly defined and formalized, so that nurses have their representative within the structure of the office - a representative to whom they can always turn if necessary," explained Martin Holcát, Minister of Health.
I appreciate the work of the nurses and I think that the nursing field deserves proper attention from the Ministry.
Exercising this profession requires not only high professional professionalism, but also a human approach and personal conviction.
“I will gladly and responsibly endeavor to enforce those steps that can improve the position of nurses.”
"We have excellent and skilled nurses in our healthcare, but I would also like to appeal to those colleagues who, with their approach to patients, do not help us much to carry out their vocations with all empathy and help us in the eyes of the public to improve the image of nurses," says Alena <0xC5><0xA0>midová.
The newly appointed Principal Nurse for the Czech Republic, Alena <0xC5><0xA0>midová, on the occasion of her inauguration, also stated that she wants to deal with the various aspects of the position of nurse and intends to cooperate with professional associations, professional companies, educators, other non-medical doctors and others.
“I don’t really want to separate the professions of doctors and nurses, but on the contrary, I see them standing next to each other, each with their own competencies and together with other health professionals forming a playful work team that provides health services for the benefit of the patient.”
"I myself face a number of problems that occur in the practice of the profession of nurses, I perceive these difficulties and I intend to participate in their solution."
These include, for example, the simplification of nursing and health documentation.
“From my own experience, I know that some of the administrative tasks of the nurses are unnecessarily burdensome and take time away from them, which they could and should rather devote to patients,” says Alena <0xC5><0xA0>midová.
Other areas that it intends to focus on include improving working conditions, finding ways to improve mutual cooperation within the team and with managements of health service providers, adjusting competences and also labour law issues, such as compliance with the labour code or not burdening nurses with their insufficient number of places in a given time and time.
Often we hear anonymous snippets, but for fear of possible punishment, they are not documented in a specific case where there may be a violation of the rules.
"Where there is no prosecutor, there is no judge, and so the function of the Principal Sisters of the Czech Republic could in this case serve as a guarantee of anonymity of such a complaint and have the relevant authorities examine a particular case," concludes Alena <0xC5><0xA0>midová.
Mgr. Alena <0xC5><0xA0>midová graduated from the Secondary Medical School in the field of Nursing (graduated in 1978) and the Faculty of Philosophy of Charles University in Prague in the Nursing - Pedagogy study program (graduated in 1992).
Since 2010 he has been acting as head of the department of nursing and other non-medical fields and the recognition of qualifications in the Department of Education and Science of the Ministry of Education and Science of the Czech Republic.
During her professional career she worked as a nurse at bedside in the internal department, she also worked as a teacher at the High School of Medicine, where she was also the statutory deputy director for 8 years.
From 2004 to 2009 she served as the Principal Sister of the Prison Service of the Czech Republic.
She has published several professional nursing textbooks and articles in professional journals, she has devoted herself to lecture activities in the field of nursing.
He is not a member of any political party.
So that I don't fall into hatred
The writer Václav Kahuda returned to writing after twelve years.
After many years of reading, living, but not writing, V<0xC3><0x81>CLAV KAHUDA (1965) publishes a new novel Wind, Darkness, Presence.
That this is not a thin volume, suggests the number of pages comparable to his most famous work Hou<0xC5><0xA1>tina (Petrov, 2001).
Another prominent Czech writer of the time, Emil Hakl, spoke for Salon Kahudu.
What moved you to write a novel after twelve years of silence?
I did it so that I wouldn't fall into hatred.
To see around us constantly new and new clones of human foolishness, young organisms affected by blind selfish endeavor.
I don't even talk about us older people, faces ruined by helpless lust, grumpy souls and vice versa polarized ideologues trying to sell their "product" with the expression of a little sales whore.
At the beginning of the millennium, I bought a small digital camera and filmed my thrilling friends, strangers and hidden bands.
I've already got it.
Sometimes I feel my brain burning from life on this planet.
I like to go for walks and read books at the lights in the evening.
You're talking about a sense of waste, hate.
Has there been any evil in the past that has affected you, or are you just getting old, like all of us?
The breakup happened a long time ago, about ten years ago.
It didn't have a name at the time.
Well, I lived after that.
But there's still a surprised, quiet boy in there.
I see other lonely exercises, each in their anxiety tornado.
I was saved by writing books.
I'm going to take part in this inverted, thousands of years-long movement of the system of life on this planet -- the birth of an unfathomable future.
That immense, breathtaking complexity of life, where every stone is a direct heir to our presence.
We are the players of a sad and beautiful game, where through trial and error, another and more generation of beings is created, which in trillions of interactions per second creates some superhuman, artificial intelligence.
Twelve years is a relatively long time.
Do you see your writing as an ongoing process, or did you start from scratch?
Self-talk, or rather dialogue, conducted by the right and left half of the brain, sometimes floats to the surface and forms in the book.
Just as the periods of peace are interspersed with the silent metastases of wars that may one day awaken, so the book is twelve years of silence clothed in words.
I could feel the silent avalanche of life growing in my brain, and if I don't do anything, one day it will quietly wrap me around.
It is a set of questions formulated by the brain and posed to layers that are stored in the darkness "below the level of consciousness".
The neocortex, the gray cerebral cortex, asks older evolutionary formations, goes to the ancient years of the brain tree.
He speaks to furry beasts, asks serpents, seeks answers in the flight of birds, raises his eyes to the clouds in the sky.
Yes, the moral law in me and the starry sky above me.
In the end, the brain asks the world.
Relatively often you express yourself to the ego metaphorically - could you define it biologically?
The brain stores in its billions of connections and electrochemical bonds all the memories, experiences and experiences that a person has experienced.
This forest of logically and emotionally exposed and branching information trees, memory registers, uses the brain in its recognition, cognitive, process, is exposed to ever-changing presence, in an unwavering effort to name and understand its surroundings and decode important.
Sometimes there are overload disturbances.
Analogously - as if you had "falled" on a PC, from a speech emulator and a foreign language translator program, you would get confused first in an operating environment, such as Windows, and after a few unsuccessful restarts ended up at the dark green blinking screens of Bios, in the core system between the motherboard and the operating system that controls the function.
For those who have not yet understood what we are talking about, I am talking about a psycho-spiritual crisis.
You mention her often - why do you regularly care about this type of regression?
Because it's a pit.
In the current functional mechanisms of our thinking, feeling and behavior - a gap will appear.
It is good to quote Nietzsche: "He looked into the abyss until the abyss looked into it."
Pure feeling - that a person is lost, if all hope disappears, mentally "die" and a new quality arises.
And why do I care about it personally?
I'll answer with a parable.
Once one fell into the water and drowned, days and months and years went by, and he was still drowning while reading, and those books taught him to swim, that is, to live.
He became a "diver".
I hope some of the sentences I wrote will help someone, as Hrabalo's texts once helped me.
To what extent do you think of the reader, the specific person who will read your text?
The one about which nothing meaningful can be said, some call it consciousness, another super ego, but in my opinion it is best characterized by Arthur Rimbaud in a letter to a friend:
"I am someone else - this reader is directly involved in the process of word formulation and sentences."
From an early age he read books of old Czech fairy tales, sailed in Captain Nema’s submarine, ran through Stinadle in dark alleys.
At the same time, behind all the branching of the authors and their messages, it reads: "The sun shines brightly on the worlds of other Karl Hynk Macha".
What if the book is out?
Do you care about the reader’s opinion?
On the retrospective that comes to you through the people who read the book?
Of course, I care about the opinion of people who take three hundred crowns and are willing to read five hundred pages of the text.
And then, perhaps after years, they accidentally contact me on the street and thank me for helping them with my book in some of their difficult life decisions.
Books are in fact "life" or rather "worlds".
They are encoded in the characters of the letters, carry experience, the history of the regions of which language.
At any time, we can bring them to life by letting their sentences flow into the brain.
It is actually, in a way, something forbidden by the divine - to awaken more and more life stories, small universes and temporary planets.
It is a fact whose DNA is stored in the lines - according to the old demonological books we commit witchcraft.
After the publication of the book, a chain of author readings awaits you.
I remember you once enjoyed reading.
Will you be happy to do it again, or will you feel it differently after years?
I'd rather just say it today.
And what did I find out?
There are good intelligent people everywhere.
Their basic feature - they are unobtrusive, they do not notice themselves too much, they have a friendly radiance, you do not feel lonely with them.
Let me give an example - in the town of <0xC4><0x8C>erven<0xC3><0xBD> Kostelec there was (and I hope he is still alive) one curly bookshop (named <0xC4><0x8C>ervenka), a cheerful companion and a good girl's bull.
At one point, he introduced me to the individual articles of the chain of readers of my book Houstina.
I looked into their eyes, and then I was shown a crushed, uncovered copy of my book.
In embarrassment, I put off the just read-out diarrhea and briefly wept masculinely.
Silently we all stood there, hovering and drunkenly weeping with a touch.
Then the young blonde mixer couldn't stand it and jumped his head out of the window into the snowstorm with a roar.
It was on the ground floor.
We ran out into the night landscape and hung up with the happy rage of the sensitives, the painful souls of the compatriots, and the strangulation of the fallen patriots – we went out and hovered like werewolves until the morning.
Each of your books is formally and substantively different from the previous ones.
Does this also apply to the text Wind, Darkness, Presence?
It's a story.
It is the story of one country behind nineteen rivers and nineteen mountains.
Ivan Bunin in his novel Suchodol puts in the mouth of the folk healer the words of an old Russian fairy tale: On the sea, on the ocean, on the island of Bujana.
There's a dog, a grey coffin on it.
Horror, horror, secret.
It never happened, but we all know it from somewhere.
Maybe we used to be devils in hell long ago, and we drew - what role in this land we're going to play.
Are you going to keep writing, or are you going to let it flow again?
The answers are eternal - Otokar B<0xC5><0x99>ezina.
Writing is a wonderful way of dialogue.
Something huge and unnamed, similar to the movement of continents on the planet, influences our desires from such depth and such breadth that it completely transcends our horizons – and so, of course, we act precisely in the intentions of our programmed task.
We are rewarded by the influx of dopamine, a mixture of endorphins and other substances.
We are biological machines.
We want to mate, we die while defending and acquiring new personal territories.
Sometimes a disorder happens and we emit compassion.
Only then do we have the right to call ourselves human.
That's the answer to your question - the biological robot is already full of various disorders, standing on the shore of the ocean of unconsciousness and catching tides of wet wind in a punctured canvas made of dirty tissue.
I have to write in order to be human.
Obama withdraws from health care
After a wave of criticism yesterday, President Obama withdrew from his often repeated and ambitious promise that “if you like your health program, you can keep it.”
With reference to hundreds of thousands of announcements of statements from providers, Republicans in recent days have accused the president of deceiving the American public.
Yesterday, Obama gave up his original promise.
“The vast majority of people who have working health insurance can keep them,” he said in a speech in Boston.
Given what he called a “media upheaval” over the statements, Obama urged Americans who received those announcements to look for new insurance in the market.
Most people will be able to have a better, more comprehensive health care program for the same price or even cheaper than expected.
"You'll get a better offer," he said.
His administration argues that it should not be a surprise that 5 percent of the population who have purchased insurance on their own may be forced to change the program because their insurance does not meet the new requirements of the Affordable Care Act.
"I say this to these Americans on the level: you deserve something better," Sebelius said in her statement to the Energy and Trade Committee in Washington.
Sebelius, who oversees the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said the launch of the Internet market has been “miserable” since October.
"I'm disappointed and angry like everyone else," she said.
I will try to regain your trust.
Annoyed, Sebelius said the phrase, which was captured by the on-mic, yesterday to an advisor sitting behind her at yesterday's committee meeting, which was held after a tumultuous exchange of views with Republican Billy Long, a representative from Missouri, who was also involved in the program.
More than three hours during the hearing, Sebelius repeatedly questioned why the “architect” of the Affordable Care Act had not voluntarily given up on government-sponsored insurance, and had not purchased a program through HealthCare.gov, which is now imposing on millions of Americans.
Which billionaire will you be talking to next year?
Kellner, the owner of the PPF group, wants to buy the O2 operator.
Both companies confirmed the talks and according to various sources from agencies and behind the scenes, there is already a hand in the sleeve.
The transaction announcement is expected to arrive in November, probably before the start of the LTE frequency auction, i.e. before November 11.
Kellner’s competitor Karel Komárek owns the KKCG Group.
Under the Sazka Telecommunications brand, it was auctioned for frequencies for LTE networks.
And to the general surprise, until then, there was no talk of the company’s desire to penetrate telecommunications.
But Sazku is now led by highly experienced telecommunications lubricant Robert Chvátal.
He started as the marketing manager of Radiomobil (today T-Mobile), later became the director of the Slovak T-Mobile and last headed the Austrian branch of the same operator.
Sazka plays several cards at once.
She signed up for the auction and now she admits that she wants to run a virtual at Vodafone.
And it makes sense.
If it succeeds in the auction, it will be able to move existing customers from its own virtual operator to its network.
This would probably not be liked under normal circumstances by Vodafone, but according to the Economic Newspaper, it could be part of a much closer cooperation between the two companies.
Vodafone is currently suffering from the agreement of competing operators O2 and T-Mobile, which will completely share their networks.
Vodafone needs a partner.
And that could be Sazka.
If it succeeds in the tender on the LTE network (as a novice can auction a specially designated spectrum), then Vodafone does not have to go to the auction at all, or it will not bother to auction only a limited spectrum (not enough frequencies for everyone).
Vodafone can share the network with Sazka.
Vodafone will launch Sazka in its 2G/3G network (respectively the newly built LTE network at 900 MHz frequency), allowing the company to quickly start the network.
In the meantime, Sazka will start building an expensive LTE network, which Vodafone will also be able to use.
Both companies can be satisfied.
The savings could then be spent by Vodafone for some provider of fixed Internet or cable TV.
And Kellner?
He would buy Czech and Slovak O2 (the Slovak branch is the daughter of Czech) immediately acquire a full-fledged operator with still decent profits and a wide range of services.
But on the other hand, it is a large mollusk that will be waiting for restructuring.
In the auction, Kellner would have won the LTE network already for the O2 and most likely in sync with T-Mobile.
The two companies have already announced that they will be sharing networks.
The auction could thus finally be successful, but probably not with the high amounts that the state budget is looking forward to.
And from next year, customers in the Czech Republic could choose between calling with Vodafone, T-Mobile, Kellner or Mozart.
Or two titans of Czech business against global giants.
Will Czech Television ever be able to do without signing events?
She entered President Zeman’s era with a legendary scene with an ashtray, so it’s not hard to listen to the complaints that collect evidence of the castle’s prosecution.
In the past, the traditional influence of such Ivan Langer or Jaroslav Tvrdík has not been documented in this way, let alone signed.
It is true that the editors are in charge.
The cases described, however, do not answer the question of where such a tendency of some journalists to the Zemans comes from - whether it is a reaction to a direct order, or, not to use vulgarism, a typical manifestation of inappropriate empathic courtesy.
And assuming a general perversion, the question cannot be forgiven whether other, no less unscrupulous, power interests, which have not yet had an opportunity, seek to change the conditions in television.
They are right to say that in developed countries, there are no slow attempts by politicians to intervene in broadcasting.
The truth is, however, that this does not mean that there are no complaints about public media.
The complainants do not question their independence.
Instead, they criticize what they consider to be their own tendency, the fruit of their subculture.
Perhaps we have not yet reached this stage of civilization and this situation is not with us.
But perhaps even in a country that thinks itself to be the most corrupt in the world, black and white stories about bad politicians and good journalists are more comfortable than the more complicated descriptions of an opaque situation in which the behavior of many imperfect human beings strikes each other.
JAN JANDOUREK: Curse of this country: Presidents on the verge of power
It is almost a rule that in the key moments of the country, the head of state was not in such a form as to be able to fulfill his state duties.
If Masaryk had been five years younger physically and mentally, he would have experienced the end of his presidency and the events around Munich would have taken place a little differently.
We probably would not have won the war, but after symbolic resistance, the air force could fly over the border, heavy weapons could be destroyed, and the government could flee to London immediately and not fight hard for its legitimacy there.
Above all, this capitulation should not have left the nation a snare to this day.
Bene<0xC5><0xA1> was not a statesman and was still in good shape for Munich, but during the war it started to go down the hill and in February 48 he was accordingly.
He could have gone into exile for the third time, undermining the legitimacy of the Communists and their coup.
It's a shame to talk about Hach.
They elected him saying that “Mr. President will not get into a situation where he would make a decision.”
But he had to, even though it was not a big decision with a knife to Hitler's neck in the chancellery.
Until the last days of March 1939, the head of intelligence, Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek Moravec, said that everything should be done to ensure that the occupation, which he knew exactly for the day, did not go on for the Germans so smoothly and with such profit.
The senile president and the cowardly government did nothing, on the one hand they did not believe him, on the other they were afraid.
Godwald had his fellow-comrades executed by human sacrifice, as Moscow had ordered him.
Ludvík Svoboda was definitively disabled by his participation in normalization and had to be deposed, already completely senile.
That Husák was a helpless and sick depressed old man in November 89 made it easier, but that’s the only treasure.
Havel was lucky not to have been seen in office for the last few years, and he was spared the worst.
While Klaus is still a fresh retired tennis player, many of his actions suggest that thought processes are no longer what they used to be.
Well, here's this.
The head of state and the commander-in-chief of the armed forces looks what they look like, and we don't know everything yet.
Fortunately, there is no external threat to the republic.
Or it may be threatening, just not so visible.
Then the question is whether it is exceptionally (historically) good that the president is not fully in power.
But it is not normal.
Couldn't we elect a president in this country once again, someone who is acceptable-minded and acceptable-healthy?
Remote planets, black-and-white movies or a little fantasy about alien life on Earth are not topics that American jazz saxophonist Wayne Shorter would throw away.
In the concept of his quartet, which will conclude this year’s Strings Autumn Festival on November 6 in the large hall of Lucerne in Prague, everything is related to everything.
The score of the quartet of jazz saxophonist Wayne Shorter is the momentary feelings of the musicians.
According to his assignment, two generations of younger colleagues have to play what they are currently experiencing.
They approach music as completely improvised chamber affairs and have to think not about harmony or rhythm, but in film pictures.
Shorter, a fresh 80-year-old composer, nine Grammy winner, former co-star Miles Davis and perhaps the greatest living jazz saxophonist, does not like to explain this principle.
He does not talk much about music, although his overall view of life is closely related to music.
At the age of eighty, I came to the conclusion that the best thing to do is to let life surprise you.
“Too many people plan everything and then they’re disappointed when things go differently,” Shorter says.
How Insects from Thailand Raised Sales at Paris Bar
You may be complaining about an insect, but you have no idea that you eat about half a kilogram a year completely voluntarily.
For example, crushed in flour.
If you consume it consciously, then you are clearly trendy: it is organic, nutritious and you are also taken care of for a unique experience.
In the beginning of October, Elie Daviron, the chef and bar owner of Le Festin Nu, was the first in Paris to place the offer of insects on his company’s menu.
The bar, named after William Burroughs’ book The Naked Lunch, is a trendy 18th district near Montmartre that attracts many tourists.
With fresh avocado, roasted red peppers, ginger and quail eggs, guests can taste not only various larvae, sparrows or water bugs, but also scorpions.
Carefully and specially packaged deliveries (to prevent insects from damaging their wings, legs or eyes) are sent to Daviron from Thailand.
Europe is still learning how to eat insects, which is common elsewhere.
The owner of a Paris bar with a pioneering menu lists several reasons why you should eat insects.
The first is the ecological benefit, because the production of insects is much less expensive for our planet (in terms of finances, space and water consumption) than for traditional meat.
"In addition, insects are an excellent source of protein and omega 3 fatty acids," Daviron told Reuters.
At the same time, the young chef does not deny his profession, he simply aims to offer his customers a unique culinary experience.
According to him, it makes the right restaurant pleasure, a sense of sin and an atmosphere of environment.
"I'm not saving the world, I'm just passing on a new experience," he explained.
Not everyone would be excited by the idea of how the insect eats the pest, but the reaction of customers of the Paris bar to the served insects is very positive, according to the owner.
It is said that even skeptics will eventually taste it, even if they start with the smallest bites and choose a scorpion.
The prices of these tasting plates range from five to nine euros.
President of the Association of Entrepreneurs in Construction in the Czech Republic Václav Matyá<0xC5><0xA1>: New green savings should continue
Since 2008, the Czech construction industry has been facing a continuous decline in the volume of contracts and a lack of interest of the state in solving the problem of investment construction.
The announcement of the New Green Savings programme was a positive signal for our construction industry, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises in individual regions.
It is a great opportunity not only for citizens, who after the implementation of the measures will save considerable amounts for heating, but also a chance for construction companies and manufacturers of construction materials.
Each billion invested will bring the state more than 2,700 newly created jobs.
From the point of view of the fiscal policy of the state there are significant leverage and multiplication effects, it is also one of the most important measures for growth.
The Association of Entrepreneurs in Construction in the Czech Republic therefore fundamentally disagrees with the government’s resolution and calls for the implementation of such steps as would allow further continuation of the program so that further challenges can be announced within it.

The dog pulled out the carpet, the president kicked and finished on the berries
President Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Zeman left the motel hospital in Prague on Thursday, where he spent the night in bed, and went to the castle in Lány.
What health condition is he in?
In an unprecedented confession, John Kerry said that American espionage “has gone too far”
John Kerry pointed to a softening of the U.S. defensive stance on its surveillance programs and said in an unprecedented confession that in some cases espionage “has gone too far”.
The foreign minister also admitted that he was responsible, along with Barack Obama, for having acted as an “autopilot” in the wake of the swift revelations about the NSA’s espionage activities, which emerged thanks to whistleblower Edward Snowden.
The information released sparked a diplomatic storm between the U.S. government and its allies.
Mr. Kerry, through a video call at an open government conference in London, said: “There is no doubt that the President and I and others in the government have actually learned about some things that have been happening out of inertia because there was this possibility, with reference to World War II, a difficult period of the Cold War 11th and then the very aftermath.”
He became the first high-ranking member of the U.S. government to admit that U.S. espionage had crossed the border, but stressed that it had not violated anyone’s rights.
He said, "In some cases, it's gone too far."
And the president is determined to try to explain and clarify this to the people and is already conducting a thorough review so that no one feels that there has been abuse.
I assure you that there is no abuse of the rights of innocent persons in this process.
Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA is striving for good and that its surveillance operations have saved many lives.
He added: “We are facing a new world in which people are willing to fire themselves.”
There is radical extremism in the world that is determined to murder and blow up people and attack governments.
What if you were able to capture it and stop it before it happens?
In fact, we have prevented planes from falling, buildings from exploding, and people from being executed, because we can already learn about these plans in advance.
The chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs said on Thursday that U.S. lawmakers are heading to Europe to respond to foreign concerns about alleged U.S. espionage, and convinced Europeans that it is necessary to continue to join forces in the fight against terrorism.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said he spoke to members of the European Parliament and others this week and was concerned about their threat to stop participating in counter-terrorism organizations because they were disappointed by the National Security Agency's (NSA) surveillance.
For the national security interests of the United States, it is really important that Europe stays on the same boat with us, taking into account the joint efforts in the fight against terrorism, said in an interview from Washington Murphy, a member of the Democratic Party and chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Foreign Affairs for European Affairs.
And I am going to Europe to make it clear that we must continue to cooperate in the fight against terrorism despite their anger at NSA programs.
Media reports that the NSA was collecting millions of phone records in Europe have disrupted relations with some U.S. allies, although the head of the agency said this week that they were inaccurate and reflected the misunderstanding of metadata that NATO allies were collecting and sharing with the United States.
Another revelation cited documents disclosed by Snowden that the NSA was tracking German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s mobile phone and 34 other world leaders.
National Intelligence Director James Clapper defended Allied espionage as necessary and said it was a common matter on both sides.
In the midst of the turmoil, Murphy said his office is planning a parliamentary trip that should take place this year, and he hopes members of both sides and chambers will appear in the delegation.
In the coming days, the names of the other legislators who intend to participate will be published.
He said there's still work on the program.
Although Murphy said the goal of the trip was to help mend relationships, he added that “well-meaning educational measures” would also be prepared.
He said that European leaders must be honest with their own people when it comes to espionage programs they have been using for years.
“While we are adjusting our surveillance programs to better protect the rights of Europeans, they also need to realize that we are not the only ones doing espionage here,” Murphy said.
Kerry, meanwhile, is scheduled to head to the Middle East and Poland this weekend to respond to hostility sparked by U.S. strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as U.S. surveillance.
Australian woman appeals against stay in Thai prison
A 22-year-old woman from Sydney, who was sentenced to 15 days in prison on Phuket Island when she falsely claimed to have been assaulted by a taxi driver, appealed the verdict and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was originally charged on June 15 by a land court on the island of Phuket with false accusations when she told Thai police that a taxi driver, along with two other men who allegedly detained her, attacked her in the morning on Sunday, June 10.
However, an industrial TV footage later revealed that she had returned safely to her hotel after breaking up with her Australian boyfriend.
Phuket police held talks with Bamford two days before finding out that she had invented the incident.
Before the trial, she was held in a local police cell.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days in a prison facility with low security on the outskirts of Phuket, instead of being placed in a female adult prison.
She is the daughter of former Australian league player Peter Tunks, who asked the Canberra Ministry of Foreign Affairs for help in his daughter's case.
Tunks told the Sydney newspaper Sunday Telegraph that the whole family was “extremely worried” about their daughter’s fate and wanted her back in Australia.
“Obviously it’s a tough period, but we hope he’ll come back to us safely as soon as possible,” Tunks said.
Bamford appealed the verdict and was released on bail of 50,000 baht.
Reports from Australia say she has been on vacation in the resort area of Krabi in southern Thailand.
Legal sources in Thailand say Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket, but she was warned that an appeal could lead to a trial that would increase her sentence and result in her being put in adult prison.
However, after the recent assassination of an Australian employee of the travel agency Michelle Smith in Phuket, Thailand can also try to correct the disgraceful image for tourists, which may have just been behind the liberating verdict.

Place of election candlestick election gul<0xC4><0x81><0xC5><0xA1>
The October elections, rather than the winners, brought a lot of defeats.
These are not only the parties that did not even get into the Chamber of Deputies (e.g. SPOZ), but also the previous government parties (ODS, TOP 09) and finally the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD due to their internal division.
The politicians instead of the festive candles served us an election goulash on the weekend.
Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1>’s movement, which promised voters to change the political style of government, became the leap forward of the election.
The fragmentation of the election result and the split in the winning party are politically charged (because) of President Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Zeman, regardless of the wishes of voters who did not even vote for the party that President Zeman publicly supported in the Chamber of Deputies.
While the president has lost a strategic lead over other politicians because of the unpleasant event, there are still several ways to get him back - for example, by choosing a future prime minister.
While <0xC4><0x8C>SSD’s chances of winning the prime minister’s seat are dwindling in my eyes, entrepreneurs are getting closer to Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1>.
While the electoral development is so far miles away from the early and smooth creation of a stable government, compared with the Communist-backed pre-election scenario of the left-wing government of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, this development is only better news for business in the Czech Republic and therefore the economy.
Due to the strong opposition of the ANO to join the ODS or TOP 09, it is still the most likely variant of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, ANO and KDU-<0xC4><0x8C>SL coalition (total 111 MPs).
Due to the split in the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, which has thus become an illegible and weak negotiating partner, the result of the coalition negotiations can be quite depressing for the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD.
The minority government of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD composed of the "Nezemanovts" in the Castle is unlikely to pass.
In addition, any government in which the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD will participate will be threatened by the dissatisfied ambitions of many Social Democrats, which may sooner or later lead to further division in the party.
So I ask myself, "Shouldn't we self-indulge in another early election?"
The next election would rather be a referendum on the strength of the electoral mandate of the ANO movement.
<0xC4><0x8C>SSD plans for introducing sector taxes, a more significant increase in income taxes or building a state bank fell under the table.
On the contrary, the parties <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, ANO, KDU-<0xC4><0x8C>SL and <0xC3><0x9A>svit agree, for example, on the support of business, a moderate fiscal policy (government deficit below 3% of GDP), on the support of employment of disadvantaged persons, the reduction of the lower VAT rate for selected goods.
The third areas are most common in terms of social policy and the size of the state.
ANO is now at the forefront, so the program so far most likely coalition ANO, <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, KDU-<0xC4><0x8C>SL would be more to the right.
Which, in my view, is ultimately a better result than a left-wing program with taxes on everything that is still moving in the economy.
