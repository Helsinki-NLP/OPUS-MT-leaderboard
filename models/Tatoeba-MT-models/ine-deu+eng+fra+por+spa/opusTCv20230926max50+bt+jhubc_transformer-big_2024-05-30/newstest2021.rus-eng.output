Semilarski v. Prosecutor: the cassation of the former deputy mayor of Tartu will be considered on August 4
This means that a decision on it is likely to be taken in early September.
The courts of the first two instances refused to hear Semilarski's lawsuit, but in April his appeal of cassation was accepted in the proceedings by the State Court.
On 12 December 2019, the Tartu Administrative Court returned the complaint to the applicant, as its authorization does not fall within the jurisdiction of the administrative court.
The court order indicated that the complaint contained a claim for compensation for damages caused in the course of criminal proceedings.
“The prosecutor’s office and the county court should regulate such matters,” Annette Kreitsmann, a spokeswoman for the Tartu courts, told ERR.
According to her, Valvo Semilarski appealed this decision to the district court, which on February 5 did not change the decision of the court of first instance.
The state will now have to say its word.
According to Semilarski's lawyer, Oliver Nyaes's lawyer, his client was unreasonably suspected of bribery for about two years.
Now he demands that the prosecutor’s office refute the false allegations against him and reimburse him for moral damages.
The reason for the complaint to the court was the statements of the prosecutor in the special cases of the Lyuna District Prosecutor’s Office of Margus Gross, made by him in October 2017, when Semilarski, together with another at that time Deputy Mayor of Tartu Artem Suvorov, was arrested on suspicion of non-commitment.
“Remember that when I was arrested, the Security Police and the Prosecutor’s Office immediately held a press conference and informed the entire Republic of Estonia that the leaders of Tartu – one of the most influential bodies of local government – are selling.
These public suspicions hanging in the air have accompanied me for about two years.
And now that these allegations and suspicions have turned out to be false, the prosecutor’s office does not want to say anything about it,” Semilarski said in early August 2019.
According to Oliver Nyaes, at a press conference, the prosecutor went beyond the legal framework in which the prosecutor’s office should operate.
“The allegation of bribery and bribery turned out to be false, but that’s not the only problem here.
The European Court of Human Rights, for example, has repeatedly stressed in its rulings on Russia, as well as on Lithuania, that at the stage of the investigation, state representatives should be careful when choosing words so that the suspects would not be represented as criminals before the sentencing.
The prosecutor’s office is also bound by the presumption of innocence, which unfortunately has not been observed in this case against Valvo Semilarski,” Nyaes said.
"Semilarski's public presentation as a serious offender and briber in circumstances where the facts underlying the suspicion of bribery are still being ascertained is unacceptable, which contradicts the presumption of innocence and is unfair to the plaintiff."
According to rus.err.ee, former deputy mayor of Tartu, Valvo Semilarski, will not be prosecuted on bribery charges - the criminal case against him in July was partially closed.
At the same time, the former official is tried on charges of knowingly violating anti-corruption legislation when conducting transactions in particularly large sizes.
According to the indictment, between 2015 and 2017, the former deputy mayor of Tartu participated more than thirty times in meetings of the city administration in making decisions related to companies operating in Tartu, with the owners or managers of which Semilarski actively communicated at a personal level in the city.
According to Gross, in all these cases, Semilarski had personal interests, and therefore he had to abstain from participating in decision-making.
Earlier, according to rus.err.ee, the prosecutor's office presented Semilarsky's suspicions of receiving bribes and violations of anti-corruption legislation when conducting transactions in particularly large sizes.
This happened in October 2016, when he was detained along with another deputy mayor, Artem Suvorov (Centrist Party).
The prosecutor’s office and the security police said there was strong evidence against the two deputies.
After that, both officials resigned.
Suvorov’s case later came to the court, which fully justified the policy.
The trial in the case of Valvo Semilarski is still ongoing.

U.S. urges Qatar and its neighbors to end dispute
It is necessary to restore trust and unity between Qatar and other states, says U.S. Special Representative on Iran Brian Hook.
He said that the conflict between the emirate and other countries in the region has been going on for too long and is detrimental to regional interests in terms of stability, prosperity and security.
So far, the United States has unsuccessfully tried to act as a mediator in the settlement of the dispute, which Washington regards as a “threat to Iran’s deterrence efforts.”
Diplomatic relations with Qatar were broken three years ago by the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Bahrain.

How the ECB’s decision to reduce the key rate will affect the economy
The Bank of Russia is expected to lower the key rate again.
It fell by a further 0.25 percentage point, to 4.25% per annum - formally the next historical minimum.
Judging by the return of a short step of the rate cut, as well as the tonality of the ECB’s statements and updated forecasts on the Russian economy, the regulator looks at the economic outlook more optimistic than before.
This means that the current cycle of monetary policy easing may soon come to an end.
“We continued to soften monetary policy, primarily considering that the risks of inflation offset down from 4% in 2021 remain,” the head of the Bank of Russia, Elvira Nabiullina, said in a statement.
They are associated with a significant decrease in economic activity, a decline in domestic and external demand.
The recovery of the economy, according to Nabiullina, will take more than one and a half years.
At the same time, she noted that after the lifting of restrictions due to the pandemic, economic processes resumed: energy consumption, consumer and investment demand were restored, construction and production of consumer goods expanded, annual rates of decline in freight turnover of transport, industrial production slowed down.
According to the ECB’s forecast, the economy will shrink by 4.5-5.5% in 2020 (previously expected to shrink by 4-6%), and the recovery growth in 2021 will be 3.5-4.5%, while in 2022 it will shrink by 2.5-3.5%.
In addition, the Bank of Russia revised its forecast for annual oil prices to $38 and $40 per barrel of Urals in 2020 and 2021, respectively.
Earlier, the central bank expected $27 and $35 per barrel.
Finally, the Bank of Russia’s inflation forecast for 2020 was 3.7-4.2% against the previously expected 3.8-4.8%.
The view of the Bank of Russia on the situation in the economy is becoming more optimistic, which brings us closer to the end of the easing cycle, according to economists for Russia and CIS "Renaissance Capital" Sofia Donets and Andrey Melashchenko.
Thus, the Bank of Russia consistently lowers the key rate more than a year, since the beginning of last summer it has already fallen by 3.5 percentage points.
And at the last meeting in June, the Central Bank immediately lowered it by one percentage point due to the low rates of inflation due to suppressed demand and the need to stimulate the slowing economy due to the pandemic and the associated constraints.
Chances of pre-adjusting monetary policy remain (at the next meeting on September 18 and until the end of the year), but the limit is already close, agrees the chief analyst of the Rosbank, Yevgeny Koshelev.
The combination of pro-inflation risks also indicates a pause in easing interest rates – disrupted supply chains, possible cost increases due to epidemic prevention measures and a faster (compared to expected) recovery in demand, he says.
In addition, the Bank of Russia’s follow-up will require more attention to inflationary processes during the harvest season, as well as external volatility, which has increased against the background of geopolitical conflicts, Koshelev said.
In one way or another, the reduction of the key rate will lead to further reductions in rates for the most reliable borrowers, as well as, perhaps, on the mortgage, says the senior economist of the analytical management of the Bank "Opening" Maxim Petronevich.
The adjustment of the rates will be less pronounced than the reduction of the key rate, he clarifies.
Rates on demand loans may fall by another 0.3-0.6 percentage point during the second half of the year, mortgage rates can end the year in the range of 6.2-7%, does not exclude economist "BKS Prime Minister" Anton Pokatovic.
The average interest rates on deposits, in his opinion, will also fall - in the coming months they can fall to 4.2-4.5% (now just above 4.5%).
Further, they can fall to 4% if the central bank lowers the key rate in the fall, Pokatovic believes.

Poll: Lithuania’s ruling Union of Peasants and Greens again leads party ranking
The union of peasants and "green" Lithuania, leading the ruling coalition of the Seimas, led the ranking of parties.
This was shown by a survey conducted by sociological research company Vilmorus on the order of the newspaper Lietuvos rytas.

According to Vilmorus director Vildas Gaidis, the break-up is in the wrong place, and yet the ruling party has stopped falling behind the Conservatives.
According to Haydis, the sociological success of the "peasants" was facilitated by the news that their electoral list would be headed by Prime Minister Saulius Skvernialis.

In third place is the Social Democratic Party, for which 7.1 percent of the respondents are now ready to vote.
In a month, she suddenly lost 2%.
Fourth - Labour Party, headed by a businessman of Russian origin Victor Uspassky (6.2 percent).

Additional requirements for applications for public procurement are excluded by law
The legislation may lay down exhaustive requirements for applications for participation in procurement.
In the autumn session of the plenary session, the State Duma plans to consider in the second reading the draft law, which establishes the requirements for the content and composition of the application for participation in the procurement, which can only be participants of small and medium-sized businesses.
Amendments are made by the government to the law "On the purchase of goods, works, services by individual types of legal entities".
The draft law was developed in accordance with the roadmap for the implementation of the Strategy for the development of small and medium-sized enterprises in Russia until 2030, approved by the government.
It provides for the preparation of a draft law on a comprehensive list of documents that customers have the right to require as part of the application from participants in the procurement - small and medium-sized enterprises.
As well as a list of requirements for these documents.
To date, the law "On the procurement of goods, works, services by individual types of legal entities" framework regulates the procurement activities of individual types of legal entities.
The requirements for the content, form, form and composition of the application for participation in the procurement are established by the customers themselves in the procurement documentation.
"As a result, the customers establish excessive requirements for the content, registration of the application, the compulsory presence of certificates, certificates, extracts, the period of receipt of which in authorized bodies can be compared with the deadline for submitting applications, which leads to the impossibility of participation in such purchase and reduction of quantities".
The new draft law provides for the establishment of a comprehensive list of documents that customers are entitled to require in the form of an application from procurement participants who are subjects of small and medium-sized enterprises.
"The adoption of the document will allow to exclude the arbitrary establishment by customers of requirements for the composition and content of applications of participants who are subjects of small and medium-sized enterprises," the explanatory note reads.

During the work trips to the Ust-Ordyn district of Buryat district, the head of the region gave a number of assignments.
Today, the mayors reported on their execution.
First of all, the construction of the Sports House in Ust-Orda was resumed.
The order on this object was given by the President of the Russian Federation fourteen years ago.
But only now the situation has been moved from a dead end.
866 million rubles will be spent on construction.
The deadline for delivery of the construction is 2022.
And already this year, the school in the village of Baiandai should be put into operation.
Finishing of the premises is currently completed.
Of the remaining works - improvement of the territory.
In general, the programme for the construction of pre-school and secondary education facilities is of particular importance for the region.
Especially for your county.
The demographic situation here is the best in the region.
And we are obliged to create all conditions for the education and leisure of children of all ages," said Igor Kobzev, Governor of Irkutsk region.
At the meeting, the head of the region instructed all mayors to be actively involved in the development of general plans for human settlements.
This is one of the main conditions of comprehensive development of the district.
All settlements must have established boundaries and a master plan.
This is necessary for the development of the territory, for the construction of socially significant facilities, as well as facilities of infrastructure and cultural heritage, the head of the region stressed.
Also during the conversation, the problem with the reduction of milk intake in cooperatives by 30% was raised.
This was due to the redistribution by the processing enterprise of the purchase of milk in favor of peasant farms.
Due to this, the share of product intake in cooperatives decreased.
The head of the region instructed the acting Minister of Agriculture to go to the site, to study the structure of the implementation of milk, to analyze the experience of other territories and to determine options for solving the problem.

The authorities of Moscow told about the fate of closed landfills
In Sub-Moscow, landfills of solid household waste continue to be closed.
This year, the authorities are promising to eliminate the latter.
Some of the 39 existing landfills are being upgraded to modern waste recycling complexes.
But this option is not possible for every landfill - many of them are covered with dense residential construction.
After the landfill is closed, it stands for re-cultivation - the body of the landfill oversleeps with soil, degassing and filtration systems are installed.
This allows you to stop the chemical processes inside the landfill, so that it does not ignite, does not spill malaria, does not poison the soil and groundwater.
And then the former landfill remains to rise in a useless pile among its surrounding residential building.
Why not make something useful out of it?
For example, in Ruza, where the re-cultivation of the Annino field was completed literally the other day, the authorities are considering an option to make a pile of ski slopes.
This landfill, which operated from 1976 to 2016, grew so much that it went beyond the boundaries of the land allocated to it.
Therefore, during the re-cultivation it was necessary to buy the neighboring plots, de facto already long stuffed with garbage under the rubbish.
"Sometime will pass, the landing ground will "send", the forts will be built, and we will think what can be done to make it begin to benefit.
Directly in the eye - the ski resort," - said the head of the Ruz district Nikolay Parthenov to journalists.
Two landfills will become sites for the production of renewable energy sources
The Torbeevo and Timohovo sites in the Bogorod district will become sites for the extraction of renewable energy from landfill and biological gases.
On the territory of "Torbeev" by the end of the year will be launched a gas-fired power plant, capable of producing up to 8 million kilowatt-hours of electricity and about 0.95 gigacalories of thermal energy per year, which will provide its own needs of the landfill - heat supply of administrative and industrial facilities.
Timohovo will produce 72.5 million kilowatt-hours and will continue to operate as a waste recycling complex.
And on the Balashikhina polygon "Kuchino", which was closed after the complaints of residents on the "Direct line" with the president of the country, a museum can be created.
"There was such an idea - to create a museum for the re-cultivation of polygons of the suburbs of Moscow", - said the Deputy Minister of Environment and Environmental Management of the region Dmitry Kurakin.

Beautiful tall minarets just decorated Ayia Sophia
Once again about Ayia Sophia - got the text of Father Vladimir Zelinsky, which, he said, it is necessary to protest.
First of all, there was a free entry - hurrah!
I have not been to Istanbul, but it is better to enter the House of God for free than for a fee.
Secondly, Muslims conquered this land just as honestly as the Orthodox conquered the Volgo-Oksk intersection, the Muslim Caucasus (and set up a church in Grozny) and planted apple trees on Mars.
God help me!
The Jews conquered the Holy Land.
The Americans conquered America.
Are we going to give everything back to everyone?
Do you think there will be no pagans who will demand the return of their altar, in the place of which the Tenth Church?
Thirdly, the Muslims improved this building, invested in it.
That is, it belongs to them, just as the factories and estates that the Leninites took from the bourgeoisie belong to the Leninists - Putin and other nomenclature.
They’ve improved everything from the Kremlin to Angara, so it’s all theirs by right of the progressives.
Beautiful high minarets very decorated Ayia Sophia, very.
There was a stupid ink, there was a stupid ink with beautiful minarets.
Fourth, there are no “Islamic” or “Orthodox” civilizations.
There are believers, there are hypocrites, there are hypocrites who combine faith and hypocrisy.
A believer in the categories of civilization does not think.
This is the opinion of the British Foreign Ministry official Toynbee, who believes it is shameful to think so.
There is a place for every believer to pray.
And always.
The believer does not pray only where he is asked to leave; he goes away to another place and prays there.
He is a believer, not a defender.
We're sticks, not egg yolks.

I knew that Bryant’s self-love could not be used with any kind of thresh-touch to avoid stimulating his sporting anger.
Kobe had a killer instinct, so on the pitch I tried to talk to him so he wouldn't perceive the game aggressively.
On the spot I gave him compliments: "Oh!
Kobe, you scored well, great pass!
Listening to my enthusiastic responses, he forgot a little about the fact that you have to take the ball in your hands again and score another 3 - 4 points.
We communicated well with Kobi," Kirilenko said in the statement, "Evening Moscow."
He also talked about his first game against Jordan.
"I took care of him.
For the first three minutes of the match, I ran in total admiration for the legend that was next to me, which I saw only on TV.
As long as I had a spiral of joy in my breath, Michael scored a lot of points.
Soon I left the delights, a couple of times covered his throws...
In that game, my team won, and Jordan still scored 44 points,” he added.

Provisional acting governor of Khabarovsk region Mikhail Degtyarev on Sunday, July 26, during a meeting with residents of Soviet Havana was surprised that the region buys sakhaline gas, which is produced by the American company Exxon Neftegas, for dollars.
U.S. gas is contracted in dollars until 2025.

I had no idea what was possible in 2020 in Russia,” RIA Novosti quoted him as saying.
Degtyarev noted that this issue was discussed with the head of the Ministry of Energy of Russia Alexander Novak during his visit to Khabarovsk on July 24.
The governor also stressed that by 2025, Gazprom will switch to the supply of Russian power plants and capacities, which means that Russian gas purchased in rubles will be used "at normal prices".
The Sakhalin-1 project is implemented through a product division agreement, where Exxon Neftegas Ltd is the operator of the project with a 30% stake, another 20% in Rosneft, Japanese Sodeco 30% and Indian ONGC 20%.
Khabarovsk region has been acquiring gas from this project since 2005.

The actor of the Russian series responded to the accusations of "propaganda LGBT and feminism"
The actor of the Russian series Chiki, whose creators were accused of "propaganda LGBT and feminism", responded to the claim to the film.
The authors "understood the acuteness of the topics raised and did not want to offend anyone," said American Stephen Thomas Oxner in an interview with the publication "Podjem".
“It seems to me that this is a story about strength and common aspects of human life.
It has nothing to do with LGBT and feminism,” said the actor who played the boy’s father, who was dressed in women’s clothing.
He said he was "proud of the job" and did not consider it propaganda.
At the same time, the American added, he is frightened by the reaction of some people to the storyline of the series: for example, there was a case when "a man in a deep breath shot the set and said that all this was not true."
“Then there were a couple of cases where we met dissatisfied locals who didn’t understand what we were doing.
But we were open, so the people who came with the claims first started to help us," he said.
The shooting, explains the publication, took place in September 2019 in Kabardino-Balkaria: a drunk man attacked the car of a shooting group with a weapon, after which he was detained by police officers.
Earlier it was reported that the public commissioner for the protection of the family Olga Baranets sent a complaint to the Ministry of the Interior and Roskomnadzor on the service more.tv, which hosted the Russian series "Chiki".
She accused the creators of the series of "propagating unconventional sexual relations and feminism," noting that the film's main characters work as prostitutes, and the series itself contains "scenes of physical and psychological violence."
The Ombudsman also resented the fact that "the series pays a lot of attention to homosexual sexual orientation" of the minor character.
