Members of the Welsh National Assembly fear they will be called muppets
There was consternation among some members of the National Assembly, as a result of the proposal to change their title to Members of the Welsh Parliament.
The idea came about in connection with the plans to rename the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the assembly from all sides of the political scene are concerned that they may become the subject of mockery.
One of the Labour Party MPs expressed concerns about his group, saying that the new name rhymes with the Welsh words "twp" and "pwp".
For readers outside Wales: in the Welsh language, the word “twp” means fool, and the word “pwp” means faeces.
One of the party's politicians, Plaid Cymru, said his group was "unhappy" with the proposal and presented other solutions.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said his party is "open" to changing its name, but noted that the word "MWP" sounds very similar to the word "muppet".
In this case, the Welsh letter "w" is pronounced similarly to the letter "u" in the English Yorkshire dialect.
The committee working within the assembly, which is currently working on a bill to change the name, has taken the following position: “Naturally, the final decision on the future title of the members of the assembly will belong to them.”
The Government of Wales Act of 2017 gave the Welsh National Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public consultation on the proposal. The reappointment of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament gained broad support.
In addition, the committee supported the proposal to change the title of the members of the Assembly to "Member of the Welsh Parliament", i.e. WMP in English, although the abbreviation "MWP" enjoyed the greatest popularity among the public.
Members of the Assembly propose alternative solutions. Difficulties in reaching a consensus are a pity for Elin Jones, the president of the Assembly, who is due to present the bill in the coming weeks.
The Act introducing the reforms will also take into account other changes in the way the Assembly works, including the rules for the recall of members and the structure of the committee system.
Members of the National Assembly will be able to vote on their future title while discussing the bill.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change country's name
On Sunday, voters will decide whether their country will soon bear the name of the Republic of North Macedonia.
The general vote is intended to help resolve a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which is home to a region called Macedonia.
The government in Athens has long argued that the name of their northern neighbor is a territorial claim, and has repeatedly opposed attempts to join the European Union and NATO.
<0xC7><0xB4>orge Ivanov, the president of Macedonia and opponent of the referendum on the change of name, said he would disregard the results of the vote.
However, supporters of the plebiscite, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, maintain that the change is necessary to enable you to join the European Union and NATO.
Bells at St. Martin's Church in New York are simmering due to problems plaguing churches in Harlem
“The older people I’m talking to say there used to be a bar and a church on every corner,” said Michael Henry Adams.
“There is no trace of them now.”
As he says, the disappearance of bars is understandable.
“Currently, people are socializing in a different way,” he noted.
“The bars have ceased to be a place of regular meetings of community members.”
In the case of churches, however, he is concerned that the funds derived from the sale of property will not be sufficient for as long as the decision-makers believe, and that “sooner or later they will be at the starting point”.
He added that the churches could be replaced by condominiums inhabited by people who would not support other nearby temples.
As he said, “The overwhelming majority of people buying apartments in such buildings will be white. This will accelerate the complete closure of churches, because it is unlikely that new residents will become members of these parishes.”
Both churches were built by a congregation of white believers before Harlem joined the Metropolitan Community in 1870 (St. Martin's Church joined the community a decade later).
The original gathering of white Methodists left the district in the 1930s.
The African Americans then took over the ownership of the building.
St. Martin's Church was taken over by an assembly chaired by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott against 125th Street vendors (the main shopping street in Harlem), opposing the hiring or promotion of African Americans.
A 1939 fire severely damaged the building, but John Howard Johnson's parishioners made plans to rebuild the temple and commissioned a group of bells.
Reverend David Johnson, son of John Howard Johnson and his successor in St. Martin's Church, proudly called the new carillon "the bells of the poor."
The expert, who struck the bells in July, described them in a different way as “a cultural treasure” and “an irreplaceable historical instrument”.
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, also noted that this is the first carillon in the world served by a black musician. The artist was Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to Riverside Church 18 years ago, where a larger band awaited him.
Malcolm J. Merriweather said St. Martin's Church did not replace him.
In recent months, a number of complicated events involving architects and contractors have occurred in St. Martin’s Church, some of which were brought to the scene by secular church leaders and some by the diocese of the Episcopal Church.
In July, the parish council (a governing body of the parish made up of secular leaders) addressed its concerns to the diocese, claiming that "it wants to transfer costs to the council", although the council did not take part in the employment of architects and contractors sent to the place.
Some parishioners also complain about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark Injured 13-Year-Old Scuba Diving in Search of Lobsters in California
Authorities reported that last Saturday, a shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old diver in search of lobsters in California. The incident occurred on the first day of the lobster season.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in the US city of Encinitas.
Chad Hammel reported to KSWB-TV in San Diego that on Saturday morning he had been diving with friends for about half an hour when he heard the call for help. Immediately with a group of friends they came to the boy to help pull him out of the water.
As Hammel said, at first it seemed to him that the boy was thrilled to catch a lobster, but soon he realized that the child was screaming: “I was bitten!
I've been bitten!"
Upon arriving at the scene, Chad Hammel noticed that the boy had completely torn skin around his collarbone.
“I started yelling at everyone to get out of the water: ‘There’s a shark in the water!’”
The boy was transported by helicopter to the Children's Council Hospital in San Diego. His condition has been described as critical.
The species of shark responsible for the attack remains unknown.
At a press conference, Captain Larry Giles said the fish had been spotted a few weeks earlier, but it was not considered to be a dangerous shark species.
Larry Giles added that the victim suffered serious upper torso injuries.
In order to conduct an investigation and for safety reasons, the authorities closed the entrance to the beach for 48 hours from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami Beach in Ecinitas.
Larry Giles noted that more than 135 species of sharks live in the area, although most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's store network plans to expand its operations in the UK cosmetics market
Sainsbury's throws gloves at stores such as Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, introducing to their supermarkets style departments to department stores, as well as specially trained retailers.
As part of a significant investment in the UK cosmetics market – which is worth <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion and is constantly developing despite declines in the fashion and household goods industry – in 11 stores belonging to the network will appear larger shelves with cosmetic products.
The return to the cosmetics industry is due to the search for ways to manage the space previously occupied by televisions, microwaves and household items.
According to Sainsbury's, the network will double the number of cosmetic products and offer up to 3,000 items. For the first time, brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw will appear in the assortment.
Currently sold items of the brands L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also receive more space and separate areas close to those of the famous Boots stores.
In addition, the supermarket network plans to refresh its range of Boutique makeup products. From now on, most of the articles will be vegan-friendly, which is increasingly demanded by younger customers.
In addition, fragrance shop Fragrance Shop will create test points in two Sainsbury's supermarkets, the first opened last week in Croydon, south London, and the second will be built in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later in the year.
The prevalence of online sales and daily purchases of small amounts of food in local stores makes supermarkets more likely to encourage customers to visit.
Mike Coupe, president of Sainsbury's, said the outlets will increasingly resemble department stores as the network tries to fight off discounts such as Aldi or Lidl by offering more non-food services and products.
Sainsbury's has placed Argos points in hundreds of stores and has introduced a number of Habitat points since the acquisition of both companies two years ago. According to the company, this contributes to increased sales of food items and increased returns on investment.
The previous attempt to reorganize the departments with cosmetics and pharmaceutical products ended in failure.
At the beginning of the 21st century, Sainsbury's set up a joint-venture company with Boots to test it. However, the cooperation was ended following a conflict over the distribution of revenues from supermarket pharmacies.
Sainsbury's is introducing a new strategy following the sale of 281 pharmacies to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy network, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
According to reports, Lloyds will contribute to the plan by introducing an expanded range of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to the four stores of the network.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Director of Commercials at Sainsbury’s, said: “We’ve transformed the look and character of cosmetics departments to improve customer experiences.
We have invested in special training for colleagues to help consumers with their purchases.
Our brands are able to meet all needs, and the friendly environment and convenient locations allow us to capture the attention of customers looking for cosmetic products, as well as to question the current ways of shopping."
Peter Jones 'angry' after Holly Willoughby withdraws from <0xC2><0xA3>11m contract
Peter Jones, the star of the TV show Dragons' Den, was "angry" to learn that Holly Willoughby intends to withdraw from the <0xC2><0xA3>11 million lifestyle brand to focus on the newly formed partnership with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Holly Willoughby has no time for their brand offering accessories and household items under the name Truly.
The activity was often compared to the Goop brand owned by Gwyneth Paltrow.
This morning, a 37-year-old presenter announced her resignation via Instagram.
Holly Willoughby’s sudden decision to leave the well-prospering lifestyle brand and focus on a newly formed partnership with Marks & Spencer and ITV angered Peter Jones, the star of Dragons’ Den.
According to sources, Peter Jones was "angry" when a popular television presenter announced during a nervous Tuesday meeting at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that due to new contracts worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million, he would not have time to sacrifice his time and sacrifice them.
The company was previously compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand, and was also to double Holly Willoughby's estimated <0xC2><0xA3>11 million fortune.
After announcing the decision to leave the Truly brand by 37-year-old Holly Willoughby on Instagram, Peter Jones left the UK to go to one of his holiday homes.
According to the source, “Truly’s brand was a priority for Holly Willoughby.
She had her future tied to her and wanted to take care of her for several decades to come.
The decision to withdraw from the business completely surprised all the people involved.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday. It was already so close to entering the market.
The Marlow Warehouse holds ready-to-sell goods."
Experts believe that the resignation of the presenter of the program This Morning and one of the UK’s most successful stars could cost the company millions of pounds due to significant investments in products – including items from pillows to candles to clothes to clothes to long-distance household items – as well.
It can also mean the end of a long-term friendship.
Holly Willoughby (mother of three children) and her husband Dan Baldwin had a close relationship with Peter Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Holly Willoughby and Tara Capp founded Truly in 2016, and 52-year-old Peter Jones joined them in March as CEO.
The couple spent their holidays together, and Jones held a 40 percent stake in Dan Baldwin’s television production company.
Holly Willoughby will become M&S brand ambassador and replace Ant McPartlin as host of I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
A source close to Peter Jones said last night: “We will not comment on his business affairs.”
Difficult conversation, "and then we fell in love"
The president joked about media criticism due to the remarks made, which some considered "unfitting to the husband of the state", as well as the positive attitude towards the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said in a ridiculous voice, pretending to be a TV presenter:
“I gave up nothing.”
The president noted that Kim Jong Un is interested in the second meeting. The first meeting took place in Singapore in June and was called by Trump a big step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
Negotiations on nuclear disarmament are delayed.
After more than three months since the June summit in Singapore, North Korea’s head of diplomacy Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly on Saturday that he saw no “analogous response” from the United States to North Korea’s early actions.
He noted that instead, the United States maintains sanctions and exerts pressure.
President Trump expressed a much more optimistic view in his speech.
“We’re doing great with North Korea,” he said.
“We were planning a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would die.
We are now in a great relationship.”
The president said his efforts to improve relations with Kim Jong-un had brought positive results: they led to the end of missile tests, helped free the hostages and returned the remaining U.S. soldiers home.
In addition, he defended his unusual approach while discussing relations with Kim Jong Un.
“It’s easy to behave after the presidential election, but instead of 10,000 people waiting outside and trying to get to the crowded stadium, we would have 200 people here,” Trump said, pointing at the crowd gathered directly in front of him.
The tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia completely destroyed one of the islands, killing hundreds of people.
After the earthquake on the island of Lombok, foreign NGOs were told that their help was not needed.
Despite the loss of a roof over the head by more than 10% of the inhabitants of Lombok, the authorities have not declared a natural disaster, which is a necessary condition for accelerating international aid.
“Unfortunately, in many cases, the authorities have made it very clear that they do not demand international support, so the situation is difficult,” said Selina Sumbung.
While Save the Children is preparing to travel to the Indonesian city of Palu, it is not yet certain whether international personnel will be able to act on the scene.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the national agency for natural disasters, said the Indonesian authorities are assessing the situation in Palu to see if assistance from international organizations should be allowed.
In the face of the shocks constantly felt in Indonesia, the country remains completely unprepared to cope with the forces of nature.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh province, they are rare for the rest of the coastline.
The lack of a siren warning of the tsunami in Palu – despite the warning – likely affected the number of fatalities.
Even in the most favourable conditions, travelling between the Indonesian islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters are making logistics even more difficult.
The hospital ship, which was stationed on the island of Lombok, is on its way to help the victims of the earthquake to the city of Palu. However, reaching the destination will take at least three days.
President Joko Widodo has made the improvement of Indonesia’s infrastructure the focus of his campaign and has allocated a lot of funds to roads and railways.
However, in the face of next year's elections, the presidential administration is struggling with a lack of funds.
In addition, Joko Widodo found himself under pressure due to the ongoing tensions in the country on religious grounds. Members of the majority Muslim community adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than a thousand people died, and tens of thousands of residents lost their roofs as a result of fighting between Christian and Muslim gangs using machetes, bows, arrows and other simple weapons on the streets.
See: Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge scores a goal for a draw against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing to Chelsea in the English Premier League, scoring in the 89th minute of Saturday's game at Stamford Bridge Stadium in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri at a distance of about 27 metres from Chelsea's goal at 1:0 to the detriment of his team.
Before firing a shot in the direction of a distant goal, he moved the ball to his left leg.
The ball hovered high above the penalty area towards the upper right corner of the grid.
Then she fell to the gate, flying over the Cape Arrizabalaga that was thrown at her.
“I was just trying to take the position and take the ball, knowing that players like Shaqiri are always trying to get it as far ahead as possible. I wanted to give myself the best opportunity to shoot,” Sturridge said in an interview with LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante approaching, took the ball and fired the shot without a deeper thought.”
Chelsea led 1-0 in the middle of the game after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The forward of the Blues kicked the fifth ball to Mateo Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x8D>ia and then ran towards the middle of Liverpool.
Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87> quickly accepted the application in the middle of the pitch.
He then made a beautiful forward play in the penalty area back to Hazard.
The gambler overtook the defenders and left footed a long pole shot past Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League on Wednesday at 15:00 at Stadio San Paolo in Naples (Italy).
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.
Tsunami death toll in Indonesia rises to 832
Indonesia’s disaster agency said on Sunday morning that the death toll from the recent earthquake and tsunami in the country had risen to 832 people.
During the conference, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said that as a result of Friday's 7.5-degree earthquake on the Richter scale, many people were trapped under rubble. In addition, the shock caused a 6-metre tsunami wave.
Inhabited by more than 380,000 people, the city of Palu is full of rubble of collapsed buildings.

Inside the detached zone are officers guarding the residential building.
Those with information are requested to contact us via Twitter (<0x40>MerPolCC) or by phone at 101, or to make an anonymous application through Crimestoppers at 0800 555 111, giving the event number 247 of 30 September.
Cromwell's monument to British Parliament last victim of 'rewriting history'
The removal of the monument would bring justice for the Taliban's actions reminiscent of the destruction of many English cultural and religious monuments by its radical, Puritan supporters.
However, the Cromwell Society described Jeremy Crick's proposal as "crazy" and "an attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “Given the ongoing debate over the removal of monuments, the dispute over the character of Oliver Cromwell in front of Westminster Palace was a matter of time.
The educational activities during the English Civil Wars were neither commissioned nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps for the actions of his ancestor Thomas a century earlier, it was decided to punish the wrong Cromwell.
The way in which Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft portrayed Cromwell at the monument is a testament to the opinion that this politician enjoyed in the 19th century and that for many people he is a figure still worth commemorating.
In an interview with The Sunday Telegraph, John Goldsmith said: “Cromwell was seen by many people – perhaps more often in the nineteenth century than today – as a defender of parliament from external pressures.
Assessing how correct this statement is is the subject of ongoing historical debate.
It is certain, however, that the conflict of the mid-17th century shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure identifying one of the sides of the division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of honor and commemoration.”
In China, there was a deadly turmoil of a farmer by a pig
According to local media, there was a deadly pig attack on a farmer at a market in southwest China.
On Sunday, the South China Morning Post reported that a dead man named Yuan was found bleeding and with a cut artery near a pig in a marketplace in the city of Liupanshui, in Kuejczou province.
A pig farmer is preparing to be vaccinated at a pig farm in Xining, Qinghai Province, China, on 30 May 2005.
According to reports, the man came to the market with his cousin from the neighboring province of Junnan to sell 15 pigs.
The next morning, a cousin found the man’s body and noticed the door open to the nearby pig.
He said there was a big pig in the piglet with blood on it.
The corpse section confirmed that this nearly 250-kilogram pig had fatally disturbed the farmer.
“My cousin’s legs were bleedin’ and bleedin’,” said a man named Wu, quoted by Guiyang Evening News.
The footage from the surveillance camera shows that Yuan arrived at the market on Thursday at 4:40 a.m. to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The market manager said in an interview with Guiyang Evening News that at the time of collecting the evidence by the police, I was asked to be isolated to avoid another attack.
According to reports, the man's family and the market authorities are negotiating compensation for death.
Pig attacks on humans have been reported in the past, although they are rare.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on a farm in Massachusetts. The man sustained fatal wounds.
Ten years earlier, in Wales, about 300 kilograms of pig nailed a farmer to a tractor. The wife of a man managed to pull the animal off.
After eating an Oregon farmer by pigs in 2012, one of the farmers in Manitoba told CBC News that these animals are not usually aggressive, however, the taste of blood can release brutal behavior in them.
“They just want to play.
They're as inquisitive as children... they don't want to hurt anyone.
You just have to show them proper respect," he said.
Remains of Hurricane Rosa will cause heavy rainfall in the southwestern part of the United States
According to forecasts, Hurricane Rosa is losing strength as it moves over the cooler waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days it will cause intense rainfall in northern Mexico and the southwestern part of the United States.
Hurricane Rosa is blowing at a speed of almost 137 km/h. On Sunday at 5:00 Eastern Time, it was given Category 1. It was then located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
According to forecasts, Rosa will move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, over the Pacific Ocean begins to form as it heads east to the west coast of the United States. On Monday, Rosa will approach the California Peninsula in the form of a tropical storm, moving the masses of moist air north, south-south.
On Monday, it will bring rainfall of up to 25 cm on part of the territory of Mexico.
Over the next few days, the humid tropical air coming into contact with the approaching low will cause heavy rainfall in the Southwestern United States.
In some places, rainfall of 2.5 to 10 cm will lead to sudden floods, the movement of pollutants and possible landslides in desert areas.
Humid tropical air will cause rain somewhere between 5 and 7.5 cm per hour, especially in parts of Nevada and Arizona.
Even 5 to 10 cm of rain is expected in some parts of the southwestern United States, especially over much of Arizona.
Due to the dispersed nature of tropical rainfall, sudden floods and rapid changes in conditions are possible.
In the face of the threat of tropical rain, it is strongly advisable to move on foot through the desert area.
Abundant rainstorms can turn canyons into rushing rivers, and thunderstorms will cause local drifting winds and dust movement.
Coming than it will bring abundant local rainfall on the southern California coast.
It is possible to rain a total height of more than 1.3 cm, which can cause small movements of pollution and danger on the roads.
This would be the first rainfall in the region.
Transient tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona on late Sunday and early Monday. On Monday afternoon and on Tuesday, rainfall will occur in more areas.
On Tuesday, heavy rainfall will reach the Four Corners region in the western part of the United States and continue until Wednesday.
In October, with cooling in the Arctic region, temperature fluctuations may occur throughout the United States, but in the intervertebral zone it will be rather warm.
This can lead to rapid changes in temperature over short distances.
A good example is Sunday temperature differences in the central part of the United States.
Between Kansas City (Missouri) and Omaha (Nebraska) and between St. Louis (Missouri) and Des Moines (Iowa) these differences are almost 10 degrees Celsius.
In the coming days, sustained summer temperatures may rise again.
Much of the central and eastern United States is expected to warm in early October. Temperatures should range from 26 to 32 degrees Celsius in the area from the southern part of the Great Plains to the part of the North East.
On Tuesday in New York, the temperature can reach up to 27 degrees Celsius, which is about 5 degrees above the average.
Long-term climate forecasts indicate a high likelihood of above-average temperatures in the east of the United States in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh’s audition
More than 20 million people watched in six television stations the Thursday hearing of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh and Christina Blasey Ford, a woman who accused a lawyer of sexual harassment taking place in the 1980s.
Despite the ongoing political impasse on Friday, commentators had to interrupt regular broadcasts to report a sudden return: an agreement proposed by Senator Jeff Flake that the FBI would conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Christine Blasey Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100% sure that Kavanaugh had mutilated her in a state of insanity and tried to take off her clothes at a high school party.
In his emotional testimony, Kavanaugh said he was convinced that the situation had not happened.
It is possible that the number of viewers on Friday was even greater than Nielsen’s 20.4 million.
The company counted the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
However, no figures were available for other stations, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen usually has difficulty measuring audiences among people in the workplace.
The number is similar to the viewership of American football cup competitions or the awards of the American Film Academy.
According to reports by Nielsen, Fox News Channel, whose presenters strongly supported Kavanaugh’s nomination, had the highest audience. It averaged 5.69 million viewers during the whole day’s audition.
In second place was the ABC station with 3.26 million spectators.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN 2.52 million.
The interest in the subject remained high after the hearing.
Jeff Flake has become a key figure in Friday's events.
In the mornings, he was captured by CNN and CBS cameras after the office of this moderate Republican issued a statement that he decided to support Kavanaugh’s nomination. In the video, he yells at the protesters who have made it difficult for him to enter the elevator on the way to the court hearings.
Flake with his head lowered for a few minutes listened to unfavorable opinions. The entire event was broadcast on CNN.
“I stand here in front of you and ask.
Do you think he's telling the people the truth?
You have strength in the face of so many women’s impotence,” he heard from the demonstrator.
Before closing the elevator door, Jeff Flake said his office had issued a statement and that he would make a statement during the committee’s hearing.
Later, television stations continued to broadcast the events pending a vote to pass Kavanaugh's nomination before the entire Senate.
Flake said he would support the nomination only if he knew the FBI would investigate the charges next week, which was insisted by a minority of Democrats.
Flake was partly persuaded to talk to his friend, Senator Chris Coons of the Democratic Party.
Flake made the decision after meeting with Chris Coons and several other senators.
Flake's election was important because Republicans would not have the votes needed to approve Brett Kavanaugh's nomination without an investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the allegations against Brett Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Theresa May accuses critics of using Brexit for their own benefit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union of playing the future of Britain and undermining the national interest.
Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham (UK), September 29, 2018.
In another interview with Theresa May, the former foreign minister in her government, Boris Johnson, attacked the plan for future relations with the European Union in the wake of Brexit, according to which the UK and the EU could levy tariffs on their behalf, calling it “completely insane.”
Wayde Sims Shooting: Police Arrest Dyteon Simpson Suspected of Murdering LSU Player
Police have arrested the suspect in connection with the fatal shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player appearing in the colors of the University of Louisiana (LSU).
According to reports, 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested and detained in Baton Rouge on second-degree murder charges.
The authorities published a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police reported that Sims had lost his glasses during the fight.
According to the CBS-related WAFB station, police officers found the glasses at the scene and found traces of Simpson’s DNA on them.
The police reported after the Simpsons interrogation that he confessed to the shooting of Wayde.
According to the lawyer of the detainee, the amount of the bail was fixed at $350,000.
On Friday, the East Baton Rouge coroner's office released a preliminary report that said the cause of death was a head and neck gunshot wound.
The police command thanked the Louisiana State Police Search Group, the State Police Forensic Laboratory, Southern University Police and nearby residents for their assistance in the investigation leading to the arrest.
Joe Alleva, LSU’s Sports Director, thanked the local law enforcement authorities for “the hard work and pursuit of justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
Measuring 198 cm, the man grew up in Baton Rouge. His father Wayne Sims also played basketball at LSU.
In his last season, he averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 points per game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "smashed" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
“It’s one of those things we’re constantly afraid of,” Will Wade said.
The ash emitted by the volcano reaches the city of Mexico
The ash extracted from the Popocatépetl volcano has reached the southern districts of the capital of Mexico.
On Saturday, Mexico’s National Disaster Prevention Center advised residents to approach the volcano due to increased activity in the crater and 183 cases of gas and ash emissions over a 24-hour period.
The center has recorded numerous sneezes and shocks.
Pictures posted on social media show the windshields of cars covered with a thin layer of ash in Mexico’s neighborhoods, such as Xochimilco.
Since the 7.1-magnitude earthquake that hit Mexico in September 2017, geophysicists have seen an increase in the activity of a volcano located 72 km southeast of the country's capital.
The volcano, also known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of independence referendum
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona as a result of clashes between protesters supporting the independence of Catalonia and police preventive units. On that day, thousands of people took part in hostile demonstrations commemorating the first anniversary of an extreme emotion of the referendum on secession.
A group of disguised supporters of the separation spilled eggs and powder paint on police officers. Dark clouds of dust swept the streets usually full of tourists.
The clashes also occurred later in the day. To stop the fighting, police forces used a baton.
For several hours, the independence groups chanted "We do not forget, we do not forgive". Opponents of the secession shouted "Long live Spain".
According to the local press, fourteen people received medical assistance in connection with minor injuries reported during the protests.
A year after the referendum on 1 October, the tension has not weakened. Although the authorities in Madrid have considered it illegal, it is still a reason to celebrate for the Catalans who want to secede.
Voters overwhelmingly voted for independence, but the attendance was low due to the widespread boycott of opponents.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly a thousand people were injured last year in brutal clashes with police trying to prevent voting in polling stations.
On Friday evening, a group of supporters of the region's independence decided to prevent a demonstration supporting the police.
The demonstration took place despite this, but a change of route was forced.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician and his wife taking part in a separatist protest, said there was no hope for Catalonia's independence.
“Last year we experienced some of the most beautiful moments of our lives.
My parents were crying with joy that they could vote. But now we are stuck in a point of no way out," he said.
Despite a significant but small victory in the local elections in December last year, the parties supporting Catalonia's secession have difficulty in continuing their actions. Many of the most recognized leaders have decided to leave the country with a non-arrest report or are awaiting a trial in connection with the arrest.
Joan Puig, a forty-two-year-old mechanic recording a phone call to support police, said politicians on both sides of the dispute were fueling the conflict.
“The situation is getting more and more tense,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders detained since the end of last year, announced his desire to run in next year's European Parliament elections.
“Candidating to the European Parliament is the best way to condemn the crisis of the democratic values of the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Men Arrested After Entering the House by Car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested in the wake of a multiple car crash in a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at around 7:30 p.m. British Time (BST).
Commissioner of Investigation Bob Blemmings said the damage covered the gate and the building.
At some point, a bullet could also be fired at the car.
Mengi's goal ensures Livingston win over Rangers 1:0
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston brought the team victory
Livingston, who has played in the extra-class since this season, has put the Rangers in shock, giving Steven Gerrard a second defeat in his 18 games as coach of the Ibrox Park club.
Dolly Menga's goal turned out to be a win, and Gary Holt's team moved to second place in the table with Hibernian.
The team led by Gerrard is out of the Premiership this season without a win. Next Sunday, the team will face the leader of Hearts, to whom he loses eight points.
Earlier, because on Thursday, the Rangers will host the Rapid Vienna team as part of the UEFA Europa League competitions.
Livingston is extending the series of wins in his division to six games. Coach Holt has not been a failure since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston missed a few opportunities against undisputed opponents
The team led by Holt should have taken the lead much earlier, as the team's game has caused a lot of problems for the Rangers.
First, Scott Robinson punched through the defense and fired a shot into the goal light, but he failed to score a goal. Then Alan Lithgow did not hit after taking over Craig Halkett's head.
The hosts allowed the Rangers to play closer to the goal, knowing that they could threaten their rivals during regular snippets of the game.
And that’s how the deciding goal fell.
After the Rangers' free throw, the Livingston team found an opportunity. Declan Gallagher and Robinson jointly created the situation of Mendze, who scored a goal from the middle of the penalty area.
At this stage, the Rangers had more possessions, but they were unable to push the defense of the host and did not cause any major problems to goalkeeper Liam Kelly.
The scheme was repeated in the second half. Alfredo Morelos gave one shot at Kelly's goal.
Scott Pittman's attempt was defended by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgow failed to hit the goal from another permanent snippet set for Livingston.
The Rangers continued the attacks in the Livingston penalty area, but could not take advantage of the situation. They demanded two penalty shots after Halkett's intervention against Glenn Middleton and one hand play. In both cases, however, the players' claims were rejected.
Livingston’s “Fenomenal” Performance – Analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland in Almondvale Park
Great performance and result for Livingston.
He said they played well and once again went beyond their expectations.
Their style and composition have hardly changed since their return to the extra class, but Holt should be appreciated for motivating the team to play.
The game had many heroes.
Captain Craig Halkett played a huge role in leading a well-organized defense, while Menga made Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall have to be very careful throughout the game.
The Rangers lacked the will to fight.
Although they have great moments under the leadership of Gerrard, they did not maintain their standards in this game.
Something seemed to be missing in their game: only once managed to break through the defense of the host. This should be a serious warning to the Rangers, who found themselves in the middle of the table.
Mixed reactions to Erdogan's visit to Cologne
During a breakfast in Berlin on Saturday (September 29th), the leaders of Turkey and Germany were accompanied by smiles and beautiful weather.
This was the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which aimed to improve relations between NATO allies.
Differences have led to disputes on issues such as human rights, press freedom and Turkey’s accession to the European Union.
After the meeting, Erdogan went to Cologne, where he opened a new, huge mosque.
The city has the largest number of Turks outside its homeland.
According to police, for security reasons, a crowd of 25,000 gathered in front of the temple, but supporters of the president gathered in the area to see their leader.
Hundreds of opponents of Erdogan – including many Kurds – also decided to express their opinion, condemning the policy of the Turkish leader and the German government’s decision to adopt a policy in the country.
The opposing protests reflect the divisions aroused by the visit of a politician who was hailed as a hero by some of the Turks living in Germany and considered an autocrat by others.
Road accident in Deptford: a cyclist died as a result of a car crash
A cyclist was killed in a car crash in London.
The accident occurred near a crowded junction of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street in Deptford, the southeastern part of the city, around 10:15 BST.
After the incident, the driver stopped the vehicle, and medical rescuers arrived at the scene. Despite the intervention, the man died at the scene of the accident.
A few months ago, another fatal accident occurred on Childers Street (about a mile from the scene of Saturday’s accident) in which a cyclist fled the scene.
The Metropolitan Police said the officers were working to identify the deceased man and to inform the family members of the incident.
Roads were closed and bus tours were organized, and drivers were advised to avoid the nearby area.
Long Lartin Penitentiary: Six officers sustained injuries as a result of riots
According to the authorities of the facility, six officers were injured as a result of riots in a criminal facility for men with an elevated level of security.
The riots at the HMP Long Lartin penal facility in Worcestershire began around 9:30 a.m. on Sunday and are still ongoing.
To the riots involving eight prisoners in one of the wings of the plant was called the specialized unit "Tornado".
Officers on the scene sustained minor facial injuries.
A spokesman for the facility said: “Specially trained personnel were involved in the action at the HMP Long Lartin penal facility.
Six of the officers sustained minor injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our facilities. We are convinced that those responsible will be handed over to the police and can spend more time in prison."
The HMP Long Lartin prison has more than 500 prisoners, including one of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
According to reports in June, the director of the facility had to go to the hospital after being attacked by one of the prisoners.
In October last year, preventive forces were called to the plant because of the dangerous riots, in which employees were attacked with billiard balls.
Sudden floods caused by Hurricane Rosa threaten Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (possible beneficial impact on drought-affected areas)
Rarely does tropical depression reach the state of Arizona. This is likely to happen at the beginning of next week. The remains of Hurricane Rosa move through the desert areas of the Southwest, posing a threat of sudden flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued a warning about the possibility of emergency flooding on Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including in cities such as Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
According to forecasts, Rosa will pass directly over Phoenix on Tuesday, with rain starting on Monday afternoon.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix reported via Twitter that “since 1950, only ten tropical cyclones have maintained the state of storm or tropical depression at a distance of 320 km from Phoenix.
Hurricane Katrina (in 1967) approached 65 km from the Arizona border.
The latest National Hurricane Center models predict rainfall from 5 to 10 cm tall. In some areas of Mogollon Rim, Arizona, it can reach up to 15 cm tall.
In other desert areas of the Southwest – including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Plain – precipitation is likely to be between 2.5 and 5 cm, and in some areas up to 10 cm.
For people outside areas at risk of sudden flooding, the rainfall associated with Hurricane Rosa can bring relief as the region has been struggling with drought for some time.
Although flooding poses a serious threat, some of the precipitation will improve the situation in the Southwest, where the state of drought prevails.
According to weather.com, the U.S. Drought Monitor estimates that nearly 40% of Arizona’s area is struggling with severe droughts belonging to the second-highest category.
Hurricane Rosa will first reach the California Peninsula in Mexico.
On Sunday morning, Rosa continued to move with the force of the hurricane, reaching speeds of up to 137 km/h. It is currently located at a distance of 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and is heading north at a speed of 19 km/h.
The hurricane encounters the cooler waters of the Pacific Ocean, causing it to weaken.
It is predicted to hit Mexico with a tropical storm force on Monday afternoon or evening.
Intense rainfall in some parts of Mexico can pose a great flood risk.
Weather.com reported that “the area from the California Peninsula to the northwestern part of Sonora is expected to be between 7 and 15 cm tall, although it can reach 25 cm.”
Then Hurricane Rosa will pass through Mexico in the northern direction in the form of a tropical storm. On Tuesday, in the early morning hours, it will reach the Arizona state border as a tropical depression. By Tuesday evening, it will migrate to the southern part of the state of Utah.
“The most serious threat posed by Hurricane Rosa or its remnants is very abundant rainfall on the California Peninsula, in the northwestern part of Sonora, and in the southwestern desert areas of the United States,” the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
Rainfall is predicted to cause life-threatening sudden floods and the movement of pollutants in the desert and mud avalanches in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Arrested for Attempted Murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on charges of attempted murder of a 16-year-old found with stab wounds in Somerset County.
The boy was found in the Excelsior Terrace, in the town of Midsomer Norton, on Saturday, around 4:00 British Time (BST).
The victim was taken to the hospital and her condition remains “stable”.
Police in Avon and Somerset said one 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested in the Radstock area last night.
Officers ask to contact all persons who have footage of the event.
Trump Says Brett Kavanaugh "Recognized the Uglyness and Anger" of Democratic Party
“The vote given to Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the implacable and outrageous conduct of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had "recognised the uglyness and anger" of the Democratic Party during the nomination process.
On Thursday, Brett Kavanaugh testified before Congress. He firmly and emotionally denied the charges of Christina Blasey Ford. The woman claims that a few decades ago, when they were both teenagers, a man committed sexual assault against her.
Ford also testified during the hearing on the allegations she made.
On Saturday, the president said that on that day “Americans could see the brilliance, class, and courage” of Kavanaugh.
“The vote cast on Judge Kavanaugh is the voice of one of the most eminent lawyers of our time, a law expert with great merits for the community,” he told a crowd of supporters at a courthouse in West Virginia.
The president did not directly refer to the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh, discussing the importance of Republican participation in the presidential election.
“We are five weeks apart from the most important choices in our lives.
I don’t run in these elections, but I remain very active,” he said.
“I’m always fighting to defend our great candidates.”
Trump says Democrats are pursuing a “resistance and obstruction” policy.
As one of the assistants to an important Republican Party politician told CNN, the first key Senate vote on Kavanaugh’s nomination is expected no later than Friday.
Hundreds of victims of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia. The number of victims is increasing
Authorities said at least 384 people were killed, many of them abducted by high waves crashing onto beaches, following a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit Indonesia's Sulawesi island.
On Friday, hundreds of people gathered on the beach in Palu to take part in a festival held in the city. At dusk, waves reaching as high as 6 meters hit the shore, kidnapping many people and destroying everything in their way.
The tsunami was the result of a 7.5-degree earthquake.
“When the threat appeared yesterday, the people on the beach did not flee immediately and were victims of the tsunami,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the Indonesian BNPD Natural Disasters Agency, told a conference in Jakarta.
"The tsunami attacked everything on its way, kidnapping cars, logs and houses," Nugroho reported. He added that before reaching the coastline, the element was moving at sea speeds of 800 km/h.
As he said, some of them survived by climbing trees.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
In aerial photographs published by the disaster agency, you can see many damaged homes and shops, damaged and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the coastal city was hit by secondary shocks.
In the area inhabited by 2.4 million people, a number of earthquakes occurred.
According to the Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Use of Technology (BPPT), the energy released by the massive Friday earthquake was about two hundred times the energy of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The statement stated that the geographical location of the city, which is located at the end of a long, narrow bay, could have exacerbated the effects of the tsunami.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho described the damage as “significant” and said hundreds of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
He added that the bodies of some of the victims were found under the collapsed buildings, 540 people were injured and 29 people were reported missing.
Nugroho said the casualties and damage could be greater along the coastline 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which was closer to the earthquake's epicenter.
According to Nugroho, the communication "has been completely paralyzed", so there are no reports from Donggala province.
“There are more than 300,000 people living there” – it can be read in the statement of the Red Cross. It was also added that employees and volunteers of the organization go to places affected by the disaster.
"We can already talk about the tragedy, although the situation can deteriorate considerably," the statement said.
On Saturday, the agency faced widespread criticism due to the lack of information about the tsunami in Palu, but authorities said the waves came shortly after the warning was issued.
An amateur video posted on social media shows a man screaming from the building, trying to warn people on the street of the upcoming tsunami.
Within minutes, the water wall collapsed over the shore, seizing buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to immediately confirm the authenticity of the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused significant shortages in electricity supply, preventing communication within Palu, which in turn made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue operations.
According to authorities, the military has started sending transport aircraft with assistance from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuated people still need food and other basic first aid supplies.
The airport located in the city is only open for humanitarian transport. The airport will remain inactive until October.
On Sunday, President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit the centers for people evacuated in Palu.
More than 800 victims of the tsunami in Indonesia.
The situation is very bad.
As reported by Doseba T. Sinay, the national director of World Vision, the staff of the organization safely reached the city of Palu from Donggala province and found shelter in tents made of tarpaulin placed in the courtyard of the office.
“They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses,” he said.
The situation is very bad.
While some groups are slowly starting to carry aid, there have been voices of criticism that foreign aid workers with rich experience are being prevented from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian law, the reception of funding, resources and personnel from abroad can only begin after the disaster site has been declared a national disaster area.
This has not been done yet.
“We are officially still dealing with a regional disaster,” a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross said.
“When the government recognizes that a national disaster has occurred, we will be able to start accepting international aid, but this has not yet happened.”
Two days after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami in Palu, friends and family of the missing still hope that their loved ones will somehow find themselves amidst the destruction.
A little boy was pulled out of the canals on Saturday.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who spent two days under the rubble next to her mother’s body.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian paragliding team, has trained two missing paragliders to compete in this month’s Asian Games in Indonesia.
According to Petra Mandagi, the other people trapped in the Roa Roa hotel were his students.
“As an experienced paraglider, I struggle with my own emotional weight,” he said.
Gendon Subandono said that within hours of the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel appearing among paragliders, he was desperate to send messages via WhatsApp to athletes participating in the beach festival.
His messages were marked with only one gray hook instead of a pair of blue hooks.
“I think it means that the news has not been delivered,” he said.
Thieves Steal $26,750 While Filling ATM Cash at Newport on the Levee Mall
According to a statement from the Newport police command, the thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink employee on Friday morning, who was replenishing cash at an ATM in the Newport on the Levee mall.
“The driver of the car was emptying the ATM in the entertainment complex and preparing to replenish the cash,” Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a statement.
Another man “ruled from behind to a Brink employee” and stole an ATM money bag.
According to the statement, witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but police did not specify how many people were involved in the theft.
All persons with information about the identity of the thieves are requested to contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changes name to Ye
Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
Announcing his intention on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote about himself: “A person previously known as Kanye West.”
The forty-one-year-old musician has been using the pseudonym Ye for some time. This is also the title of his eighth album released in June.
The change took place before his visit to Saturday Night Live. The artist is expected to present his new album Yandhi during the performance.
He will replace singer Ariana Grande, who is said to have given up her role “for emotional reasons.”
West had previously stated that the word “Ye” is not only an abbreviation of his current artistic nickname, but has a religious meaning.
“I think ‘ye’ is the most commonly used word in the Bible. In the Bible, it means ‘you’,” West said earlier in the year, discussing the title of the album with a radio presenter on the pseudonym Big Boy.
“I am you, I am us, it’s about us.
First I was Kanye, which means the only person. Now I am Ye – a reflection of all our good, bad and confused qualities.
The album shows who we are.”
West was among the other famous rappers who decided to change their name.
Sean Combs, known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, announced this year that he wanted to be called Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, a former colleague of West, also wrote his pseudonym in various ways, with a connector, without a connector, and in capital letters.
Mexican President-elect Andrés Manuel López Obrador pledges not to use military against civilians
On the eve of the 50th anniversary of the bloody suppression of student demonstrations, Mexican President-elect Andrés Manuel López Obrador (AMLO) pledged never to use the military against civilians.
On Saturday, in the Plaza de las Tres Culturas, López Obrador promised “never to use the military to repress the Mexican people.”
On October 2, 1968, soldiers opened fire on the square in the direction of a peaceful demonstration, killing up to 300 people. The event occurred at a time when leftist student movements began to develop throughout Latin America.
López Obrador has pledged to support young people in Mexico by providing monthly financial support to learners, as well as creating more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are pushing young people towards criminal groups.
The U.S. should double funding for artificial intelligence research
According to Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and AI expert working for Google, Microsoft and Apple, as China’s activity in this area increases, the United States should double its spending on AI research.
The remark is related to the AI announcements made by various U.S. government agencies, even though the U.S. does not have an official strategy on AI.
Meanwhile, last year, China presented its plan to become the most innovative country in the field of artificial intelligence by 2030.
“To begin with, we need to double the research budget on AI: all other countries are far behind the United States, and we are trying to make another breakthrough in this area,” Kai-Fu Lee said.
In an interview with CNBC this week, he also said that doubling the funds could double the chances of making another breakthrough in the area of artificial intelligence in the United States.
Lee, whose book titled “AI Superpowers of China: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by the publisher Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the president of the company’s subsidiary, SinoVision.
In the 1980s, Kai-Fu Lee worked at Carnegie Mellon University to create an AI system that defeated the then-best American player in the Othello game. He then held a senior position at Microsoft Research and was president of the Chinese Google division.
Lee acknowledged the success of earlier U.S. government technology initiatives, such as the Advanced Research Projects in the Defense Area (DARPA) competition for the most interesting robot projects. He also asked about the date of the next edition of the competition.
As Kai-Fu Lee said, scientists in the United States often have to work hard to get government subsidies.
“It’s not China that takes away the best academics from us, it’s corporations,” Lee said.
For several years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired prominent scientists to work on artificial intelligence.
According to Lee, changes in immigration policy could also help the United States in the development of AI.
"I believe that people with AI who have obtained a doctorate should automatically be granted a green card," he said.
In July 2017, the Chinese State Council published a plan for the creation of the next generation of artificial intelligence.
As noted by Lee, the National Natural Science Foundation of China provides funding to members of academic institutions in a manner similar to the U.S. National Science Foundation and other governmental organizations granting funds to U.S. scientists. The quality of the activities of the academies is unprecedented.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense set up a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center to engage partners from industry and science, while the White House announced the creation of a special committee on artificial intelligence (Artificial Intelligence Committee).
This month, DARPA also announced a $2 billion donation to the AI Next initiative.
The National Science Foundation currently invests more than $100 billion annually in AI research.
At the same time, the U.S. initiative to create a national commission for artificial intelligence security has not shaken a step forward for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change the name of their country
On Sunday, Macedonians voted in a referendum to change the name of their country to the Republic of North Macedonia, which would allow to resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece, which blocks the country's efforts to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, on the territory of which the historic country of Macedonia is located, maintains that the name of the northern neighbor constitutes a claim to its territory. Therefore, it vetoed the country's accession to the EU and NATO.
In June, the governments of both countries reached an agreement on naming, but nationalists argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority residing in Macedonia.
President <0xC7><0xB4>orge Ivanov said he would not take part in the vote. A campaign to encourage boycott has raised doubts as to whether attendance will reach the minimum level of 50% required for the referendum to be considered binding.
The referendum asked the following question: “Do you support joining NATO and the EU following the adoption of the agreement with Greece?”
Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is worth paying the price for the possibility of Macedonia – one of the countries formed after the fall of Yugoslavia – joining organizations such as the European Union or NATO.
“I voted in favour of the future of my country so that young Macedonians can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union. Membership in the EU will ensure greater security for all of us,” said 79-year-old Olivera Georgiewska from Skopje.
Although the referendum is not legally binding, a sufficient number of MPs have declared that they will respect the results of the vote.
The change of name requires the support of two-thirds of Members of Parliament.
The State Election Commission said no unusual incidents had been reported until 1 p.m.
However, the attendance at that time was only 16% compared to 34% in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66% of the eligible voters voted.
“I voted because of my children. Our place is in Europe,” said 62-year-old <0xC7><0xB4>osze Tanewski, a voter from Skopje.
On September 30, 2018, in the Macedonian city of Strumica, Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Duszko voted in a referendum on changing the country’s name to pave the way for membership in NATO and the European Union.
In front of the parliament building in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kawardarkov prepared a small scene and placed chairs in front of tents laid out by people boycotting the referendum.
“We support membership in NATO and the EU, but we want to join these organizations with our heads up, not the back door,” Kawardarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they don’t want us as Macedonia, we can turn to other countries, such as China or Russia, and become part of Eurasian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaew says NATO membership will bring the necessary investments to Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is over 20%.
“I believe that the vast majority will support the name change in the referendum, because 80% of citizens support the European Union and NATO,” Zaev said.
He said that voting “yes” is a “confirmation of our future.”
In a poll published last Monday by the Macedonian public research institute, 30 to 43% of voters said they wanted to participate in the referendum. This is less than the required attendance.
According to another survey conducted by Macedonian TV, Telma TV plans to vote in a referendum on Sunday by 57% of respondents.
70% of respondents said they would support the name change.
In order for the vote to be successful, the attendance must be 50% + 1 vote.
The failure of the referendum would be the first major blow to the pro-Western government’s policy since it took power in May last year.
See: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero beats all of Brighton's defense and scores a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling returned home from Brighton in a 2-0 draw for Manchester City on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
The goal scored by Aguera in the 65th minute looked childishly easy.
The action began with the midfielder being turned over to the Argentine striker.
The player has overtaken three Brighton defenders.
Then Aguero was among the four players of Brighton.
First, he hit one of them, then beat the others and found himself on the edge of the Brighton penalty area.
Then he played the ball to the left, where Sterling was waiting for it.
The English forward immediately handed the ball back to Aguera in the penalty area, which defeated Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan by shooting on the right side of the goal.
“Aguero is struggling with a foot injury,” Manchester City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We talked about the possibility of playing 55, 60 minutes.
And that's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored a goal at the time.”
However, it was Sterling who secured the blue first lead in the Premier League.
The goal was scored in the 29th minute.
In this action Aguero received the ball deep in the middle of Brighton.
He sent a wonderful pass along the left side of the pitch to Leroy Sane.
Sane made several moves, allowing Sterling to move to distant poles.
Manchester City striker pointed the ball at the grid just before it hit the car.
Manchester City will face Hoffenheim in the group stage of the UEFA Champions League on Tuesday at 12:55 a.m. The match will take place at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena stadium in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to spoil the chances of winning the Rockies
After losing the playoffs to Washington Nationals, Scherzer did not have to appear in the first line-up.
However, the rival Scherzer hopes to play in Sunday's game against the Colorado Rockies, as long as the Rockies keep their chances in the play-offs. Currently, the team has one more win than the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West division.
The Rockies can count on at least a wild card if they win a Friday match against the Nationals with a score of 5:2. However, they still want to get their first division champion title.
"Although we're playing 'nothing', at least we'll go out on the pitch, knowing that the atmosphere in Denver and the opponents' performance will be at the highest level, as in the rest of the season.
Why would I not want to participate in this meeting?”
The Nationals have not yet announced a starter for the Sunday meeting, but the team is inclined to show Scherzer in the first team.
This would be Scherzer’s thirty-fourth appearance in the first set. The player took part in Thursday’s throw training and hopes to perform on Sunday.
Washington's right-handed pitcher scored 18-7 and ERA 2.53. He eliminated the batsmen 300 times and scored 220 and 2/3 rounds per season.
So Trump's in West Virginia
Trump did not directly refer to his nomination of Brett Kavanaugh as a Supreme Court judge, discussing the importance of Republican participation in the presidential election.
“In November, we are putting all the achievements so far at risk.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important choices in our lives.
Although I do not start, I remain very active. I constantly defend our wonderful candidates" — he said.
Then he continued: “We are dealing with a terrible group of radical Democrats. We see their actions with our own eyes.
They are determined to seize power by all means possible, they are vile and malicious.
They don’t care who they hurt or who they have to hurt to gain power and control. Taking power and control is their goal, but we will not give it to them.”
As he said, the Democrats are carrying out the mission of “resisting and hindering activities.”
“It has been very good to see this in the last four days,” he said, calling Democrats “bad, malicious, unpleasant and untrue.”
The president referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee, recalling on behalf of Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, which met with a loud outcry on the part of the crowd.
“Do you remember her answer?
Are you responsible for leaking the document?
“Oh, are you listening?
No... I mean... no." Her body language was fatal. It was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a group of people with different views.
The party is intolerant of those who express their opinions.
When the activists of Momentum in my party voted for me to be reprimanded, I was not surprised.
After all, I am a member of a group of Labour Members who have recently been told that they are not welcome, all because of their own opinions.
My parliamentary colleague, Joan Ryan, was treated similarly because she opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, the reprimand was due to a difference of opinion between me and Jeremy Corbyn.
The differences concerned the importance of responsible economic policy, national security and Europe. Ironically, Jeremy Corbyn opposed the position of previous leaders on these issues.
In the announcement on Friday of the Labour Party’s meeting in Nottingham East County, it was read: “We want the meetings to be open and productive.”
During my eight years as a member of the Labour Party, most of the Friday afternoon meetings of the General Committee looked like this.
Unfortunately, many meetings are going differently now, and the promise of a "more cordial and gentler" policy has long been forgotten, as far as it has ever been remembered.
It is becoming increasingly clear that the Labour Party does not tolerate different views. Each opinion is assessed in terms of compliance with the party leadership.
It all started shortly after Jeremy Corbyn took office as EU President, and my colleagues, who seemed to me to have similar views, began to expect me to change my direction and to take positions that I would not have agreed with before.
After every public speech – regardless of the content – I meet on social media with attacks calling for the withdrawal of nominations, the condemnation of centrism or the departure of the Labour Party.
It's not just my experience.
I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments addressed to me are rather political in nature.
I admire the professionalism and determination of colleagues who experience daily treatment in a sexist or racist way, but do not avoid further action.
One of the most disappointing aspects of the current policy is the transition to the agenda with insults to others.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said the Labour Party should support a culture of tolerance.
In fact, we are no longer a group of people with different views. With every request for a “vote of distrust” and every change in the rules of choice, the party’s worldview is narrowed down.
Over the past two years, I have been repeatedly advised not to lean over and keep silent on certain issues. Then everything “would be okay”.
That’s not why I was involved in politics.
Since joining the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student as a result of the negligence of the Margaret Thatcher government that led to the disintegration of my school class, I have been trying to provide better public services for those in need – both as a local councillor and a minister.
I never hid my beliefs, even during the last election campaign.
Everyone in Nottingham East knew my position and they knew about differences of opinion with the party authorities.
To those who supported Friday’s proposal, I would like to say that I cannot understand the willingness to waste time and energy on the issue of my loyalty to the Labour leader in the face of an impending Brexit that will harm households, businesses and public services.
However, the most important message I am sending is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents (both Labour Party members and others): I am proud to be able to serve you. I promise that no threat of revocation of the nomination or the most opportune political goals of overcoming your best interests will discourage me from doing anything.
Chris Leslie is an MP from Nottingham East.
Ayr vs Melrose 38:17 – unbeaten Ayr back up
Two late fixtures may have somewhat distorted the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win this extremely interesting Scottish extraliga match.
The team ranked first in the table and remains the only undefeated team.
In the end, this outstanding defense and better use of opportunities led the host team to the victory. Coach Peter Murchie could be pleased with his supporters.
"The games so far have been a challenge for us, but we are still unbeaten, so I'm happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of the Melrose team said: “We have to respect Ayr players, they have taken better advantage of the opportunities that are emerging from us.”
Ayr went on to lead in the 14th minute following Grant Anderson's beating and Frazier Clima's promotion. However, a yellow card for Scot Rory Hughes, who came to the team with the Glasgow Warriors, allowed Melrose to equalize the score when Jason Baggot caught a slap in the ball.
Climo increased Ayr’s lead after kicking off the penalty kick just before the end of the first half. He first took the lead, and then took the chance to raise, scoring 17:5 for Ayr.
Melrose started the second half well. Patrick Anderson's addition raised by Baggot reduced the loss to five points.
There was then a prolonged suspension of the game due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott. The player was removed from the field on the berths. After resuming Ayr increased the lead after the addition of Stafford McDowall and the elevation of Clima.
Afterwards, team captain Ayr Blair Macpherson received a yellow card, and Melrose re-used his number: an unused attempt to raise Bruce Colvin reduced the lead.
The hosts took the initiative when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for knocking down Clima without a ball. MacPherson got a slap on the back of the approaching defense.
Climo took advantage of the opportunity to raise, then again managed to raise the score shortly after the game resumed, when Kyle Rowe caught a penalty shot and enabled wingman Gregor Henry to win the fifth inning for the host.
The star of the series Still Game starts a career in the gastronomy industry
Ford Kieran, the star of the Still Game series, seems to be starting a business in the catering industry. It has recently been discovered that he has become the director of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC sitcom. He performs and co-creates the series together with his longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the last in the history of the series. Everything indicates that Ford Kiernan is already planning the future after leaving "Craiglang".
According to official data, he became the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the matter, although the Scottish Sun informant suggested that Kiernan is trying to engage in the "developing gastronomy industry" in Glasgow.
“The sea belongs to us”: Bolivia’s sea-deprived hope that the court will reopen its way to the Pacific
Marines patrol the vicinity of a naval base in La Paz.
There are blue flags flying from public buildings.
In the ports of the Navy from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, the motto appears: “The sea is ours by law.
It is our duty to recover him.”
In Bolivia’s inaccessible sea, the memory of the coastline lost to Chile in the bloody resource conflict of the 19th century is still alive. It’s like dreaming of sailing again in the Pacific Ocean.
Bolivia is awaiting the verdict of the International Court of Justice, which is due to be issued on October 1 after a five-year trial.
“Bolivia’s actions are gaining momentum. Residents are unanimous, optimistic and counting on a favorable verdict,” said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians across the country will watch the meeting of the International Court of Justice together. They hope that the organization based in The Hague will recognize Bolivia’s claim and, after decades of fruitless talks, Chile will have to enter independently into negotiations on granting the state.
Evo Morales, the charismatic Bolivian president who will face a controversial re-election battle next year, also hopes for a verdict on Monday.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he swore at the end of August.
However, some analysts argue that the chances of a favorable verdict for Bolivia are small and that even a favorable decision would not change much.
The United Nations body based in The Hague has no authority to grant Bolivia the territory of Chile. It also has reservations that it will not affect the settlement of any talks.
According to Paz Zárate, a Chilean specialist in international law, the decision of the International Court of Justice will be issued six months after the submission of the final arguments. Such a short time shows that the case “was not complicated”.
Unfortunately, the past four years have allowed Bolivia to move away from its goal.
“The issue of access to the sea has been taken over by the current Bolivian administration,” said Paz Zárate.
Morales’ relentless rhetoric deprived Chileans of any remnants of goodwill, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will resume talks at some point, but this will be very difficult in the face of the situation.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, the former president and representative of Bolivia in The Hague, disagreed with the view that the court’s decision-making process was extremely rapid.
Monday will bring Bolivia “a unique opportunity to begin a new era in relations with Chile” and the possibility of “ending a 139-year period of mutually beneficial disputes,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales — still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents — was using the issue of access to the sea as an element of political play.
“Pallivia will never renounce the right of access to the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
“The verdict is a great opportunity to see that we have to deal with the past.”
North Korean officials say nuclear disarmament will not take place until they can trust the United States.
North Korea’s foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, says his people will never get rid of nuclear weapons until they can trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the U.N. General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to keep the promises made at the Singapore summit between the leaders of the two countries.
His comments came as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be on the verge of resuming suspended nuclear diplomacy more than three months after meeting North Korea’s leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
Ri argues that the “dream” is that the lack of lifting of sanctions and the U.S. opposition to a declaration ending the Korean War ever threw North Korea to its knees.
Washington does not want to agree to sign the declaration without Pyongyang taking concrete steps to disarmament.
Both Kim Jong Un and US President Donald Trump want another meeting.
However, there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is seriously approaching the elimination of the arsenal, which is seen in North Korea as the only security measure.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month in preparation for the second Kim-Trump summit.
Parisian fashion shows announce the appearance of the latest line of big head coverings in clothing stores.
If you want to enlarge your collection of hats or completely cover yourself up from the sun, then we have good information for you.
Fashion designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled a series of crazy, oversized head coverings from their 2019 summer collection, which gleamed with style during the Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely impractical hats climbed on Instagram this summer. The aforementioned designers decided to present their stunning creations on the run.
Valentino’s distinguishing work was a huge beige hat decorated with a wide, feathered round flooding the heads of models.
Other oversized accessories included jeweled watermelons, a wizard’s hat, and even pineapple —but they weren’t designed to warm your head.
Thom Browne also showed a number of strange masks — just in time for Halloween.
Many colorful masks had sewn on the lips and resembled Hannibal Lecter’s style more than haute couture.
One creation resembled diving equipment with a tube and glasses, and the other looked like melted ice.
And if you don't want to break up with big fashion, you're lucky.
Observers of styles predict that huge hats can hit clothing stores.
The oversized hats follow right behind "La Bomba", a straw hat with a width of 61 cm round, which was already worn by everyone — from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The iconic brand behind this extremely impractical hat, which spilled through social media, presented another great creation on the runway — a straw beach bag almost as large as a model wearing it in a swimsuit.
A burnt-out orange raffle bag, finished with raffle fringes and crowned with a white leather handle, was featured in the Jacquemus La Riviera collection for the 2019 summer season during the Paris Fashion Week.
Luke Armitage, the star stylist, told FEMAIL: “I expect big hats and beach bags to appear in stores next summer — because the designer managed to make such a big impact, it would be hard not to exploit the demand for oversized accessories.”
John Edward: Language Skills Necessary for the Citizens of the World
Independent schools in Scotland are continually rejoicing in their scientific achievements – in 2018 they were able to boast of further outstanding exam results, backed by individual and collective successes in sports, art, music and other social endeavors.
Represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), schools attended by more than 30,000 students across Scotland strive to provide the best level of services to students and parents.
Independent schools are designed to prepare students for further and higher education, their chosen career path, and to indicate their role as world citizens.
As an educational sector that has the opportunity to develop and implement a curriculum tailored to the needs of the school, we see that modern languages are still popular and desirable subjects to choose from in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If you speak to another person in a language that he understands, it goes to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, it goes to his heart.”
This is a clear reminder that we cannot rely only on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
The results of the last exam this year show that languages rank first in the league rankings, with the highest proficiency rates occurring for independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages received a higher A grade.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 percent of students received a higher A grade in Mandarin, and 72 percent of German learners, 69 percent of French learners and 63 percent of Spanish learners also received an A grade.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Currently, learning languages as subjects of choice is conducted in the same scope as learning STEM subjects (Strict Sciences, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) as part of curricula in independent schools and elsewhere.
A 2014 survey conducted by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills found that 17 percent of candidates’ lack of language proficiency was due to difficulties in obtaining vacancies from employers.
Therefore, language skills are increasingly becoming a necessity to prepare young people to start a career.
These skills are essential in a globalized world with a growing number of jobs requiring language proficiency.
A lifelong skill, like learning a second language, will provide a huge advantage in the future — regardless of the path of professional development.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically increases the chances of a multilingual person in relation to the competition.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of more than 4,000 British adults, 75% of them could not speak a foreign language well enough to conduct a conversation, and French was the only language with a two-digit, two-digit percentage.
That’s why investing in teaching foreign languages is so important for today’s children.
Knowledge of several languages, in particular the languages of developing economies, will give children a greater chance of finding suitable employment.
In Scotland, each school will be different in terms of the languages it teaches.
Many schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages considered to be the most important for the UK in the 2020 perspective, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of the child’s interests, independent schools will always have many languages to choose from, which will be taught by specialized teaching staff in this area.
Scottish independent schools are committed to creating a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills they need to succeed – no matter what the future holds for them.
Today, there is no denying that in the international business environment, languages are still crucial to the future of the country, so it must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should be regarded as "international communication skills" (international communication skills).
Independent schools will continue to offer Scottish youth a wide choice, diversity and level.
That's just the way it should be.
John Edward, Chairman of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron's debut with the Lakers in San Diego on Sunday.
Fans looking to see LeBron James' debut at the Los Angeles Lakers are finally looking forward.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that LeBron James will play in a Sunday pre-season game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
It is not yet known how many minutes he will play.
“More than one, but less than 48,” Walton said on the Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell said on Twitter that James is likely to play incomplete minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for six pre-season games for the Lakers.
“At this stage of my career, I don’t need to take part in pre-season games to prepare,” he said.
So Trump's election in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is launching a series of election centuries tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of Trump’s five planned election centuries to take place next week, along with stops in places that are friendly to him, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote confirming the suspension of his election to hold a vacancy in the Supreme Court, Trump is striving to build support in the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans may risk losing control of Congress when the votes are cast in November.
What time will Trump’s election in West Virginia take place tonight and where will he be able to be seen on the Internet?
Trump’s election in Wheeling, West Virginia, will take place today at 7:00 p.m., i.e. on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
So Trump’s election in West Virginia will be able to be followed live on the Internet on YouTube.
Trump is likely to speak on this week’s hearings of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh’s nomination, which took place in a tense atmosphere due to allegations of sexual misconduct, as well as the anticipated vote in the Senate.
However, the main goal of this series of election centuries is to provide support to Republicans facing difficult November elections.
President Trump’s five-member campaign next week aims to “mobilize volunteers and supporters to help Republicans protect and expand the majority in the Senate and House of Representatives.”
“Congress control is such an important point in the president’s schedule that as the hottest season of the campaign approaches, he will visit as many states as possible,” Trump’s campaign spokesman said.
Today’s polls at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling may attract supporters from “Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as the attention of the Pittsburgh media” — West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday, Trump will visit West Virginia — a state where he won more than 40 percentage points in 2016 — for the second time in the past month.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia's Senate candidate, Republican Patrick Morrisey, who is losing in polls.
“This is not a good sign for Morrisey when the president comes to support him in the polls,” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. Team Shows Fighting Spirit, Maintaining Hope of Winning Sunday Singles
After three one-sided sessions, the foursome format held on Saturday afternoon could have been what the Ryder Cup needed.
The swing swing swing swing swing swing swing swing swing swing swing swing swing swing swing swing swing swing swing swing swing swing swing swing swing swing swing swing swing swing swing swing swing swing swing swing swing swing swing swing swing swing swing swing swing swing swing
So what does their drive look like at the moment?
“They’ve driven six points, and now they’re only driving four, so I think we’ve got a little speed,” Spieth said.
Europe, of course, leads by four points, while there are twelve more to be won.
Americans, Spieth says, however, feel the wind in the sails and have worthy patterns to follow, especially in the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together throughout the day and each of them could boast of scoring three out of four points.
Spieth is dangerous in all areas and gives an example.
Screaming all over the throat as a sign of excitement became louder throughout the round, sinking the key putt and winning the game as he and Thomas scored two holes in two hits.
His reflection on the ground, which gave them a victory with a score of 15, met with a similar outcry — one that suggests that the American team is still in the game.
“You just have to focus and worry about your own game,” Spieth said.
That’s all that’s left for each of these players.
18 holes to win.
The only players who have scored more points in the last two days than Spieth and Thomas were Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undeniable story of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but charming pair of the European team won four out of four and was not mistaken.
"Moliwood" is the only couple that didn't count bogeys on Saturday afternoons, but also avoided bogeys on Saturday mornings, Friday afternoons and back nine on Friday mornings.
The way they play and how their energy seems to flow both into and out of the noisy crowd proves that these players must be beaten on Sunday, and that there is no better player than Fleetwood or Molinari who could seal the potential victory of the European team at Le Golf National.
It would be better if they played on different holes at the same time.
However, it is too early to talk about the European team’s victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly played Sergio Garcia, the morning fourball hero, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
Bogey and the double double on the front nine dug Spaniards and Swedes into a hole they would never get out of.
On Sunday, there's no one to help get out of the hole.
Fourball and foursome formats are so fascinating due to the interactions between the pairs, the advice they give, the advice they don’t give, and how in one moment a change of strategy can occur.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has taken a significant lead in the last day, but the foursome session also showed that the U.S. team is stuck in a fight that some, especially in the U.S., have doubted.
Europe with a score of 10-6 includes the lead in the final day of the Ryder Cup.
Europe with a significant advantage in the last day of the Ryder Cup after winning with a score of 10-6 Saturday games fourball and foursome against the United States.
The inspired duo—Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari—assumed the lot, bringing two victories over fighting Tiger Woods, increasing their previous score at Le Golf National to four points.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, trying to keep the trophy he lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the insignificant American team in the morning fourball format, winning the series with a score of 3-1.
The United States faced greater resistance in the format of a foursome, winning two games, but were unable to recover the losses.
In order to retain the trophy, Jim Furyk’s team must score eight points out of 12 singles to be played on Sunday.
Fleetwood is the first European debutant to score four points in a row, while along with Molinarim (this band was named "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend) they are just the second pair in Ryder Cup history to score four points in four opening games.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourball format in a magnificent style, they defeated pumped-out Woods and American debutant Bryson Dechambeau, achieving an even more empathetic 5&4 score.
Woods, who had struggled through two Saturday games, occasionally showed a glimpse of genius, but has so far lost 19 of 29 games in fourball and foursome formats, seven in a row.
Justin Rose, not taking part in the morning fourball format, returned to Henrik Stenson in the foursome format to defeat 2&1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, who ranked 1st and 3rd respectively in the world rankings.
The European team, however, did not have everything in mind for this pleasant, cool day on a field to the southwest of Paris.
Three-time main winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a benchmark for the Americans, scoring two points on Saturday.
They defeated Spain’s Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in a fourball 2&1 victory and later returned to defeat Poulter and Rory McIlroy in a foursome 4&3, losing two opening holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history did the team make a four-point loss, starting singles, although Furyk's team would have had only a draw to keep the trophy.
However, taking the second place two days ago, the Sunday counterattack seems rather unlikely.
North Korea says “decisive no” to unilateral disarmament without confidence.
North Korea's foreign minister said on Saturday in a speech at the U.N. that the failure to lift sanctions only deepens North Korea's lack of confidence in the United States and there is no way that the country would unilaterally give up nuclear weapons in such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly that North Korea took “significant measures of goodwill” last year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling a nuclear test site and committing to non-proliferation of weapons and nuclear technology.
“We do not see any concrete response from the United States,” he said.
"Without trust in the United States, there will be no guarantee of our national security and under such circumstances there is no unilateral disarmament of North Korea."
While Ri reiterated North Korea’s well-known complaints about Washington’s reluctance to adopt a “gradual” approach to denuclearization, in which North Korea would be rewarded for taking steps gradually, his statement appeared to be significant, as the denounced one thing.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first ever summit between the incumbent president of the United States and the leader of North Korea, which took place on June 12 in Singapore, when Kim Jong Un pledged to work for the “denuclearity of Korea”.
North Korea expected a formal end to the Korean War (1950–1953), but the U.S. delegation announced that Pyongyang must first give up nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls for the easing of harsh international sanctions against North Korea.
“The United States insists on ‘denuclearization first’ and increases pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal in a coercive manner, even opposing the signing of a ‘war ending declaration,’” Ri said.
“The testimony that sanctions can throw us to our knees is the dream of people who behave ignorantly towards us.
The problem, however, is that the lack of lifting sanctions deepens our mistrust.”
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump, which the U.S. leader spoke about earlier this week at the UN.
Instead, the minister drew attention to three meetings between Kim Jong-un and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, after which he added: “If the party on the issue of denuclearization were South Korea, not the United States, then there would be no such thing.”
Despite this, the tone of Ri's speech was completely different from last year when he said at the UN General Assembly that targeting North Korea's missiles in the United States is inevitable after the "Mr. Evil President" rocket hits Trump.
This year, at the UN forum, Trump, who last year threatened North Korea’s “complete destruction,” praised Kim Jong Un for his courage to take steps toward disarmament, but also said there was still a lot of work to be done, and he also said that until the North’s sanctions are lifted, it will not be backed.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had not set a timeline, saying, “Whether it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Thursday at the UN Security Council that “enforcement of the Security Council sanctions must be continued and ongoing until we establish a complete, final and verified denuclearization.”
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously tightened sanctions against North Korea, trying to stifle funding for Pyongyang’s nuclear program and ballistic missiles.
Pompeo met with Ri outside the UN General Assembly and later said he would return to Pyongyang next month in preparation for the second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit cannot be called a success.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying progress had been made, after which within hours North Korea condemned him for “making gangster demands.”
North Korea pledged this month at a meeting with Moon Jae-in that it would dismantle the missile test site and nuclear facility if the United States takes “appropriate measures.”
He said Kim Jong Un had told him that the "appropriate measures" he cares about were security guarantees, which Trump had pledged to ensure in Singapore, and steps to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students attend a course on adequately long rest periods
A new course at Harvard University, which took place this year, provided all students with more sleep, aimed at combating the growing macho culture of learning by “caffeine-driven full-time students.”
Academic students from the best university in the world often have no idea about the basics of caring for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, has developed a course that he says is the first of its kind in the United States.
To create the course, he was inspired by a speech on the impact of sleep deprivation on science.
“After the speech, a girl came up to me and said, ‘Why are you telling me this only now that I’m in my final year of college?’
She stated that no one had ever told her about the meaning of sleep, which surprised me,” The Telegraph said.
The course, which took place for the first time this year, explains to students how good sleep habits help to achieve good results in learning and sports, as well as improve the overall well-being of students.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the University Health Service, said the course was decided to be introduced after it was found that students suffered from severe sleep deprivation within a week.
The hourly course includes a number of interactive tasks.
One section includes an image of a dormitory room where students click coffee cups, curtains, exercises, and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, and how sleep deficiency affects sports performance, as well as how important it is to maintain regular sleep.
In another section, participants learn how long-term lack of sleep can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of the campus with interactive icons encourages participants to reflect on their daily routine.
“We know that this will not cause an immediate change in the behavior of students.
But we believe they have the right to know — just as everyone has the right to know the health effects of smoking cigarettes,” added Professor Czeisler.
A culture of pride from “whole-night science” still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students means an increasing problem of sleep deprivation.
Providing enough sleep of good quality should be a “secret weapon” for students to fight stress, exhaustion and anxiety, and even avoid weight gain, because lack of sleep causes the brain to go into starvation mode, so the student is constantly hungry — said.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Ceisler develop the course after taking part in one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to push for the introduction of a course for the entire campus.
The next step, according to him, is to ask all postgraduate students to complete a similar degree program before moving to a competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students set an alarm to remind them when to go to sleep and when to get up, and that they be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" emitted by the screens of electronic devices and LED lighting, which can disrupt the daily rhythm and lead to a problem.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga takes Gerrard's team
The Rangers once again suffered during a fight on the exit at Livingston when Dolly Menga led to the defeat of the disbanded team of Steven Gerrard, scoring 1-0.
The team from Ibrox Stadium wanted to record their first win since the February 4–1 triumph over St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team defeated Gerrard for the second time in 18 games, creating an eight-point difference for his team compared to the leader Ladbrokes Premiership — Hearts.
Menga scored the goal seven minutes before the end of the first half, and the Rangers’ lack of commitment did not seem to improve.
While the Rangers recorded a drop to sixth place, Livingston climbed to third — just behind the Hibernian with a loss of one goal.
The Rangers team may have further problems with the need to repair the head wound of Linear Judge Calum Spence after he was hit by an object thrown from the guest stand.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team, which allowed Ayr to advance to the Betfred Cup semi-finals.
Holt, in turn, passed with the same eleven Livingston, who took the Hearts team’s point last week, being delighted by the way his well-trained team was tired at every step of their opponents.
The Rangers may have dominated possession of the ball, but it was Livingston who did more with the ball when they got it.
They should have scored in just two minutes, when Menga's first pitch allowed Scott Pittman to face Allan McGregor's goal, but the assistant didn't take his chance.
Keaghan Jacobs then addressed the deep free throw to Captain Craig Halkett, but his teammate Alan Lithgow playing as a defender could only remain in the rear position.
The Rangers regained control in the third quarter, but it looked like they had more hope than faith in their game.
Alfredo Morelos certainly conceded that he owed a penalty kick fifteen minutes before the end of the game when he and Steven Lawless collided, but Judge Steven Thomson settled the Colombian's claim.
The Rangers were only able to give two customs shots in the first half, but the former Ibrox goalkeeper, Liam Kelly, barely worried about Lassana Coulibaly's head and Ovie Ejaria's weak shot.
While Livingston’s 34-minute opening goal may have been against the game, no one can deny that they deserved him for the effort he put into his win.
Again, the Rangers failed to cope with Jacobs' deep, permanent play.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher threw the ball at Scott Robinson, who remained calm, giving to Menga for the simple finish of the action.
Gerrard did not pause and traded Coulibaly for Ryan Kent—this change almost immediately affected the wingman who threw the ball at Morelos, but the impressive Kelly managed to block it, running from his position.
The Livingston team continued to bring guests into the game exactly the way they liked it when Lithgow and Halkett performed long runs one after the other.
Holt’s team could have increased the lead in the last minutes, but McGregor made a good start to Jacobs, after which Lithgow pushed the game away from the corner.
Reserve Rangers Glenn Middleton was hoping for a penalty once again when he got confused with Jacobs, but Thomson turned his eyes again.
Almanac: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now the page of our edition "Sunday Morning" Almanach: September 30, 1882 — 136 years ago... the day on which the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, which eventually led to the creation of a device known as the Geiger counter.
Since then, the Geiger counter has become an element of both science and pop culture, as in the 1950 film Bells of Coronado, in which these seemingly improbable cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans appeared:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: “It’s a Geiger counter that’s used to locate radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you put on these headphones, you will hear the effects of atoms emitted by radioactive minerals.”
Evans: “Now you hear something!”
Hans Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name has survived to this day.

The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize enemy cells as part of treatment.
This method involves isolating immune cells from the patient and changing them in the laboratory.
Then they can “see” a protein common to many cancers, and then they are injected back into the body.
The trial vaccine shows promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
One woman treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize hostile cells was observed to have ovarian cancer gone for more than 18 months.
The method involves isolating immune cells from the patient, changing them in the laboratory so that they can “see” a protein common to many cancers called HER2, and then re-injecting these cells to the patient.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the American National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results indicate that this vaccine works very well.”
HER2 "drives the growth of several types of cancers", including breast, ovarian, lung and colon cancers, Prof. Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach to extracting immune cells from patients and “teaching” them to locate cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a certain type of leukemia.
Kanye West goes on pro-Trump talk show Saturday Night Live — with a MAGA hat on his head.
It didn't go very well.
Kanye West was “swept” into the studio during Saturday Night Live after he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would apply for office in 2020.
After performing his third track titled Ghost Town, during which he wore a cap with the inscription “Make America Great,” he held a rally against the Democrats and again expressed his support for Trump.
“Every time I talk to white people, I hear, ‘How can you like Trump?
“If I were concerned about racism, I would have left America a long time ago,” he said.
The SNL program began with a sketch with Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star ridiculed Brett Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on allegations of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, the video of West was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is not known if Rock wanted to laugh at West by posting a post.
In addition, West complained to the public that behind the scenes he had problems with his hat.
“They took me behind the scenes.
They told me not to go out with that hat on my head.
They've got me!
And then they say I have no way out," he said — Washington Examiner.
West continued, “You’re saying I don’t have a way out?” adding, “I’m going to put on a ‘superman’s cape’ so you won’t be able to tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Let's accept it."
His words twice caused the audience to “shut up” and the members of the SNL team looked embarrassed — reports Variety. The person who was in the studio during these events: “The studio had a grave silence.”
West was invited to the show in place of singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days earlier.
West intrigued many with the performance of I Love It in a bottle of Perrier water.
West received support from the head of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who posted the following tweet: “To one of the most courageous: THANK YOU FOR POWERING THE MAFI.”
Talk show host Karen Hunter said on Twitter that West was “just himself and it’s absolutely wonderful.”
“However, I will NOT reward a person (by buying her music or clothing or supporting her ‘art’) who, I believe, accepts and spreads an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
We are free too,” she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and that he was now "formally named Kanye West".
However, he is not the first artist to change his name — he follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
A friendly rapper, Snoop Dogg, took the name Snoop Lion, and music legend, Prince, changed the name to a symbol, and then to an artist previously known as Prince.
Accused of attempted murder for stabbing in Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after he stabbed a man in a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defendant is scheduled to appear in court in Belfast on Monday.
The allegations will be investigated by the Prosecutor's Office.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington raises the issue of toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow in the medieval HBO series Game of Thrones.
The 31-year-old actor hit the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that showing such roles on the screen often causes young boys to think they have to play hard to be respected.
In an interview with the Sunday Times Culture, Kit stated that “something went wrong” and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his partner from Game of Thrones, 31-year-old actress Rose Leslie, admitted that he felt "quite confident" about the matter.
“Personally, I feel pretty confident at this point — where did we make a mistake on the topic of masculinity?” he said.
“What did we teach men when they were growing up, from the perspective of the problem we are currently facing?”
Kit believes that the development of toxic masculinity may be partly caused by television due to the representation of very masculine characters.
He continued: “What attitudes are innate, and what are learned?
What does he learn in television and on the streets, what makes young boys start to think that they have to stand on a certain side in order to be a man?
I think this is one of the most important issues of our time — what can be done to change this?
It’s clear that not everything is okay with young men.”
In the interview, he also confessed that he will no longer be playing in any prequel or sequel to Game of Thrones after the series ends next year, saying he has "finished battlefields and horses."
Starting in November, Kit will be playing Sam Shepard’s “True West,” which is a story about a film producer and his brother, a thief.
The actor recently revealed that he thinks getting to know his wife Rose is the best thing that ever happened to him in Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife on the set, which assured me of my future family and a new life,” he said.
In this award-winning Emmy-winning fantasy series, Rose starred Ygritte, an object of love interest to a character played by Kit, Jon Snow.
The couple got married in June 2018 at the Leslie family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China registers 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14 percent increase in the number of people living with HIV and suffering from AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected by the problem, as reported by the country’s health services.
Around 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new cases were sexually transmitted, which means a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spreads rapidly in some parts of China as a result of an infected blood transfusion.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been almost completely reduced, according to Chinese health officials at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, year-on-year, the number of people living with HIV and suffering from AIDS in China increased by 100,000.
Sexually transmitted HIV is a serious problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is widespread.
Given the country’s conservative values, the study estimates that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry a woman.
Many cases of transmission of the disease are due to insufficient protection during sex in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has provided universal access to HIV medicines as part of efforts to combat this problem.
Maxine Waters denies that one of her team members disclosed the data of Republican senators — it’s “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theory.”
U.S. House Speaker Maxine Waters on Saturday dismissed allegations that a member of her team had posted the personal data of three Republican senators on the Wikipedia pages of the lawmakers.
A member of the Los Angeles Democratic Party said the allegations were made by experts and websites linked to “ultra-right wings.”
“Lies, lies, and even more vicious lies,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information reportedly included home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch of Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, posted by an unknown person at the Capitol during a Senate panel hearing on allegations of sexual offences against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak occurred some time after three senators challenged Kavanaugh's candidacy.
Conservative parties, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was associated with the Waters office and published information about the Waters team member, according to Hill.
“This unfounded allegation is completely false and it’s a one hundred percent lie,” Waters continued.
“A member of my team – whose identity, personal data and security have been violated as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations – was in no way responsible for leaking this information.
This unfounded allegation is completely false and it is a one hundred percent lie.”
Waters’ statement quickly sparked criticism on the Internet, including from Ari Fleischer, a former White House press spokesman.
“This kind of denial is wrong,” Fleischer wrote.
“This suggests that she doesn’t have the right temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn’t do, they can’t be wrong.
He can't provoke.
It cannot challenge the motives of the defendant.
He has to be calm for that.”
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters’ reaction to Democrat criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of displaying excessive anger during Thursday’s hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate running in the midterm elections to replace Waters, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
“It’s a big deal, if that’s true,” he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said her office had notified “the competent authorities and law enforcement agencies of these fraudulent allegations.”
“The perpetrators will be exposed and held liable for all their actions that pose a threat to any of my team members,” she said.
Johnny English: Nokaut – a spy parody with the weakened Rowan Atkinson
Searching for references to Brexit in every new film with a British thread has become the norm. This seems to apply to the new part of the series of films from the genre of action and comedy "Johnny English", which began in 2003 from the film "Johnny English" and which returned to the screens of the movie "Johnny English".
Will the self-sacrificing satire about how hopeless we are become the country’s new export commodity?
In any case, the eternally astonished, rubber-faced, incompetent Johnny English has once again been granted a license to associate—his name, more than anything else, signals that he is an expanded, comic book intended for non-English-speaking viewers.
He is of course a silly secret agent who, despite his strange preferences for smoothie glamour, has a little bit of Inspector Clouseau, a pinch of Jasio Fasoli and a drop of this guy adding a single note to the tune of the 2012 President’s Chariots of Fire motif at the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games.
In the past, he was also a traveler and a world-class man-secret — Atkinson played in the once-forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials, in which he left chaos behind.
In the latest Johnny English movie series there are one or two moments worth noting.
I really liked the scene in which Johnny English approached the helicopter, dressed in medieval armor, while his helmet was beaten rhythmically by the rotor blades.
The screen clearly shows Atkinson’s gift for physically playing comedy, but the sense of humor seems to be rather low-flying and unnecessary, especially since now also “serious” movie brands such as 007 and Mission Impossible offer comedy elements as part of the film.
Humorous elements seem to be aimed at children rather than adults – I think Johnny English’s crazy adventures are not as ingenious and consistent as the gags in Atkinson’s silent films about Jassy Bean.
It has always been a common assumption that the UK is in serious trouble.
The cyberhacker infiltrates the British super-secret network of spies, revealing the identities of all British agents operating in the field — to the horror of an agent on duty, Kevin Eldon, who unfortunately played a small role.
This is the last drop in the prime minister’s bitter spell, which is a pompous, wasteful figure already suffering from a nervous breakdown caused by a lack of political popularity: Emma Thompson does everything in her power to portray herself as Theresa May, but the scenario does not give her a chance to develop.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that due to the disclosure of the identity of all active spies, she will have to return to the service of one of the retired agents.
And that means an incompetent Johnny English in person, currently employed as a teacher at some fancy school, giving unofficial lessons on how to become a secret agent — a few nice gags while giving spy lessons by English.
English is called to Whitehall for dispatch, reconnecting with his former assistant Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man associated with the captain of a submarine—a cheerful but somewhat tired character played by Vicki Pepperdine.
So Batman and Robin, a partisan in the secret service of Her Royal Majesty, return to action, meeting the beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova, a character played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is dangerously dominated by a charismatic tech billionaire maniac who claims to be able to solve Britain's computer problems - he is portrayed by Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their crusade of absurd situations: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a French restaurant; they smuggle themselves into chaos on board a luxury yacht Volta; and English sows desolation while using a virtual reality kit to explore the interior of the house.
In this last sequence, all restrictions disappear, but despite the nice and noisy performance, the whole film is very similar to television for children.
Typical average.
As with the other films in the Johnny English series, I couldn’t resist thinking: Can’t the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really fits his talent?
The Labour Party denies that it is developing a plan that foresees a four-day working week for the British people, for which they will be paid in five days.
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party will consider introducing a radical plan, under which the British will work four days a week, receiving a salary of five days.
The party reportedly wants business leaders to pass on the savings generated by the Artificial Intelligence (AI) revolution to employees, giving them an extra day off.
Thanks to this, employees could enjoy a three-day weekend, earning the same amount of pay.
Sources say that the idea “will fit” into the party’s economic agenda and plans to leave the country in the face of workers.
The transition to a four-day work week has been supported by the Congress of Trade Unions as a way for workers to benefit from changing the economy.
A senior Labour leader told The Sunday Times: “Policy changes are expected to be announced by the end of this year.”
“This will not happen overnight, but a four-day work week is something that fits into the party’s approach to restoring economic balance for the benefit of the worker, as well as into the party’s overall industrial strategy.
The Labour Party is not the first party to support such an idea — the Green Party has committed to introducing a four-day work week during the 2017 election campaign.
At present, however, these plans are not supported by all Labour Party members.
A spokesman for the Labour Party said: “A four-day work week is not the party’s policy and its introduction is not considered by it.”
John McDonnell, the chancellor of the shadow cabinet, used last week’s Labour Party conference to present his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to regain power from “faceless directors” and “speculators” in public utility companies.
The Chancellor’s plans from the shadow cabinet also mean that current shareholders of water companies may not be able to recover their full share because the Labour Party government could make “deductions” based on the abuses detected.
He also confirmed plans to place employees on the company’s boards and create integrative equity funds to transfer 10 percent of private sector companies’ equity to employees who receive annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy are responding to the question on the 60 Minutes program whether the FBI investigation into the Kavanaugh case could make them change their mindset.
The FBI investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least a week and raised the question of whether the findings of the Bureau of Investigation could prompt Republican senators to nominate them.
In an interview with 60 Minutes on Sunday, Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could uncover something that could change their mindset.
Kennedy was more open-minded than his South Carolina counterpart.
“Of course,” Kennedy said.
“When I went to the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened when the accusation came up, and I said, "Did you do that?"
He was determined, determined and unambiguous.”
Graham’s opinion, however, seems to be carved in stone.
“I’ve made a decision about Brett Kavanaugh and it takes a strong charge to change it,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know this: Brett firmly denied it,” Graham added, addressing Christine Blasey Ford.
“None of the people he reported was able to verify it.
It's been 36 years.
I don't think anything will change."
What is the Global Citizen Festival event and has it contributed to any degree to reducing the level of poverty?
Next Saturday in New York City will be held the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event boasting an extremely impressive cast of performing stars and an equally impressive mission — the eradication of poverty in the world.
The seventh Global Citizen Festival will be attended by tens of thousands of people arriving at the Great Lawn in Central Park, not only to enjoy the performances of stars such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to support the realization of the most important goal of this event, which is the 20th anniversary.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international group of activists to combat poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free ticket for this event (unless a VIP ticket has been purchased), the concert participants had to perform a number of tasks or “actions” such as volunteering, sending emails to a world leader, making a phone call or other meaningful actions to help them.
But what success can Global Citizen boast of in the 12 years remaining to achieve the goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a good way to convince them to take action, or another case of so-called “activism” when people feel like they’re doing something important by signing an online petition or posting a tweet?
Global Citizen says it has recorded more than 19 million “actions” of people supporting the action since 2011, aiming to achieve many different goals.
It also claims that these actions have helped drive global leaders to announce commitments and regulations worth more than $37 billion, which are expected to impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements resulting from its activities, in which at least $10 billion has already been paid or funded.
The group estimates that the secured funds have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide so far.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK partnership of investors and implementers committed to “helping children reach their full potential”, which has promised to hand over $35 million to Rwanda to help eliminate malnutrition in that country, after Global members over two years.
“Thanks to the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and members of Global Citizen like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition history.” — Tracey Ullman, Power of Nutrition Ambassador 2018
The group also said that following more than 5,000 actions calling on the UK to improve the quality of mother and child nutrition, the government has announced funding for the Power of Nutrition project, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutritional problems.
On one of the most frequently asked questions on his website, which was “How can you be sure that extreme poverty will be eliminated?”,
The Global Citizen responded: “It will be a long and difficult journey —sometimes we will stumble and fail.
But as with the great civil rights movements of the past and the fight against apartheid, we will succeed because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the stars performing at this year’s New York event hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the navy to “block” Russian energy exports — Secretary of the Interior
Washington may “if necessary” resort to its navy to prevent Russian energy from flowing into markets, including those in the Middle East, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke, the Washington Examiner, said.
Zinke argued that Russia’s involvement in Syria—especially where it operates at the invitation of a legitimate government—is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
“I think the reason they are in the Middle East is because of the desire to mediate in the energy trade, as it is in Eastern Europe,” he said.
According to the official, there are ways and means to solve this problem.
“The United States, through its Navy, has the opportunity to ensure that sea routes remain open and, if necessary, to create a blockade to ensure that their energy does not reach the market,” he said.
Zinke spoke to the participants of the event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that calls itself the “energy consumer voice” in the United States.
He also compared Washington’s approaches to Russia and Iran, noting that in reality they are the same.
“The economic option of Iran and Russia is more or less about using and replacing fuels,” he said, comparing Russia to a “one-trick hook” with a fossil-fuel-dependent economy.
These statements came as the Trump administration continues its mission to increase liquefied natural gas exports to Europe — a much cheaper option for European consumers compared to Russian gas.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump said made Berlin a “slave” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, which is intended to double the existing capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s fierce opposition to this project stems solely from economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I think we share the view that energy cannot be a tool to exert pressure and that consumers should have the choice of suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after meeting U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position has provoked a violent reaction from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industrial organization, the German Federation of Industry (BDI), called on the United States to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I think it’s a big problem when a third country interferes with our energy supplies,” Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industry Federation (BDI), said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts senator, said she would consider running for president in 2020.
Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts senator, said on Saturday she would consider running for president after the midterm elections.
During a meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering her candidacy.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and fix the broken government. This also applies to women holding the highest position,” she said — The Hill.
"After November 6, I will consider my candidacy for the post of president."
During the meeting, Warren mentioned President Donald Trump, saying he was “leading the country in the wrong direction.”
“I am very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren without a garden expressed her criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren tweeted, “Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote.”
However, a poll published on Thursday showed that the majority of Warren voters do not believe she should run for office in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts voters who voted for the option "probably" said the senator should not run, according to a poll conducted by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported the nomination.
The poll showed more support for former governor Deval Patrick’s candidacy — 38 percent supported his potential candidacy, and 48 percent opposed it.
Other well-known names from the Democratic camp disregarded in regards to a potential 2020 candidacy were former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision by January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin talks about Track Palin’s Post-Track Stress Syndrome (PTSD) during Donald Trump’s election campaign
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in the military in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
“What my own son is going through, what he has to go through on his return, I understand other families who are experiencing the effects of PTSD and the wounds our soldiers are coming back with,” she told audiences at Donald Trump’s polling station in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called her son’s arrest “a taboo subject,” after which she said of her son and other war veterans: “They come back a little changed, come back hardened, come back, wondering if they will be shown respect for what their fellow soldiers, airmen and other soldiers are doing.”
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, incitement to falsely testify in a domestic violence report, and possession of a gun in a sober state, according to Wasilla Police Department spokesman Dan Bennett.
18 States and District of Colombia Support Fight Against New Asylum Policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support the legal challenge for a new U.S. policy that refuses to grant asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and districts filed a letter amicus cur<0xC3><0xA6> in Washington on Friday to support an asylum seeker struggling with this policy, according to NBC News.
The full name of the cause in the Grace v. Sessions lawsuit, which the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against federal policy, has not been disclosed.
She said her partner “and his brutal gang sons” abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Prosecutors in support of Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where there are a large number of asylum seekers in the U.S., as countries struggling with widespread problems with gangs and domestic violence.
A new U.S. asylum policy has overturned the 2014 Board of Immigration Appeals decision that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Karl Racine, District Attorney General of the District of Columbia, said in a statement Friday that the new policy “ignores state, federal and international law that has been in place for decades.”
“Federal law requires that all applications for asylum be considered on the basis of specific facts and circumstances, and such a prohibition violates this principle,” the letter reads.
Prosecutors further argued in the letter that the policy of refusing entry to immigrants harms the U.S. economy, claiming that they can become entrepreneurs and “constitute the necessary workforce.”
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic and gang violence.
“Asylum is available to those who leave their country of origin because of persecution or fear on the basis of race, religion, nationality or because of belonging to a particular social group or who have such and no other political beliefs,” Sessions said in his June 11 statement on asylum policy.
Asylum was never meant to solve all the problems – even the serious ones – that people around the world face every day.
Desperate rescue attempts in Palu, where the death toll has doubled in a race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation became more and more tragic.
“It’s a very intense feeling,” Risa Kusuma’s 35-year-old mother said, comforting her ailing son at an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
“Every minute an ambulance brings in bodies.
Lack of clean water.”
Residents were seen returning to destroyed homes, searching for water-soaked things and trying to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, damaged by a 7.5-degree earthquake, quickly overflowed.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who suffered a spine and arm fracture, rested outside the military hospital in Palu, where patients were being treated outside due to severe secondary shocks.
Tears filled his eyes as he told of a violent earthquake that shook the room on the fifth floor of the hotel he shared with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to save myself.
I think I was pushed into the wall room," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family had come to the city for the wedding.
“I heard my wife cry out for help, and then her voice stopped.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they’re safe.”
The U.S. ambassador accuses China of “bullying” with propaganda.
A week after the official Chinese newspaper posted a four-page ad in a U.S. newspaper praising the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using U.S. propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to a paid addition to the China Daily in the Des Moines Register — the most popular newspaper in Iowa — accusing China of trying to interfere in the U.S. Congressional elections that will take place on November 6.
Trump’s allegation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the U.S. election confirmed what U.S. officials told Reuters was a new step in Washington’s escalating campaign to exert pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place advertisements promoting trade with their countries, Beijing and Washington are now leading an escalation of the trade war, which has led to an increase in tariffs on mutual imports.
Chinese retaliatory tariffs at the start of the trade war were meant to affect exporters in states like Iowa, which supported the Trump Republican Party, Chinese and American experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa — the main exporter of agricultural products to China — said Beijing had harmed U.S. workers, farmers and entrepreneurs.
Branstad stated in a Sunday article in the Des Moines Register that China “is now doubling its force to begin harassment by placing propaganda ads in our own free press.”
“In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the respected American tradition of free speech and free press to place paid advertising on the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
However, there will be no opposition voices in the street kiosk in Beijing and there will be no real reflection of the divergent opinions that the Chinese may have about the disturbing economic direction taken by China, given that the media are under the strong control of the Chinese Communist Party.
He added that "one of the most famous Chinese newspapers refused to publish" his article, although he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans terrorize women with the right to vote in midterm elections over Kavanaugh affair, analysts warn
While many leading Republicans support and defend Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in the face of several sexual assault allegations, the analyst warns that your members will meet during the upcoming special mid-term elections with a blast.
The emotion that accompanies this event is extremely high, and most Republicans already want to officially vote.
“This cannot be reversed,” said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School at the University of Syracuse.
Reeher said he had doubts as to whether Senator Jeff Flake’s (Arizona) effort to conduct a last-minute FBI investigation was enough to reassure angry voters.
“Women won’t forget what happened yesterday — they won’t forget it tomorrow and they won’t forget it until November,” said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted the slogan “November is coming,” demonstrating in the Senate lobby over the Republicans controlling the Judiciary Commission’s decision to not withdraw Kavanaugh’s nomination despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford — as Mic reported.
“The level of democratic enthusiasm and motivation will go beyond scale,” said Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst.
“People say he was already tall — and it’s true.
But it can be higher, especially among indecisive suburban women and younger voters aged 18 to 29 who, although they don’t like the president, often don’t vote.”
Even before Ford made a public statement detailing her allegations of sexual assault against a Supreme Court candidate, analysts suggested that if Republicans decided to approve the candidacy, it could come with a violent reaction.
“The Republican Party has to deal with a little mess,” Michael Steele, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, told NBC News earlier this week.
“It’s not just about the committee vote or the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh will be elected, it’s also about how the Republicans handled the situation and how they handled Ford,” Guy Cecil, director of U.S. Democratic Priorities, said in a statement.
However, Americans seem to be a bit divided as to who to believe in the face of Ford and Kavanaugh’s testimony, with the latter having slightly greater support.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents strongly or rather believed Ford’s testimony, while 35 percent said they strongly or rather believed Kavanaugh’s testimony.
In addition, 38% of respondents said that Kavanaugh likely or certainly lied during the testimonial, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
After Flake’s pressure, the FBI opened an investigation into the allegations made by Ford, as well as at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, according to The Guardian.
Last week, under oath before the Senate Judiciary Commission, Ford testified that Kavanaugh had assaulted her at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee showed her his genitals during a graduation ceremony at Yale University in the 1980s.
The creator of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook platforms.
Tim Berners-Lee, the creator of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company based on an open source platform — Solid — owned by Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people have access to specific information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the goal of creating Inrupt was “domination of the world.”
“We have to do it now,” he said, referring to the startup.
“It’s a historic moment.”
The application uses the technology of the Solid platform to allow people to create their own “personal data online store” or other POD.
It can include contact lists, lists of things to do, a calendar, a music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify available in one browser and at the same time.
A unique feature of an online store with personal data is that it is entirely up to the user who has access to what information.
The company calls this “personal empowerment through data.”
According to the company’s CEO, John Bruce, the idea of Inrupt is to provide the resources, processes, and relevant skills to help make the Solid platform available to all people.
Currently, the company includes Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several developers employed to work on the project, and a community of volunteer developers.
Starting this week, tech developers around the world were able to create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking to “Facebook and Google about whether to make a complete change that will turn all of their business models upside down from day to day.
“Don’t ask for permission.”
Berners-Lee wrote in a post on Medium on Saturday that “Inrupt’s mission is to provide commercial energy and ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on the Solid platform.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has done a lot in the debate on net neutrality.
Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m extremely excited to think about the next era in the development of the network,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: award of the clergy with the Cross of Victoria during World War I
The memory of the only clerical Church of England, who was awarded the Cross of Victoria as a combatant during World War I, was celebrated 100 years later in his hometown.
Lieutenant-Colonel Bernard Vann was awarded 29 September 1918 for the attack on Bellenglis and Lehaucourt.
He was killed by a sniper four days later, never knowing that he had been awarded the highest British military order.
On Saturday, his two grandchildren unveiled a memorial stone during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said the unveiling of the stone on the centenary of his grandfather’s centenary was “exceptionally symbolic in character.”
As reported by the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Colonel Vann led his battalion through the Saint-Quentin Canal "in a very dense fog and under heavy firing from field artillery and machine guns".
He then rushed to the line of fire and with "the greatest courage" led it forward, after which he single-handedly attacked the position of the field units, eliminating three of them.
Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 — just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “something I would never be able to cope with, but at the same time something humble.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, laid the wreath at the end of the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band parade.
Michael Vann said he felt "very honored to be able to take part in the parade" and added that "the courage of a true hero is reflected in the support he receives from many people."
MMA fans didn’t sleep all night to watch the Bellator 206 gala, instead they got Pig Peppa.
Imagine that you have not slept all night to watch the emotion-packed Bellator 206 gala and ultimately not be able to see the main fight.
The San Jose gala program included 13 fights, including six on the main card, and was shown live at night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for battle, spectators in the UK were shocked by the change to Pig Peppa.
Some were disappointed after not sleeping until the early hours of the morning specifically to see this fight.
One fan on Twitter described the switch to a children’s cartoon as “some kind of sick joke.”
“According to the government’s decree, content of this type is inappropriate to be released at 6 a.m., which required a change to the children’s program,” said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the broadcast.
Peppa Pig, yes.
Bellator CEO Scott Coker said they would work on a schedule to include viewers from the UK in the future.
“When I think about repeating the situation, I think we can fix it,” Coker said.
“But it is Sunday the sixth morning, so we will not be able to deal with it until Sunday according to our time, and Monday according to their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when there was a program change, we were filled with a lot of comments, none of which sounded friendly.
We tried to fix it... we thought it was a technical flaw.
But it was not a mistake, it was a legal issue.
I can promise that this situation will never happen again.
We’re going to limit the program to five fights instead of six — that’s the standard amount. Too strongly we wanted to please the fans and unfortunately we’ve gotten better.
This is an unfortunate situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley Feel 'worse' Because of Sexuality
Tom Daley, an Olympic water jumper, says he grew up feeling worse than everyone else because of his sexuality, but that gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn’t realize that not everyone was like him until he went to high school.
In the Desert Island Discs program on Radio 4 hosted by Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about gay rights to give others “hope.”
He also said that becoming a parent made him less interested in winning the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the regular host of this long-running program, took a few months off due to her illness.
Appearing in Laverne's first program, Daley said that growing up, he felt "less valuable" than others because "the simultaneous liking of boys and girls was socially unacceptable."
He said, “To this day, this sense of lesser value and being different is something that gives me the strength to succeed.”
He said he wanted to prove that he is “something worthwhile” so as not to disappoint everyone when they finally find out about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a vocal activist for the LGBT community and has used his performance at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to call for more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he decided to express himself because he felt happy to be able to live openly, without any implications, and in this way he wanted to give others “hope.”
The three-time world champion said falling in love with a man—American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013—surprised him.
Daley married an Oscar winner (who is 20 years older than him) last year, noting that such an age difference has never been a problem for him.
“When you’re going through so much at such a young age,” he said, referring to his first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father’s death from cancer three years later, “he said it was hard for him to find someone at the same age who had experienced similar ups and downs.
The couple became parents in June to a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley. Daley said that his perception of certain things had completely changed.
“Last year, the most important thing for me was to win a gold medal,” he said.
"And you know what? There are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
“My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.”
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept that he was dying, and one of the last things he asked was if they already had tickets to the 2012 London Olympics — he wanted to be in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him, ‘You won’t be with us to be in the front row, Dad,’” he said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing. Only when he stopped breathing and died, I realized that he was not invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daley took part in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
“I knew that this was what I had dreamed of my whole life — jumping into the water in front of a crowd of people at the Olympics — it was the best feeling possible,” he said.
This also inspired him to choose the first song — Proud performed by Heather Small — that accompanied him during the preparations for the Olympics and that continues to spice up his goose skin.
The Desert Island Discs program is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 every Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Showing no form of Mickelson on the bench during Saturday's part of the Ryder Cup
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to work on his form to keep his heel off.
Mickelson, playing for the twelfth time in a two-year event, was sent back to the bench by Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's fourball and foursome games.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as has often happened in his case in the United States team, the five-time main winner had to spend the day doping the team and working on improving his game in the hopes of fixing the reason for his return to the bench.
The 48-year-old, who never gave the simplest punches, even at the peak of his career, does not do very well on the narrow Le Golf National field, where the wrong punches are mercilessly punished by long roughs.
And if the field itself is not discouraging enough for Mickelson, in the ninth match on Sunday he has to face the precision of the winner of the British Open — Francesco Molinari, who joined forces with debutant Tommy Fleetwood this week to win all the match.
If the Americans (with a loss of four points at the beginning of 12 singles) start a game with a verve, Mickelson’s match can prove to be extremely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in his player — he probably could not do anything else.
“He fully understood his role today, patted me on the back, took me by the hand and said he would be ready tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He is very confident.
He’s in the celebrity gallery and has brought a lot to play for his teams both in the past and this week.
I didn’t think he would play two games.
I thought there would be more of them, but that's how it happened, and that's how we had to do it.
He wants to play all the time, just like everyone else.”
Mickelson will break Nick Faldo’s record for the Ryder Cup matches on Sunday.
This could mean the end of his career in the Ryder Cup, which has never matched his individual achievements.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws on his account. Furyk said that his presence contributed a lot to the team.
“It’s funny, sarcastic, funny, ridiculous, and it’s good to have him in the team room,” he explained.
“I think the younger players had a good time with him this week, which was nice to see.
He brings in much more than just a game.”
European team captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the big point advantage may soon shrink
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that a significant point advantage before starting the singles on the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into a difficult game.
The Dane made his debut in 1997 at Valderrama, where he had a five-point lead over the Americans, along with his deputy captain Sevem Ballesteros, but he passed the finish line with the shortest hair possible, winning 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x80><0xB2><0xE2><0x80><0xB2>.
“We can’t forget that we had a big advantage on the Valderrama field; we also had a big advantage on the Brookline field where we lost, and in the case of the Valderrama field we only won for the hair,” said Bjorn, in the photo, after winning 5-3 Class of 2018 on both Fridays, Fridays and Fridays.
Time will show me and all the members of the team that this is not over yet.
Tomorrow you will do your best.
Get out there and do everything right.
It will only end when the points appear on the board.
We have a goal to win a trophy, and that's what we need to focus on.
“From the beginning, I’ve been saying that I’m focusing on the 12 players who are on our side, but we also know very well who the people on the other side are – the best players in the world.”
Bjorn, delighted with the way his players handled the difficult field, added: “I couldn’t have done it better.
But tomorrow is different.
They're going to be single tomorrow, and that's another matter.
It’s good to play with your partner when everything goes according to plan, but when you play alone, your golfing skills are tested to the limit.
This is a message that needs to be conveyed to the players, is to give tomorrow its best.
Your partner has to do his best too.”
Jim Furyk, unlike Bjorn, will expect his players to score better on their own than when playing with a partner, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three out of four points.
Furyk himself experienced great returns on the last day, being a member of the winning team on the Brookline field, after which he failed after the European team performed a "miracle on the Medinah field".
“I remember every word,” he said in response to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, warmed up to fight his players on the last day.
“Tomorrow we’re going to play 12 important games — you’d like to start the game at a fast pace, as you did at Brookline and Medinah.
If this thrust goes one way, it will exert a lot of pressure on the midfield matches.
We set up our cast appropriately and set up the boys in a way that would allow us to enchant tomorrow.”
Thomas was entrusted with the task of leading the counterattack, facing Rory McIlroy in the main game, as well as Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter — other European team players in the front half of the program.
“I chose this group of guys in this order because I think he’s going to be able to make it through the whole game,” Bjorn said of his singles selection.
A new German warship is delayed again.
The latest German navy frigate should be put into service in 2014 to replace aging warships from the Cold War, but this won’t happen until at least next year due to faulty systems and growing locally at an alarmingly high cost.
The use of the Rheinland-Pfalz, the main ship of the new Baden-Württemberg frigate, was postponed to the first half of 2019, Die Zeit newspaper reported, citing a military spokesman.
The ship should be incorporated into the Navy in 2014, but due to problems that appeared after delivery, it was necessary to make changes to this ambitious project.
The four units of the Baden-Württemberg class ordered by the navy in 2007 will replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
Of course, they will be equipped with a powerful cannon, a number of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as technological solutions preventing detection, ensuring, among other things, the reduction of radar, infrared and acoustic footprints.
Other important features include longer periods between maintenance operations — the operation of new frigates should be possible for up to two years away from home ports.
The continued delays mean, however, that these modern warships, which are meant to enable Germany to react to situations abroad, will be obsolete at the time of service, Die Zeit notes.
The unfortunate F125 frigate appeared on the front pages of newspapers last year when the German Navy officially refused to put the ship into service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had returned the ship to the shipyard after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons behind the return, but the German media reported a number of key "software and hardware flaws" that made the ship useless in a combat mission.
Software deficiencies were particularly significant, as Baden-Württemberg-class ships are to be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, which is half less than in the case of older Bremen-class frigates.
It has also been found that the ship is far too heavy, which reduces its performance and limits the ability of the Navy to carry out future modernizations.
The Rheinland-Pfalz ship weighing 7,000 tons is thought to be twice as heavy as the similar class of ships used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to the defective equipment, the problem also becomes the cost of the entire project — including the training of the crew.
It is said to have reached a staggering <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion ($3.6 billion), while the initial cost was <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
Problems with the deployment of new frigates are becoming particularly important in light of recent warnings that the strength of the German navy is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament’s defence committee, admitted that the navy “will end up with ships capable of use.”
He also said that this problem has grown over time as a result of withdrawing from the operation of old units without providing replacement ships.
In addition, he expressed his dissatisfaction with the fact that none of the frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class could be incorporated into the navy.
The National Trust is listening to the secret life of bats
A new study on the estate in the Scottish Highlands aims to show how bats use the landscape while harvesting food.
The results of the study are expected to shed new light on the conservation of these exceptional flying mammals and help guide future actions to protect them.
Research conducted by researchers from the National Trust for Scotland will cover common and small dwarfs, as well as brown long-eared bats and bats from the family of red nuts at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special registrars will be deployed in key locations around the estate to monitor bat activity throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct field research using portable detectors.
The expert sound analysis of all recordings aims to determine the frequency of signals sent by bats and how each species behaves.
A habitat map and report will then be developed to create a detailed picture of their behavior on a landscape scale.
Rob Dewar, Nature Conservation Advisor at NTS, hopes the results will reveal which habitats are most important to bats and how they are used by each of the species.
This information will help to identify the benefits of habitat management work, such as meadow management, as well as the best ways to maintain forest areas for bats and other related species.
The populations of bats in Scotland and throughout the UK have declined significantly over the last century.
They are at risk of construction and development work, which affects the shrubs and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting installations can also pose a threat, as can fly glues and some chemicals used in building materials, and even domestic cats.
Butterflies are not really blind.
However, because of their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more helpful than their eyes in catching prey.
They use a complicated echolocation technique to find worms and obstacles in their path.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
It consists of ten trained experts who regularly carry out surveys, checks of beams, and sometimes even rescue actions.
The organization even established Scotland’s first and only dedicated bat reserve on the Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland’s ten bat species.
David Thompson, the estate manager, says that it is the ideal territory for bats.
“Threave has a wonderful area for bats,” he said.
“We have old buildings, lots of old trees and excellent habitats.
However, there are still many unknowns when it comes to bats. The work we do here and in other estates will help us better understand what they need to develop."
It underlines the importance of controlling the presence of bats before proceeding with maintenance work on the estates, since the unintentional destruction of a single flock can kill up to 400 females and young, which can lead to the extinction of the entire local population.
Bats are under protection —killing, harassing, or disturbing them, as well as destroying their beams, is illegal.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish Bat Conservation Trust officer, encouraged the public to provide assistance.
She said: “We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and for many species, we don’t even know how their populations are coping.”
Ronaldo rejects allegations of rape while his lawyers intend to sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo described the allegations of rape against him as “fake news,” saying people “want to promote themselves” using his name.
His lawyers intend to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The Portuguese striker of Juventus has been charged with raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
According to Der Spiegel, the footballer was supposed to pay a woman $375,000 for silence.
Ronaldo, 33, a few hours after the charges were announced, in an Instagram live broadcast addressed to his 142 million followers, described the reports as “fake news”.
“No, no, no, no, no.
Today’s reports are fake news,” said the five-time gold-ball winner.
“They want to promote themselves using my name.
That's nothing new.
They want to be famous by saying my name, but that's part of my job.
I’m happy and everything is fine,” the player added with a smile on his lips.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel in connection with charges they have called “an unacceptable reporting of privacy suspicions,” according to Reuters.
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for “moral damages in the amount corresponding to the weight of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious personal rights violations in recent years.”
The event was scheduled to take place in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at the nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly went to the footballer's room where he allegedly raped a woman anally, according to documents filed at the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after his alleged arrival and told her that "99 percent is a good guy" who was fooled by that "one percent".
According to the documents, Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but this was done with mutual consent.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that pictures of her injuries were taken at the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was “fearful of retaliation” and “public humiliation.”
The 34-year-old says she wants to nullify the deal now because she still can’t forget about the alleged breach.
At the time of the alleged assault, Ronaldo moved from Manchester United to Real Madrid, and that summer he moved to Juventus after paying 100 million euros for him.
Brexit: Britain 'would have regretted' car manufacturers' departure
Britain would “regret forever” if it lost its status as the world’s leading carmaker after leaving the European Union, Business Secretary Greg Clark said.
He said he was “disturbed” when a representative of Toyota UK told the BBC that if the UK leaves the EU without a deal, production at the Burnaston plant near Derby would be temporarily halted.
“We need a deal,” Clark said.
A spokesman for the Japanese automaker said the effects of delays at the border in the absence of a Brexit deal could lead to job cuts.
The Burnaston plant, which produces Auris and Avensis models, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to other European Union countries.
“In my opinion, if the UK leaves the European Union at the end of March without an agreement, then production at our factory will be suspended,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s Managing Director at Burnaston.
Other UK carmakers fear leaving the EU without an agreement on how cross-border trade works, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW is going to close its Mini car factory in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concerns, according to car manufacturers, are about the threats to the supply chain if the UK leaves the European Union without an agreement.
Toyota’s production line operates on a “just-in-time” basis, where parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for custom-made cars.
If the UK leaves the EU on 29 March without a deal, there could be difficulties at the border, which, according to industry representatives, could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
According to a spokesman for the company, Toyota would not be able to withstand more than one day without deliveries to its Derbyshire plant, and production would be halted.
Theresa May’s Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is “precisely designed to avoid border controls.”
“We need an agreement. We want to achieve the best possible agreement that will not only allow us to enjoy the current success, but also allow us to make the appropriate use of this situation,” he said on BBC Radio 4.
“The statements not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers show that we need to be able to continue what has been a very efficient set of supply chains.”
Toyota’s office was unable to determine how long production would be halted, but warned that in the long run, additional costs would reduce the plant’s competitiveness, leading to a reduction in employment.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at the Burnaston plant for 24 years and is a member of the branch board of the union organization Unite, said that union members are increasingly concerned: “I know from experience that if jobs are eliminated, they will never be restored.
The government spokesman said: “We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relations with the European Union.”
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, White House says
Donald Trump’s important meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “delayed another week” due to the ongoing fight for Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special prosecutor Robert Mueller, who is investigating the possibility of Russian interference in the election, the link between Trump’s close associates and Russia, and the potential obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether Trump will fire the deputy attorney general, thereby threatening Mueller’s independence, has been a hot topic in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was talking about using wiretapping to record conversations with Trump, as well as the possibility of removing the president from office under the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the allegations.
Last Monday, however, he went to the White House in the face of reports that he was about to resign.
The meeting with Trump, who was then at the UN headquarters in New York, was scheduled for Thursday.
Trump said he would rather not fire Rosenstein. The meeting was postponed to avoid colliding with a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a weekly FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the vote in the Senate.
Trump’s spokeswoman, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
Asked about her meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “There is no date yet for this meeting, it may take place this week, or it may be postponed another week, taking into account all the events related to the Supreme Court.
We’ll see, I’ll tell the press.”
Several journalists questioned this statement: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10.
The program's host, Chris Wallace, asked why.
Sanders said that a small number of press conferences are not caused by a reluctance to “ostentatious” television journalists, after which she added: “I will not hide that they are “ostentatious”.
She then suggested that the direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
“The current president conducts more ‘questions and answers’ sessions than any other president before him,” she said, adding without providing evidence: “We have seen the numbers.”
Press conferences will continue to take place, Sanders said, but “if journalists are given the opportunity to directly ask the President of the United States, that is a much better solution than talking to me.
We are trying to do this on a regular basis, and we have done this very often in the last few weeks, and press conferences will give way to such sessions, during which you will be able to talk directly to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions while leaving the White House or attending open sessions or press conferences with guest dignitaries.
Solo press conferences are rare.
This week in New York, the president may have demonstrated why this is the case, behaving too freely and sometimes oddly in front of gathered journalists.
The Minister of Health writes to workers from European Union countries employed at NHS Scotland in the face of concerns related to Brexit
The Minister of Health sent a letter to workers from the European Union countries employed in the Scottish Health Service to convey to them the gratitude of the country and ask them not to leave after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before Britain left the European Union.
The Scottish Government has already pledged to cover the costs of examining applications for ‘settled status’ for EU citizens working in decentralised public services.
Freeman wrote in her letter: “Negotiations on the UK’s exit from the European Union continued this summer, and the appropriate decisions will be taken in the autumn of this year.
The British government has also stepped up preparations for a possible no-deal exit scenario.
I know this is a very disturbing time for all of you.
That is why I would like to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of each member of staff, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve healthcare work and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we really want you to stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie undergoes surgery after suffering a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers striker Christion Abercrombie underwent surgery after suffering a head injury in a Saturday game against the Vanderbilt Commodores, which resulted in a 31-27 loss for the Tennessee team, Organ said.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the player was injured shortly before the end of the first half.
“He went to the sideline, then fell to the ground,” Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sidelines, then placed it on the carriers and carried it out for further research.
A Tennessee State spokesman told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was operated on at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that “there are no details yet on the type/size of the injury,” and Tennessee State is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie (a second-year student dismissed from representing college for a year to train his skills) plays his first season at the Tennessee State team after transferring from Illinois.
On Saturday before the end of the game he had five sets, giving him 18 sets throughout the season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher tax on the purchase of real estate in the UK
In line with the new plans, foreign buyers will be charged higher tax fees for the purchase of real estate in the UK. The funds thus obtained will be allocated to help the homeless.
This move is intended to undermine the success of Jeremy Corbyn's efforts to attract a young electorate.
The tax increase will include people who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The Ministry of the Treasury expects to receive up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help homeless people.
Theresa May will announce today that foreigners buying property in the UK will be charged a higher tax, and the additional funds thus obtained will be allocated to help the homeless.
This move is seen as an attempt to quell Jeremy Corbyn’s efforts to attract the young electorate with promises of cheaper housing and increase the burden on those who earn more.
Higher tax rates will apply to individuals and non-taxable businesses in the UK. Additional measures are designed to help the government fight homelessness.
The additional fee — charged in addition to the current tax, including the higher rates for second homes and rented homes introduced two years ago — can be up to three percent.
The state treasury expects this move to yield up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of newly built properties in London are purchased by residents of other countries, leading to price increases and making it difficult to buy a first home or apartment.
Because many foreigners buy real estate and spend most of their time abroad, many wealthy regions—and especially the capital—have turned into “ghost cities.”
The new rules come just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a tax cut to help young people buy their first home.
He accused large developers of keeping high real estate prices by occupying the land, but not using it, and called on Prime Minister May to lift the limits on cheap housing in order to eliminate the “residential scandal” in the UK.
Jeremy Corbyn has announced a number of attractive housing reforms, including rent regulation and an end to eviction "for no reason".
It also wants to give local governments greater powers to build new homes.
Theresa May said: “Last year, I said that as Prime Minister, I am committed to rebuilding the British dream that the lives of each generation will be better than the previous one.
This also means repairing our shaky housing market.
The UK will always be open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it is not right that people who do not live here, as well as foreign companies, can buy property here with equal ease as hard-working British residents.
For too many people, the dream of their own home has become very distant, but the humiliation associated with the need to spend the night on the street remains far too real.”
Jack Ross: “My biggest ambition is to be Scotland’s national team”
Sunderland coach Jack Ross says his “greatest ambition” is to become Scotland’s coach at some point.
This forty-two-year-old Scot is committed to the recovery of the North-East club, which currently ranks third in League One with a three-point loss to the best team.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after introducing St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
“I wanted to represent my country as a player.
But I only managed to get to staff B," Ross said in an interview with BBC Scotland's Sportssound.
“As a child, I often watched the Scottish games in Hampden with my father, and it always attracted me.
However, this opportunity will only come if I succeed as a coach of the club.”
Ross's predecessors as Sunderland coach included Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former Alloa Athletic coach says he doesn’t feel shy about taking over the role after such famous personalities in such a large club, having previously rejected proposals from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“Today, my success will be measured by whether I will be able to bring this club back to the Premier League.
Given its structure and the facilities it has at its disposal, there is no doubt that its place is there,” he added.
“It’s not going to be easy, but I’m sure I’ll feel like I’ve succeeded here, only if I succeed.”
Ross’ coaching career has only been going on for three years. Before that, he was an assistant coach at Dumbarton and for 15 months he was part of the Hearts coaching team.
He then helped Alloa re-advance to the third league after degrading, and in the following season led the St Mirren team from the edge of declining to the championship.
Jack Ross says he is now feeling much more comfortable than when he played at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
“It was a real turning point,” says coach Allo’s statement.
“I really believed that running a team is much better for me than playing.
This sounds strange, because as a player I managed to make good money and I achieved several measurable successes.
But playing is a heavy piece of bread.
Every week you have to go through different situations.
They still meet me when it comes to the stress and pressure associated with the work of the coach, but I feel good in this role.
I’ve always wanted to train others and now I’m doing it. I can say that right now I feel the most in place in my entire adult life.”

Studies show that the best time for beer is at 5.30 p.m. on Saturday
The summer heatwave caused a violent influx of customers to British pubs, but it hit the restaurant chains.
The survey showed that in July, sales in pubs and bars rose by 2.7 percent, but in restaurants fell by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin of the CGA consultancy, which developed the data, says: “Continuously hot and longer than expected England’s participation in the World Championships caused the results from July to be similar to those of June, when the turnover in pubs increased by more than 2.8 per cent, while the turnover in restaurants increased by more than 2.8 per cent.
The 1.8% drop in restaurant sales in June was even more pronounced in July.
The pubs and bars that offered drinks fared best — their sales growth exceeded the drop seen in restaurants.
Pubs serving food also suffered during the heat, though not as much as the restaurant owners.
Seems like people were just thirsty.
Sales of beverages in managed pubs and bars rose 6.6 percent this month, and food fell three percent.
Paul Newman of RSM, an analyst of the entertainment and tourism industry, says: “These results are part of the trend we’ve seen since the end of April.
The most important factors affecting the volume of consumption ‘outside the home’ remain the weather and major sporting or social events.
The fact that restaurant chains are experiencing difficult times is not surprising, though a 4.8 percent drop in sales compared to the previous year will have particularly severe consequences if you take into account the continued pressures to cut costs.
The long and hot summer has come at the least favorable time for the owners of the food-serving premises and time will show whether the slightly more moderate temperatures we had in August will bring the much-needed respite.”
Total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including those newly opened, amounted to 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slowdown in brand growth.

One in five children has secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents
Studies have shown that one in five children — some just 11 years old — have secret social media accounts that they hide from parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 elementary school students showed an increase in the number of “fake Insta” pages
The news has heightened fears that sexual content is being published on them.
Twenty percent of students said they have a “main” account that they show their parents
One in five children — some as young as 11 — set up accounts on social networks that they do not disclose to adults.
A survey of 20,000 elementary school students showed a rapid increase in the number of “fake Insta” accounts – the name refers to Instagram, where you can share photos.
The news has heightened fears that these accounts are used to publish sexual content.
Twenty percent of the students admitted to running a corrupted “main” account that shows up to their parents and also has private accounts.
One of the mothers, who accidentally stumbled upon the secret side of her 13-year-old daughter, encountered a teenager who urged others to “rape her.”
A study conducted in independent schools by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) found that 40 percent of students aged 11 to 18 have two profiles. Half of them admit to having private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, president of HMC, said: “It’s worrying that so many teens are creating their places online where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" on the board of Scottish Athletics
At the annual general meeting of the management of Scottish Athletics, Eilidh Doyle was elected to the board as non-executive director.
Eilidh Doyle is the most-titled Scottish athlete. President Ian Beattie described this move as an excellent opportunity for those who manage the sport to benefit from the rich international experience she has gained over the last decade.
“Eilidh enjoys great respect from the Scottish, British and global athlete community and we are confident that bringing her to the board will bring great benefits to Scottish athletics,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I am very pleased to have the opportunity to give the council the voice of athletes, and I hope that I can really help in the management of sport in Scotland.”
The American, who among his four Olympic gold medals has won 200 and 400 metres at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics and now regularly performs in the BBC as an expert, cannot walk as a result of a transient anaerobic attack.
He tweeted: “I had a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that time will tell if I will recover and to what extent.
It was a quaternary job, but I recovered completely, learned to walk again and went back to training!
Thank you for all your words of support!”
Advertising of lactators, which compares mothers to cows, arouses extreme emotions on the Internet
The company that produces lactators has sparked a storm on the Internet, publishing an advertisement that compares breastfeeding mothers to nursing cows.
To announce the launch of the world’s “first silent lactator to wear underwear,” its manufacturer, Elvie, has published a ridiculous commercial in the form of a video that highlights the freedom it provides to mothers.
It depicts four real mothers dancing in a hay-filled courtyard to a song where you hear the words, "Yes, I hear it, but you can't see the tail" and "If you didn't notice, it's not just my tits."
And the refrain goes like this: “Pump them out, pump them out, feed the children with it, pump them out, pump them out, I hear my masters.”
The advertisement, which was posted on the company’s Facebook page, sparked a lot of controversy on the Internet.
The film currently has 77 thousand views and hundreds of comments. Users express extreme opinions, many of them claim that it is inappropriate to joke about the "horror" that takes place in the dairy industry.
“Using cows to advertise this product was a very bad idea.
Just like people, in order to give milk, they have to get pregnant and give birth to a carcass, with the fact that their babies are taken from them after a few days from birth," wrote one of the users.
Elvie lactator can be worn unnoticed under a feeding bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another person commented: “Of course, this is traumatic for both the mother and the child.
“Of course, let’s use cows to advertise lactators to mothers who can keep their children.”
Someone else added, “This ad is completely detached from reality.”
Others are gunning for the clip — one of the women said she thought the song was “fun.”
“I think it’s a brilliant idea.
If I was still breastfeeding, I'd buy one.
When I was eating, I felt like a cow.
Advertisement is a little crazy, but I'm not looking for another bottom in it.
“It’s a brilliant invention,” someone wrote.
Another commented: “It’s a funny ad for mothers who pull off food (often at work or in the toilet) and feel like ‘cows’.
It is not intended to praise or criticize the dairy industry.”
At the end of the film, it turns out that women danced with lactators discretely attached to their breasts.
The campaign was inspired by the view that many nursing women feel like cows.
Elvie’s lactator, however, is completely silent, has no cables or tubes, and can be worn unnoticed under the feeding bra, giving women freedom to move around, holding children in their hands, and even leaving the house while pulling food out.
Ana Balarin, partner and creative director at Mother, said: “Elvie’s lactator is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative premiere.
Combining lactating women and dairy cows, we wanted to show all the challenges associated with pulling food, while presenting in a fun and consistent way the incredible sense of freedom it provides.
It's not the first time that lactator Elvie has hit the headlines.
During London Fashion Week, during the Marty Jakubowski show, the mother of two children appeared on the runway with this product attached.
Hundreds of Immigrant Children Secretly Moved to Tent Camp on the Texas Border
The number of detained immigrant children is growing rapidly, although the number of people crossing the border each month is virtually unchanged. This is partly due to the harsh rhetoric and rules introduced by President Trump’s administration making it difficult to place children with sponsors.
Most sponsors are usually undocumented immigrants who are afraid of being deported if they apply for a child.
This risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adults residing on the joint farm would take their fingerprints, which would then be handed over to the immigration authorities.
Last week, a senior official at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, Matthew Albence, testified before Congress that his agency had already arrested dozens of people who applied as sponsors for children left unattended.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested were not previously registered.
“Nearly 80 percent of people who are sponsors or live with them in one household are illegally resident in the country, and a large proportion of them are foreigners with criminal backgrounds.
That’s why we’re constantly chasing them,” Albence said.
As part of efforts to speed up the regulation of children, officials have introduced new rules that require some of them to appear in court within a month of detention — not after 60 days, as was the case under previous standards.
A lot will be done through videoconferencing, not in person, to ask an immigration judge to legalize their status.
Those who do not qualify for dismissal will be deported immediately.
According to shelter workers and reports published in recent months, the longer children are in custody, the easier they can become anxious or depressed, which in turn can lead to explosions of aggression or attempts to escape.
Defenders found that these problems are even more serious in larger centers such as Tornillo, where it is easier to ignore the signals that something bad is happening to the child because of its size.
They also added that moving children to a tent camp without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or say goodbye to friends can exacerbate the trauma that many of them are already struggling with.
Syria calls on U.S., French and Turkish "occupation forces" to withdraw immediately
During a speech before the UN General Assembly, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, despite the fact that the war in the country has been going on for eight years.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces are illegally on Syrian soil, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and “we will deal with them appropriately.”
“They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally,” he told the Assembly.
Moualem says the “war on terror is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011, and millions have been forced to flee their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to "lead its sacred battle until the territory of Syria is cleared" of both terrorist groups and "any foreigners illegally staying on it".
There are currently about 2,000 U.S. troops stationed in Syria, mainly engaged in training and advising Kurdish and Syrian forces opposing President Bashar al-Assad.
In addition, there are more than 1,000 French soldiers in the war-torn country.
As for the refugees, Moualem said the conditions were good enough for them to return, and he accused “some Western countries” of “raising irrational fear” that discourages them from returning.
“We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to help with these returns,” he said.
“They politicize things that should have a purely human dimension.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that until President Assad concludes a political agreement with the opposition to end the war, Syria will not receive any reconstruction aid.
UN diplomats say the latest agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last major rebel bastion in Idlib has created an opportunity for continued political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey helped prevent a major attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on a province of three million people.
Moualem stressed, however, that the agreement has a "clear time frame", and expressed hope that military action will be directed against jihadists, including fighters from the Al-Qaeda-linked Levantine People's Defense Front, who will be "eliminated".
The UN envoy, Staffan de Mistura, hopes to soon convene the first meetings of a new commission composed of members of the ruling party and the opposition in order to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and prepare for the elections.
Moualem outlined the conditions for the Syrian government’s participation in the commission, saying the panel’s work should be limited to “verifying the provisions of the current constitution” and warned against interference.
Why Trump Will Win the Election Again
According to this logic, President Trump would be elected to a second term in 2020, unless – as many liberal observers are likely to hope – his presidency ends sooner with a removal from office and a scandal.
It would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic presidential finale so far.”
So far, there are no signs of spectators getting tired.
Since 2014, CNN’s first-team viewing results have more than doubled to reach 1.05 million viewers, and MSNBC has nearly tripled to 1.6 million viewers.
According to Nielsen Fox News, it attracts an average of 2.4 million viewers in the hours of the biggest audience, an increase from 1.7 million four years ago, and the MSNBC broadcast program “The Rachel Maddow Show” has achieved the highest results among the cable television programs, attracting 3.5 million viewers.
“People fly like midgets into the fire — that’s something we don’t understand,” said Neal Bear, the lead producer of ABC’s “Designated Survivor,” about the cabinet secretary who becomes president after the Capitol attack.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedian and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club, has another theory.
She mentions how before the 2016 election she was driving a taxi in Boston.
The driver said he would vote for Trump.
“Why?” she asked.
“Because he makes me laugh,” he replied.
“Chaos has an entertainment value.”
Of course, reports from Washington could, like nothing else shown on television, judge the future of the Roe v. Wade case, the admissibility of connecting immigrant families, or the state of the world economy.
Disconnection is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Besides, it’s not just a matter of being a well-informed citizen of the Washington Post when you watch a panel of experts discussing Bob Woodward’s use of secret whistleblowers when writing The Fear, Paul Manafort’s jacket, and the ostrich-skinned details for $15,000.
I’ll never look at Super Mario the same way I did before.
“What he’s doing is partly reminiscent of the reality show in that it delivers new content every evening,” said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and founder of Pawn Stars, about Trump’s changing cast and daily returns of action (as an attack on NFL D players).
You can't afford to miss the episode because you're going to be late.
When I met Mike Fleisse this week, the weather on the north coast of Kauai, where he has his home, was beautiful, but he was sitting inside, watching MSNBC and recording CNN at the same time.
Not when Brett Kavanaugh was standing before the Senate Judiciary Commission and weighing the future of the Supreme Court.
“I remember doing all these crazy programs before, and people were saying ‘this is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Fleiss told me.
“I thought they were joking, but it turns out they were right.”

Influence of money from the outside on the election campaign to Congress
It is not surprising that, after the reorganization of the electoral districts, as a result of which one post will now become two incumbent congressmen, a river of cash flows into the 17th electoral district in Pennsylvania.
This newly formed suburban district of Pittsburgh represents in Congress a Democrat representative, Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district during last spring’s special election.
Lamb is competing with another current congressman, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the former 12th District of Pennsylvania, which largely coincides with the new 17th District.
The county maps were corrected after a January ruling by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, which ruled that the old counties were unfairly designated, giving Republicans an advantage and being inconsistent with the constitution.
The race in the new 17th district began with a fight to fund the campaign between the party's main funding bodies, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
The name Lamba gained popularity in Pennsylvania after winning a haircut in the widely commented 18th presidential election, which took place in March.
The Republican has been in this position for more than a decade, and Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts have given the Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States considered punishing El Salvador for supporting China, but withdrew from this idea
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, despite slight opposition from Washington.
In June 2017, President Donald Trump held a cordial meeting with the President of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela, and until the expulsion by the partners of the Trump Organization management team, he had a hotel in Panama.
State Department officials have decided to dismiss the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions from El Salvador, Dominican Republic and Panama because of “recent decisions to stop recognising Taiwan,” the department’s spokeswoman, Heather Nauert, said in a statement this month.
However, the sanctions were to be imposed only on El Salvador, which is estimated to have received $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including to fight drugs and support development and the economy.
The proposed sanctions, which would include restrictions on financial assistance and the granting of visas to certain people, would be very severe for this Central American country, which is struggling with high unemployment and high homicide rates.
As international meetings progressed, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity in order to address the conclusions of a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step forward by the United States and the United States.
In mid-September, officials at the highest level of the administration made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, thus cutting off any consideration of sanctions against El Salvador.
Diplomats say that now at the conference, which is currently scheduled for mid-October, Vice President Mike Pence is to speak, which is supposed to be a sign of an invitation to the assembly of representatives of the administration.
Three U.S. envoys returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and Dominican Republic, with no new harsh statements or punishment from Washington.
White House spokesman John Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate, which were presented by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats who, on condition of anonymity, agreed to discuss internal reviews.
Their relationships were confirmed by an external analyst from the administration, who also spoke anonymously.
Learn about history
Another element could be the report by the special prosecutor, Robert Mueller, on the possible obstruction of justice by President Trump, for which concrete evidence is currently available to the public.
According to reports, the Robert Mueller investigation is also investigating whether Donald Trump’s campaign had anything to do with Russia’s attack on the U.S. election.
If the composition of Congress changes, President Trump will be held accountable by him in preparation for re-election, or perhaps even be tried by a jury.
There are a lot of unknowns here, and I don’t want to suggest that Trump’s downfall — nor those in his equal positions in Europe — is inevitable.
All of us on both sides of the Atlantic must make a choice that will decide how long it may take.
In 1938, German officers were ready to carry out a coup d'état against Hitler if only the West resisted him and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed and lost the opportunity to avoid the years of massacres that followed.
The tracks of history revolve around such turning points, accelerating or slowing down the inevitable march of democracy.
There are now several such turning points ahead of the Americans.
What will we do if Donald Trump fires Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man on whom the future of Robert Mueller’s investigation depends?
“Rosenstein has been in trouble since we revealed in our paper last year that he proposed a secret recording of the president and speculated that he was not fit for this office.
According to Rosenstein, the report presented by The Times is inaccurate.
“How will we react if the newly ordered FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh turns out to be incomplete or unfair, or if he is appointed as a Supreme Court judge despite his credible allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And most importantly, will we elect to Congress in the middle of the presidential term those who will hold Donald Trump accountable?
If we do not pass these trials, there will be difficult times for democracy.
However, I believe that we will succeed because of the lesson I have learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my residence as ambassador.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later she sent me to light Shabbat candles on that table marked with a swastika.
Having such a legacy, how could I not look to the future with optimism?”

Rangers player Graham Dorrans is optimistic about the match against Rapid Vienna
The Rangers take on Rapid Vienna on Thursday with the knowledge that the victory against the Austrians, achieved after an impressive draw with Villareal this month in Spain, will significantly increase their chances of qualifying for the Group G European League.
Up to a 2–2 draw with Villareal, a knee injury prevented assistant Graham Dorrans from playing this season, but he believes that the result will work on the Rangers as a trampoline for greater success.
“We did it well because Villarreal is in good shape,” said the 31-year-old.
“We went to this game with the belief that we would achieve something — and we got the point.
Maybe we could have pushed them in the end, but overall the draw is probably a fair result.
The Spaniards were probably better in the first half, but we were better in the second half.
As far as Thursday is concerned, this is another important evening for Europe.
We hope to be able to score three points, but this game will be difficult because our opponent got a good result in his last game. However, I am sure that thanks to the support of the fans, we will pass and we will win a positive result.
The last year was definitely tough because of everything related to my injury and changes in the club itself, but now we all feel good in our places.
The team is great, and the boys really like to play. The training goes well.
I hope we can move on, leave the last season behind and be successful.”
Fear of retirement savings drives women to sleep from their eyelids
Although the respondents knew exactly how they wanted to be treated, few spoke to their family about it.
In a survey conducted by Nationwide, about half of the participants said they had talked to their spouse about the costs of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they don’t talk about it,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide’s life insurance company.
Where to start?
Talk to your spouse and children: You will not prepare your family to take care of yourself unless you express your will beforehand.
Discuss with your counselor and family where and how you want to be cared for, as this choice will be an important factor in determining costs.
Ask a financial advisor for help: He can help you find a way to pay for these expenses.
Long-term care funds can come from a traditional care policy, a hybrid policy that allows you to pay out cash to cover such expenses, or from your own assets — if you have one.
Prepare legal documents: This will prevent court battles.
Appoint a trusted health care representative who will oversee it and ensure that the right people act according to your will if communication becomes impossible.
Also consider hiring a representative who will take care of the finances.
Choose a trusted person, because they will make financial decisions for you and make sure that all the bills are paid if you are not able to do it yourself.
Don’t forget the details: Imagine that your elderly parent suddenly needs medical attention and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medications and allergies?
Write down all the information to have it prepared.
“It’s not just about the finances, it’s about who the doctors are,” Martin asks.
“What medications are you taking?
Who will take care of the dog?
It’s worth having that plan at hand.”
Man repeatedly shot from a wind turbine in Ilfracombe
The man was shot multiple times from the windshield when he came home from an evening party.
The forty-two-ball was located near Oxford Grove in the town of Ilfracombe in Devon County when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and arm.
The police described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST time, as a "random action".
The victim did not see the attacker.
The alleged injuries do not threaten the life of the man. The police ask to report witnesses to the incident.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
According to official reports, at least 384 people died as a result of the massive earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday. The number of victims is likely to increase.
Due to disrupted communications, rescuers were unable to obtain any information from the Donggala kabupatene, which is located north of Palu, closer to the epicenter of the 7.5-degree earthquake.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu after the disaster.
Here are some of the most important information about the city of Palu and the Donggala kabupatene on the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of Celebes Central, a province located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island. According to estimates, in 2017 it was inhabited by 379,800 people.
When the earthquake and tsunami occurred, the city was just celebrating the 40th anniversary of its founding.
Donggala is a kabupaten (administrative unit lower than the province) stretching along the northwest coast of the island for more than 300 km.
It is estimated that in 2017 it was inhabited by 299,200 people.
The main branches of the economy of Central Celebes are fishing and agriculture, which developed especially in the coastal Kabupatenie Donggala.
Another source of income for the province are nickel mines, but they are mainly located in Morowala, on the opposite coast of Celebes.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Relief Agency, the earthquake and tsunami have plagued Palu and Donggal several times over the past 100 years.
In 1938, the tsunami that struck Donggal killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
In 1996, a tsunami killed nine people in western Donggali.
Indonesia is on the active seismic Pacific ring of fire, so earthquakes occur there quite regularly.
The biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake that hit the western coast of Aceh province in northern Sumatra on December 26 caused tsunamis that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people on the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: In late March and early April, a series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra.
Hundreds of people were killed on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake struck south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that struck the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: Near Padang, the capital of Western Sumatra, there was a 7.6 magnitude earthquake.
As a result, more than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck one of the Mentawai islands off the coast of Sumatra, triggering a 10-metre-tsunami wave that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck the Kabupaten Pidie Jaya in Aceh province, causing destruction and panic among people who still remembered the devastation brought by the fatal 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
There was no tsunami this time, but the collapsed buildings killed more than 100 people.
2018: Major earthquakes hit Indonesia’s tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on its northern side.
They have destroyed thousands of homes and brought temporary trouble to thousands of tourists.
Sara Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska Governor and Vice Presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
According to a report released on Saturday by Alaska State Troopers from the town of Wasilla, Alaska, the 29-year-old was arrested on charges of domestic violence, making it difficult to file a complaint and resist arrest.
According to the police report, when a friend of the suspect tried to call the police to report the crime, he took her phone.
KTUU station reports that Palin is in Mat-Su's investigative detention and has a $500 bail.
According to her information last Saturday, he stood before the court, where in his defense speech he stated that he was "certainly innocent".
There are three Class A offenses in Palinia, which means he could face up to a year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He was also charged with a Class B offense, which was punishable by a day’s imprisonment and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time Palin has been charged.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
Then his mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack.
The case is currently pending before the Alaskan Veterans Claims Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, hampering the filing of a complaint and possessing a weapon in a sober state in connection with this incident.
His partner says he hit her in the face.
In 2016, groups of veterans criticized Sarah Palin, who linked her son’s aggressive behavior to the post-traumatic stress syndrome he acquired while serving in Iraq.
Hundreds of people died as a result of the tsunami after the earthquake in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died as a result of Friday's earthquake that hit Indonesia's Celebes island.
A 7.5-degree earthquake caused tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and connectivity are not working and the number of casualties is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred near the central part of the island of Celebes, which is located northeast of the capital of Indonesia, Jakarta.
There are videos on social media showing the moment of the disaster.
When the tsunami hit the coast, there were hundreds of people on the beach in Palu, where the festival was held.
Federal prosecutors demand death penalty for suspected terrorist attack in New York City
New York federal prosecutors are demanding the death penalty for Sayfull Saipov, suspected of carrying out a terrorist attack in New York that killed eight people. This is a rare punishment — it has not been executed in this state for a federal crime since 1953.
To carry out the attack, which took place in October on a bike path running along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, thirty-year-old Saipov allegedly used a rented Home Depot truck that he drove by pedestrians and cyclists on his way.
According to a notice filed in the Southern District of New York of intent to demand the death penalty to justify its necessity, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov “intentionally” killed eight victims and “intentionally” caused serious bodily harm.
According to the court document, both of these charges are liable to the death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, the federal jury presented Saipov with an indictment covering 22 positions, including eight counts of murder in the context of illegal activity — which is a procedure usually used by federal prosecutors in cases of organized crime and after-sales crime.
According to prosecutors, the organization of the attack required "solid planning and reflection". The way in which Saipov conducted it, they called it "monstruous, cruel and immoral".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused injury, damage and loss to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erli, Hernán Ferruchi, Hernán Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Daján"
Five of the victims were Argentine nationals who were in New York for tourists.
The last time the death penalty was imposed in the Southern District of New York was ten years ago.
Prosecutor Khalid Barnes was found guilty of murdering two drug dealers, but finally in September 2009 he was sentenced to life in prison.
The death penalty in a federal case was last executed in New York in 1953 on the Julius and Ethel Rosenbergs. The marriage was executed after two years earlier they were found guilty of conspiracy and espionage in favor of the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
Both Rosenbergs were lost in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, who comes from Uzbekistan, within months of the attack did not show any remorse.
Police say he told investigators that he felt good about what he had done.
According to the indictment, Saipov confessed to the authorities that he was inspired by the ISIS videos he watched on his phone.
According to police, he also demanded that the flag of ISIS be hung in his hospital room.
The indictment, which includes 22 charges, answers that he is innocent.
David Patton, one of the federal defense attorneys representing Saipova, said they were “for obvious reasons disappointed” by the prosecutor’s decision.
“We believe that the decision to demand the death penalty and reject life without the possibility of early release after pleading guilty will only prolong the suffering that these events have brought to all concerned,” he said.
Saipova's defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to demand the death penalty.
Tory MP Says NIGEL FARAGE Should Take Responsibility for Brexit Negotiations
During today’s protest, which took place during the Tory conference, Nigel Farage vowed to “mobilize an army of the people.”
The former leader of the UK Independence Party (UKIP) said politicians must "feel hot" beating Eurosceptics when one of Theresa May's MPs suggested he should take responsibility for negotiations with the European Union.
Conservative MP Peter Bone told protesters in Birmingham that if Farage were the Brexit secretary, “the United Kingdom would already be outside the Union.”
However, joining the tories opting to stay in the community to a separate protest against Brexit taking place in the city further underlined the burden of reconciling their deeply divided ranks before Theresa May.
The Prime Minister is struggling to implement her Chequers compromise plan amidst attacks by Brexit supporters, its opponents, and the European Union itself.
Her allies claim that despite opposition, she will seek to conclude an agreement with Brussels and force eurosceptics and Labour to make a choice between her proposal and “chaos.”
Peter Bone told the Leave Means Leave assembly in Solihull that he wanted to “throw the plan out of Chequers.”
He suggested that the representative should be Nigel Farage, who should be given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
“If it were him, we would be outside the EU now,” he said.
Wellingborough MP added: “I support Brexit, but we have to throw out the plan from Chequers.”
Presenting his opposition to the European Union, he said: “We did not fight in world wars to be subject to someone now.
We want our rights in our own country.”
Peter Bone rejected the suggestion that citizens had changed their minds since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to stay in the Union is completely untrue.”
The demonstration also included supporter of Brexit Andrea Jenkyns from the Tory Party, who told reporters: “I’m just saying, ‘Mrs. Prime Minister, please listen to the people.
The Chequers plan does not enjoy the support of the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, neither do our party or our activists, who populate the streets and who elected us, support it.
Please drop the plan from Chequers and start listening."
In a statement to Prime Minister May, she added: “Premiers keep their positions when they keep their promises.”
Nigel Farage said politicians taking part in the demonstration must “feel hot” if they are to betray the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
“Now it’s a matter of trust between us — the people — and the political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit, and we’re here today to tell them, ‘We’re not going to let you do that.’”
Speaking to the enthused crowd, he added: “I want you to make politicians who are on the brink of Brexit betrayal feel hot.
“We are mobilizing the army of the people of this country, which gave us victory in the Brexit referendum, and we will not rest until we become an independent, independent, proud United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, Brexit opponents marched through the city to the centre, where a two-hour demonstration took place.
A handful of activists waved banners “Tories against Brexit” after forming the group this weekend.
Labour activist Baron Andrew Adonis laughed at the Conservatives for their party app security issues at the start of the conference.
“These are the people who say they can organize information systems and all the technology to operate the Canada plus plus plan, a smooth border, free trade without borders with Ireland,” he added.
“It’s a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he added.
Elizabeth Warren plans to “consider seriously” running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will “consider seriously running for president” after the November election.
As reported by The Boston Globe, a representative of the Democrats from Massachusetts spoke about her future during a meeting with voters that took place on Saturday in western Massachusetts.
Elizabeth Warren, who often criticizes President Donald Trump, will run for re-election in November. Her opponent will be Republican Representative Geoff Diehl, who co-chaired the Trump campaign in Massachusetts during the 2016 election.
It is now said that in the 2020 election, Warren could defeat Trump.
Saturday’s Holyoke event was her 36th meeting with voters in the town hall since Donald Trump took office.
One of the participants asked if he was planning to run for president.
Elizabeth Warren responded that the time had come for “women to go to Washington to fix our corrupt government—and she meant the woman at the top as well.”
Arrest of the killer of LSU team player Wayde Sims
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, on Saturday reported the arrest of a suspect in Friday's shooting in which LSU basketball player Wayde Sims was killed.
The Baton Rouge Police Department reported the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson during a conference held at 11:00 Eastern Time.
On Friday, a video of the shooting was published asking for help in identifying the man on it.
Twenty-year-old Wayde Sims was killed in a shooting near the Southern University campus on Friday morning.
“Wayde Sims was shot in the head with a firearm, resulting in his death,” police chief Murphy J. Paul told 247sports.
Wayde stood up for a friend and was shot by the Simpsons.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being at the scene of the crime, carrying a gun, and shooting at Wayde.
After his arrest, during which he did not resist, he was transferred to the East Baton Rouge Police Department.
Measuring 1.98 m, junior Wayde Sims grew up in Baton Rouge. He played in 32 games, with last season starting 10 times, during which he spent an average of 17.4 minutes on the floor, scored 5.6 points and scored 2.9 goals per game.
Grand Prix of Russia: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title after commanding the team enabled him to win against Sebastian Vettel
Since Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it has become clear that Mercedes’ command will have a major impact on the race outcome.
Bottas, who started from the first field, started very well and almost beat Hamilton, defending his position in the first two laps and forcing Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went down to the service point first and allowed Hamilton to ride in the tail of the pellet, which should decide the fate of the race.
The Mercedes driver went down to boxing in the next lap and appeared behind Vettel, but after the round-by-round action, as a result of which the Ferrari driver reluctantly left the inner part of the lane, risking a push to the defensive after a double movement of the opponent's defense on the third position aimed at defending.
Max Verstappen started from the end of the betting and at his 21st birthday at the end of the first lap he was in seventh place.
Then he drove through much of the race thanks to the fact that he did not change the tires in order to make a quick finish and take Kimi Raikkonen fourth place.
In the end, he went to the service point on the 44th lap, but in the other eight laps he was unable to accelerate.
“It was a tough day because Valtteri did a great job all weekend and he turned out to be a real gentleman when he was told to let me through.
The whole team did their best to take the first two places," Hamilton said.
It was really bad body language.
During a meeting on Saturday, President Donald Trump taunted Senator Dianna Feinstein, who maintained that she had not disclosed the contents of a letter from Christina Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court Judge Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly refer to the statements made by Christina Ford before the Senate Justice Commission. Instead, he stated that what was happening in the Senate showed that people were "ugly, malicious and liars".
“What could have happened is one thing, but this beautiful situation in the Senate, which we have been witnessing for a few days, when we see anger, when we see people who are angry, mean, malicious and lying,” he said.
“We see what has been published and revealed, and then they tell us ‘oh, I didn’t do it.’
I didn't do it.
Do you remember?
Dianna Feinstein, did you reveal that?
Remember her answer... did you reveal the contents of this document? — oh, oh, what?
Oh, no, no, no.
I didn't reveal it."
Wait, wait, wait.
Did we reveal...No, we did not reveal,” he added, slapping the senator.
Dianna Feinstein received a letter from Christina Ford describing the allegations against Kavanaugh in July, and his contents leaked in early September. The senator denies that her office was the source of the leak.
“I didn’t conceal Dr. Ford’s insinuations, I didn’t reveal her story,” Feinstein told the committee.
“She asked me to be discreet, and at her request I did not disclose this content.”
However, her statement did not convince the president, who commented on them during Saturday’s meeting: “I tell you, it was really bad body language.
Maybe she didn’t, but it was the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing to defend a Supreme Court judge candidate whose three women have accused of sexual harassment, the president suggested Democrats are using insinuations for their own purposes.
“They are determined to take over power by all means.
They see vileness, malice, they don’t care who they hurt, who they have to destroy in order to seize power and control,” the president said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars — Belfast Giants 5:3
In a match with Dundee, Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants.
Dundee Stars retaliated on Friday's Elite League loss to the Belfast Giants, winning a rematch at home on Saturday 5:3.
The giants quickly gained a two-quarter lead after the arrows of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie leveled the score, after which Dwyer again led the Giants to the lead.
François Bouchard again leveled the score, scoring a goal for Dundee, after which two goals scored by Lukas Lundvald Nielsen sealed her victory.
This was the third loss in the Elite League season for Adam Keefe, who, despite the initial loss on Friday night, won 2-1 against Dundee in Belfast.
Both teams met for the fourth time this season — the first three games were won by the Giants.
Dwyer's opening goal fell in the fourth minute (3:35) after assisting Kendall McFaull. Four minutes later Beauvillier doubled the score thanks to assisting David Rutherford.
After an intense opening at 13:10, Sullivan brought the hosts back into the game, and then Matt Marquardt tied the score at 15:16.
Dwyer secured the Giants' lead before the first break when he scored his second goal that evening at the end of the first third.
The host team was regrouped and Bouchard again equalized the goal scored during the lead in 27:37 minutes.
At the end of the second third, Cownie and Charles Corcoran jointly helped Nielsen to give the Dundee team the first advantage in this game. Dundee's final victory was sealed in the middle of the last third by the same player who scored the fifth goal for his team.
The giants, who have lost four games in their last five games, will play the next game at their home in Milton Keynes on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies, helping hundreds of people on board the plane to escape the earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller has been called a hero after he died, helping to safely take off a plane with hundreds of people on board.
More than 800 people have been killed and many have been reported missing after a major earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Celebes on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
In the city of Palu, many people have been trapped in the rubble.
Although his colleagues were fleeing, saving their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave the post in the shaky flight control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He remained there to ensure that the Batik Air aircraft (flight number 6321), which was just on the runway, took off safely.
Then he jumped out of the tower when it seemed to him that it was about to collapse.
He died in the hospital.
According to ABC News, a spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said the controller’s decision likely saved hundreds of lives.
We arranged a helicopter from Balikpapan to Borneo to transfer it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, Anthonius left this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“This message has broken our hearts,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the number of fatalities could reach thousands. The National Disaster Relief Agency reports that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
“We believe that the harvest of death continues to increase because many bodies are still under the rubble and cannot be reached,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency, said in a statement.
Tsunami waves spanning six meters destroyed Palu, where a mass funeral of victims will take place on Sunday.
Military and civilian airplanes provide assistance and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Ambulances are constantly bringing in bodies.
There is a shortage of drinking water.
Small shops are being looted.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is rushing to help the survivors, but we don’t know what we’ll find on the spot.
It’s a tragedy, and it could be even worse.”
On Sunday, Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu, addressing the military: “I ask all of you to work day and night to carry out all the tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?” — CNN reported.
This year, Indonesia was hit by an earthquake that killed more than 550 people on the island of Lombok.
Air Niugini plane crash in Micronesia - Air Niugini Airlines reports one person missing after plane crashes in lagoon
Airlines operating the flight that crashed into a lagoon in Micronesia in the Pacific report that one person is missing. Earlier, they claimed that all 47 passengers and crew members were safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini reported that according to data on Saturday afternoon could not count one man who traveled on a feral plane.
They assured that together with local authorities, hospitals and investigators, they were trying to find him.
However, they did not immediately respond to requests for additional details concerning the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
After the plane crashed into the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island airport, local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew members.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said that six more passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday, all in stable condition.
It is unclear what caused the disaster, and its exact course is unknown.
The U.S. Air Force and Navy say the plane landed on a lagoon near the runway.
According to some witnesses, he fell off his belt.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was approaching very low.
“It helped us a lot,” he said.
Jaynes said he and others managed to get through the water reaching the belt to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
According to him, the crew members panicked and screamed, and he himself suffered a harmless head injury.
The U.S. Navy reported that the rescue operation was also assisted by sailors who were working nearby to modernize the coast. With the help of a blown boat, they were able to transport people to the shore before the plane sank to a depth of about 30 meters.
According to data from the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died in the crashes of aircraft belonging to the airlines registered in Papua New Guinea in the last two decades, but there is no Air Niugini among these lines.
Analyst reconstructs the events of the night when a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecution ended presenting evidence in the retrial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett has testified for hours as a forensic expert on information analysis.
He described to the judges how he used cell phone records to recreate the tour of the 29-year-old defendant, Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, from the night she died.
As reported by the newspaper Clarion Ledger, Rowlett said that he obtained location data from various cell phones that showed that on a ferocious evening Tellis was from Chambers, thus refuting his earlier claims.
When the data confirmed that Quinton was supposed to be with his friend, Michael Sanford, while his cell phone was at Jessica Chambers, the police decided to question Sanford.
On Saturday, Sanford testified that he was not in town that day.
When asked by prosecutors if Tellis was telling the truth, he said he was in Sanford’s truck that night, and he said, “He was lying because my truck was in Nashville at the time.”
Another inaccuracy is Tellis’s claim that he had known Chambers for about two weeks.
The mobile phone records showed that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that sometime after Chambers Tellis died, he removed her contact details, as well as texts and calls from her phone.
“He took her out of his life,” Hale said.
The final defense speech is scheduled to begin on Sunday.
The judge said the case was likely to be handed over to the jury on the same day.
The High Breed: What is Hip-Hop?
The hip-hop trio wants to change the negative image of the genre, filling their music with a positive message.
According to the Bristol-based group The High Breed, today’s hip-hop has moved away from its original political and social content.
The band members want to return to its roots and restore the popularity of conscious hip-hop.
Thanks to the work of artists such as Akala and Lowkey, there has been a recent rebirth of artists such as The Fugees and Common in the UK.
Another black one?!
New York babysitter sues couple for firing after ‘racist’ text
A New York nanny sues a couple for firing her from work on a racist background after receiving an erroneously addressed text in which the child’s mother complains that she is “another black person.”
The couple denies that they are racists, comparing the lawsuit to “ blackmail.”
The mother of two children, Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, was clearly dismayed when it turned out that the new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, who appeared on her first day at work in 2016, was black.
“No, another black person,” she wrote in an email to her husband.
However, instead of sending him to him, she mistakenly sent him to Mrs. Maurice twice.
According to reports by the New York Post, when Plasco-Flaxman became aware of the gaffe, she "disgraced" Gisella Maurice, claiming that a warm babysitter, who is an African-American, was doing poorly her duties, and besides, Filipin was expecting her.
Mrs. Maurice was paid a day’s work and then sent home by Uber.
She is now demanding compensation from the couple for a $350-a-day dismissal multiplied by six months for which she was originally employed with a residence, although she did not sign a contract.
“I want to show them that such things are not being done,” she told the Post on Friday, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple denies the allegations of racism, claiming that the termination of cooperation with Ms. Maurice was justified because after they insulted her, they feared they would not be able to trust her.
“My wife sent something to her that she wasn’t going to say.
She's not racist.
We’re not racists,” Joel Plasco told Post.
“Would you entrust your children to someone who you have offended, even if it was by mistake?
Your newly born baby?
Let's go."
Comparing the lawsuit to “ blackmail,” Plasco said his wife had given birth just two months earlier and was in a “very difficult situation.”
“Are you going to blow something like that?
It’s not very nice,” added the investment banker.
Although the case in court is not yet over, the public quickly issued a verdict on social media, criticizing it for its behavior and way of thinking.
The new letter reveals that publishers of Paddington books feared that readers would not feel a connection to the talking mission
The author’s daughter, Michaela Bond, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the warm reception of the book, says about the letter: “It’s hard to stand in the place of the person who read it for the first time, even before the book is published.
It’s really fun now that we know what we know about Paddington’s great success.”
He claims that her father, who, before a little plush bear inspired him to write a children’s book, worked as a cameraman at the BBC, was sure that his work would be rejected. He also adds that after his death last year, the 60th anniversary of the book’s release seems to have “gotten hot”.
About Paddington, who she describes as a “very important member of our family,” she says her father was secretly proud of his success.
“He was a quiet man, he didn’t brag,” he adds.
“However, because Paddington seemed very real to him, it was almost as if you had a child who achieved something — you’re proud of him, even if it’s not your merit.
I think Paddington's success was perceived in this way.
Although he himself invented it and created it, he always gave credit to Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye to her over the phone
After landing, her daughter was taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
“Nad called regularly and said it was really bad, that he probably wouldn’t get out of it,” says Tanya Ednan-Laperouse.
Then he called to say that Natasha was going to die in two minutes, and I had to say goodbye to her.
I did it anyway.
I said, “Tashi, I love you so much.
I'll be at your place soon.
I'll be at your place.
The medications that doctors gave her to maintain her heart function slowly stopped working and were excreted from the body.
She died a while ago, and that was the end of it all.
All I could do was sit there and wait with the knowledge that all of this is developing.
I couldn’t scream or cry or cry because I was among other people.
I really had to hold on.”
In the end, Tanya Ednan-Laperouse, who was already mourning the loss of her daughter, boarded with other passengers, unaware of the pain she was going through.
“Nobody knew,” she said.
I had my head down, and my tears were flowing all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on the plane, I felt an all-embracing sympathy for Nada.
I felt I needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Postcards from women in mourning to help prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women whose loved ones committed suicide try to dissuade others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys place postcards on the Welsh bridge with inspiring news and phone numbers under which people can get help.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 years old when he was depressed, and at the age of 18 he took his own life.
“I don’t want any parent to feel the way I feel every day,” she says.
45-year-old Sharon Davis, who lives in Lydney, says her son was a promising cook with a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew his smile.
They have always said that they can illuminate every room with it.”
Before his death, however, he quit his job because he was “in a really black place.”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother was 11 years old and he was the one who found his brother when he committed suicide.
Ms. Davis says, “I’m still afraid of the domino effect.”
Sharon Davis created cards “to tell people that there are people you can turn to and talk to, even if they’re just friends.
Don’t sit still, talk to someone.”
Kelly Humphreys, who has been friends with Sharon Davies for years, has lost Mark, her 15-year-old partner, shortly after her mother’s death.
“He didn’t say anything that he felt nailed, sad or something,” he says.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
At Christmas he was already in a complete hole. When the children opened the gifts, he even looked at them."
He says that his death was very painful for them, but they had to deal with it: “It breaks a hole in the family.
He's tearing us apart.
But we must continue to live and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance as FBI opens investigation
“I thought if we could actually get what he asked for — a time-limited and limited investigation — maybe we could reach some unanimity,” Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the commission would “divide” into opposing camps.
Why did Brett Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want an FBI investigation?
All their unwillingness comes from the moment.
Elections to Congress are just a few weeks away — November 6th. If, as predicted, Republicans lose them, the chances of electing a certain person to the highest court in the country will significantly diminish.
George W. Bush was already picking up the phone to call the senators and persuade them to support Kavanaugh, who worked for him in the White House and through him met his wife Ashley, who was the personal secretary of the president.
What will happen when the FBI draws up a report?
In the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats, a vote will take place.
It’s unclear if Brett Kavanaugh will win at least 50 senators, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break the impasse and bring him to the Supreme Court.
Under Kim's rule, the number of North Korean refugees is declining.
According to the South Korean lawmaker, since Kim Jong Un took power seven years ago, the number of people fleeing from North Korea to South has fallen.
Citing data from the South Korean Ministry of Unity, Park Byeong-seug said there were 1,127 escapes last year and 2,706 in 2011.
According to him, the key factors that have influenced this situation are closer controls at the border between North Korea and China and higher rates imposed by human smugglers.
Pyongyang has not issued a public statement on the matter.
The vast majority of North Korean refugees are finally being offered South Korea’s citizenship.
According to authorities in Seoul, since the end of the Korean War in 1953, more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally.
Most are fleeing through China, which has the longest border with North Korea, making it easier to cross than the tightly protected Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers refugees to be illegal immigrants rather than refugees, and often sends them back to the country by force.
Relations between the North and the South, which theoretically are still at war, have clearly improved in recent months.
This month, the leaders of both countries met in Pyongyang, where they held talks on negotiations on denuclearization that had previously come to a dead end.
This was after the historic meeting of U.S. President Donald Trump with Kim Jong Un in Singapore in June. The fruit of this meeting is a general agreement on pursuing the cleanup of the Korean Peninsula from nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, North Korea’s Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the United States of failing to make progress on the issue.
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no certainty about our national security and under these circumstances, there is no way we can unilaterally disarm ourselves first," Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and claims he is not fit to work in the Supreme Court
The leader of the minority in the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called the candidate for the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said that he was not by nature fit to work in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi spoke during an interview she gave on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin.
“I think if a woman behaved in this way, she would be considered ‘hysterical,’” Pelosi said of her reaction to the statement Kavanaugh made before the Senate Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations of alleged sexual harassment by Dr. Christina Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
At times, during his introductory speech, Kavanaugh showed strong emotions —almost screaming and losing speech when discussing family issues and high school years.
He also harassed the Democrats from the committee, citing the accusations of a “grotesque and coordinated assault on reputation” by liberals angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh’s testimony showed that he was unfit to work in the Supreme Court because it revealed his bias towards the Democrats.
“I think he disqualified himself by making these statements, as well as by the way he attacked the Clintons and the Democrats,” she said.
Asked if she would try to dismiss Kavanaugh from office if he were nominated and if the Democrats won a majority in the House of Representatives, Pelosi hesitated.
“If he doesn’t tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he should not only sit in the Supreme Court, but also serve in the court where he currently works,” she said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the District Court of Appeals in the District of Columbia.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat she fears Kavanaugh's possible rulings on the Affordable Care Act or the Roe v. Wade trial because he is considered a conservative judge.
During the affirmative hearing, Kavanaugh skipped questions about whether he would revoke certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
“This is not the time to bring a hysterical, biased person in court who will expect us to say ‘but it’s wonderful,’” Pelosi said.
And women have to control it.
It's the right diatribe, months and years of spilling fury, and she can't throw it away without crying.
“We cry when we’re angry,” Gloria Stein told me 45 years later.
“It’s pretty common, isn’t it?”
She added: "I was greatly helped by a woman who was a manager at a company. She said that she also cries when she's angry, but she invented a way that when she gets nervous and starts crying, she says to the person she's talking to 'You probably think I'm sad because she's sad.
I'm mad.
And he's still doing his thing.
I thought it was genius.”
Tears are acceptable as a way out of anger in part because they are basically misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories of one of the first jobs in a male-dominated office is how I once started to cry with an unspeakable rage. A certain elderly woman — a cool driver, who was always a bit scared of me — grabbed me.
“Never let them see you cry,” she said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you're sad, and they're glad they've baked you."
Patricia Schroeder of the Democratic Party, then a member of Congress from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Hart was caught with a lover on a boat called Monkey Business and withdrew from the race, frustrated to the point that Patricia realized she could actually consider running for president on her own.
“It wasn’t a thoughtful decision,” she told me, laughing, 30 years later.
“There were seven other candidates before the election and the last thing they needed was another one.
Someone has called this situation ‘The Snow Queen and the Seven Dwarfs.’”
As the campaign had been going on for a long time, Schroeder lagged behind in raising funds and promised herself that she would not join the race unless she raised $2 million.
It was a battle doomed to lose.
She discovered that some of her supporters, who gave men $1,000, had only $250 for her.
“Do they think I have any discounts?” she wondered.
During her speech, in which she announced that she would not be conducting a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed with emotions — gratitude to the people who supported her, frustration with the system that made it so difficult for her to raise money and turn to her voters for sex, not for delegates, and in public.
“You might think I’ve gone through a nervous breakdown,” she said.
“You might think I’m sponsored by Kleenex.
I remember wondering what they'd write on my grave.
'Crying?'"
What benefits can the economic war between the United States and China bring to Beijing
The sweepstakes starting the economic war between the US and China have been daunting and while the battle is still ongoing, in the long run, the conflict between these countries may be beneficial to Beijing, experts say.
The first warning was issued this year by U.S. President Donald Trump, imposing tariffs on key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation occurred this week following the introduction of new tariffs on goods worth $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), which resulted in taxation of half of all goods entering the US from China.
Each time Beijing reciprocated in nature, recently raising tariffs on US goods worth $60 billion from five to ten percent.
China is determined to respond to every U.S. strike, and it does not look like the second economy in the world is about to give up.
Forcing Washington to withdraw means accepting the demands, but publicly bowing his head to the United States would be too embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, according to experts, if Beijing plays its cards well, the pressure resulting from the U.S. trade war could in the long run strengthen China, reducing dependencies between the two economies.
“The fact that a swift political decision made in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions for economic chaos in any of the countries is actually much more dangerous than previously admitted by observers,” said Abigail Center Grace, an American think tank researcher.
Foreign Minister Says Syria Is 'Ready' for Refugees to Return
The government says Syria is ready for the voluntary return of refugees, and asks for help to rebuild a country devastated by more than seven years of war.
In his address to the UN General Assembly, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country are improving.
“The situation in our territory is now more stable and safe thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
In an effort to restore normality, the government is constantly rebuilding areas destroyed by terrorists.
All conditions have already been met so that refugees who have had to leave the country due to terrorism and unilateral economic developments aimed at their daily lives and livelihoods can voluntarily return to it.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left Syria since the start of the war in 2011.
The other six million people who still live there are in need of humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would gladly accept assistance to rebuild the destroyed country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept aid conditioned or offered by the countries that sponsored the rebellion.
Europe seals victory at the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup, defeating the US team with a score of 16.5 to 10.5 on the Le Golf National in the suburbs of Paris.
On European soil, the United States has lost for the sixth time in a row and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the trophy when under the leadership of the Danish captain, Thomas Bjorn, scored 14.5 points, which were needed to defeat the United States.
The American star, Phil Mickelson, who did not go too well for most of the tournament, hit the ball from the base straight into the water at the 16th hole PAR3, thus giving the match to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari shined through all rounds and became one of four players who, since 1979, when this tournament was held for the first time in the current format, managed to get a 5-0-0 score.
The American Jordan Spieth was eliminated with a score of 5&4 by the lowest ranked player from Europe, Thorbjorna Olesena from Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, who holds the top position in the world rankings, lost two holes before the last hole to Englishman Ian Poulter, for whom it was perhaps the last Ryder Cup tournament.
The European with the largest number of wins in the Ryder Cup was the Spaniard Sergio Garcia, who has already participated in eight such tournaments and scored 25.5 points in his career.
“I usually don’t cry, but today I can’t stop.
It's been a tough year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for believing in me and choosing me.
I am very happy to have the cup back.
It’s a success for the whole team and I’m glad I was able to help,” Garcia said after the European team’s victory.
He handed the stick over to his father-in-law, John Rahm, who defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods in a 2&1 game on Sunday.
“I’m incredibly proud to win against Tiger Woods, and I grew up watching his game,” Rahm, 23, said.
Woods has lost all matches in France and now has 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
This is an unprecedented statistic, as for one of the greatest players of all time, who won 14 of the most important titles and only ceded to Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had trouble finding a runway throughout the weekend, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played at a really high level throughout the tournament.
After the disappointing performance of the American line-up, his captain, Jim Furyk, said: “I’m proud of the boys, they fought.
At some point this morning, we squeezed a few Europeans.
We pulled back.
Hats in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All of his 12 players played really well.
Together with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Commission, we will find a way to move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
I'm full of admiration for the opponents.
They played a lot better than us.”
Information on flowering — in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota plankton density decreases
A recent report by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows a general decline in plankton density in some parts of the Gulf of Tampa.
According to the FWC, the presence of the streaked flower has been recorded in the counties of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier, suggesting that its density is decreasing.
It spans about 209 kilometres of coastline, from the north of Pinellas County to the south of Lee County.
The highlights can be found about 16 kilometers from the coast of Hillsborough County, but compared to the previous week in fewer places.
The inflorescence was also observed in Pasco County.
Last week, the average concentration of the County's low-plankton county near the coast and in the waters of Pinellas County was recorded, low to medium near the coast of Hillsborough County, natural to high in Manatee County, natural to high in coastal and in the waters of Sarasota County, natural to medium in the county of Charlotte County.
Airway irritation is still reported in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier counties.
Last week, however, there were no reports of them in northwest Florida.
