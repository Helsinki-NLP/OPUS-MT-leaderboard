And Moses said, As thou hast said, so shall it be; I will not see thy face any more.
And Moses said, When I go out of the city, I will stretch out my hands unto Jehovah; and thunder shall cease, and there shall be no hail, that thou mayest know that the land is Jehovah's.
And Moses said, I beseech thee, O LORD, I have not spoken since yesterday, nor since yesterday, nor since the day that thou spakest unto thy servant; for I am a slow and a slow tongue.
Moses said: » Even if you give us the sacrifices and burnt offerings that we offer to Jehovah our God, our flocks will also go with us. There will not be any of them left. We will take from them what is necessary for the service of Jehovah our God. We do not know what to offer until we come to this place. «

Thou shalt not swell like water, for thou hast gone up to thy father's bed, and hast made my bed unclean.
If I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but do not have love, I am a clanging brass or a clanging cymbal.
Thou hast broken my heart in one of thy eyes, and in one of the furrows of thy neck.
Thou shalt bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of thy inheritance, in thy dwelling place, which thou hast made, O Jehovah, holy, O Jehovah, which thy hands have established.
And ye shall keep this word as a statute for you and for your sons forever.
And thou shalt live by thy sword, and shalt serve thy brother: and the time shall come, when thou shalt cut off his yoke from off thy neck.
Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I am Jehovah thy God, the God of jealousy, who visiteth the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me, and who sheweth mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and keep my commandments.
Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour.
Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house; thou shalt not covet his wife, nor his servant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor anything that is his.
Thou shalt not go up by the steps to my altar, lest thy shame be revealed.
Thou shalt not make thee a graven image, or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the waters under the earth.
Do not steal.
Thou shalt not take the name of Jehovah thy God in vain; for Jehovah shall not hold him guiltless who takes the name of Jehovah his God in vain.
