Barack Obama is the fourth President of the United States to receive the Nobel Peace Prize
US President Barack Obama is coming to Oslo, Norway for 26 hours to receive the Nobel Peace Prize as the fourth U.S. president in history.
In addition, he receives the diploma as well as the medal and a check of over $1.4 million for his extraordinary efforts to intensify world diplomacy and cooperation among peoples.
The head of the White House arrives tomorrow with his wife Michelle in the metropolis of northern Sweden and will be busy all the time.
He first visits the Nobel Institute, where he meets for the first time with the five committee members who elected him in October from 172 people and 33 organizations.
The presidential couple then scheduled a meeting with Norwegian King Harald V and Queen Sonja.
In the afternoon, the visit reaches its climax with the ceremony, at which Obama takes over the prestigious prize.
He is the fourth president of the United States, but only the third to receive the award directly in office.
The White House has already announced that Obama will talk about the war in Afghanistan when he takes over the prize.
The president does not want to evade this issue because he knows that he is taking over the award as a president who is currently waging war in two countries.
He has stepped up the war effort a few days ago by sending more troops to Afghanistan, which none of his critics forget to highlight.
At the ceremony, Obama also received the goal medal, the diploma and the check of over ten million Swedish kronor (about 24 million Czech kronor).
He intends to donate the money for charitable purposes, but has not yet decided on a concrete charitable work.
The event programme will then include a banquet with the President and his wife, with the Prime Minister and another 250 invited guests in addition to Norway’s King and Queen.
Obama was very cautious about the price from the start.
For example, he stated that he felt that he did not fully deserve the prize.
He also reiterated several times that the price is not only for him, but for all who aspire to the same values as him.
Immediately after the announcement, he stated that for him this is a "call to action".
Conservationists accused of blackmail
The Leitmeritz police accused the president of the civic association "Naturschutzgemeinschaft Leitmeritz" of extortion.
In several cases, he filed appeals against some construction procedures last year, for the withdrawal of his appeals he demanded money from the investors in his favor, said the Leitmeritz police spokeswoman, Alena Romova.
The chairman of the Leitmeritz Naturschutzgemeinschaft is Lubomir Studnicka.
He is now in prison and faces a prison sentence of up to three years.
The sorting garbage containers in Brno do not smell good
In Prague, people can sort the beverage packaging, in the South Moravian towns you can find again on the move and step the sorting garbage containers.
And in Brno?
There you would have to reserve a few minutes to find the appropriate trash cans.
I do not want to say that the waste separation in Brno would not work at all.
But it seems to me that the Councils do not care enough about this problem, even though we are the second-largest city in the Republic.
Brno is located in the waste separation in the Urwaldliga, not only because we as citizens here are always allowed to dispose of only paper, glass and plastics in the sorting containers, but above all because of the number of tons of waste for such waste.
For example, have they ever tried to dispose of PET bottles in a collection basket in the center?
This is art, especially it takes time and strong nerves.
The only place I have found so far by chance is the Moravian place opposite the affected goose.
Mr Onderka should not bother us with his colleagues, but I think that is far too little.
Apart from the fact that the waste separation is not honeycomb in other parts, too.
Whole ranks of my friends would rather not sort the waste at all.
Out of laziness.
They are too far away from the garbage cans.
I'm not surprised.
Even after the celebration, I offered to dispose of a few glass and plastic bottles.
But on Konicova street I saw no color garbage cans in sight.
Fortunately, I came to the right place on the tram.
The garbage was almost over.
This is still the center of Brno, which represents the whole city, isn’t it?!
However, ecology and some kind of aesthetics probably leave the Brno Socialists cold.
They'd rather buy the city an ice hockey league that would embarrass us all over the republic, rather than buying a few more barrels of garbage and offering the sorting of other raw materials for a cleaner brun.
I am glad that I was able to confirm my assumption with official statistics after I searched the Internet for a while.
According to the data of the company EKO-KOM, Brno is really the worst in the entire district of South Moravia.
The "Paroubek" budget has withdrawn the money for pensions and sickness benefits
After the left party gave more money to farmers and officials, despite the government’s view, there is no money in the budget for pensions, sickness and construction savings.
But also not for public debt or for international litigation.
This is causing even more problems for those who will be in government in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and Communists enforced the salary increase for some groups, they expected the government to borrow extra money for sensitive expenses, old age pensions or sickness benefits. "This is just a postponement of the problems in the future, mine laying," says Janota.
In fact, the loans pay higher and higher interest rates, and you have to repay the money at some point.
Too much to choose from, the treasury is empty.
If the social benefits or costs for the state enterprise are not reduced, the tax must be increased.
For all those to whom the left party now gave more money: the fire department, the teachers, the farmers.
And later for their children.
In order for the pensions or sickness benefits, from whose account 1.8 billion have disappeared, people do not need to be afraid, they get this money.
But at the price that the state owes even more - next year, not only 163 billion will be missing in the state treasury, but much more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota, the debt will increase more and more quickly and, together with this, the costs and interest.
The state will need the money to compensate, then it will not be enough to increase VAT only slightly or to reduce maternity allowances, as the government did in its counter-deficit package.
Due to the money laundering in favour of some electorate groups, five billion will also be missing next year for the expansion of highways and railways.
These are mainly the sections won in competition, which can no longer be redesigned and possibly cheapened.
At most, get what is not free.
This means delay or stoppage of thirty large buildings, Europe’s money creation is also at risk, warns the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka.
The CSSD has proposed that it solve the outflow of money salomonically - it attacks the CEZ stock dividends, in which the state owns the majority, and from these the money is then disbursed to the transport funds.
The problem is that the amount of the dividend is never certain and it is by no means an infinite source.
Last year, CEZ contributed $18 billion to the budget.
Annually, the dividends are used to pay the environmental damage liquidations, the pension account is replenished and this money also serves as a reserve for the planned pension reform.
This trick also increases the actual budget deficit to the level of 5.7 percent of GDP according to EU rules.
This is not the end of the carnival of revolutions.
Nearly three billion cut the budget for various compensations for victims of communism and crimes, or for expenses for litigation, even for building savings.
Whether the state can do without this money is not certain.
This is pure gambling.
“If we lose an international lawsuit, we have to pay for it anyway,” Janota said.
The minister must then save the money internally or, in the worst case, attack the government budget reserves.
Hundreds of millions are also missing for the two-billion-dollar project "Staatskasse", which is supposed to allow on-line monitoring, for which the individual authorities spend the money.
The first stage starts in January.
Should the finance minister not find the money elsewhere, the project would have to be stopped and in this case sanctions would come, warned Janota.
Your next smartphone will dominate two operating systems
The Americans expect for the future a mobile phone on which the user can switch between different operating systems by pressing a single button.
The plans presented look promising.
It is enough to press a button, and from Windows Mobile will be in a few seconds in the change Android.
It is precisely this possibility that the American company VMware wants to present, which focuses mainly on the development of virtual software for computers.
We allow you to run two user profiles at the same time on your mobile phone.
You can switch between these, you can separate them into two home and work profiles.
Both will work in parallel, Srinivas Krishnamurti of VMware pointed out in an interview for the magazine Computerworld.
It was presented in November last year and presented for the first time a few days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
The virtualization of smart phones is not fiction.
VMware has already successfully introduced the smartphone test pattern to journalists with two operating systems.
One was a modified Nokia N800 with 128 MB of RAM, running the mentioned systems Windows Mobile and Android simultaneously.
The development of new technology for mobile phones is in full swing.
Now VMware is working with the European and American operators on the virtualization of smartphones and to the customer the devices are expected to come within the year 2012.
The lack of snow in the mountains afflicts the hotel owners
Sneeless slopes not only worry the inhabitants of the Giant Mountains.
The lack of snow also scares people away from ordering ski stays in hotels and pensions.
That's why you can still get free rooms for all winter dates in the Giant Mountains incl. Christmas and New Year's Eve.
Our pages are frequently visited.
People go through the offers, fix the prices, but now they are afraid to order binding.
And when they call us, they immediately ask if in our opinion this year's Christmas will be on snow or "on match", said the operator of the information portal Spindl.Info, Martin Jandura.
If you want the New Year’s Eve stay in the Spindelmühle exactly according to your expectations, you should not hesitate with the order.
Those who prefer saving and whose quality of stay comes in second place can try to wait a few more days.
The Spindelmühle hotel owners now offer mainly weekly stays for New Year’s Day.
I think they’ll try to sell them for a while, but then they’ll have to give in, too, and go into shorter times.
And then the free rooms will quickly fade, Jandura appreciated.
Free beds on all winter dates are always offered by the travel agency Ingtours in Vrchlabi.
Now we are most interested in the Christmas week, which is not yet sold out.
In our offer, about half of the seats are still available.
That is why we have already prepared some cheaper Christmas stays for the last minute, said the director of the travel agency Ingtours, Petr Schiefert.
On New Year’s Eve in the Giant Mountains, the Vrchlabi travel agency can still offer you, but there are fewer vacancies here.
Good sales also find the first fourteen days in February, the remaining winter dates are sold on average.
This year, interest in winter holidays is also negatively affected by the fact that there is always no snow in the Giant Mountains.
People are waiting to see if snow is falling.
No one wants to spend the end of the year in the mountains without snow.
Should the slopes be snowy within a week, Christmas will also be sold out, says Schiefert.
Conversely, and slightly better than last year, it is possible to occupy the rooms at the Hotel Horizont in Pecpod Snezkou.
We are about 5% better than last year.
On New Year's Day and Christmas, we only have a few free rooms.
There is great interest in the Polish holidays in Janua, and in February the business will also run well, informed the director of the best Pec-Hotel, Karel Rada.
At 80 percent for the New Year’s Eve stays, the Hotel Omnia is also occupied at the central parking lot in Janske Lazne.
On the other hand, half of the beds are still available at the newest hotel in Janske Lazne at Christmas.
We were pleasantly surprised this year in January, for which we are already about 60 percent occupied.
February is a little weaker now, but the moment when the snow comes, interest in staying in the Giant Mountains is certainly increasing, said the director of the Omnia Hotel, Erik Sporysch.
In the meantime, the hotel owners of the Giant Mountains are waiting for a bigger snowstorm.
On Thursday it should cool down and if there is rain, it should be snow on the mountains.
But after that, there will be another warming, Jiri Jakubsky from the location of the Czech Weather Office in Hradec Kralove reported.
USA: Repeat is the mother of wisdom
It’s almost funny with what student enthusiasm Barack Obama, the president with his reputation as the smartest, repeats his predecessor’s strategy in the Afghanistan issue, which he himself considered the dumbest.
When he finally scrapped his long-awaited Afghanistan doctrine, it turned out that he copied it from the Bush-Iraq scenario three years ago.
Not only did he use the wording “as in Iraq” several times in the text itself, he even used the name of the January 2007 Bush Declaration as the name of his own declaration: “New Way Forward” without perplexing.
Three years ago, he criticized Bush’s idea of sending fresh troop contingents into civil war-torn Iraq as an “irresponsible and, in its aftermath, catastrophic decision.”
The following months, however, showed that the Bush strategy, based on military recommendations, was the only possible and very successful one, insofar as it is no longer spoken of in the news about Iraq at all today.
Bush’s reputation was not improved because objectively he left his successor with a much more grateful starting position than expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes that the miracle will repeat itself.
In order to increase the troop contingent, the military asked him again, especially the commander-in-chief of Afghanistan-Operation General Stanley McCristal, who even despite the subordination habits, harshly criticized the deafening snipers in the White House.
He called for 40,000 soldiers to reverse the situation for the better.
The president hesitated for three months, but did not come up with a better idea, and so he cheated the general of the Wenigens by 10,000 soldiers.
From Europe, he pressed the pledge for another 5,000, even though he himself originally expected at least 10,000.
What is most problematic about the entire Obama strategy is his plan to withdraw troops from Afghanistan in 18 months and complete this process within three years. The entire Obama doctrine leaves more questions than answers.
Some doubt that the half-intensification will have the same effect as the measure in Iraq.
Despite the Brotherhood War of recent years, the Iraqi society is relatively well structured, its leaders honor the values.
The Afghan situation is shaped by the contraindication - no one can be trusted and no agreements are made.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces, who are accustomed to changing their minds every day.
The political institutions, even if they were formally established correctly, remain only imaginary structures behind which patriarchal tribal relations will continue to grow.
The balance of interests between the different ethnic groups is unusually complicated, especially due to the opaqueness of the conditions that further complicate the Pakistan and Iran influences.
The construction of a "capable state", which is the minimalist goal of the whole operation, is also very unrealistic.
Time horizon of Obama strategy alienated by his volunteerism
Over the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only further deteriorated and is now on the brink of explosion.
To believe that the little soldiers who have erupted into the war cry about the "early return" can create a miracle here, only a truly romantic soul that is not impressed by the facts.
From a political point of view, setting the date for the withdrawal of troops is pure irresponsibility, because the Taliban will take it as an indirect confession of American defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that the Europeans’ willingness to participate in the battles in Afghanistan is dwindling.
Europe’s politicians cannot and do not want to explain to their voters how the security of Germany or Italy is related to the war in the Hindu-Kush Mountains.
Another possible factor that can radically affect the situation is the development of events in Iran.
Should the situation continue to deteriorate and the increased sanctions against the Iranians do not work, the United States faces a very serious question as to whether the problem cannot be solved with troops.
This question needs to be answered during the period when America is moving towards Obama’s withdrawal from Afghanistan.
But any solution will also mean a dramatic shift in the Afghan situation.
The only consolation for Barack Obama is the fact that three years remain until the presidential election, and thus there is still enough time for him to resort to a different strategy if it turns out to be a total failure.
Goldman Sachs managers no longer receive cash bonuses
The executives of the American bank Goldman Sachs will no longer receive bonuses in cash this year.
This was announced by the company, which is responding to sharp criticism of its wage practices.
A group of 30 top managers receive shares instead of the money, which can only be sold in five years.
In addition, the shares can be withdrawn from the manager in the event that they act excessively risky.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs is at the forefront of efforts to combine Wall Street premium bonuses with long-term performance.
I believe Wall Street is aware of the further direction in which it has to go, former JPMorgan banker Douglas Elliott said.
The problem lies in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs was the target of criticism after setting aside nearly $17 billion in bonuses for the first three quarters of this year.
The total amount of bonuses this year is likely to exceed $20 billion, according to Reuters, despite the measure announced today.
High bonuses in the banking sector have become the hottest political issue in a number of countries since the start of the financial crisis.
Britain reported on Wednesday that it intends to charge the bankers’ bonuses, which exceed <0xC2><0xA3>25,000, once at a tax rate of 50 percent.
France is also taking similar steps.
This year, women have won Nobel Prizes in all disciplines except physics.
In Stockholm, five women took over this year’s Nobel Prizes in the categories of science and literature from the hands of the King of Sweden Carl XVI Gustaf.
Among the four scientists was the German writer of Romanian descent, Herta Müller, among them.
Two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, together with their compatriot Jack Szostak, have won the Nobel Prize in Medicine for their research in chromosomes.
The prize for chemistry was awarded to the Israeli Ada Jonath, along with the Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz, for enlightenment of the ribosome structure and function.
The last laureate awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics, which the American Elinor Ostrom and her compatriot Oliver Williamson received for analyses of the economic report.
The only category in which no woman received a Nobel Prize this year was physics.
Today, scientists Charles Kao and George Smith, together with Willard Boyl, have won this award for the invention of the CCD chip, which is the basis of all digital cameras, fax machines or astronomical telescopes.
Each of these laureates has received the diploma, the Nobel Medals and certificate of acquiring the Money Prize.
This amounts to ten million Swedish kronor in each category.
If there are several prize winners in each category, the prize money is divided among them.
Traditionally, US President Barack Obama has received the most-anticipated Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo this afternoon.
In his speech, he acknowledged the controversy surrounding his appointment because he is only at the beginning of his journey and is also at the forefront of the country, which is waging two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
In keeping with his policy, however, he added that wars are necessary in certain situations for the achievement of world peace, even if the price for it is high.
Minister Janota is considering resignation. Klaus invited him to the castle
President Vaclav Klaus welcomes Finance Minister Eduard Janota early on Friday, reflecting on his stay in the government because he disagrees with the execution of the state budget for the next year in the form released by the House of Representatives on Wednesday.
It is assumed that the budget and perhaps also Janota’s stay in the cabinet will be the topics of the Friday meeting.
The budget is also criticized by Klaus.
According to him, the state deficit is too high, which also deepens the crisis of public finances.
Speaker Radim Ochvat informed about the meeting.
On Monday, Janota wants to negotiate with the Prime Minister, Jan Fischer, about his continued position.
According to the budget law, which Klaus now receives for signature, the Czech Republic should save with a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
But on Wednesday, the parliament voted on the left-wing party’s money-laundering proposals and increased the money for civil servants’ salaries, for the maintenance of social benefits and direct wages for farmers.
The government has opposed the proposals of Social Democracy that they covertly increase the budget deficit.
Between the left party on the one hand and the government, Klaus and the right party, on the other hand, a sharp domestic political dispute arose, therefore the question arises about the further work of the Fischer-Official Cabinet, on the formation of which the ODS, CSSD and Green Party have been in the spring.
Critics argue that the budget, as it was adopted by Parliament, virtually liquidated the austerity package enforced by the Fisheries Government in the fall, and that, according to their understanding, it is intended to end the sovereign debt.
Klaus, who can sign the law on the state budget but does not have to, explained at a discussion breakfast with the entrepreneurs today that politicians have long neglected the "serious problem" that constitutes "the unsustainable deficit" of public finances.
In his opinion, there is no good solution today.
An improvement could only bring about a strong government that could build on a broader consensus of political parties.
The ODS chairman, Mirek Topolanek, noted that the budget is grim, and the government should weigh their continued existence.
ODS Deputy Chairman Petr Necas told the CTK that the concept of the official cabinet with the support of the CSSD, ODS and the Green Party obviously no longer works.
Prime Minister Fischer described similar words in the editorial as "strong utterances".
The head of the CSSD, Jiri Paroubek, responded to Topolanek’s words that the state deficit was horrific, that the former government of Topolanek had prepared for this year, and that it exceeded 200 billion crowns.
On Wednesday, the CSSD rated the approval of the state budget for the next year as a success.
The People’s Party was also satisfied.
Mandela as Clint Eastwood in Morgan Freeman's new film
The South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film "Invictus: The Undefeated" shows the world much of the country, of its struggle and victories despite some criticism that the main role was occupied by an American actor.
The story tells about sport, race and about Nelson Mandela.
The relentless fighter against the racist apartheid system in the South African Republic and its first black president, Nelson Mandela, represents in his life story the American Oscar actor, Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said he was asked by ninety-one-year-old Mandela if he could portray him in the Eastwood film.
Matt Damon plays another important role.
I told him, "If I'm going to play you, I'll have to meet you.
The seventy-two-year-old actor, who received the award for his role in the Eastwood drama from the boxing section "Million Dollar Baby", was already the leader of the movement for the abolition of slavery, from which in the end he became the slaveholder, a fictional US president, but also as important to many as Levan Ledela.
The former South African statesman was imprisoned for 27 years for his active activity in ending apartheid in the South African Republic.
He was set free in 1990 and for four years became president of the country.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
"Invictus" is the Latin word for "unbeaten", and at the same time it is the name of a poem by the English author William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The requirement was how to speak
The film depicts a true event in which Nelson Mandela joined forces with the captain of the South African rugby team, Francois Pienaar, to unite the country. The new President Mandela knows that his people remain racially and economically divided even after apartheid.
He believes that he can unite his people through sport, so he decides to unite the rugby players who belong to the outside world.
Finally, the South African team rises to the 1995 World Cup.
Freeman worked for several years to bring Mandela's story to the screen.
He had no other goal than to play this role in such a way as to bring it as close to reality as possible, Freeman said.
The biggest challenge, of course, was to speak like him.
The actor said that if he and the world politician were in the same country, he would try to meet with Mandela, have dinner with him and be behind the scenes in front of his speech.
The most important thing for him was to shake Mandela’s hand.
I’ve found that when I shake your hand, I take over your energy, it’s being transferred, and I felt like I know what you’re feeling, he said.
It’s important to me to become a different person.
In the film, Matt Damon portrays François Pienaar, captain of the national rugby team in which the white players have prevailed.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for the role in the tough rugby world.
It was a big surprise for him when he first met Pienaar in his house.
I remember when I rang the doorbell that he opened and the first thing I said to François Pienaar in my life was, 'In the movie, I look a lot bigger.'
Despite the obvious differences in the stature of the actors compared to their actual role models, he has received positive reviews under the direction of director Eastwood "Invictus: Unbeaten" and there is also talk of prospects for an Oscar.
The Daily Variety film critic Todd McCarthy summed up his assessment in the following words: "This was a very good story, very well-executed film."
In the movie reviews on the web sites rottentomatoes.com, Invictus has received 76% positive reviews.
The secret of light about Norway: the Russians have tested a rocket
A special light effect of unknown origin was observed in Norway.
The Russian Ministry of Defense admitted yesterday that an intercontinental ballistic missile was being tested near the Norwegian border.
But the launch was unsuccessful again and the rocket, which was originally supposed to be the pride of the Russian army, will slowly become the nightmare of the Russian generality as well as of the Prime Minister, Vladimir Putin.
His repeated presence on site during the missile test did not have a positive effect on the success of the test flights.
Bulava has not been launched or damaged in the air at all.
In the Russian newspapers it is already written about "Bulava" as about a "missile that does not fly".
A rocket that does not fly, but lights up
This 13th attempt was normal at the beginning.
It was only at the end of the flight that technical damage to the rocket occurred.
Probably the engine exploded in the third stage rocket.
This time, "Bulava" was launched from the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donsky, which sailed under the waters of the White Sea.
This type of rocket allows the launch from the submarine.
Therefore, it is likely that the mysterious light over northern roads caused by an indefinite flying object was actually the damaged "Bulava".
In addition, the Norwegians have not doubted from the first moment that it is a Russian missile.
The generality has been wary of this, claiming that one cannot speak clearly of a failure.
The first two stages of the rocket did not fail and only the third stage was affected by the accident.
In the previous cases, the engines were immediately damaged in the first stage.
Even if no test start was made without error, the Department of Defense’s leadership considers only six out of thirteen unsuccessful.
The nearly fifty percent success therefore fulfills the generality with optimism and so it continues to be claimed that the "Bulava" will fly once without problems and will even carry up to ten hypersonic nuclear warheads with a total weight of up to 1.15 tons.
The legendary Fetisov has signed an annual contract with the CSKA Moscow at the age of 51
At the age of 51, legendary defender Vjaceslav Fetisov is once again introducing himself to a professional ice hockey game.
The former World Champion, Olympic winner and Stanley Cup owner is helping his team CSKA Moscow in need, and is likely to play in the Friday duel KHL against Petersburg.
Fetisov, who completed his career at the age of forty, in 1998, is currently president of the CSKA.
After Denis Kulja’s injury, we urgently need another defensive player.
Fetisov has regularly trained and agreed that he will support the team.
We only need to clarify some remaining formalities, the agency AP quoted the coach of the Moscow club of Sergei Nemcinov.
Meanwhile, it is unclear whether the comeback of the famous ice hockey player will affect only one game.
I think that Fetisov is one of those who can raise the morale of other players, said teammate Nemcinov.
When Fetisov returns to the ice, he will become the oldest professional Russian ice hockey game according to AP.
In the NHL, legendary striker Gordie Howe played an entire season for Hartford at the age of fifty-one and was able to score 15 goals and 26 assists.
The oldest of the famous Five, Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov, is one of the best and most successful ice hockey players in history.
In the Soviet Union, he has won two Olympic gold medals, seven World Championship titles and has also triumphed in the Canada Cup as well as in the Junior World Championship.
In the second part of his career, he also garnered success in the NHL, where he twice lifted the Stanley Cup in the Detroit dress.
He has been a member of the Ice Hockey Star since 2001.
Hyundai surrendered to the unions. All overtime will be cancelled
The management of the Hyundai Nosovice Automotive Factory agreed with the union to abolish all overtime.
Due to frequently scheduled overtime, the union announced its willingness to strike on Monday.
This was confirmed by the spokesman of the Hyundai Automobile Factory, Petr Vanek.
However, the management wants to agree with the unions on a Saturday shift this week.
We can’t give up our manufacturing plan, that’s a principle, so on Saturday, December 19, voluntary overtime was proposed for the reason that two layers of work would be worked, Vanek said.
The website Sedmicka.cz wrote that the company has offered a bonus of 400 CZK to employees who would work on the Saturday shift.
It will also be available to employees in retrospect for the Saturday class of November 28th.
According to Vanek, the company has decided to change the motivation of employees for the proposed overtime hours.
Either they can pay the overtime surcharge or they can take a replacement holiday on December 28 to extend the Christmas holidays, Vanek said.
In addition, all employees of the Saturday class will be paid the fare and lunch.
Given that the overtime was the most urgent and ardent point regarding demands and complaints of the unions that had stopped production last week, the management decided yesterday afternoon with immediate effect on the cancellation of all overtime for the month of December, Van<0xC4><0x9B>k said.
Until last week, the employees of the automobile factory had been forced to work almost every day for two extra hours after the eight-hour shift.
From the signing of the agreement, the strike will be revoked by the trade unions.
Further negotiations between the management of the automobile factory and the unions are expected to take place on Friday afternoon.
The union leader, Petr Kuchar, said on Wednesday that if they can agree on meeting the demands and sign a joint document, they are ready to lift the strike readiness.
The situation in the automobile factory spiked last week, on Wednesday, when about 400 employees spontaneously went on strike due to constant overtime.
They also protested against poor payment terms and alleged harassment.
The management, on the other hand, felt that employees had to do the overtime to meet the automotive supply needs.
The unions also demanded in their Monday strike call that employees who had stopped production on Wednesday were not subjected to sanctions.
In the area of overtime, unions are demanding that overtime work be reduced to a minimum.
In addition, they are demanding to pay the fee of 5000 crowns this year.
The Hyundai Nosovice Automotive Factory now employs 2,000 people.
Serial production started at the company in November last year.
Up to this September, approximately 80,000 vehicles were produced here, the current production capacity is 200,000 vehicles per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that also works in 'steeled' HIV viruses
The team of Czech and German scientists is testing new compounds to prevent the spread of HIV viruses in the body.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also works with viruses that are already resistant to drugs.
This fact outweighs the disadvantage that the compound does not act as strongly on common virus variants as one of the existing drugs.
The disease AIDS cannot be cured.
However, the drug composition can prolong the life of the patient and prevent the proliferation of HIV viruses in the body.
However, your intake is accompanied by a whole series of side effects.
Incomplete suppression of virus proliferation also results in the development of so-called resistant viruses, against which no drugs are more effective.
The work of experts from three institutes of the Academy of Sciences CR, from the VSCHT (Chemical and Technological University) Prague and from the University of Heidelberg opens the way for dealing with virus resistance.
They have demonstrated that the substances called metalocarboranes act on the protein responsible for the multiplication of the HIV virus.
Metalocarbons are compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block virus proliferation in a different way than all drugs used today, so they can overcome the resistance problem.
In their work, scientists arrive at new "improved" compounds, which were prepared based on the knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their binding to the virus protein.
The metalocarbons have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multifaceted cages consisting of boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms coupled by a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
Homeopathic and persistent virus
HIV protease is a protein of the HIV virus, which is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without the cleavage of the HIV virus caused by the HIV protease, no mature infectious virus particles would form.
When we turn off the HIV protease, we also turn off the multiplication of the virus in the patient's body, the scientists explain in the press release published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences CR.
In the paper, published in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, the scientists describe whole series of compounds in which two pairs of cages (see table) are coupled by a short organic chain, which is then systematically further altered.
A little weaker, but more reliable
The effect of this series of substances against the HIV protease was tested in the test tube, also against their resistant (resistant) variants, which were obtained from HIV-infected patients.
The effect of metalocarborane on the usual enzyme variant is not as strong as with the clinically used drugs, but it does not lose its effect on the resistance variants, against which the drugs used are often ineffective.
The unique mechanism of action as well as its other properties, such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of further chemical formations, makes the metallocarboranes interesting compounds for further research aimed at the development of effective drugs against HIV, says Pavlina Akgenetik, Head of the Institute of Biochemistry and Chemistry of the Laboratory for Organic Biology.
Struggle over budget. ODS went to fisherman who defends himself
The chairman of the ODS, Mirek Topolanek, called the approved budget for the next year "horrible" and the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should consider their continued existence.
The statement of the ODS described the Prime Minister as "strong statements".
There is supposed to be time for analysis.
Petr Necas, ODS deputy chairman, said that the concept of the official cabinet with the support of the CSSD, ODS and Green Party obviously no longer works.
According to Necas, the prime minister has to decide whether he intends to rely on the minority in parliament when it comes to the fight against the rising deficit, or whether he wants to stay in office using the parliamentary left.
The approach of the SDGs and the Social Democrats to the problem of public deficits is diametrically different, Necas pointed out.
Parliament approved the 2010 budget on Wednesday, but with left-wing amendments of more than CZK 12 billion.
Parliament has increased the money for civil servants' salaries, for the maintenance of social benefits and for direct payments to farmers.
The government has opposed the proposals of the Social Democracy that they covertly increase the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic is expected to save 163 billion crowns.
The ODS has left the Chamber before the vote, so it has fulfilled the government’s wish, because even the amended budget is only a less bad variant of the budget provisional.
Disappointment and senselessness
Finance Minister Eduard Janota has spoken out about his disappointment and a sense of senselessness, while Prime Minister Jan Fischer has said the government is still judging the current situation.
Necas is convinced that if Janota had seriously threatened with his resignation in the event that the amendments would be accepted, the situation would look different.
According to Czech television, Janota has signed up for the Prime Minister for Monday after the government deal.
In doing so, he indicated that he was considering remaining in office.
The reason for this is his disillusionment with the provision of the budget.
The extent to which Fischer is in favour of continuing the fight against the budget deficit, according to Necas, the Social Democratic nominees (CSSD), who had enforced the changes in the budget, have nothing to do with this in the government.
The prime minister should also make it clear that he will step down if Parliament continues to adopt deficit-increasing laws, such as those pertaining to sickness and pensions, or service bills.
Topolanek: Ministers nominated by ODS were not mistaken
This is a matter for the Prime Minister Fisher and the entire government.
The ministers nominated by the ODS have made no mistakes, Topolanek highlighted in a text message from the United States.
It has been mentioned that in some ministries there are deputy function people who profess to TOP 09 who voted against the budget.
Necas stressed that if Fischer decides to renounce the fight against the deficit level of public finances, "it is perfectly logical and correct that he is relying on the left majority that is currently in parliament".
Then he allegedly cannot count on the support and tolerance of the civic democrats.
I haven’t thought about it, and if it’s going to be the case, then I’ll deal with it,” Martin Bartak, the democrat-nominated defence minister, told reporters in parliament.
Prime Minister Fischer flew to Brussels in the afternoon to the European Council.
The ODS resigned at the request of the Prime Minister
At the same time, Necas stressed that the ODS would likely vote against the amended budget in parliament on Wednesday if the prime minister explicitly asked the deputies of the Democrats to allow the adoption of the budget.
We do not pretend to be orphans, we are not small children, so he responded to the question whether the ODS was not pushed back during the political negotiations on the budget due to the absence of the party chairman in Parliament as well as in the Czech Republic.
I didn’t realize my voice was missing.
As soon as I renounced the mandate, I knew that in the coming months it would be mainly about the Bolshevikization of the parliament and the destruction of all the positives, Topolanek himself responded.
According to the new schedule of the CD (Czech Railway), fewer trains will travel for approximately the same fare.
The Czech Railways will terminate or limit some less-used high-speed and local trains from 13 December, while other connections will be strengthened.
The total traffic volume will be reduced by 2% from the date of validity of the new schedule compared to today.
Most fares incl. basic and customer fares will not be changed.
For example, the inhabitants of the Ostrava area get several connections to the capital, the railway uses trains of the type Pendolino for this route.
The high-speed train will no longer travel to Bratislava (Presburg).
There are also fewer high-speed trains on the Prague - Pisek - Budweis route, in principle the direct connections from Prague to Letohrad are reduced.
The largest reduction is planned for the railway in the district of Hradec Kralove (Königsgraz), a total of eight percent, but Prague and its surroundings can look forward to an increase.
Two overnight trains on the Prague - Tabor - Budweis route will also be cancelled and, on a few days a week, the operation of some high-speed trains on the Prague - Pisek - Budweis route will be reduced.
One of the biggest changes is the introduction of the new direct transport route from Milovice to Prague, currently the residents of Milovice have to switch to Lysa nad Labem.
It is the fifteenth transport route of the Esko suburban transport system, whose opening is possible thanks to the railway electrification from Lysa nad Labem to Milovice.
The long-distance journeys to the capital will end at the destination station Prague - Hauptbahnhof.
The CD introduces more connecting lines SC Pendolino between Prague and Ostrava and the trains to Sumperk/Jesenik will travel over a two-hour interval.
The Pendolino has not allowed passengers to travel to Bratislava since 13 December.
This year’s regional railway bill: 200 million increase
The high-speed trains are ordered and paid for by the Ministry of Transport, in total, the railway receives four billion crowns in the next year to compensate for the so-called loss of liquidity, just as in this year. The local trains supply the districts, in total they pay for it in the next year to eight billion, three billion crowns.
This year, the regional trains are 200 million Czech crowns more expensive.
For local trains as well as high-speed trains, the railway has renewed a ten-year contract, until now the contract has always been concluded for only one year.
The railroad praises the system, perhaps because of this it has not resorted to price increases for the vast majority of tickets.
Changes will only be made for one-day CD Net tickets and for low-cost eLiska tickets.
For passengers without the customer card, the price of CD Net will be increased from 450 crowns to 600 crowns.
The price of eLiska will then depend on the driven stick, until now it was uniform for the journey between any district cities and cost 160 kroner.
Philippine militants have arrested more than 50 people, the children have been released.
Militantes kidnapped 75 people in the southern Philippines today, including some elementary school students and their teachers.
This was reported by AFP, which initially only informed about 65 abductees.
All 17 detained children were released after eight hours, including one teacher.
He was abducted in the province of Agusan del Sur.
Approximately 19 millionaires allegedly used the hostages as a living shield when fleeing the police.
Local negotiators are now endeavouring to extradite the remaining hostages.
According to AFP, the militants belong to the New People’s Army (NPA), which is the faction of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to AP, police were pursuing the kidnappers over the violence that demanded revenge actions between the two local family clan.
In the south of the Philippines, in the province of Maguindanao, state law was enforced because of the recent massacre in which 57 people were killed.
Among the victims of the November 23 massacre, which coincided with the election to the governorship, were 30 journalists.
On suspicion of involvement in the massacre, the governor of this southern Philippine province and his father Andal Ampatuan, the patriarch of the influential Ampatuan clan, were arrested.
Muslim separatists are also active on the island of Mindanao.
On Tuesday, peace talks with the Philippine government resumed.
The history of South Africa affects everyone, says Morgan Freeman aka Nelson Mandela
In the next few days, Clint Eastwood’s new Hollywood film will be released in the American cinemas “Invictus: The Undefeated”, which includes part of the life story of former President of South Africa Nelson Mandela.
The role of the world-famous fighter against apartheid was given to Morgan Freeman, who was allegedly elected by Mandela himself a few years ago.
The supporting role of the legendary South African champion in rugby, Francois Pienaar, has been given to Matt Damon.
With the cinema launch of the film, reactions from critics as well as the public are also loud.
Nelson Mandela 's
His full name is Nelson Rolihlaha Mandela, born on 18 July 1918 in Mvez, South Africa.
In 1988, he received the Sakharov Prize, and in 1993, together with de Klerk, he received the Nobel Peace Prize.
He was elected President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
Great expectations are set in the film because it comes to the cinemas at a time when South Africa, on the one hand, is culminating in the preparations for the World Cup, but at the same time the media are shaking the world public with frightening news about the rising racial hatred and the discrimination of the inhabitants by the black ruling majority.
According to the AP news agency, the reactions to the new film in South Africa are positive for the time being, despite numerous reservations against the casting of the main roles with American Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman is proud of the new film.
I have dreamed of this role for many years and have prepared myself well for it.
Several times I also met Nelson Mandela personally so that I could – as they say – receive his energy, he performed in the interview after the film’s festival premiere in Los Angeles.
I think it’s good if we can remember Mandela’s personality and his message with this film.
This is a history of South Africa, but it concerns every human being, he added.
Dressed in the rugby national team
The film is based on the book template by British writer John Carlin, freely translated 'In the Role of the Enemy': Nelson Mandela and the game that united the people portrays the South African human rights defender during his first presidential term.
Throughout the film, Morgan Freeman endeavors to bring together two racially and day-to-day distinct population groups, and like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he also enters the South African National Rugby World Cup, which South Africa won at the time.
For entering the grass in dress, which is considered almost a sacred act in South Africa, Mandela collected large ovations fourteen years ago, predominantly from the white audience, thus gaining the recognition of the white population.
The Rugby Championship may be accomplishing the task of bringing people back together into a single people, said rugby player Chester Williams, who was the only "black" in the national team in 1995.
Whether the tense situation in South Africa is improving, that will first be shown.
But the white South Africans are skeptical, as Christopher Dawson, a rugby fan who fled the country to Britain, recently revealed in an interview with LN.
The championship starts on June 11, 2010.
In the Louny area, transformers burn for several 10 million crowns
The fire broke out in the morning at the transformer of the company Ceps in the switchgear at the municipality of Vyskov in the Louny area.
According to the spokesman of the district fire department Usti nad Labem, Lukas Marvan, six units were involved in the fire.
Initially, the fire department wanted to burn out the transformers, but later it changed its view and now the fire is extinguished with a mixture of water - foam and special extinguishers.
The cause was a technical defect, a transformer internal short circuit.
No one was injured, the accident did not jeopardize, according to the company spokeswoman, Pavla Mandatova, the security operation of the management system.
The damage has been estimated at several 10 million crowns, more precisely the damage will only be numbered after the fire.
According to Mandatova, the destroyed transformer must be replaced by a new one.
For more than 10 years, nothing similar has happened at the company Ceps, errors of this kind are rare, she added.
The power supply was not interrupted, according to the spokeswoman of the company CEZ for North Bohemia, Sona Holingerova, the fire of the transformer station did not affect the functioning of households, authorities and companies.
A.G. Ceps operates in the Czech Republic as the sole operator of the grid system, the 400 kV and 220 kV electrical lines.
It maintains, renovates and develops 39 switchgears with 67 transformers, which transfer the electrical energy into the distribution system and pipeline with a length of 4,339 kilometers.
Jancura filed a criminal complaint for slander against three leaders of the CSSD.
The owner of the Student Agency, Radim Jancura, today filed criminal charges for slander against three social-democratic leaders.
Against Michal Hasek from the district of South Moravia, Radko Martinek from the district of Pardubice and the head of the district of Olomouc, Martin Tesarik.
Jancura said this in a twenty-minute Inteview in the radio journal.
The lawsuit relates to the company’s efforts to operate regional rail transport in some districts.
All regions, however, have finally signed the long-term contracts with the Czech Railways.
All three ladders attack us and say that we are taking out the raisins, but we have only made the offer about the extent it was agreed with them.
They claim that we are more expensive than the Czech Railway because we would know the prices of the Czech Railway which were closed last week.
So we have nothing left but to defend ourselves.
Due to this slander of the Society Student Agency, Jancura told the Radiojournal.
At the same time, he stated that he has evidence from all districts that they have taken their steps in accordance with European law.
That is why we are preparing an indictment for the European Commission.
Hasek believes that the prosecution is the continuation of Jancura’s media show, which serves as free advertising for his company and for his own person.
Of course, I am ready to defend my good name and the good reputation of my district, and I also call on other leaders to do so.
I assume that even in this matter it will become clear that it is Jancura who manipulates the public in the matter of regional railroad traffic and uses false and untrue arguments, Hasek said.
Jancura reported last week that he had invested several million crowns in the advertising, which will point to the districts’ adverse move.
He told the radio journal that he would interrupt the campaign after Christmas and continue it after the New Year.
He clarified that he will lead the anti-corruption campaign as such.
The campaign was launched by Jancura after the districts agreed to operate the regional railway with the Czech Railways and did not call for tenders for the order in the amount of 150 billion crowns.
According to Vancura, such conduct is unlawful and contrary to the requirements of the European Court of Justice.
Due to criticism of train traffic in the districts, he was also threatened, according to Jancura, by a member of the CSSD.
The only threat was if we didn’t give up that we could lose the bus licenses.
He presented himself as a member of the CSSD, I know who it is, I don’t say his name,” Jancura told Radiojournal today.
Vaccination against pneumococcal disease free and voluntarily
Immunization against pneumococcal changes the habit from January.
The first is to be free and voluntary for families.
But even now there are reports that the mandatory vaccination would be more effective.
The preparations for the introduction of the free pneumococcal vaccination culminate.
The medical institute already sets the maximum prices of the vaccines that the health insurance must pay.
The specialists are also aware of the vaccination procedure.
New Vaccination
Vaccines free for August children
From January onwards, children can be vaccinated free of charge against pneumococcals born on and after August 2 of last year.
The condition is that they have not yet received a dose of the vaccine.
If you have started vaccination in the past year or earlier, you will also need to pay for another repeat vaccination yourself.
The first dose of the vaccine should be given between the 3rd and 5th month of the child’s life.
Last year, a quarter of families had their children vaccinated against pneumococcal disease.
The parents paid 1600 crowns and more for a dose.
Four doses are required to vaccinate the youngest children.
Overall, the experts estimate that health insurance costs between 300,000 and 450,000 crowns per year for vaccine doses.
However, they save on the treatment that children would need without vaccination.
So far, the state has spent about 500,000 per year on all surface vaccinations of children.
The compulsory vaccination was introduced with the so-called Janota package.
Pneumococcals cause middle ear inflammation, but also severe infections including brain inflammation and blood poisoning.
As a result of pneumococcal infections, up to 28 children under the age of 10 die in hospitals per year.
Outside the Czech Republic, mandatory vaccination of children against pneumococcal disease has been introduced in about 40 countries.
Will the vaccination be mandatory?
At the same time, it is said that this vaccination could be mandatory in the future.
From January onwards, it will be paid by the insurance companies and will be voluntary.
For example, the head of Nahlas civic association, Rudolf Kalovsky, mentioned that compulsory vaccination would be better.
His association has been promoting pneumococcal vaccination for the long term.
The experts at the international conference in which our association participated were not very satisfied that we had voluntary vaccination.
That's not quite ideal.
On the other hand, we are glad that we have succeeded in achieving at least that.
I think that’s the way we have to go now, Kalovsky said.
However, the Ministry of Health does not want to change the vaccination procedure against pneumococcal disease.
At this moment, we are not considering this at all, said his spokesman Vlastimil Sesen.
Voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks, the doctors claim.
The chairman of the specialist society of pediatricians, Hana Cabrnochova, admits that a voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks.
If all children were vaccinated, then one could think about reducing the number of repeated vaccinations "In a situation where the vaccine is so expensive, we understand the political decision that this vaccination was started as voluntary," says Cabrnochova.
Experts expect more than 80 percent of parents to vaccinate their infants against pneumococcal disease from next year.
Pneumococcal vaccination is also groundbreaking in that it is the first area vaccination paid by the health insurance companies and not by the state.
The insurance companies should spend the money for prevention, so they save for further treatment, explains Cabrnochova.
The doctors have to buy the vaccines themselves.
However, this is associated with a concern of practical pediatricians regarding the purchase of vaccines.
According to the original plan, the vaccines should be purchased by the insurance companies and then the doctors will receive them in the same way as other vaccines issued by the state to them.
However, some MPs feared that the insurance companies could “take the money out of the health insurance.”
Therefore, the doctors will have to buy the vaccines themselves and wait until the insurance companies pay them.
According to the estimates, the individual practitioners will have to invest 40,000 crowns per month, which is a significant sum.
This will not be easy, says Cabrnochova.
US artist's son involved in "museum theft"
The son of the famous American fantasy artist Frank Frazetta was accused of trying to steal $20 million worth of paintings from his father's museum.
According to Pennsylvania police, Alfonso Frank Frazetta was caught with a trailer while inviting 90 paintings into his vehicle.
It is said that Frank Frazetta junior and another man used a excavator to enter the museum in the Pocono Mountains.
The 81-year-old Frank Frazetta Senior is famous for his portrayal of figures such as Conan the Barbarian and Tarzan.
According to the Associated Press, the artist was in Florida at the time of the incident.
AP quoted an unnamed police officer as saying that Frank Frazetta Junior may have been motivated by a family feud.
According to a police swearing-in statement, Frazetta Junior claimed he was instructed by his father "that he should enter the museum by all means to bring all the paintings into a camp".
The agency reported that Frank Frazetta Senior denied any permission to have been granted.
Labour defends state and tax increases
The ministers have defended the tax increases and spending cuts announced in the Pre-State Report against criticism of the opposition, the economy and trade unions.
The Conservatives said Alistair Darling had "passed away" an opportunity to show that he was serious about reducing the deficit by postponing the decisions until after the election.
The chancellor of the Treasury was also shot for targeting low- and middle-income workers.
His main proposals include a 0.5 per cent increase in social security and a 1 per cent cap on public payroll for 2011.
Social security annoyances
Trade unions have protested that low-wage earners are being punished for a recession they did not cause and warned of "problems" to come.
The increase in social security - to about <0xC2><0xA3>3 billion a year - has angered the private sector, which says it is a tax on jobs, although the focus should be on economic recovery.
The increase, which is limited to those earning more than <0xC2><0xA3>20,000 a year, will affect approximately 10 million workers.
POINTS OF THE FORM STATE REPORT
Increase in social security by a further 0.5% from April 2011
This year, the economy shrank by more than the expected 4.75%
New 50% tax on banker bonuses
1 percent increase in corporate tax for small businesses rejected
Tax rebates for electric vehicles and wind turbines
Increase in state pensions by 2.5%
According to estimates by the Treasury, someone with an annual income of <0xC2><0xA3>30,000 will be poorer by <0xC2><0xA3>90 per year and someone with <0xC2><0xA3>40,000 per year will be poorer by <0xC2><0xA3>190, while a person with an annual income of <0xC2><0xA3>10,000 will be richer by <0xC2><0xA3>110.
The ministers said their goal of halving the deficit by 2013 meant "difficult decisions", but they also said that 60% of the burden of additional taxes would be on the top 5% of earners.
Treasury Secretary Stephen Timms denied that the sketched tax increases and spending cuts would be “a drop on the hot stone” compared to the necessary measures.
"These are big numbers, they're going to bring us the deficit halving and this is also absolutely necessary over the next four years," he told the BBC.
Timms said he was confident that the economy would return to growth by the end of the year.
The Labour Party’s predictions of future economic growth – affecting the extent of re-indebtedness and the speed of deficit recovery – were questioned after the Chancellor of the Treasury was forced to revise past figures.
He said in his statement that the economy is likely to shrink by 4.75% this year – far more than the 3.5% decline predicted in April – while the debt at <0xC2><0xA3>3 billion would be higher than previously estimated.
"Lost Opportunity"
Conservatives, who want to launch a new advertising campaign on Thursday to warn against Labour’s “debt crisis,” said the planned <0xC2><0xA3>789 billion in debt over the next six years was unsustainable.
They added that the ministers have failed to present a credible plan on how to repay this and are pressing themselves "cynically" before difficult decisions until after the election - which must take place no later than June 2010.
"They didn't say anything important about what they're going to do," said shadow finance minister Philip Hammond. "They had their chance to do it, and they let them pass."
"The significant announcements are made only after the election, whoever wins them".
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labour insists that schools, hospitals and the police are protected from future cuts, unlike in the proposals of the Conservatives, who see the deficit cut coming faster and more likely.
But the Liberal Democrats said the money raised by the tax increases and spending cuts will be used to cover next year’s spending, not to reduce the deficit, and therefore argue that the plans are “built on sand.”
The BBC’s political editor, Nick Robinson, said that at the time of the announcements—such as the above adjustment to inflation for some disability pensions in April—something would expose the chancellor to the charge of voting, as the money could simply be recovered next year.
Labour insists on providing the extra assistance when people need it most and that the situation be re-examined in September 2010.
"Hohler Staat"
Although the ministers have not disclosed state details beyond 2011, economists say the pressure on public spending will only come to bear in the medium term.
The recognized Institute of Tax Studies said the Chancellor’s figures would mean strong cuts in many areas, possibly in the future in the areas of transport, higher education, science and defense.
"It only shifts the pain to later," said his manager Robert Chote.
“The significant announcements are made only after the election, whoever wins them,” added Roger Bootle, an economic advisor to the audit firm Deloitte.
"This was just the hollow preliminary state report. Markets recognize that."
FBI Investigates "Detention of U.S. Citizens in Pakistan"
The FBI is investigating the arrest of five reported U.S. citizens on suspicion of extremist connections in Pakistan.
The men were arrested in an assault on a house in Sarghoda, in eastern Panjab province, the U.S. Embassy in Pakistan told the BBC.
The FBI said it is investigating whether these are the same men who were reported missing last month in the U.S. state of Virginia.
The U.S. State Department said they were also looking for information about the men.
Three of them are said to be of Pakistani descent, one is of Egyptian origin and the other has a Yemeni background.
“If they are U.S. citizens, of course, we are very interested in the charges against them and the circumstances under which they are detained,” Kelly said.
FBI spokeswoman Katherine Schweit said the authorities were informed of the arrests and were in touch with the families of the missing students.
“We are working with the Pakistani authorities to find out their identities and the purpose of their stay there if they are actually the missing students,” she said.
The Pakistani embassy in Washington said the men had been arrested in a house belonging to the uncle of one of the students.
He said the local police had been interested in the house before and that no charges had been filed against the arrested men.
The Reuters news agency reported that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton refused to comment on the arrests, but she said the United States must “work closer with Afghanistan and Pakistan in eradicating the infrastructure of terrorism that continues to recruit and train people.”
The five students were reported missing by their families in North Virginia at the end of November.
Amnesty condemns "abuse" in Iran
According to a report by the human rights organization Amnesty International, human rights in Iran are still as bad as in the past 20 years.
The report details "abuse patterns" by the regime, both before and after the contested presidential election in June.
One man quoted in the report stated that he was beaten and burned with cigarettes; another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran has rejected criticism of its human rights record.
Officials said such criticism was politically motivated.
After the contested election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, thousands of people were arrested and dozens killed in Iran, leading to the largest street protests since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Dozens received prison sentences and prosecutors said at least five people were sentenced to death.
BBC Tehran correspondent Jon Leyne, who is now in London, said that at the beginning of the protests, the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, acknowledged some of the abuse allegations and ordered the closure of the Kahrizak prison.
But since then there has been no tolerance on the part of the authorities for criticism, our correspondent said.
"False Confession"
Amnesty International quoted the report of 26-year-old computer science student Ebrahim Mehtari, who said he was charged with “working with Facebook networks” and protesting the election results.
"They hit me in the face more often," he was quoted as saying.
"I was burned with cigarettes under my eyes, in my neck, on my head... they threatened me with death and they humiliated me."
After five days, he signed a false confession and was released on the street, still bleeding and half unconscious, Amnesty said.
Presidential candidate Mehdi Karroubi said some protesters arrested after the election were tortured to death in prison in August and others were raped.
The Iranian authorities denied the allegations of rape, but admitted that abuses had taken place.
Amnesty also cited the case of a former detainee who said he and 75 others had been detained for more than eight weeks in a container in a prison in Kahrizak.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian Parliament and the judiciary had set up a committee to investigate post-election unrest and the government’s reactions to it, but so Amnesty, the mandates and power of these bodies would be unclear and the results obtained by the parliamentary committees would not have been published.
The group said at least 90 people had been arrested in the past three weeks to prevent further demonstrations.
Ski slope was installed in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow have been used to turn a landmark in Bristol into a competitive track.
The slopes of this park attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders who fought for cash prizes.
At the top of the slope in Brandon Hill Park, there was a short jump at the beginning of a 100-meter-long slope.
Student John Hickman, who is studying medicine in the fourth year, said there was a beautiful view from the top of the slope, but it was also pretty intimidating.
It is a great view with all the lights of the city shining below.
He added: "There are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the country here - some real talent."
Prizes were awarded for the best artwork performed on the slope - or tricks.
After the event on Thursday night, the snow will be left to melt.
Still she and we
Is Islam French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when Swiss voters voted for a construction ban on minarets and concerns about Europe’s alleged Islamization are widespread, John Bowen, an American academic, has written a thorough and well-considered report on whether Muslims can be integrated into one of Europe’s declared most secularized societies.
Some readers will read this new book out of admiration for the author's last work: "Why the French Don't Like Headscarves" (2006), an elegant and densely argumentative study of a dispute that the country has shared and appreciated over a decade and a half.
Bowen’s latest book offers a broader and bolder spectrum.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and the media say about Islam in France, but what is really happening in the field.
He has spent months in mosques, schools and institutes that now offer the 5 to 6 million Muslims in France, as Bowen calls it, “Islamic Free Spaces.”
He is a good listener, he reflects debates between teachers and students about the issues that most worries them.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or a town hall (or both)?
Should young Muslims be taught about evolution and the rights of homosexuals?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim man?
Is it permissible for a Muslim to use an interest-oriented banking system to get a mortgage?
It is these seemingly profane affairs, he argues, that make up everyday life, quite unlike the political dramas that the media occupy.
The author recognizes a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, none of them by a known name, possibly with the exception of Tarik Ramadan, a Swiss-born Arab-Muslim scholar and academic.
This new generation is trying to open the debate about how it is possible to be a good Muslim on the one hand and a good citizen in a modern secular society on the other.
They don’t have all the arguments on their side.
The conservatives are suspicious of the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists who interviewed Bowen are mostly at odds with their Salafi counterparts – advocates of purist Sunni Islam associated with Saudi Arabia – who now show a small but influential presence among Europe’s Muslims.
Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism may be compatible.
But an agreement requires giving and taking on both sides.
He questions the extent to which French political decision-makers (and the intellectual elite who so passionately guard the separation of church and state) really feel committed to pluralism.
He suggests that Muslims may experience harsher treatment than Catholics, Protestants, and Jews, who in turn had to make their historical compromise with secular republicanism.
He recognizes a "sharpening of the value screws" rather than a growing pragmatism.
After reading this book, one is inclined to say "yes, but not yet".
The most despondent view in the world
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than any other environmental region on Earth.
The ice that marks it melts at alarming speed and takes life that can’t survive anywhere else.
Oil, gas, shipping and fishing interests have entered the newly open waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now also authors in their keel waters.
Richard Ellis, an author and illustrator, draws in "On Thin Ice" (original title: "On Thin Ice") a natural history of the icon of the North, the polar bear.
Wandering through the complicated history and politics of whaling, he describes the long tradition of Arctic explorers who have proven themselves in hunting polar bears.
Admiral Nelson's encounter with a polar bear as a brave 14-year-old wingman at sea, who fought only with the rifle of his musket, is certainly a legend, but others are true.
Young bears caught swimming behind the bodies of their recently killed mothers were brought to zoos and circuses.
A circus performance at the beginning of the 20th century showed 75 polar bears in a performance.
Even today, zoos typically still own a millionth of the habitat of a wild old animal. The climate is rarely suitable: The polar bear in Singapore has become quite green by the algae growing in the hollow hairs of its fur.

Ellis refers to the reports of other authors and historians and often returns to the threat that hunters pose to the survival of the species.
Although banned in Norway, America and Russia, landing continues in Greenland and Canada, where hunters in helicopters and motor sled-driven Inuit use powerful storm rifles to bring their prey to the range.
Ironically, ice will last the longest in the waters in the north of these two hunting nations.
In his new book “After the Ice,” Alun Anderson, a former editor of the science magazine “New Scientist,” offers a clear and disturbing description of Arctic science and a compelling insight into how the future could evolve.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospheric scientists nor oceanographers can adequately explain the speed of changes.
However, this is not due to a lack of explanations.
The pioneering journeys of Fridtjof Nansen at the end of the 19th and early 20th centuries gave the impression for the first time of the turmoil of the Packeis.
In the Cold War, submarines assumed the shifting ridges as they submerged.
A useful addition are satellite measurements and the large-scale deployment of measurement probes on icebergs, but much is still being achieved by fearless people camping outside in the cold.
Anderson takes a look at the peculiar, tiny world of the inflow system within the Arctic ice, formed by saltwater streams that are compressed as they freeze.
But, ranging from the bear on the ice to the microscopic wonders in the ice, everyone is threatened once the summer ice passes, which is expected between 2013 and 2050.
"In a few months ... it could be us"
Marines were among the 6,000 who deployed wreaths in Arlington
De'Angello Robinson traveled seven hours by bus to put a single wreath on the grave of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other Marines who made the journey from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, North Carolina, to the National Cemetery in Arlington to decorate graves, the day was a tribute to the men and women in whose footsteps they have stepped.
In a few months, wherever we are brought back from, we could be," Robinson said of the fallen soldiers.
If we were, I wish someone would do the same for me, so I try to show my respect.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who had gathered on Saturday morning to lay wreaths on the graves of veterans in several sections of the Arlington Cemetery.
Morrill Worcester, owner of the mourning wreath manufacturer Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, founded this tradition in 1992 when he and some others decided to decorate several hundred graves at the cemetery in Arlington.
It is now an 18-year-old tradition and Morrill and his wife Karen, who make this trip every year, stop in different cities along the way to conduct events dedicated to people in the military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a non-profit organization, Wreaths Across America, which expanded the event to other states.
This year, volunteers placed more than 16,000 crowns on the graves at Arlington Cemetery, in areas at the Pentagon, on graves at Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, at Battery Park in New York, and at the memorial site for United Airlines Flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsyl.
For the second time, the Walmart Foundation donated more than $150,000 to purchase and transport the wreaths.
Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster, said she made the trip to Arlington in memory of her husband, a deceased professional soldier.
Although her husband is not buried in Arlington, Hunt said, this is her way of giving something back to those victims.
She said this is a small contribution to how we civilians can support our soldiers.
It’s like visiting a family cemetery.
Wrapped in layers of warm clothing, the volunteers wandered across the extensive lawns and hills of the cemetery.
The volunteers had older graves from the First and Second World Wars and the Vietnam War as their target, as these are not visited as often as the newer graves, according to the organizers.
The mood was cheerful, children were playing and couples were holding hands while carrying the fresh pine branches to the grayish gravestones.
Each round wreath was dark green with a small red loop attached to the top.
Section 60, which is located nearby and where mostly veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried, remained almost quiet.
The United Service Organizations donated 1,000 crowns to decorate this section, but the grim mood of the current wars filled this area.
Individuals wept openly, others prayed, and families and friends clung to each other in the icy air.
Some read the names carved in stone, while others bowed down to small black-and-white square cards that had been stuck in the wet mud for those whose tombstones had not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many mothers who shed bitter tears before her son’s grave.
She has driven 8 hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the tomb of Marine Infantry Sub-Official David Shane Spicer, who fell in battle in July.
No one should ever forget why we are free ... my son paid for it, she said.
“When I’ve been gone for a long time, I want someone to remember him.”
U.S. government contractors arrested by Cuban authorities
The Cuban government has arrested a U.S. government contractor who sold mobile phones and notebooks in the country, State Department officials said on Saturday.
The contractor, who has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc., based in Bethesda.
The company works on projects for clients, such as USAID, the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
U.S. consular officials in Havana are trying to gain access to the prisoner who was arrested on December 5.
The special indictments have not yet been released, although under Cuban law a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor can be arrested for almost anything under the charge of "danger".
All so-called counter-revolutionary activities, including light protests and critical writings, carry a risk of arrest.
Anti-government graffiti and statements are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has a growing blogger community led by popular reporter Yoani Sánchez, who more often describes how she and her husband are being persecuted and attacked by government officials.
Sánchez has repeatedly asked for permission to leave the country to receive awards, but this has always been rejected.
The arrest of an American contractor is likely to heighten tensions between the Castro Brothers’ communist government in Cuba and the Obama administration, which had sought a “slow” approach to improving relations with the island.
The news of the arrest was first reported Friday night by the New York Times.
The new U.S. policy emphasizes that the United States will provide a return if the Cuban government takes concrete steps in this direction, such as releasing political prisoners and creating more room for opposition.
Mobile phones and notebooks are legal in Cuba, although they are new and coveted products in a country where the average earnings of a government employee are $15 per month.
The Cuban government has only allowed normal citizens to buy a mobile phone since this year, they are mainly used to send text messages, as a 15-minute phone call would cost a day’s wages.
Internet use is extremely restricted on the island.
It is accessible in expensive hotels and there for foreign visitors and at some government agencies, such as universities.
Cubans who want to log in often have to report their names to the government.
For many websites, access is restricted.
Arrest of an American is rare in Cuba.
Most of the few U.S. citizens who are in prison in Cuba are behind bars for crimes such as drug smuggling, said Gloria Berbena, the press spokeswoman for the U.S. Department of State in Havana.
Berbena said she could not give any further information on the arrest.
Arrest and detention are clearly wrong.
An activity that would be legal in any other free society - the delivery of free mobile phones - is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, head of the American section of the "Human Rights Watch" group, which recently issued a harsh report on freedom in Cuba entitled "New Castro, the same Cuba, the landing of Fistro.
Vivanco said the defendants would very often be arrested, convicted and imprisoned within a day.
He said that any solution would likely be political and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, especially at a time when both countries are moving towards each other for more dialogue.
Pakistani government reveals plan to send men to Afghanistan
Pakistani authorities uncovered on Saturday an allegedly leading head of a conspiracy aimed at sending five men from North Virginia to Afghanistan to kill U.S. soldiers, saying they hoped this case could help uncover an extensive network of terrorist recruiters who have radically turned off the Internet.
Investigators said they were looking for an opaque insurgent, known as Saifullah, who had invited the men to Pakistan after he tracked them down because one of them had commented on the terrorist attacks on the YouTube video site.
Saifullah became the leader of these men after their arrival in Pakistan and tried to help them reach the remote area in Pakistan’s tribal belt, which is home to Al Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani intelligence official who was briefed on the matter said on Saturday that Saifullah was unable to convince the al-Qaeda leaders that the men were not part of a CIA conspiracy to undermine the terrorist network.
As a result, they were detained for days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the inhospitable mountains in the northwest, which have become a haven for terrorists.
They were considered part of a covert operation.
That is why they were rejected, said the government official, who wanted to remain anonymous because of the sensitivity of the matter.
The government official said the men were by no means discouraged and continued to try to get the right recommendations to gain access to the al-Qaida camps when they were arrested by Pakistani law enforcement authorities.
The case of the five men – who are still in Pakistan and are being questioned by the FBI – underscores the crucial role of recruiters in identifying future terrorists and possibly more importantly, in deciding who is trustworthy.
Since the September 11, 2001 attacks, the US intelligence has made it a matter of utmost urgency to house human asset posts within Al Qaeda.
The recruits of the organization act as gatekeepers who do not allow in those whose commitment to the Holy War is not serious enough and those who could be spies.
American recruits are undergoing a special examination by A Kaida, analysts said.
However, due to their potential access to U.S. targets and their propaganda value, they are also considered extremely attractive to the group.
Evan Kohlmann, senior analyst at the US-based NEFA Foundation, said terrorist groups have also become much more cautious about who they allow access to in recent years, as U.S. intelligence services have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you try to include someone in these groups, what better way to go than to follow the recruitment model that so many have already followed?
The model is now much more based on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of protesters call for climate action in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of protesters marched through the streets here on Saturday, demanding from the dealers in the city’s Bella Convention Center bolder action on climate protection.
Demonstrators said 100,000 people had joined the event, while police estimates were more likely to be around 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, although a handful of masked activists set fire to small explosives near some government buildings in downtown.
On a day when the UN-sponsored climate negotiations did little, thousands of activists wandered through the city with banners stating in English “There is no Planet B” and one in Spanish that declared “The Earth says “Enough”.
Some stars joined the protest, for example the Danish model, photographer Helena Christensen, who said that traveling to Peru, the birthplace of her mother, made her aware of the heartbreaking problems the country is struggling with due to the already tangible effects of climate change.
That’s part of the reason why I decided to take part in the big demonstration – to pass on the word and appeal to the world leaders to reach a fair, ambitious and binding agreement,” she said.
It is not an easy task, but it must be done now and there is no way around it.
Police prevented the protesters from getting too close to Bella Center, saying they had arrested 19 people, mainly because they were either masked or carrying pocket knives.
According to Danish law, these actions are prohibited during demonstrations.
According to one viewer, who did not want to be named because he was involved in the climate negotiations, masked demonstrators in black clothes set fire to several explosives near the Copenhagen main canal, near which several ministries are located.
They threw them near the buildings, he said, adding that they began as light rockets, but were then followed by "a few large explosions."
Inside the convention center, people gathered in front of television screens to watch the demonstration all afternoon.
But the protest has apparently not reached the consciousness of key officials, such as Su Wie, China’s chief climate dealer.
Asked if he thought the demonstration would have a constructive effect on international considerations, he replied in English: "This is something I was not aware of at all."
He then continued in Mandarin and said, "Because the venue is big, I can't hear what's going on outside."
He noted that it depends on the perspective of the individual whether the demonstration would harm or help.
It shows the concentration of the general public and various sectors on the issue of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "you can also say that they interfere with the negotiations or the freedom of other people."
Test data show stubborn breed air
The testimonies of math performance were welcome good news for public schools in Washington, D.C., last week.
Although Washington District is still far behind the country’s top performing schools, the testimonials show that the fourth and eighth graders have made faster progress over the past two years than cities that include Atlanta, Chicago, and New York.
But what is included in the latest figures of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) is the persistent performance gap between African-American and white students, both locally and nationally.
The average score of white fourth graders from Washington D.C. rose from 262 to 270 in the last two years (on a scale of 500), but their African-American peers rose only three points from 209 to 212.
The performance gap actually increased from 53 to 58 points between 2007 and 2009.
The progress of African-American eighth graders remained essentially the same, falling by a statistically negligible point from 245 to 244.
The average score of white students was not included in the test data because the sample size was not large enough.
The picture over a six-year period is also not more encouraging.
The gap that separated white and black fourth graders in 2003 when the first NAEP was detected in this district was 60 scale points (262 to 202).
And although the score reached by the children of both groups has grown over this time span, the difference has hardly decreased by now 58 points.
Some of the district’s education advocates expressed their concern last week that the results, celebrated by school chancellor Michelle A. Rhee and Democratic mayor Adrian M. Fenty, were largely driven by white students who are already high-performing children anyway.
This suggests that we have raised the overall score by treating those at the top of the scale, which is problematic and difficult, said Jeff Smith, a board member of D.C. Voice, a nonprofit group advocating for education equality in Washington D.C.
I’m not jumping up and down for a span of two or three points, said Democratic Washington City Councillor Kwame R. Brown, who has a daughter in the fourth grade of Eaton Elementary School.
Brown, a frequent critic of Rhee’s management style, said the message of the exam scores is that the city’s high schools urgently need attention.
Of course, you always want to see the positive signs, I respect that.
What scares me, though, is that we don’t roughly spend the time and energy we need to spend on our high school.
Rhee said the district must continue to find better ways to meet the needs of the underperforming students.
This fall, for example, some teachers will be trained to use a new reading curriculum, the Wilson Reading System, that targets students in the upper grades of primary and secondary school who have not mastered basic reading skills at the beginning of their school career and who are significantly behind their peers.
Daily mathematics, a curriculum that focuses from kindergarten to sixth grade games and real-life experiences, was brought to Washington under former school supervisor Clifford Janey, and this curriculum is attributed to some of the NAEP progress reported last week.
I think we need to continue to work to bring the best measures to the benefit of students who are below the grade level, Rhee said.
Others say the NAEP results highlight the question of whether Rhee can continue to improve the overall performance of the system while continuing to provide the additional money and resources for the poor schools that are needed to narrow the gap.
This is a serious dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, professor of education at the University of California at Berkeley, who is investigating urban exam results.
The conventional remedy is to focus its resources and management reforms on the schools located in Washington, D.C.’s poorest areas.
The objective could have political repercussions that work against this important agenda item.
The weakness, of course, as with other urban school inspectors, is that she tries to keep the white and black middle class.
Our focus is to ensure that we build a system of great schools.
We need to strengthen our schools in the neighborhoods so that all families, regardless of where they live, can be sure that their children can receive excellent public schooling.
Janey, who is now a school inspector in Newark, said this week in an interview that one of the most significant elements in closing the performance gap is to extend the traditional public school year, which is currently 180 days in Washington, to compete with charter schools.
One has to increase the school year to nearly 200 days to have the strength to change, said Janey, who came to an agreement with his teachers' union last year over 185 days a year, which he sees as "a milestone" on the way to a larger increase in the next contract.
Higher education for more people than prospects for the future
The bus reaches Gettysburg College with a loud whistle.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, comes out and blinks for a moment at the sight of the white columns, the brick facades and the emerald green lawn.
Graciela’s parents hardly finished high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela, who was rescued in Silver Spring and now lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a college campus.
Her attitude and that of the other eighth graders of the group who explore Gettysburg, where tuition costs $38,690 a year, was more the one of an awe-inspiring visitor than the one of an enthusiastic future student.
"Yes! I will be here soon!" said Graciela, who would like to study medicine when the guide announced that they had now entered the building for natural sciences.
"Wow, really?" she said thoughtfully when she was told of the school's low professor-to-student ratio.
The college in Pennsylvania was the 7th that the kids attended on their three-day tour and now they have fully embraced the intended message: The question is not whether to go to college.
The question is where.
On the one hand, there is growing concern about the large number of children of Hispanic immigrants born in the U.S. who do not finish high school or become pregnant as teenagers, but on the other hand there are also hundreds of thousands who receive the college education necessary to rise to the middle class.
In fact, one in five of these “second generations” of Hispanic Americans graduates from college – a remarkable achievement as many of their immigrant parents, mostly from Mexico or Central America, came to the United States without having completed high school.
Their success stories are important, researchers say, because they show the way forward for a generation that will play a huge role in the country’s workforce.
Those who study powerful children say that they often have a natural affinity for school and a drive to success inherent in them.
Many of them also have parents who set high goals for their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
But counseling programs also play a big role by helping Graciela and millions of kids like her get to college, especially if these efforts persist for a long time.
If you look at low-income children whose parents do not have the experience and skills to help them find their way through the system, then a single measure at some point will not solve the problem either, said Patricia Gándara, a researcher at the University of California in Davis who studied Hispanic American students.
We need to think about providing a support network for these children from preschool to high school.
The federal program that had funded Gracielas College tour is a useful example.
It’s known as GEAR UP – Turning One Gang Up – and provides more than $300 million a year for local school systems to start college preparation programs that begin when low-income students are in high school and continue until they finish high school.
According to the U.S. Department of Education, the program has helped more than 10 million students since 1999, more than 60% of whom have gone to college.
Iraqi Ministry of Oil signs contracts with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has been able to get major oil companies to rebuild their damaged infrastructure at two auctions closed on Saturday.
The 10 contracts signed by the Iraqi oil ministry with foreign oil companies suggest that China, Russia and European oil companies are ready to play an important role in renovating the Iraqi oil industry, which has been crippled for decades by war and economic sanctions.
U.S. companies were only able to book shares in two of the 10 auctioned fields.
Seven U.S. companies had paid to participate in the second auction, which began on Friday.
The only company that made a bid attracted the shorter one.
Two American companies were able to conclude contracts for fields auctioned in June.
The thinly planted representatives of American oil multis at the opening of the Iraqi oil industry surprised the analysts.
Iraq has finally opened its doors after 6 years of war, and instead of US companies, Asian and European are settling ahead, said Ruba Husari, the editor of Iraq Oil Forum, an online news service.
There will be no further offers in Iraq for a long time.
Security concerns underscored by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday and political instability from the U.S. military’s withdrawal have likely prevented U.S. oil companies from engaging more strongly in Iraq, which has the world’s third-largest proven crude reserves, analysts said.
U.S. firms have been disadvantaged in some cases because competitors, especially the Chinese and other state-controlled energy companies, have significantly lower wage costs and are more likely to take risks because they do not have to hold shareholders accountable.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies to be able to enter into contracts with the department.
Larger U.S. companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which maintain close ties with the Iraqi oil ministry and have been on the sidelines with technical advice in recent years, have gone empty.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main players in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The state-owned China National Petroleum Corporation has bid for more contracts than any other company and could go home with large packages of contracts for two larger fields.
We all know, said the spokesman for the oil ministry, Assam Jihad, that China is on its way to becoming one of the world’s largest economies as well as a technology power.
We are convinced that the Chinese company can measure itself with its counterparts and will fulfill its commitments to Iraq.
For bidding, pre-selected companies issued bids, which were then compared with the fee per barrel of oil, which the ministry was willing to pay to increase the output of each field beyond the current level.
Al Qaeda's top planner apparently killed in Pakistan
An apparent U.S. missile attack along the Pakistani border with Afghanistan is said to have killed a top al-Qaeda deployment planner this week, U.S. counter-terrorism officials reported on Friday.
This would be, if confirmed, the second deadly attack on a senior official of the terrorist organization this fall.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arabs who, according to U.S. sources and Pakistani officials in the region, were killed by a number of missiles that hit their vehicle on Tuesday near the city of Miran Shah in the northern province of Waziristan.
Local authorities reported that the missiles were fired by a type of drone deployed by the CIA in Pakistan’s lawless tribal belt.
They were driving in a white vehicle towards the Afghan border when the car was hit, a Pakistani civilian intelligence official from Miran Shah said by phone.
Local residents, suspected of belonging to the militants, ran to the scene and quickly seized all that was left of the "completely destroyed bodies".
Local authorities were unable to confirm the identities of the victims, but two U.S. counter-terrorism officials cited indefinite evidence that Somalia was among the dead.
Somalia was described as the leading military planner of Al Qaeda, which led operations of terrorist groups outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
He was involved in conspiracies around the world, noted a senior official who wanted to remain anonymous, and pointed to the delicate nature of U.S. airstrikes on Pakistani soil.
Assuming its central role as a given, this also included planning attacks against the United States and Europe.
He took strategic instructions from al-Qaida’s top leaders and implemented them into operational planning for possible terrorist attacks.
The second U.S. official said Somalia had quickly risen in the al-Qaeda hierarchy and had best links to other extremist groups in the region.
He may not be known to some Americans, the second official said, but this in no way diminishes the danger he posed to us and our allies.
If his death were confirmed, Somalia would be the second leading al Qaeda or Taliban leader to be killed since September when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant faction in the tribal area, and three other top activists.
The pace of attacks by CIA drones has dropped from an average of six operations per month to two since the summer, according to a summary of the Long War Journal, a nonprofit website.
The decline may be due to improved tactics by terrorist groups that have taken steps to reduce their vulnerability while brutally killing suspected informants, the site reported.
Leading UN envoy in Kabul to step down
U.N. envoy to Afghanistan Kai Eide said on Friday he would step down from office in March, ending a stormy term blurred by allegations of widespread corruption in the U.N.-backed Afghan presidential election.
His departure comes after the Obama administration decided to send another 30,000 U.S. soldiers to Afghanistan.
The U.N. envoy said he supports the troop increase, but he also expressed concerns that the U.S. military withdrawal schedule, which is set to begin in 18 months, could prompt other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to speed up the deployment of Afghan security forces and send the right signal to the Afghans that they can trust the international community, Eide said in a phone interview from Kabul.
Commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international civilian aid workers to assist in the political transformation of Afghanistan.
The increase in troops on the military side must correspond to an increase on the civilian side, he said.
Eide said he would not resign, but would only fulfill an agreement made in March 2008 with his family to stay in Kabul for only two years.
He said he wanted the notification to the UN-
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon is now forwarding so that he has time to arrange for a replacement.
What I’ve said is that he’s better off starting to look for a successor, Eide said.
When I came here, there was a two-month gap between my predecessor’s departure and my arrival.
Ban has started looking for a replacement, according to UN officials.
The UN representatives say he has considered the Swedish-Italian-born Staffan di Mistura, who recently led the UN mission in Baghdad and the Frenchman Jean-Marie Guéhenno, who previously led UN peacekeeping operations.
His position in Afghanistan was put to the test after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, accused him in September of favoring President Hamid Karzai in the country’s presidential election and concealing evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide has denied all accusations, but he also said that Galbraith’s accusations – who was fired – “unquestionably hurt the mission because there was already a great deal of skepticism regarding international interference in the election.”
Eide said he had recommended the appointment of a leading civilian representative to coordinate the relief efforts of U.S.-led forces in Afghanistan.
He also urged the UN leadership to allow his successor to hire more personnel from the United States and other Western countries donating to the Afghan mission, saying that this would strengthen their confidence that their money will be properly spent.
Eide expressed his disappointment at the limitations of his forces in Afghanistan, saying that the cumbersome UN hiring arrangements have undermined his ability to bring in capable people.
The UN rules are designed so that since May, he said, I could only hire one person.
This is catastrophic and should not go on like this.
U.S. Defense Secretary Gates: Iran Must Expect Additional Sanctions
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said on Friday that world powers will soon impose "significant additional sanctions" on Iran because it has not participated in talks on its nuclear plans.
Gates spoke during a 7-day trip through the war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq to a group of about 300 U.S. soldiers in northern Iraq, downplaying the prospect of military action against the Islamic Republic of Iran.
There are no good options in Iran, he said in response to a soldier’s question about the likelihood of such a development.
“One of the things that is on my mind is if we have learned something from Iraq in the last six years, the war’s own unpredictability.”
The Obama administration is considering a package of sanctions targeting Iran’s military and political elite, but Gates has announced that some sanctions could also affect the average Iranian.
He said a “package of positive and negative incentives” is needed “to convince the Iranian government that it is actually less protected with nuclear weapons” because “your people will suffer tremendously” under the sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement from White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the US government joined European top politicians in warning that Iran must expect "credible" consequences if it does not use its nuclear program to meet the demands of the UN Security Council and its International Atomic Energy Monitoring Organization.
Iran continues to argue that knowledge of nuclear technology should only be gained for peaceful purposes.
At talks in Geneva on October 1, Iran said it would resume talks on restricting its nuclear program and relinquish a substantial portion of its stockpile of enriched uranium in exchange for urgently needed nuclear fuel for its medical research reactor.
The U.S. government has pushed for this kind of agreement to build trust between the two parties and gain time for negotiations.
But Iran seems to have left the negotiations on the preliminary agreements since then -- in part, experts say, because the Iranian leadership is at odds about whether they should commit to the United States.
That Iran has simply left the international community alone with regard to some proposals it had already agreed to in early October has, frankly, brought the international community, including the Russians and Chinese, together in a way they never were in conjunction with important additional sanctions on Iran, Gates said.
President Obama has set Dec. 31 as a deadline for Iran to respond to these proposals before he continues to pursue other options, including those that former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called “overwhelming sanctions.”
In a statement issued in New York, the Iranian mission to the United Nations condemned what it called on Thursday "unfounded and unfounded allegations" by some members of the Security Council about Iran's nuclear activities, saying they are ready to continue talks with the United States and five other world powers to "continue a long-term solution".
Gates, who was due to return to Washington on Friday, met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki in the morning before flying to the oil-rich Kurdish region in Iraq to meet with the soldiers in Kirkuk and with Kurdish officials in Irbil.
Tensions between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq remain high, particularly in terms of borders, property rights and the distribution of public revenues.
Gates urged both sides to reduce the conflict potential to prevent delays in U.S. plans to reduce U.S. troop strength from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
U.S. officials quoted Gates, who told Masud Barzani, president of the Kurdish regional government, “We will keep your security, your prosperity and your autonomy within a united Iraq.
We will not leave you.”
A change of pace in an ageing China
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters that lectured them that "Mother Earth is too tired to entertain more children" and "One more baby means one more grave".
They learned these lessons so well that when government officials in Shanghai, who suddenly began to change course this summer due to the low birth rate and the ageing population, and encouraged young couples to have more than one child, their answer was immediate and definitive: “Not at all.”
We have already invested all our time and energy in a child.
For a second child, nothing is left, said Wang, 31, a HR manager with an 8-month-old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of one-child policy in China, which has produced two generations of notoriously fat, nurtured single children lovingly called “little emperors,” a population crisis is raging in the country.
The average birth rate has fallen to 1.8 children per couple compared to 6 at the time this policy came into force, according to the United Nations.
The Department of Population Affairs is firmly committed, while the number of people aged 60 and older is expected to rise explosively from 16.7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 percent by 2050, well above the global average of about 20 percent.
The imbalance is stronger in rich coastal cities with a well-educated population, such as Shanghai.
Last year, 60-year-olds and older made up nearly 22 percent of Shanghai’s reported residents, while the birth rate was below one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, head of the Shanghai City Population and Family Planning Commission, has said that couples of childbearing age need to have babies to “help reduce the ratio of ageing population shares and alleviate the shortage of workforce of the future.”
Shanghai will soon be "as old -- but not as rich -- as the industrialized countries, such as Japan and Sweden," she said.
A gradual relaxation
Enshrined in the country’s constitution in 1978, China’s one-child policy is likely to be the most controversial provision introduced by the ruling Communist Party to date.
Couples who violate this policy face huge fines -- up to three times their annual salary in some regions -- and discrimination in their workplaces.
Chinese state officials have attributed it to this policy that the critical use of the country’s natural resources could be avoided, whereas human rights representatives have condemned abuses in the enforcement of the policy.
In rural areas, some officials have forced pregnant women who have already had a child to abort.
Many couples had also had sex-selective abortions, resulting in an unnaturally high ratio of men to women.
In recent years, government representatives for the population have gradually weakened their attitude towards one-child policy.
In 2004, they allowed more exceptions to the rule -- including urban residents, members of ethnic minorities, and cases where both husband and wife were single children -- and in 2007 the tone of many harsh slogans was mitigated.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Beijing University Institute of Population Research, said government officials recently discussed even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children with a partner who is an only child.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to promote more births.
Posters instructing families to have only one child were replaced almost overnight by guidelines detailing who is eligible for a second child and how to apply for approval.
The city administration has sent city employees and family planning volunteers to visit couples at home and shove information sheets under the doors.
She also asked to provide psychological and financial advice for those who have more than one child.
The reaction was not very encouraging, family planning representatives said.
Disappointing Reaction
Although officials from a rural small town in the outskirts of Shanghai said an upsurge is visible in the applications of couples who want a second child after the start of the campaign, urban districts, on the other hand, report no change.
As an example, the municipality of Huinan, with a population of 115,000, still receives only four to five applications per month.
Disappointed Shanghai officials say the number of births in the city expected for 2010 despite the campaign will still be around 165,000 -- slightly higher than in 2009, but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee of Shanghai’s Caolu municipality, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people don’t want to have children anymore.
They want to give their first the best, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said that they would like to have two children and that this is also legally allowed.
But, like many Chinese, they only have a small amount of government health and life insurance.
Without a social network, they say, this decision would be irresponsible.
People in the West misjudge one-child policy as a human rights issue, said Yang, a civil engineer whose wife is pregnant with her first child in the seventh month.
Yes, we are being robbed of the possibility of having more than one child.
But the problem is not simply politics.
The problem is money.
Other couples give psychological reasons for their hesitation.
Wang, the HR manager, said she only wanted a child because she was also an single child. "We were the center of the family and used to everyone taking care of us.
We’re not used to taking care of others, and we don’t really want to.”
Chen Zijian, a 42-year-old who owns a translation company, said it unbridledly.
For middle-sized parents with double careers, through which the birth rate decreases, he said, it is about being successful and for that you have to be selfish.
The age group of today’s 20- to 39-year-olds grew up watching their parents struggle during the early days of the Chinese capitalism experiment and they don’t want such a life at all for themselves, he said.
Even a single child, he said, poses huge demands on the time of parents.
A mother must give up her social life for at least two years.
Then there's the spatial question -- "You have to rebuild your apartment" -- and the life plan -- "When the child is 9 months old, you have to have a resume ready for the best preschools."
Most of his friends are willing to go through this once, Chen said, but not twice.
Our generation is the first to reach a higher standard of living, he said.
We don’t want to make too many sacrifices.
UN Group Drafts Emissions Reduction Plan
The UN-sponsored climate conference -- which has so far been characterized by wild poses and mutual accusations -- has again placed a focus on Friday with the publication of a document that records an ambitious reduction in greenhouse gases for the next 40 years, with the industrial nations in the near future having the biggest burdens.
The text, which could provide the basis for a definitive political agreement on the regulation of greenhouse gases, has shown both the remaining obstacles and the way forward.
But it was seen as an important step forward in a negotiation that will take time, as more than 100 top politicians from around the world will arrive in Copenhagen next week.
The text, formulated by a specially created UN working group, is silent about the amount of money that rich countries should give to poor countries so that they can cope with global warming in the short and long term.
It also offers a range of options for the key issues, including how industrialized and large emerging countries can limit their carbon emissions and how high the upper limit value of global temperature rise should be that policymakers would contribute.
The process is given a great deal of flexibility, says John Coequyt, senior representative of the Sierra Club in Washington.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who drafted the six-page document, summarized a 180-page negotiating text to focus on what UN climate chief Yvo de Boer called “the big picture.”
It shows the outline of a possible agreement whereby, by 2020, industrialized nations would collectively reduce their emissions by 25 to 45 percent, compared to the 1990 limit values, while larger developing countries would reduce their emissions by 15 to 30 percent over the same period.
Together, countries could reduce emissions by 50 to 95 percent by 2050.
The European Community also boosted talks on Friday by reassuring that it will provide $3.6 billion a year over the next three years to help poorer countries adapt to the impacts of climate change – from mastering floods and droughts to preventing deforestation.
Friday nonetheless brought the same verbal fireworks that the conversations of the past week had determined.
U.S. climate commissioner Todd Stern has rejected formulations demanding binding reductions in greenhouse gas emissions for industrialized countries, compared to voluntary reductions for larger emerging economies, if they are not funded by industrialized nations.
This move announced that the Obama administration is moving a harder line with China than representatives of the Bush administration did not even two years ago.
The United States will not sign an agreement without major emerging countries rising up and taking action, Stern said, who also complained that the text was not going far enough to ensure that the cuts could be confirmed by outsiders.
Stern made his statement an hour after the statement of Chinese Vice Foreign Minister He Yafei, who said that the leading American climate trader either lacked "reason" or it was "highly irresponsible" by him that he said earlier this week that the United States would not help China to finance the global.
Because the future economic direction of the world’s great powers is at stake, breaking lines have been opened both within the industrialized nations and between the industrialized nations and the emerging countries.
The current struggle relates to saving individual economies as well as saving the planet, with China and the United States fighting for their respective commitments, while poorer countries claiming that the two dozen most influential countries would ignore the scientific need to take more action.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said it is not surprising that the major powers are struggling to determine who should bear the cost of braking greenhouse gas emissions, as even affected countries have moved to take more aggressive action to account for countries with very high greenhouse gas taxes for their actions.
This is clearly a game from which a new economic dominance will develop, according to Ulate, who also works as a regional climate change consultant for Conservation International in Mexico and Central America.
Some of the countries most exposed to the impacts of climate change said they would continue to fight for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although the leading participants say the talks will at best lead to a political agreement.
The Alliance of Small Island States with 43 members submitted a 24-page draft treaty early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who heads international climate negotiations for the European Commission, said the offensive of the small island states “exerts political pressure on the entire political process,” partly because they are now united and demand action from emerging countries such as China and India.
The talks were given a new urgency as delegates focused on the fact that most of the open questions had to be clarified before the government leaders arrived to reach an agreement.
High-ranking officials, such as India’s Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and China’s Deputy Minister, flew off their planes and rushed through the hallways of the Bella Center to meetings behind closed doors and press conferences to stamp out claims that will be negotiated over the next week.
The sheer scale of the gathering -- 13,000 people walk into and out of the congress center every day, guitar-playing activists hold nightly shows where they make fun of the countries they think they are betraying and selling, and drafts of contracts are hand-in-hand instead of e-mail -- is already a challenge.
The intensity is just building up: Almost all the important ministers are here now and from Wednesday there will be 60 government leaders in Copenhagen.
We are coming to the upper league,” said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, Vice President of Global Policy at Conservation International.
The heavyweights are coming.
Britain's first 225 km/h fast train redefines Monday's feeling
On Monday morning at 5 a.m., a whistle will penetrate the darkness to announce a train departure, which represents a revolution in traffic in the UK.
The country’s first high-speed diver train will reach 225 km/h from Ashfort, Kent, to London St. Pancras and travel 93 km in 38 minutes.
To Lord Adonis, the Minister of Transport, Lady Kelly Holmes will then embark on the first Javelin commuter service from London.
He hopes that the new service will eventually connect the UK to an international rail network of faster, more reliable trains and connect the large metropolitan areas of the Midlands, the North and Scotland to London.
The neglected province could become vibrant commuter cities, working hours would be drastically reduced, and the switch from plane and car to rail would reduce national carbon emissions and road congestion.
In theory, the three major parties believe in this vision.
But the many billions of pounds needed to build a new national rail network, the inevitable planning battle and fears of environmental damage could still pull the brakes on British high-speed rails.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company founded in January to submit a feasibility study to the government, will submit the report to Lord Adonis on December 30, according to the Times.
As a result, it receives a detailed route map of the next planned stage of the high-speed rail network.
The new rail line, which will connect London with the West Midlands, will pass through urban areas and places where environmental impacts are controversial with a span of five meters.
In open ground, the plan will show the concept within a distance of 25 meters from the final route.
HS2 will also create three options for a larger, north-facing, high-speed rail network.
Lord Adonis will respond in the spring.
The preferred proposed option is a Y-shaped route guide, in which a single high-speed route would lead to the West Midlands.
The route would split in or near Birmingham and one branch would lead west of the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and another to the northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line would lead to Scotland.
"It seems to be the best-functioning option," a railway insider said.
After completion, the travel time between London and Edinburgh would be reduced to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first partial route, which would not be opened before 2025, would allow travelers to travel the route London-Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to today’s just over an hour.
The designs offered the trains the ability to drive at a speed of 400 km/h, making the British rail network the fastest in Europe.
The first route was planned in such a way that 400 meters long trains with a maximum capacity of 1,100 people can ride on it.
Up to 18 trains per hour could be operating on the London-Birmingham route.
This would mean, in turn, that a terminal station would be needed in London, where 20,000 passengers could be handled per hour.
Given the spatial constraints in the capital, an existing train station is expected to be expanded to accommodate the high-speed network.
Railway experts say that only St. Pancras International or Euston have this potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not he believes this plan should be continued, but the lengthy public consultation and planning measures mean that a final decision will be made only after the parliamentary elections.
But even if he puts the wheels in motion, the rail network must be built in sections.
The trains would first have to switch from the high-speed lines to existing rail lines in the north of Birmingham, which would continue to be over three hours between London and Scotland.
This is considered to be a crucial turning point in order to ensure a change from the aircraft to the railroad, a measure of direction for the rail revolution.
Taxpayers Arrive for Mortgage for <0xC2><0xA3>75,000 Orangerie of a Conservative
Alan Duncan, the leading Conservative House member, has billed taxpayers thousands of pounds a year for the costs of an orangery he built in his home in his constituency.
The party’s prison spokesman, degraded by David Cameron for complaining that members of the lower house must live “of lean rations,” has raised his mortgage by <0xC2><0xA3>75,000 to build an oak lumber farm at his second home in Rutland.
He was allowed to charge the taxpayer the additional interest income, a sum of hundreds of pounds per month.
The House of Commons officials approved the applications at the time, and they were also not challenged by Sir Thomas Legg, who is conducting a review of the expenditures of the House of Commons members. Last night, Duncan said that the applications could not have been "yet cleaner or more understandable".
Duncan, one of the richest members of the House of Commons, owns a two-storey house in a village in his constituency of Rutland and Melton.
Nearby homes have reached a purchase price of nearly <0xC2><0xA3>1 million (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.1 million).
The ground floor includes kitchen, living room and dining room, but the Fees Office, a spending control body of the lower house, has agreed that Duncan needs more space.
Last year, he planted a winter garden called "Orangerie" in the plans.
Neighbors described it as a "glasshouse for entertainment".
Even during a recent investigation of his previous mortgage contracts by the Committee on Standards and Privileges, Duncan was not asked to take a stand on the increased withdrawal of money.
Last month, after an examination of his expenditure, the Committee approved him for breaking the rules.
In 2004, Duncan transferred the security for a mortgage of over <0xC2><0xA3>271,406 (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>300,000) from his London home to his constituency, which he bought in 1991, a year before his election to parliament.
Documents released this week show that Duncan received approximately <0xC2><0xA3>1,400 (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1,500) per month as mortgage interest until March last year.
In April, his claims rose to more than <0xC2><0xA3>1,800 (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2,000) per month.
The interest rate on Duncan’s RBS mortgage did not change during this time, suggesting that the overall increase was used to finance the <0xC2><0xA3>75,000 withdrawal.
The normal steady RBS mortgage rate fell from 7.94 percent in December 2007 to 4 percent in March of this year, where it still stands.
The latest documents released by the House of Commons show that Duncan continued to claim his entitlement to <0xC2><0xA3>1,250 (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1,400) per month this May.
Duncan lost his position as opposition leader of the House of Commons in September after an undercover reporter filmed him saying after the spending scandal that members of parliament would live "of lean rations".
"Essentially, working for the state means having to live on lean rations and being treated like S****e."
He said: "I have spent my money on my garden and claim a vanishingly small part, measured by what belongs to each other.
And I could have demanded the whole damn sum, but I don't."
The member of parliament, a millionaire from his previous career as an oil wholesaler, was attacked for the first time in May because of his spending when it became clear that he had claimed thousands of pounds for his garden before clarifying with the Fees Office that this “could be considered an exaggerated claim.”
An activist dug a hole in Duncan’s lawn in protest after it became known that he had demanded 4,000 pounds (4,500 euros) over three years.
When asked about the increased mortgage last night, Duncan said, “This was approved both by the Fees Office and subsequently by Legg for Value Added.”
He added: “There is no debate about evading and sneaking through or bending the rules or anything like that.
Everything is perfectly transparent and moves strictly within the rules, is approved and everything.
It couldn’t be cleaner and clearer.”
Come and admire Brighton's Beach Cottages Advent Calendar
Beach huts in Brighton have found a new life content for the winter months as an interactive Advent calendar.
Beyond, an alternative church group that encourages spiritual discoveries through creativity, has invited 24 owners to decorate their huts for every December day with Christmas songs as a theme.
The event started on December 1st and visitors were allowed to watch the latest hut every day from 17:30 to 18:30 with free sparkling wine and traditional Mince Pies, filled with dried fruit pastries.
The Christmas songs so far selected are "I saw three ships", "O come, o come, Emmanuel" and "The first No<0xC3><0xAB>l", where the hut decoration is the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a TV marketing assistant from Hove, is a volunteer pastor of the Diocese of Chichester and head of Beyond.
He said: “We want to make religion more important for people in a post-Christian society.
Why do we, as a church, expect people to come to a strange old building? I think the church should go to people and hold exciting celebrations.
The idea for the Strandhütten-Adventskalender started as a conversation with some friends at dinner.
Brighton is such a fantastically creative and vibrant place and we are trying to express this through our spirituality.”
Strong mobilization in Copenhagen and in the world for the climate.
Tens of thousands of people marched around the world and in Copenhagen on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding agreement on climate change, where police have made several hundred arrests.
At least 30 thousand people, according to police, 100 thousand according to organizers, marched in the cold of the Danish capital, on the edge of the United Nations climate conference, which should lead to a conclusion by Friday, which could enter into force from 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, Danish chair of the climate conference, the increasing mobilization in the world for climate contributes to what these demonstrations illustrate that the “political price” of a failure in Copenhagen would be very high.
The incidents in the Danish capital took place shortly after the train passed, when a group of 300 demonstrators, dressed in black, had smashed windows with paving stones and hammers, an AFP journalist noted.
Anti-disturbance police officers have intervened immediately and without consideration.
Police have announced that between 600 and 700 people, according to their estimates, mainly members of the Blacks Blocs, these extremely violent factions that have already made themselves famous at the NATO Summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, in April.
The Coalition Climate Justice Action (CJA), one of the organizers of the demonstration, has sharply criticized the conditions under which hundreds of militant supporters had been arrested "without distinction", and has stressed that about a hundred of them "still held in the streets on Saturday evening" despite the extreme K
The rather peaceful train has left Parliament in the direction of the Bella Center, where the negotiations took place.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the building without attempting to enter.
A stage was installed to welcome the intended speakers for an evening with candlelight, with the participation of the former South African Archbishop, Desmond Tutu.
Most of the protesters arrived with buses and trains from the major European cities, but also many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans were present, as well as some Africans.
Approximately 3,000 people, most of them in sky blue raincoats, made their first appearance in Copenhagen in the morning as they followed the call of the Friends of the Earth to form "blue tides" for "climate justice".
Today we are going to the streets to demand a redress of the ecological debt in favor of the South, said Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino activist of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We cannot go on like this and say to ourselves: we have time, said Angelique Kidjo, a singer from Benin.
There are rivers in Africa that can be dried up, where you can walk, as it has never been in the past.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, established in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the movement of globalization critics has approached environmental organizations.
European MEP José Bové, a figure of globalisation critics, announced that he came to Copenhagen to link "climate justice and social justice": "Today there is no difference between the fight against climate change and the fight for another world."
The Asia-Pacific region, where many islands are at particular risk as a result of the warming, has kick-started the demonstrations.
About 50,000 people have taken to the streets in Australia, according to the organizers.
In Manila, there were a few hundred people, mostly students, who marched in red and hoisted bandanas in which they boasted of the solar energy.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, but also in Canada, protests by several hundred demonstrators took place to demand an energetic approach to climate change.
In France, the demonstrations organized by the network "350" have gathered a few hundred people, namely in Paris, in Marseille (South), in Lille (North), in Bordeaux (West) and in Lyon (East).
Some people gathered in Geneva.
Separatist Abkhazia elected its president, denouncing Georgia as a “strike”.
Abkhazia elected its president on Saturday, a little more than a year after Moscow recognized this pro-Russian separatist Georgian territory as independent, Tbilisi denounced the "strike".
About 131,000 people were called to participate in the first election after the August 2008 Russo-Georgian War for control of the South Ossetian territory, another Georgian secessionist territory recognized by Russia.
The polling stations closed at 17:00 GMT.
Election turnout was about 58 percent a few hours before the closure of the polling stations, according to the Abkhaz election commission officials.
The first preliminary results should be announced on the night of Saturday to Sunday.
The five candidates, including the former president, Serguei Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which condemns the election.
This election is a farce.
Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili regrets that Abkhazia is now under Russian occupation, his press spokeswoman Manana Manjgaladze said.
In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela have recognized the independence of this area with 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world perceives it as part of Georgia illegally occupied by Russia.
After separating from Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict, with several thousand people dying, Abkhazia wishes to demonstrate through this election its readiness to join the international community.
This process is a stage in our new life, a new era, as an independent state, explained Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian who claims to have chosen Mr. Bagapch.
She was one of the voters who went to vote for a polling station located in a school in the capital, Soukhoumi, a beautiful white building with a few palm trees in front of the entrance.
The question of Russian dominance is at the heart of this presidential election, in a region with beautiful landscapes on the Black Sea.
Large signs on which Bagapch can be seen alongside the Russian president and head of government, Dmitry Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, are everywhere in this small area that has 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, which is located in the east of the country, the district head, Beslan Archba, has prepared a warm welcome to the Russian representatives who have come to monitor the conduct of the election.
We, the Abkhaz people, are grateful, he said at a small celebration, as a reference to Moscow’s support, especially regarding the decision to recognize Abkhazia’s independence.
I hope that your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations, replied Alexei Ostrovsky, a member of the Russian Parliament, while raising a glass of vodka.
The opposition, represented by the former vice president and two Russian businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, has criticized the agreements reached with Moscow last year, like the one in which Abkhazia leaves Russia control of the railroad for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Banba, claims not to support the current government or the opposition.
A majority of 50% plus one vote is required to win the election.
If none of the candidates reaches this threshold, a second round of elections must be organized within two weeks.
Climate: Global demos, Copenhagen incidents
Tens of thousands of people across the world demonstrated on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding treaty from the Copenhagen Climate Conference, where the police, at any time ready for action, detained about 700 people, on the fringes of an important demonstration.
Thirty thousand people, according to police, hundreds of thousands, according to the organizers, have demonstrated in the afternoon cold in the Danish capital, which by December 18 receives delegates from 193 countries, who are looking for an agreement to enter into force on January 1, 2013.
From Parliament, the peaceful train marched towards the Bella Center, where the negotiations take place.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the center and did not attempt to penetrate.
A stage was set up to welcome the intended speakers for an evening with candlelight, with the participation of the former South African Archbishop, Desmond Tutu.
A few moments after the train passed, a group of protesters, dressed in black and armed with bricks and hammers, began to strike disks, an AFP journalist noted.
Anti-disturbance cops immediately circled you and ruthlessly intervened by throwing some of you on the floor.
Police have announced that between 600 and 700 people have been arrested and have made it clear that they are mainly members of the “Blacks Blocs”, these extremely violent factions that have already made themselves famous at the NATO Summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, in April.
In the evening, a police officer suffered an injury to the chin from a paving stone during the incidents, in which, according to police, about twenty people were provisionally arrested, and four vehicles burned near an occupied house.
"We have the extreme groups under control," said police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen, as the helicopters of the law enforcement forces flew in the air.
Most of the protesters arriving by train or their own vehicle from German cities, London, Amsterdam or Milan were Europeans.
However, there were also many Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, and Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly in a sky blue raincoat, formed in Copenhagen in the morning following the call of the "Friends of the Earth" to become the first group to represent the "blue seas" for "climate justice".
"Today we are going to the streets to demand that the ecological debts be repaid to the people of the South," activist Lidy Nacpil told the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
"We can no longer say to ourselves: we still have time," says singer Angélique Kidjo from Benin.
“In Africa, there are rivers that run out, there are watercourses that you can walk through, which has never been the case before.”
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, launched in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the movement of anti-globalization activists has approached environmental organizations.
The French MEP and globalisation critic José Bové told AFP that he had come to Copenhagen to "combine climate justice and social justice." "Today there is no difference between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world."
The organization Oxfam has mobilized several personalities, such as Danish model Helena Christensen or former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson, who are addressing the masses.
The Asia-Pacific region, where many islands are particularly vulnerable to global warming, has given the impetus to the demonstrations.
In Australia, according to the organizers, about 50,000 people took to the streets.
In Manila, a few hundred people, mostly students, dressed in red with bandanas, made advertisements for solar energy in front of the Philippine capital’s city administration.
Hundreds of protesters have also gathered in Hong Kong and Jakarta in an action against climate change.
In France, several hundred people gathered during the demonstrations organized by the "Network of 350", especially in Paris, Marseille in the south, Lille in the north, Bordeaux in the west and Lyon in the east.
Several people gathered in Geneva.
The subjects of geography and history emerge, according to Chatel, strengthened from the school reform of the lycées.
In an interview published in the Sunday newspaper "Journal du dimanche", the national education minister Luc Chatel explained that the subjects of geography and history emerged strengthened from the school reform of the lyceums, even if they are not mandatory in the terminal (12th school year).
"The students of the Première (11th year of school) now have every four hours of the week and the same program," confirms Mr Chatel.
For the minister, "this hypocrisy must be overcome", because, according to him, "the scientific profile is no longer a scientific profile", but, in general, a concentration of "the best students."
"The economic-social and literary profile (ES and L) must not become a sub-profile of the scientific one," he continued, stressing: "I have also not heard many historians and intellectuals who were outraged by the lack of historical-geographical education in the terminals at technical lyceums."
On Saturday, an IFOP survey published in Humanité found that nearly seven out of ten Frenchmen (69%) criticized the state project of abolishing compulsory education in history and geography in Terminal S (12th school year with a scientific profile). Many teachers and intellectuals also criticized the right-wing and left-wingers.
The Minister replied that there would be no question of a restriction of the philosophy of the Terminal S program.
Luc Chatel also defended the educational reform for teachers, while 16 organizations (students and trade unions) had called for Tuesday to protest against the project, which they believe falls victim to the educational training of future teachers.
The Minister stated that in Master 2 (M2) they undergo a subject-related aptitude test at the beginning of the year and at the end of the year an admissions test in which their teaching skills are tested.
In addition, they perform internships during the year in M2 and then teach one year in front of the students as internship teachers.
He continued: “If you add all the internships offered before the performance test, you will achieve even more hours you spent in front of the students, i.e. more than 300 hours.”
The minister finally stated that he wants to offer "the individual right to education" - a "thing that does not exist in popular education."
He confirmed that he wants to abolish the school card "by 2012".
15 minutes for the climate at the "Ecole Normale Supérieure"
Fifteen minutes to talk about the deployment at the Copenhagen summit: this is the challenge that Jean Jouzel, vice-president of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, had to face on Saturday morning at the Ecole Normale Supérieure in Rue d'Ulm, Paris.
As one journalist of the AFP noted, the Nobel Peace Prize winner Jean Jouzel opened the first of the "Ernest" conferences, at which experts each spoke for fifteen minutes with filmed contributions to the audience.
Edouard Hannezo, 22 years old and one of the organizers of this day, on the edge of the conference, explained that the name of this event is due to the name that the students gave to the fish in the school basin.
"Among the experts were selected among the twenty participants of the discussion, also according to their charisma," he said.
"You can talk about climate warming for hours, but the core goals can also be set in a few minutes," Jean Jouzel, who spoke freely to about 50 people with the help of foils, told AFP.
"This is part of our role as scientists," he said, hoping that listeners can learn that "the Copenhagen conference is based on an absolutely serious scientific dossier."
The videos shot by these conferences will be available online on the school’s website from 15 December.
The next "Ernest" day is scheduled for February and will take place every two months thereafter.
Delay in payment : angry prison guards, actions planned
The unions of law enforcement officials called on Friday for a general day of action to ensure that premiums and overtime, whose payment was postponed for budget reasons until January, are transferred before the Christmas holidays.
The 2nd Syndicate of Enforcement Officers (FO-Penitentiaire) urged employees who have no service to demonstrate in front of the enforcement facility on Tuesday morning and block them in order to alert them to the "theft of what belongs to them".
The 3rd Union of Criminal Enforcement Officers ("CGT-Penitentiaire") called for "to unite for a strong mobilization in the various prisons", on which the non-payment of overtime, overnight surcharges and Sunday and holiday surcharges in December is considered "disgraceful and unacceptable".
The first union of law enforcement officers, the Autonomous Federal Penitentiary Union (UFAP/UNSA), called for "general mobilizations (...) to show discontent and anger."
The heads of the enforcement agency and the Ministry of Justice said that overtime had risen sharply in 2009 and not all were foreseen in the budget, but they guarantee that the remaining claims will be paid in January.
As the Ministry of Justice announced in the evening, Michèle Alliot-Marie has sent a letter to the unions of the law enforcement officers, guaranteeing that the payment will be made next month.
"I know very well about the efforts of the staff to keep our enforcement system functioning and modernize it," the Minister of Justice said in the letter.
"I have ordered the management of the prison to take immediate action to ensure that such a situation, which has arisen due to a lack of assessment of the overtime incurred, does not repeat itself in the future," added Ms. Alliot-Marie.
The December salary is therefore lean, except for the management staff who benefit from high service and target premiums, explains the UFAP/UNSA, for which the "budgetary constraints" must be maintained.
"This is an absolute scandal," the inter-regional trade union FO in Marseille said, announcing that it would boycott "all assemblies and convocations" up to new instructions.
"The staff does not go to work on Sundays and public holidays, if the hours from October to December are still not paid. This also applies to their overtime", also threatens the FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
“At a time when we are being burdened with more and more tasks without hiring more personnel, the attempt to enrich ourselves with the staff’s funds is more than inappropriate,” the CGT trade union of Bordeaux said.
According to the trade unions, the situation is not the same in all regions, some of which are less affected than others.
In any case, however, it is wrong, notes UFAP Secretary General Jean-François Forget.
Obama believes that he always distributes better Christmas gifts than he gets himself.
U.S. President Barack Obama, who will spend Christmas with his family in the White House for the first time, has told TV host Oprah Winfrey that he is always giving better gifts than he gets himself.
In a special broadcast broadcast on ABC on Sunday evening, the president and his wife Michelle gave insight into how they will spend the holidays in their new illustrious home.
Even Bo, the little four-legged companion of the family, will be with the game.
"Santa Claus loves Bo too," Michelle Obama says, adding that the dog will of course also receive a gift.
Michelle Obama resolutely rejected her husband's claims about the quality of the gifts. "I made you beautiful gifts last year," she nodded to the president.
"So please," he summoned her, pointing to the pearl necklace of the First Lady, "And who gave it to you?"
During this one-hour broadcast in a casual atmosphere with the well-known TV presenter, who had so vehemently supported Barack Obama during his campaign, the president and his wife also spoke about gifts they loved most as a child.
Barack Obama recalled a ten-speed bicycle and also a basketball that his father, whom he rarely saw, had brought to him from Kenya for Christmas.
“I remember when my dad once visited us at Christmas and brought me a basketball,” he said.
“It wasn’t until much later in my life that I realized I had this ball from him.”
The First Lady, in turn, remembered her dollhouse.
"I didn't know how to arrange the furniture in a house at all, so I put them all on the wall instead of grouping them around the fireplace, but I loved this little dollhouse," said Michelle Obama.
Johnny Hallyday re-operated, RTL confirms he was put in an artificial coma
Johnny Hallyday was again operated on in Los Angeles for significant "damage" after an operation in France. According to the people around him, the situation was "under control", although RTL confirmed that the singer was put into an artificial coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rock musician was operated on again at Cedars-Sina<0xC3><0xAF> Hospital in Los Angeles on the night of Wednesday to Thursday after American doctors had found "damage as a result of the surgery of a disc injury" that he suffered in Paris on November 26 that was necessary.
The singer's production company wanted to clarify that the situation was "under control" and said a new medical assessment would be available within 48 hours at the latest.
However, according to RTL, the singer's partner during the singer's last tour, Johnny Hallyday was placed in an artificial coma to avoid "pain and complications".
However, it wasn’t until 48 hours later that you had a little more certainty about the patient’s condition than when he opened his eyes, RTL added.
At the request of AFP, there was no confirmation or comment from the production company.
RTL also confirms that "there is evidence from certain sources" that "no drainage" was laid after his first operation in Paris.
The rocker had been operated on in the international clinic of Parc Monceau due to a disc incident.
The surgery, planned over several days, was performed by neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known doctor who had already treated many stars.
It was not available for comment to RTL on Thursday night.
After Johnny Hallyday's surgery, the singer was delivered to Cedars-Sina<0xC3><0xAF> Hospital in Los Angeles on Monday due to a consequential infection after the surgery.
The singer Eddy Mitchell, who is very close to Johnny Hallyday, told RTL on Thursday that his friend is just going through a "deep valley", but he assured that you don't need to worry about the rock musician because he is a "good fighter".
"He had called me before he left for Los Angeles, and I told him it was nonsense to get on a plane for 12 hours after such an operation, that's not going to happen," Mitchell said.
On Wednesday night, the singer's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, confirmed that Johnny Hallyday "reacts well to antibiotics" and that "the infection is contained."
Mr. Camus also said that he had spoken to Laeticia, the singer’s wife, and that he had not felt any particular concern.
However, concern for the singer’s health had grown since he spent nine days in a hospital in July after crashing on his yacht.
Two months later, it was to the general surprise that Johnny Hallyday had a "small bowel cancer surgery", which resulted in a mild infection.
At the end of September, the singer recorded his long "Tour 66" as a farewell tour.
Since then, however, every health issue has been commented extensively. Fans and journalists have not missed the fact that the singer had trouble moving on stage.
It was not until mid-November that the people surrounding him had to deny a readmission to the hospital.
Euro-2009/Short track: Bousquet takes first place over his favorite distance
The Frenchman Frédérick Bousquet, three-time medal winner at the 2009 Swimming World Championships, won an international title on Thursday over his favorite distance, 50m freestyle, at the Euro-2009 on the short track in Istanbul.
On the first day of this competition, the last time the polyurethane suits were allowed, there were only three world records, while one had expected a real record flood.
One record was improved by the Hungarian Evelyn Surprised over 4 x 200 m positions and the other two by Russia at 4 x 50 m positions of the men.
Damage to Bousquet, who wanted to grab the world record for the 50m freestyle, the record of which he holds in the big basin (20.94).
At one of the two royal distances in swimming, 50m freestyle, the 28-year-old Frenchman claimed himself in 20.53 sec,. in a final with ten swimmers at the start (usually eight) - a premiere on an international level.
Bousquet beat Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but failed to break the world record (20.30) as planned.
"You can believe in bigger and bigger, and in this case I said, if the world record is within my reach, I'll try."
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers started in polyurethane suits, which are banned from 1 January 2010.
With 238 world records since February 2008, these combinations end their epic in Istanbul, which began in 1999 at the same competition for the first time.
The use of the combination has not paid off this time for the German Paul Biedermann, double world champion in the pool this summer in Rome and world record, in the end.
The young swimmer has failed to improve his best time over 400m freestyle (3:32.77), yet he has prevailed with the second best time in his career (3:34.55), ahead of Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and Danish Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
“I didn’t give everything this time.
I knew I couldn’t set a world record today, but I defended my title and fulfilled my mission.”
"Lobintsev will be a serious opponent in the future," Biedermann said.
U.S. Sepulchre at Zola estimated at $1.5 million
A Roman tombstone, which appeared exclusively with the French writer Emile Zola, was estimated at $1.5 million above its value on Thursday, according to art dealer Sotheby's.
This plate is two meters long and 63 cm high. It dates from the 3rd century AD and was always valued at 150,000 to 250,000 dollars.
The marble, on which "four scenes of Dionysus are depicted in a sophisticated architectural decor, surrounded by satires and Bacchus figures, is a rare piece, there are only four or five of them in the world", explained Florent Heintz, vice president for the auction of Roman and Egyptian antiquities at Sotheby's.
It was sold under hundreds of pieces.
"The sale is still going on, but this part is certainly what buyers have been bidding most for so far," Sotheby's spokesman Dan Abernethy told AFP.
The discovery of this acquisition of the marble part by Emile Zola goes back a long way.
The record was in Rome for almost 300 years in the famous collection of the Borghese family at home, after which it appeared piece by piece with the French actress Cécile Sorel, who found use for it in her bathroom of her Paris hotel, and with Paul Reynaud, Minister of the Third French Republic and President of the Council, before coming to the Marshall Pé.
The next 50 years are in the dark.
While searching the Louvre database, Florent Heintz discovered that this record was part of a "heritage of Emile Zola", which was opened in 1903, a year after the death of the author of the "Thérèse Raquin" and the fresco "Rougon-Macquart".
Zelaya’s attempt to leave Honduras for Mexico has been unsuccessful
On Thursday, Mexico declared the conditions for the transfer of the ousted Honduran President Manuel Zelaya on domestic soil no longer compatible after the coup was rejected by the government as unacceptable.
“After a telephone conversation with President Zelaya last night, everything seems to indicate that there is disagreement on the possibility of carrying out this transfer,” Mexican Foreign Minister Patricia Espinosa said in a statement.
According to the immigration authority, the Mexican government aircraft, which arrived in Salvador on Wednesday for the purpose of transferring M. Zelayas, returned to its departure point.
The Putsch government wanted to force Zelaya to "abdicate" and seek political asylum for him abroad.
However, the ousted president declined this, wishing to return to Mexico as the most welcome, acting head of state.
The coup regime "has suffered a repeat failure by trying to move me to give up at my expense (...), they wanted me to give up," Zelaya told Radio Globo on Thursday, in which he frequently spoke since the beginning of the political crisis that has lasted in the Central American country for five months.
I can stay here for ten years, here I have my guitar, added the deposed president, who had fled to the Brazilian embassy of Tegucigalpa two and a half months ago, under the influence of some chords.
The Mexican embassy has sent us a request for guidance, which we unfortunately cannot accept because it does not include a request for asylum, Oscar Raul Matute, Interior Minister of the Putsch government, told Honduran Radio HRN on Wednesday.
I am not seeking asylum in any country at all, Manuel Zelaya answered in an interview with the Telesur channel, whose headquarters is in Caracas.
A possible departure from Honduras, he had stressed, would only take place as president of the Honduran people.
Rumors of Zelaya’s departure had mobilized supporters of the ousted president on Wednesday, who had opened up and gathered around the Brazilian embassy, after which the military there had stepped up its efforts.
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticized the government’s stance.
This, according to his assessment, reveals the marginal character of this government in the face of international norms.
Zelaya, who had approached Venezuelan socialist President Hugo Chavez, had been overthrown on June 28, the day of the poll he organized in preparation for his re-election, contrary to the advice of the Supreme Court, the army and the Congress.
Surprisingly, he returned from his exile in Costa Rica on September 21 and had fled to the Brazilian embassy.
If he leaves them, he will be detained for high treason, of which he is accused by the judiciary, according to the coup government.
Putsch president Roberto Micheletti has managed to hold a presidential election on November 29 to replace Zelaya.
While Porfirio Lobo was recognized by the United States in the course of the contested election, he was rejected by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil.
Three days later, the Kogress had voted massively against Zelaya’s return to office until the end of his term on January 27.
Wall Street on the rise, US trade balance feeds optimism
The New York Stock Exchange closed with a high on Thursday, the figures of the US trade balance show a recovery in the price of the shares of the United States and its partners: the Dow Jones increased by 0.67%, the Nasdaq by 0.33%.
According to the figures at the close of the stock market, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose from 68.78 points to 10.405.83 points, the Nasdaq, in turn, dominated by technology, from 7.13 points to 2,190.06 points.
The extended Standard & Poor's 500 index was written with 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1,102.35 points.
There is good news from various industries, Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial judged.
However, this remains anecdotally under the premise that the market is only focused on "half-empty glasses", she moderated.
According to Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners, the investors are mainly fixed on the figures of the American trade balance, "which shows an improvement in activity in the fourth quarter".
The U.S. trade deficit fell by 7.6% in October to $32.9 billion compared to September.
Analysts, on the other hand, had anticipated a deficit growth.
Both imports and exports have increased.
The big news is the increase in the total volume of trade, especially in goods exports, which reflects the economic growth of the main trading partners of the United States, said Christopher Cornell of the company research Economy.com.
In return, unemployment reports in the United States have risen against all expectations in the past week and have now reached the level of 474,000 requests.
However, the average value for new job seekers has fallen to the lowest point of the year during the past four weeks, said Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market has fallen.
The yield on 10-year government bonds rose to 3.482% from 3.432% on Tuesday night, while the yield on 30-year bonds rose to 4.492% from 4.408% on the day before.
Cuba: Hundreds of Partisans in Power Whistle "Ladies in White"
On Thursday, hundreds of Cuban partisans plundered the wives of political prisoners gathered in Havana for the purpose of the World Human Rights Day, as well as thwarted another rally that temporarily detained a good dozen dissidents.
Around forty "ladies in white", wives or close political prisoners, were pissed off in the open street by government partisans under Raul Castro just as they were marching on foot into the center of the capital to demand the release of political prisoners, the AFP newspaper confirmed.
Down with the Yankees!, "Soldiers!", "The street belongs to the revolutionaries!", "Long live Fidel and Raul!", the empowered partisans chanted with a raised fist against the dissidents.
The latter were escorted by civilian agents who had appeared to "ensure their protection".
A similar demonstration against the "Ladies in White" had taken place in Havana on the eve, in which there were no injuries or arrests.
In the Vedado district of Havana, on the other hand, a dozen dissidents, who also protested at the demonstration held on Thursday in view of the International Day of Human Rights, were temporarily arrested by civilian police, an AFP reporter confirmed.
According to this journalist, the police have forced the dissidents exploited by the partisans of the government, using force, to get into civilian vehicles.
The temporary detention of dissidents under such circumstances is usually limited to a few hours.
As candidates for the Sakharov Prizes awarded by the European Parliament in 2005, the "Ladies in White" have organized an unauthorized march for the purpose of the "Please for the release of all political prisoners", whose number, according to a dissident list, includes about 200 people, said Laura Pollan, one of the leaders of the 20-year-old Hehektoren.
Maceda belongs to the group of 75 Cuban dissidents imprisoned in March 2003, 53 of whom have been behind bars.
The Cuban authorities perceive the regime's opponents as "mercenaries" or "agents" in the service of the declared archenemy, the United States.
A rarity in itself is that Cuban television reported on Thursday’s demonstrations between militant pro-government fighters and “contra-revolutionaries.”
Cuba, led by a single party, the Communist Party, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of violating rights and freedoms, in particular freedom of expression.
Crazy kills 80-year-olds with knife and leaves 5 injured in Clichy-la-Garenne
An insane man armed with two knives killed an 80-year-old man and injured five others late Friday at the main business hours in the downtown area of Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine).
According to the first information of the interview, the 28-year-old assailant injured the 80-year-old in or in front of a pharmacy on Boulevard Jean-Jaures with two knives, according to police reports, in the presence of witnesses.
The old man, born in 1929, has suffered the consequences of his injuries, according to a spokesman for the Alliance Police Syndicate in the hospital.
In or before the same pharmacy, he made a couple with a pregnant woman.
The man, about in the 30s, intervened and was injured.
The first two victims were admitted to the hospital, where the eighty-year-old died.
The other injured is in danger of death, as he was apparently affected by vital organs, according to police sources.
The pregnant woman became ill as a result of the events and she is said to have been hospitalized in a "shock state" according to a police squad.
The armed man, who, according to police, appeared to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs, is said to have immediately escaped to the street, the same Boulevard Jean Jaures.
He had injured two other passers-by, apparently by chance: a thirty-year-old and a forty-year-old, the latter of them being severe.
The scenario remained in the dark in the evening.
He had been armed with two meat knives, which he wore crossed behind his back, said Arnaud Pressé, a leader of the Alliance syndicate of the Hauts-de-Seine area.
Several passers-by, including young people, reportedly tried to get rid of the madman, according to AFP’s investigative witnesses.
I saw a guy in the 30s with a green vest.
Three young men attempted to intervene.
They failed because the guy was well-built, Alberto, a waiter at a nearby bar, reported.
A horde has fallen over him, he added, including a city policeman who broke his wrist.
Two city police officers, including her supervisor, tried to arrest the armed man still on Boulevard Jean-Jaures, at the level of house number 61, and were wounded with stabs, police said.
The event took place in one of the main arteries of Clichy-la-Garenne, where a number of shops are located.
Passengers have come to me to tell me that there is an injured person outside.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old person lying on the ground, I put her in a first aid position and noticed a pounding wound in the stomach area, said Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist, to AFP.
Five minutes later, a second, about thirty-year-old person arrived, injured by cuts.
State police officers finally arrested the man, who did not carry any ID documents.
The Nanterre Public Prosecutor’s Office has commissioned the district police department of Hauts-de-Seine (SDPJ 92) to investigate the case.
The madman was hospitalized on Thursday night.
Given his condition, he has not yet been heard in court.
A police e-mail does not preclude him from being delivered to a nervous health facility.
According to another police source, six police officers sniffed him to hand him over to the police station in Clichy, where he had been taken.
He was "in a state of excitement" as "all mentally confused of this kind, in which the forces are released during the course of action".
USA: Polanski's lawyer calls again for stopping law enforcement
The lawyer of the French-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski has repeatedly demanded on Thursday in Los Angeles (California, western United States) to prosecute his client, who is currently at his residence in Switzerland on the grounds of a moral violation of more than 30 years ago.
Chad Hummel, a lawyer for the director of the "Pianist", has complained to three judges of the Court of Appeals in California's second district of gross procedural errors at the time of the negotiations in 1977.
I call for release on the spot, Hummel said, before adding that the behavior of Judge Laurence Rittenband, who was in charge of the case at the time of the trial, "made one run cold on his back."
According to him, the now-deceased Judge Rittenband, before his verdict, had discussed with a prosecutor who was supposed to have told him Roman Polanski deserved a nursing home -- a serious procedural error.
This discussion had been set up in the documentary film "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" (Roman Polanski: persecuted and desired), specifically by the questioned prosecutor David Wells.
Wells had finally declared at the end of September that he had "lied" to the authors of the documentary.
Should the Court refuse to close the criminal proceedings, Mr Hummel requests that a trial be conducted which would enable him to provide evidence for his argument.
The prosecution, for its part, reiterated the evidence already presented in the first instance, i.e. that a discussion on the abolition of the facts charged to the accused cannot be seriously considered as long as Roman Polanski does not appear in court.
The 76-year-old director had fled the U.S. in 1978, before he was sentenced for "illegal sexual relations" with a 13-year-old minor.
Since then, he has not traveled to the United States.
Los Angeles County Deputy Prosecutor Phyllis Asayama had stated that Roman Polanski "must be there to attend the trial."
Do you want to spread the message in this matter, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other accused, that escape is a way out?, asks Ms. Asayma.
In her opinion, “the filmmaker asks the court for a favor and thus despises his authority.”
One of the three judges – who now have 90 days to announce their decision – even pointed out that “there are other escape options.”
Hummel was not the only one who had applied for the cessation of prosecution against Roman Polanski.
Samantha Geimer’s lawyer, the victim, also demanded the suspension of the criminal proceedings.
She recalled that her client would no longer tolerate being harassed by every revival of the Polanski affair, adding: "No one in this room can say that this procedure was fair.
Thirty-two years is enough.”
Roman Polanski was arrested in Switzerland on September 26 on the basis of an American arrest warrant.
After spending two months behind bars, he was convicted in anticipation of possible extradition to house arrest in his Gstaad chalet.
Wall Street is slowed by the rise of the dollar and closes without price.
The New York Stock Exchange closed on Friday in a market that was up and down between better than predicted indicators in the US and an increase in the dollar: the Dow Jones won 0.63%, while the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
Based on the final figures available at closing, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose by 65.67 points to 10,471.50 points, while the technologically dominated Nasdaq posted 0.55 points to 2,190.31.
The expanded Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1,106.41 points.
“Honestly, the market is pretty quiet,” said Mace Blicksilver of Marblehead Asset Management.
"It remains tightly limited, the volume of trade has become very low and I think it will remain so until the end of the year."
The trend was supported by the release of better-than-expected economic indicators that “contributed to improving the market view of the solidity of the economy’s rebound,” summarized Charles Schwab’s analysts.
In the U.S., retail sales increased by 1.3% in November, already two months in a row and far more than anticipated.
Confidence of American consumers improved significantly in December to 73.4 from 67.4 in the previous month, according to the University of Michigan’s index forecast.
However, the indices have been slowed by a new rise in the dollar exchange rate, which has reached its highest level against the euro in two months, pushing down sectors vulnerable to the economic situation," said Owen Fitzpatrick, Deutsche Bank.
As a result, the technological values have lost some ground.
The bond market has declined.
The yield of the 10-year Treasury bond rose by 3.540% on Wednesday evening from 3.482% and that of the 30-year bond to 4.497% from 4.492% on the previous day.
Miss World again in South Africa
After a month’s tour of South Africa, the 112 candidates for the Miss World title will cross the last barrier on Saturday to realize their dream: to be elected the most beautiful woman in the world, in front of a billion television viewers.
During this great beauty fair, which is held for the second time in a row in the area of Johannesburg, five of them have already got their ticket to the semi-finals.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta from Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo from Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma from Canada were selected as Miss Sportive or Miss Top Model during their African stay.
This was a true whirlwind of pleasures.
Beautiful cities to visit, such as Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Hoorn, was simply exceptional.
I’ve seen a lot of things and made a lot of experiences!” said Miss Sierra Leone with enthusiasm.
This competition will take place for the ninth time in South Africa and will be broadcast live from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, on Saturday, starting at 5 p.m.
I couldn't imagine a more beautiful country to hand over my crown.
This experience was simply fascinating.
I am happy to have made this experience twice, underlined Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of the South African summer.
For the young Russian, her second stay in South Africa was marked by numerous exchanges of experience with candidates and the rediscovery of "breathtaking landscapes".
After a month of galas, rehearsals, press meetings and safari, Miss now focuses on the competition.
Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to follow in the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, who was elected in 2000 and will also be present at this election, as well as to mimic Aishwarya Rai, who was elected in 1994 and both became Bollywood stars.
Of course, it is every woman’s dream to once be crowned the most beautiful woman in the world, but it’s not just about appearance.
We are ambassadors of our country and I want to come home with the crown, Miss India throws in with a wide smile.
According to the organizers, this 59th edition is underlined with music and dance.
The candidates defiled in traditional costumes and not to forget, in a swimsuit.
The show will be hosted by a television presenter, Chinese Angela Chow, former South African beauty queen Michelle McLean and a Miss World committee leader, Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that it knows how to welcome the world with an insurmountable warmth and pride, assures Julia Morley, President of Miss World.
The candidates, like last year, took a safari visiting the famous township in Soweto, but this time tasting by bike and local cuisine.
However, the meeting with South African President Jacob Zuma, who gave them a hand, was quite extraordinary.
Not usual for a head of state, Miss Sierra Leone noted.
However, her most beautiful memory remains undoubtedly the draw in Cape Town (southwest) for the World Cup in June 2010, a kind of country to advertise a little more for this event.
I'm wrong with people I'd probably never get close to.
I will definitely return to the 2010 World Cup, Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi, promised enthusiastically.
Johnny Hallyday's Son David Says He's "Very Positive"
The news about Johnny Hallyday is "very positive," his son David assured on Friday on his arrival at Los Angeles airport, where he visited his father, who has been in the hospital for several days.
The news is very positive.
He is very strong, everything is going very well, David Hallyday told the press when he got off the plane, arriving shortly after 1 p.m. local time (21 p.m.) from Paris.
The singer's son, who made a relaxed impression, assured that he would be "fastest" to go to Cedars-Sina<0xC3><0xAF> Hospital, where Johnny Hallyday was admitted on Monday for a bacterial consequential infection after surgery on a disc injury on November 26 in Paris.
The singer was placed in an artificial coma in Los Angeles that night to relieve his severe pain and perform his treatment, the press service announced.
Johnny Hallyday was placed in an artificial coma by doctors at Cedars-Sina<0xC3><0xAF> Hospital in Los Angeles, where he was admitted to Paris on Monday for a bacterial consequential infection after a pancreatic surgery on November 26.
The singer had to undergo surgery again on the night of Wednesday to Thursday due to the diseased changes that resulted from the last surgery.
His wife Laeticia attended a school event at the French high school in Los Angeles on Friday morning, where her daughter Jade goes to school, a photographer from AFP noted.
The head of the Department of Orthopaedic and Traumatological Surgery at the Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital, Yves Catoné, announced that he would visit the singer at the Los Angeles hospital on Monday.
The producer has severely strained the neurosurgeon Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, who operated on the singer on November 26 at the Clinique internationale du parc Monceau in Paris.
We were told that he had committed the purest massacre.
The surgeons in Los Angeles said they were completely upset, Mr. Camus said.
I have heard that a trial may be initiated, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus believes that Johnny Hallyday "has travelled far too fast and this with the permission of the Parisian surgeon to Los Angeles".
I personally telephoned this doctor, who assured me that he considered this trip completely unproblematic, which was a great surprise to me, since I myself already have two spinal cord surgery behind me, he added.
Shortly before, he announced to RTL that the singer had apparently left the hospital "without drainage, without everything" after the operation.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the artist environment.
He had operated on the actress Marie Trintignant, a few days before her death in Vilnius, in a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine, where he practiced at that time.
In 2007, he had also operated on actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to absorb a hematoma after a brain haemorrhage.
But he is also a doctor with a dubious reputation, who has already been convicted several times for failed operations and not to forget, for tax evasion and fraud.
Me Olivier Metzner, the lawyer of the Medical Chamber, has described him as "a man without scruples" who has to answer "regularly" before the Board of the Chamber and is "anything but recommended".
After a few days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux made a statement on Friday about his lawyer, Me David Koubbi.
He said the intervention would have been "perfect" and the post-operative examinations would have been "normal".
The operation "did not cause any bleeding and therefore does not require drainage," he added.
In any case, the tour of the singer, whose health problems have been growing since last summer, seems to be in doubt.
It is quite clear that it is a little too short for a continuation of the tour on January 8 (in Amiens), Mr. Camus explained.
The party alliance UDF (Union for French Democracy) is becoming energetic and calls on the Nouveau Centre party to stop using its seal
The party alliance, overseen by François Bayrou's MoDem party, has on Friday strongly reacted to an attempt to take over the seal, the party once founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, by the chairman of the Nouveau Centre party, Hervé Morin, and no longer documented it under threat of prosecution.
Hervé Morin publicly announces his intention to adopt this UDF seal, as he believes that François Bayrou would not be worthy of defending this political legacy after giving the left his hand.
The defence minister, whose party partner is the UMP, wanted to reaffirm this strategy in front of the NC National Council on Saturday.
As a reminder of his efforts, he had received the support of MEP Hervé de Charette (formerly UMP, now at NC), who claimed ownership of the UDF trademark, as he was the first to apply for it in 2004 at the "Institut national de la propriété industrielle".
However, the business unit of the party alliance UDF, supervised by François Bayrous’ friends, broke the silence and made it clear that they could not be expropriated and, under threat of prosecution, gave the minister and the MP a period of time to stop using this seal and transfer the property rights to her.
You have made numerous statements in recent days that you would propose to your political movement to take over the UDF seal, wrote the party alliance in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 office members, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez, the MoDem party, as well as Senator Jean Arthuis B.
You probably also believed that you had the right to have the name of this movement +Nouveau centre+, the slogan + of today’s UDF +, printed on their political material as well as on the homepage of your website.
As you know, you have no right to use this seal, the UDF office stated, and urges the NC party to "immediately remove the mention of the name UDF from all material as well as from (their) website".
In addition, Hervé de Charette was required "to transfer the ownership rights of the brand to its legal claimants".
If you refuse to do so, we will file a lawsuit against you in order to respect the law and to defend the legitimate rights of UDF members, the signatories warned.
In their letter, they stress that "UDF" has been a full-fledged political movement since 1978 and recall that Morin and his friends "made the choice" to leave this in 2007 to form a competing movement, as others had already done in 2002 to form the "UMP" party.
According to the signatories, the Nouveau centre party therefore has no right to use the UDF seal (Union pour la démocratie française).
They also recall that the last congress of the UDF in 2007 approved the three-year membership of the MoDem party as well as the establishment of an office to defend "the material and moral interests" of the movement founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, the office continues, "at the time when he applied for the brand name, he was no longer a member of the UDF for three years" but of the UMP.
He benefits in a scandalous and deceptive way, from the lack of depositing the acronym UDF to do this for himself.
Furthermore, you give into consideration that this recklessness is on the best way to turn into a crime, and ironize the strategy of the NC: "It seems to us, in politics as well as in life, more worthy of making a name for ourselves, rather than trying to come out of anonymity by deceiving oneself in a deceptive way."
Liliane Bettencourt: François-Marie Banier Convicted of Exploitation of Weakness
The court of Nanterre on Friday decided to judge the artist François-Marie Banier to determine whether, as the daughter of billionaire Liliane Bettencourt claims, he has taken advantage of a weak moment of the Eighty-year-olds in order to squander a part of her fortune.
The 62-year-old photographer, who is known for his star photographs, will be held accountable in court on April 15 and 16, 2010, for exploiting weakness, a crime punishable by a maximum of three years’ imprisonment and a fine of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>375,000.
This decision means that there will indeed be a process in this matter worthy of the saga of one of the richest families in France, in which mother and daughter are engaged and at the same time have in their hands the restraints of the cosmetic empire L'Oréal.
However, the 15th Criminal Chamber ordered a medical examination of 87-year-old Liliane Bettencourt, which is carried out jointly by three doctors.
The heir and main shareholder of L'Oréal has so far refused to undergo such an investigation, especially not under the conditions submitted by the Prosecutor's Office of Nanterre during the investigations.
The doctors appointed on Friday are expected to submit a report before March 10, 2010, in which you clearly announce whether and when Liliane Bettencourt may have been in a state of weakness.
I think she will undergo these investigations.
I will speak to her,” Mrs Bettencourt’s lawyer, Me Georges Kiejman, said after the hearing.
As for the lawyer of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, Me Olivier Metzner, he is very satisfied with the decision of the court.
This is excellent news (...). The opinion will prove that he (Banier) has manipulated this old lady that you have to protect, he reaffirmed.
For two years, Liliane Bettencourt’s only daughter has filed a criminal lawsuit against François-Marie Banier, a photographer and all-round artist, accusing him of exploiting her mother’s weakness for years in order to donate a total of one billion euros in the form of bank cheques, insurance policies, or money laundering.
For her part, Liliane Bettencourt had always refuted being manipulated by the photographer she considers a long-time friend.
Although the court would have to examine the admissibility of the action brought by Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers, the lawyers’ pleadings on Friday led to a major family debacle.
For example, Liliane Bettencourt’s lawyer cited three letters sent by his client to her notary (1999, 2003 and 2005) in which she wrote that she distrusts Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers’ husband.
According to her lawyer, Liliane Bettencourt added: "Could you please explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier for fifteen years, once or twice a day.
I've never been able to speak to Françoise since her marriage."
The Nanterre Public Prosecutor’s Office once again believes that the plaintiff had no right to react in this way, especially because a guardianship judge has rejected her request in recent days to initiate a legal protection proceedings against her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "is fully legal, is not protected and has no guardian.
No one has the right to act in their place,” said Marie-Christine Daubigney, the attorney general’s representative.
The court has now decided to issue a judgment after the admissibility trial of Ms Bettencourt-Meyers took place.
Manager Revolution or the End of Strategic Early Enlightenment?
If nothing changes in the leadership of the great French companies, our struggle for the development of economic intelligence has been in vain ...
For more than a decade, the attitude of the management of large companies in relation to its employees, said the position of the companies vis-à-vis the consumers before the marketing revolution: It is for the staff to join "values" determined the best, as it used to be on the consumer products designed by the technicians in the plant to impose.
By placing the customer at the center of the company, the marketing revolution has given the strategies of conquering the markets in the place ... although the authoritarian temptation products separate factors to impose customer preferences again and again on a regular basis!
Demobilization of employees can lead to fatal demoralization.
Suicides at France Telecom, PSA or Renault are just the tip of a much larger phenomenon that particularly affects employees.
This demobilization has a negative impact on the development of all the intellectual functions of the company, especially those of R&E and, more crucially, those of economic intelligence.
Indeed, the IE (Intelligence Economique) calls “for a proactive approach and a forward-looking perspective from all parties involved”; it demands from employees a commitment that is completely contrary to the instructions of authoritarian management.
That is why we are calling for an operational revolution, which would consist in placing employees at the centre of the company’s concerns on an equal footing alongside the customers.
The very conditional benefit of internal opinion polls
Will the internal opinion polls, such as the questionnaire Orange has submitted to its wage earners, stimulate this revolution in terms of management practice?
I'm afraid not.
- First of all, because I was able to find that the whole fabric, in the face of a new situation, after many detours, finally arrives at doing primarily what it has always done.
Also because authoritarianism, one of the pathologies of power, increases proportionally to the importance of its own failures.
And finally, because most executives have a highly simplified idea of human behavior.
Deriving from the major engineering schools, their interpretation of psychology is mechanistic.
They adopt, through intellectual comfort, the old behaviorist theory, which has recently been reactivated by U.S. “neurology” and unknowingly widely disseminated by research institutes and the media.
Thus, and by suggesting that it is possible to use the "leverage" (sic) to engage employees, a recent survey by Ipsos, published in Le Figaro.fr, reinforces the leaders in an attitude towards a mechanistic control system that is unsuitable for today's world.
Identify and measure the mobilization factors
Instead, a business revolution necessary for the smooth functioning of modern enterprises presupposes the adoption of a definitive view of human behavior.
It consists in incorporating a basic protocol into every consideration or practice of management: for the payees, engagement for the company is possible only if it clearly appears as a means to realize part of their dreams, ambitions and projects.
At the moment, only the studies from the multifunctional analysis adopt this concept of employee motivation.
These studies have shown that they judge their company on the basis of a predetermined doxa, which allows them, by their perceived image of the company, to estimate what it offers them to achieve their life goals.
By identifying and measuring these mobilization factors, business leaders can control, predict and anticipate their “social performance” and reposition their human resource management in the right place.
In this way, they create a fertile soil that is favorable for the coordinated development of robust and efficient economic intelligence.
Oslo Speech: “Just War” Brings Obama Praise from the Right
The American right welcomed Barack Obama’s speech in Oslo on Friday and was pleased that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize had defended the concept of a “just war” against the enemies of the United States.
The Conservatives, who mocked Obama’s award on October 9, this time applauded the president’s speech, following the example of former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin in the 2008 election.
I liked what he said, Palin explained, the face of the Republican Party’s right wing in the USA Today newspaper, adding that she herself has raised the subject of a “sometimes necessary” war in her memoirs.
The war is of course the last thing I think the Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
We have to stop the terrorists down there, she says.
Obama, who inherited two wars from his predecessor George W. Bush, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, tried on Thursday in Oslo to justify the use of force; a way to explain his decision of nine days ago to send 30,000 additional soldiers to Afghanistan.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, argued that the president did “very good work” in Oslo.
I found the speech really very good, the former president of the House of Representatives rejoiced, especially acknowledging the reference to “the existence of evil in the world” in Obama’s words.
In some parts I felt this speech was entirely historical, Ginrich explained, who was interviewed on the radio show "The Takeaway".
The former MP, who is considered by some to be a possible candidate for the Republican nomination for the 2012 presidential election, said he was delighted to have seen a "President of the Left" who reminded members of the Nobel Committee that they "would not be free and could not afford a price for peace if they could not exist."
For Michael Gerson, former writer of George W. Bush and now editor of the Washington Post, Obama has given “a very American speech.”
In addition to portraying himself as “cosmopolitan” as “he always does,” he spoke “like an American president” when he pointed out that Europeans “live in a security bubble that they didn’t create themselves and for whose protection they don’t do much,” Gerson said.
Among the few, unconvinced rights, former UN ambassador John Bolton, a Bush-era falcon, described the speech on the National Review Online website as "boring, lofty and uninspired".
To the left of the president, Democratic Representative Dennis Kucinich is concerned about how Barack Obama defends the military’s retaliation.
If one packs the war under the guise of the judiciary, the massacre of the innocents can easily be justified, he warns.
The moderate-left press, however, remains praising the president’s side.
The Los Angeles Times, which still believes that the Nobel Prize was given to Obama prematurely, called the speech itself a “monumental work” for a speaker like him, known for his talent.
The speech in Oslo “offers a timetable for managing international decisions against conflict, poverty and oppression,” the California daily said in a statement.
The New York Times believes that Obama “proclaimed the necessary discourse” and calls his speech “dark and exemplary at the same time.”
Three marathons for a deal to secure the supply at Christmas
After a three-week negotiating marathon, the unions of the road association and the TLF - the only employers' organization that remained until the end - came to an agreement on Friday night that put an end to the strike order and the imminent severe supply bottleneck at Christmas.
At the signing meeting on Friday evening, Secretary of State for Transport Dominique Bussereau "welcomed" the agreement, which was launched on Wednesday morning after several weeks of negotiations.
After a second negotiating night, the negotiators separated early Friday morning in the hope of quickly signing the agreement in the late morning.
And this despite the fact that the three employers’ associations (FNTR, Unostra and OTRE) had left the meeting.
However, it took more than six hours from the beginning of the meeting at 11:00 until the conclusion of the agreement and only at 18:00 the agreement was signed.
The conflict "had done a lot of damage to the companies" and "it was to be feared that it would affect the holidays at the end of the year," said Bussereau.
The agreement provides for a wage increase of 4% for the lowest wages (local and regional road transport) and of 2.9% for the highest wage groups (international transport).
The hourly rate for workers with the lowest wages thus rises from 8.72 euros to 9.06 euros.
"It's not a lot, but we're just starting small," says Patrice Clos (FO).
Activists are now instructed to stop blocking the supply centers.
"There will probably always be some opponents who are not satisfied with the agreement," he adds.
TLF chairman Philippe Grillot spoke of a "good deal", although it was "difficult to allow these wage increases in the face of international competition".
According to him, the increase is 170 euros per month for the low and 100 to 120 euros for the high wage groups.
"This agreement is based on common sense and respect for the employees," said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) spoke of "an historic agreement."
Richard Jaubert (CGT) commented on "an acceptable compromise".
The agreement also provides for an increase in travel costs of 3% and the maintenance of the overall budget for road transport in the first half of 2010, which will allow in particular to address the issue of the 13th monthly salary and the modernisation of collective agreements.
M. Bussereau recalled that “the reduction in employers’ fees of 100 million euros” was the subject of a government amendment to the 2009 revised finance bill passed by the National Assembly on the night of Thursday to Friday.
The government is calling for an "identical" vote by the Senate.
The signing of the TLF allows the agreement to apply first to the companies affiliated to this organization and then to apply to the entire professional level in the event of an extension by the Minister of Labour.
This will be the case "in the shortest possible time", says Bussereau.
The opposition of the employers’ associations can only delay the procedure.
The association FNTR denounced a "fraudulent trade" because the 100 million euros "had already been promised to the sector to compensate for a part of the carbon tax".
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to negotiate as quickly as possible, but not on the basis of a joint analysis, but in order not to crush the goose-eaters on the coming Christmas days, complains Unostra.
For the Otre association, the agreement threatens "to lay a big grave for the small and medium-sized enterprises of the industry in the next 12 months".
Line RER A: Disruptions this weekend, unions dissatisfied with the proposals of the RATP
The disruptions on the RER A line, the largest high-speed rail network in France for the Greater Paris area and the <0xC3><0x8E>le-de-France, continued over the weekend, while a meeting on Friday, the 2nd day of the strike between the trade unions and the management of the RATP (Independent Parisian Passenger Transport Administration), continued to lay strikers with their demands.
On this important shopping weekend before Christmas, there were no trains between 10:00 and 20:00.On the central route (between La Défense and Nation) only one of two trains was ready for use and outside the central route only one of four trains was ready for use.
The connection to the trains of the SNCF was interrupted in Nanterre Prefecture, forcing the travelers to switch.
The shopping chain Galeries Lafayette, which counts 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that "RATP is trying to connect the big stores in traffic technology".
The RER A line runs through the Paris metropolitan area from west to east.
The RATP section connects the towns of Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre as well as Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, about one in two trains was scheduled to arrive at the main traffic time, and almost none during the low-traffic time.
As already on Thursday, there was no public feeling on the platforms, as the inhabitants of the <0xC3><0x8E>le-de-France had adjusted to the situation.
So early in the morning, the train station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was far less crowded than usual, mainly due to the lack of high school students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, an engineer (29), explained that he would have been extra "an hour and a half earlier to get to work on time".
The SNCF, which had planned to provide assistance to passengers by staff and law enforcement, pointed out that there were no bottlenecks at Saint-Lazare railway station.
The trains operated by the SNCF on line RER A or in the direction of Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or departed via the Saint-Lazare station to ensure the connection to the subways.
On Saturday and Sunday, the strikers' main assemblies again took place, during which the results were reviewed, which the associations had classified as "poor" after meeting with the leadership on Friday afternoon.
The RER Managing Director proposed the specific drafting of a protocol for line RER A with regard to all relevant aspects, working hours, career paths, etc.
However, this is not what drivers want, according to Thierry Garon (South), they are demanding a long-standing salary increase.
The CGT was outraged that the RATP itself put its payroll proposals in brackets, stressing that the leadership "is not able to solve a problem, while this was also possible with the long-distance drivers and the SNCF."
The RATP clarified that a re-convention was scheduled for Monday for a "comprehensive review of working conditions".
This also shows the associations that the company "ignores the weekend travelers".
In the morning, about 150 drivers sought the establishment of a committee in Paris.
Again, it was the leadership that so far rejected any discussion during the strike, and suggested a meeting after a calming of the situation.
On Tuesday, the conflict threatened to spread to the RER B line after a pre-announcement by UNSA and independents.
The associations demand a salary supplement of 120 (Unsa) to 150 euros, of which 30 euros are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud, Indépendants). In addition, they regret the deterioration of working conditions on this route, on which millions of travelers travel daily.
The drivers of the RER line, who have years of professional experience, receive a gross salary of 2,200 to 2,700 euros as well as a salary supplement of 600 to 650 euros for shift services as well as Sundays and holidays.
Turkish Constitutional Court dissolves pro-Kurdish party. Decision with serious consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court on Friday announced the dissolution of the country’s pro-Kurdish main party; a decision that was followed by immediate outrageous demonstrations in the Kurdish community in the southeast of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision threatens to greatly complicate the work of the government, which is trying to reach out to the Kurdish community to put an end to the 25-year-old conflict.
The "Party for a Democratic Society" (DTP) was dissolved as it had become a "place for activities that are detrimental to the independence of the state and its indivisible unity", said President of the Constitutional Court Hasim Kiliç four days after the decision to the press.
According to Kiliç, the decision would have been taken unanimously by 11 judges, with a majority of seven votes required to enforce the dissolution. He also pointed out that 37 of the party's leaders, including Chairman Ahmet Türk and Parliamentarian Aysel Tugluk, were excluded from political affairs for a period of five years.
Furthermore, the judge announced the lifting of parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Turk and Tugluk, as well as the confiscation of the party's goods.
The DTP now has 21 seats in parliament (out of 550).
The party leaders commented before the verdict that parliamentarians would rather leave parliament than be seen as impartial parliamentarians.
The decision followed a trial initiated in 2007 by the prosecutor of the Turkish federal court, Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya, who accused the DTP of following the "instructions" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which is considered a terrorist organization by Ankara and numerous other countries.
Numerous observers believe that the DTP is the legal political window of the PKK rebels.
The party claims to have "no connection" to the PKK, but refuses to call it a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate.
The verdict of the Constitutional Court intersects with the government, which seeks to confront the Kurdish community and propose a series of measures to strengthen the rights of the Kurds in order to end the support of the PKK by the Kurds and put an end to the conflicts.
The leaders of the DTP affirm that a dissolution could lead to a re-emergence of tensions in southeastern Anatolia, where numerous demonstrations against the detention conditions of PKK chief Abdullah <0xC3><0x96>calan in recent weeks had led to clashes with the police.
Since the court’s announcement, thousands of protesters have gathered outside the DTP premises in the million-dollar city of Diyarbakir in the southeast, which is predominantly Kurdish-populated.
The police used tear gas grenades and water throwers as the protesters began to throw Molotov cocktails and stones.
Hundreds of people also protested in Istanbul.
After the verdict, Türk assumed that the court’s decision “will deepen the desperation even further.”
"Turkey cannot clarify this issue on the basis of a party's ban," he told the press.
The government, consisting of a party that emerged from the Islamist movement, also regretted the decision.
“We oppose in principle the closure of the parties.
This does not solve the problems,” said Energy Minister Taner Yildiz.
"This decision is a torpedo to the democratic opening that has been promoted by the government," said Ahmet Island, a political market observer.
“You can obviously get caught up in a reaction from the PKK,” he adds.
On Thursday, the PKK announced an attack that killed seven soldiers in northern Turkey three days earlier, one of the most brutal attacks in recent months.
The snowstorm may come
A really crisp winter, that’s what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
Not because he wants to harass the citizens, says the Winter Service Manager of the FES.
Rather, so that his employees can try and master the entire vehicle technology.
It could be that far this weekend, according to meteorologists.
More than 330 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to take care of snow and ice.
In doing so, the FES follows a precise plan.
As soon as it snows extensively in Frankfurt and the temperatures are below zero degrees, 20 so-called A-routes are run by large-scale scattering vehicles, explains Brauburger.
These include major traffic and transit roads such as the Neue Weg and the Hanauer Landstraße.
But also firefighting, public roads, pedestrian zones and sloped routes, such as the Atzelbergstraße.
FES service starts at 3 a.m.
The approx. 1040 kilometres would have to be dispersed in a maximum of three hours with moist salt, which sticks better.
Therefore, the FES starts at three o'clock at night, "so that the routes are free until the professional traffic starts".
It will be difficult if it does not snow until 7:30 a.m.
Then we have a problem, says the Winter Service Manager, "because then no one is ready to make room for the scattering vehicles".
It is only afterwards, if it does not snow further, that it is time for the roads of supply and development, which also includes the Rat-Beil-Straße.
The last priority is side roads and side roads.
There will be complaints, Brauburger knows.
At five o’clock in the morning, the FES’s people are on their way, and hazard points and transitions are cleared in the first place.
The FES usually can't care about all bike paths.
There is a special service in Frankfurt that keeps an eye on the bridges from 10 to 4.30 p.m., says Brauburger.
Since there is a quick smoothing on these, as soon as the temperature drops below two degrees, the spreader is on the move.
If necessary, it will also be called by the police.
The Cradle of Dinosaurs
Tawa hallae looked like many other carnivorous dinosaurs: the two-metre-long and 1.50-metre-high animal ran on two powerful hind legs, had an elongated skull with sharp, curved teeth, short arms with silk claws and a long tail.
Had the species lived a few million years later, it would have been nothing special.
But Tawa hallae was one of the first dinosaurs with these body features, reports Sterling Nesbitt of the University of Texas in Austin and colleagues in Thursday’s journal Science.
The animal lived about 215 million years ago in what is now New Mexico, which was then in a dry zone of the supercontinent Pangaea on the equator.
Tawa opens a new window on the early evolution of dinosaurs, says Nesbitt.
He shows us a lot about the relationship, the distribution and the characteristics of the early dinosaurs.
In 2006, Nesbitt and other paleontologists began digging at Ghost Ranch in northern New Mexico.
We sometimes found a dozen dinosaur bones in one day, which is unprecedented for deposits from the Triassic, reports team member Randall Irmis of the Utah Museum of Natural History.
Some of the bones quickly identified the researchers as a new species.
During the excavation, they brought together the remains of a total of five individuals.
Find confirms theories about Dino's early history
The name "Tawa" comes from the sun god of the Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt, it is an extraordinary find: "Dinosaur fossils from the Triassic are extremely rare, usually only individual fragments are found."
Other dinosaur experts do not necessarily share the enthusiasm.
This finding is not particularly spectacular, but it confirms some theories about the early history of dinosaurs, says Martin Sander of the University of Bonn.
According to current teachings, dinosaurs first appeared about 230 million years ago.
However, many of the oldest fossils are incomplete, which is why the assignment of these primordial dinosaurs is usually controversial.
For example, the experts debate when the lizards split into their three main lines of development: the carnivorous theropods, which later included the Tyrannosaurus rex, the Velociraptor, and also the birds, which are known as "long-necked" to the four-legged species of the sauropods.
According to the analysis of Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa hallae is an original theropod.
It has an interesting combination of primitive and advanced properties, says Nesbitt.
At the skull of Tawa hallae, for example, the researchers found clues to air sacs, as they also possess the descendants of theropods, the birds.
Thanks to the air bags, the breathing of birds is more efficient than that of mammals.
In Tawa hallae, the bones of the spine were also apparently partially filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive theropod with air sacs, says Randall Irmis.
Since the related lineage of the giant sauropods later also possessed airbags and lightweight bones, it is likely that the common ancestor of both groups had already produced this useful innovation.
At least three waves of migration to North America
Because the most primitive dinosaurs known to date lived in South America, the researchers conclude that the lizards first appeared there.
As a result, the three lines of development separated early and spread from South America over all parts of the Earth, which at that time still formed a single land mass as the supercontinent Pangaea.
This is due to the fact that the team, together with Tawa hallae, found the remains of two other, not particularly closely related theropods.
The three cannot descend from a common immigrant ancestor, the researchers argue.
We believe there were at least three waves of migration to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, a co-author of the science study.
Of course, there are also contradictions.
An even older species, Silesaurus, which belongs to a sister group of dinosaurs, lived in present-day Poland, says Bonner palaeontologist Martin Sander.
In his opinion, there could be a distorted picture, because in South America, there are only very many primitive dinosaur fossils that have been preserved, while on other continents, there is hardly anything to be found.
How the dinosaurs managed to evolve from a relatively rare sideline of the reptile tribe to the dominant terrestrial vertebrates of the Earth's Middle Ages is still enigmatic.
During the Triassic, the dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other reptiles, for example, with the ancestors of today's crocodiles and flying saurians and with numerous other lizards.
Towards the end of the Triassic, the dinosaurs spread around the world and developed many new species, while the kinship on the border from the Triassic to the Jura died out.
Success story didn't last forever
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
There may have been a mass death that the dinosaurs accidentally survived, but the other reptiles did not.
Or the dinosaurs were better adapted so they could beat the competition out of the field.
At least the success story didn’t last forever.
150 million years later, a meteorite impact helped a group of animals to blossom, which had also evolved in the Triassic and has since tempted a shadow existence: the mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the signatories are international.
Professors at the University of Toronto, the University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna or from Berkeley in California.
Lecturers from Naples are in attendance, from Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
The police eviction of the occupied casino of the Frankfurt Goethe University is hitting waves worldwide.
278 professors and lecturers from the Goethe University, but also from universities throughout Germany, Europe and North and South America stand in solidarity with the protesting students on the Westend campus.
In a statement written in German and English, they "disapprove" the police intervention initiated by the Bureau.
University President Werner Müller-Estler had the building occupied by students and lecturers on the educational strike cleared last week because walls and works of art had been dirtyed.
Five students were injured in the incident.
The damages, the signatories judged, did not justify "the violent dissolution of self-organized teaching events by students and teachers by a police command".
The eviction represents an "unacceptable interference" in the freedom of research and teaching.
The exclusive focus on vandalism serves "the deligitization and criminalization of the protest" and deflects from the content.
The Bureau has withdrawn from the necessary discourse.
The teachers demand the immediate cessation of criminal prosecution.
The majority of the occupants did not support the damage, it is said.
Protests Legitimate
The youth of the Verdi union and the German Trade Union Federation are also in solidarity with the students.
The protest is a legitimate expression of a growing concern for one’s own future, says Verdi youth secretary Alexander Klein.
Hessen’s science minister, Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU), defended the actions of the uni president and the police.
We are grateful to the President.
Destruction and occupation are completely unacceptable means, she said at a press conference on Thursday in the Wiesbadener Landtag.
We have an understanding of the protest, but no understanding of vandalism, says CDU MP Peter Beuth.
The opposition factions SPD, Greens and Left saw it differently.
The CDU takes painted walls as a pretext to criminalize the protest, said Janine Wissler (left).
Instead of dealing with the students' arguments and demands, they have been cleared.
The left has filed a motion urging the interior minister to report on the police deployment.
New Silicon-Valley
For many years it was considered a secret city, inaccessible to Western visitors.
Selenograd, one of the ten districts of the capital Moscow, was a strictly guarded location for secret armor research in the Soviet Union.
Today, the municipality with its 216,000 inhabitants, 37 kilometers from the center of Moscow, is considered the "Russian Silicon Valley".
Important research and production facilities for micro and nanoelectronics are located here.
Since September 2008, representatives of Selenograd had established contacts with the Frankfurt science site Riedberg - with the university institutes and the companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There were several mutual visits and on Wednesday Selenograd and Riedberg signed a "protocol on closer cooperation".
Moscow deputy mayor Yuri Rosljak and prefect Anatoly Smirnov of Selenograd led the Russian delegation, for Frankfurt signed planning dezernat Edwin Schwarz.
In 2010, representatives of the FIZ and small and medium-sized enterprises of the natural science focus will travel to Selenograd for a seminar.
Scientific exchanges
It is a matter of continuous scientific exchange.
But it is also about economic relations.
Firms of the FIZ will be able to take their feet on the growing Russian market.
Conversely, Russian scientific companies want to obtain orders in Germany.
Selenograd is the seat of major Russian research institutes and companies.
These include, for example, the Moscow Institute of Electronics Engineering, the large corporations Citronics and Rossijskaja Elektronika.
The municipality was founded in 1958 as a so-called "socialist planning city" for armor research.
Selenograd (literally translated "green city") got its name from the forested hilly landscape in which the research institutions are embedded.
Stuttgarter Bremsklotz
The dimension of Stuttgart 21 cannot be set high enough.
For the proponents of the project, it is simply about "the new heart of Europe".
S21 is much more than a train station, more than a monstrous construction project that will plunge the city of the state capital of Baden-Württemberg into chaos for a decade.
Stuttgart 21 was born from the spirit of the 1980s.
Head train stations with tracks ending in the middle of the city were then considered 19th century traffic-technical fossils that acted like brake pads of modern rail traffic, as it once took a huge amount of time to sweep locomotives from rear to front.
Get in, hold short, keep driving - that's how it's supposed to go.
And that is why the railway stations should disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a crossing station that is about halfway between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava – that’s why the slogan of the “Heart of Europe”.
S21 is actually being addressed now, although the visions of the 80s have long since ceased to be compatible with reality.
Even very ambitious planners have realized that in the Hessian and Bavarian metropolitan areas, it is almost priceless to implement the deepening.
Heading stations, however, no longer have an entry and exit problem, since there are modern turnover trains with powered vehicles and control cars at both ends.
Nevertheless, Stuttgart 21 is now approached in addition to the ICE new construction route to Ulm.
Local and local politicians have enforced it.
The railway takes part, also because the risks of the largest single infrastructure project of the Republic are borne by taxpayers and not by state-owned corporations.
In urban planning, the project can still be justified somewhat.
New urban space is being created, which - it is believed the computer-generated graphics of the planners - will be equipped with a lot of green.
S21 is harmful to the rail transport system.
The transit station and the extension of the route are intended for passenger transport, which - typically in the 80s - was attributed to huge growth.
At the time, there was no competition from low-cost airlines.
However, modern transport policy must first focus on strengthening freight transport, as rail transport is considerably more environmentally friendly than road transport by truck.
However, the new construction route is not suitable for freight trains due to heavy slopes.
Even more serious is that S21 indirectly also touches on many other rail projects.
A total of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>6 billion will be banned in Swabia.
This is the official number.
Experts say 10 to 15 billion is realistic.
It is certain that in the next decade the money will be missing at other nodes and bottlenecks on the network.
A total of 60 major projects are listed by the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the expansion of the 180 km long route through the Rhine Valley.
Since 1987, the track has been built at a time-lapse pace.
It would be urgent to press the tube right here.
But S21 will act as a brake pad.
The Rhinetal route becomes a bottleneck for international freight transport: right in the heart of Europe.
The government is reviewing the judgment on the airport
The state government has left open in the Wiesbadener Landtag whether it will revise the ruling of the Hessian Administrative Court (VGH) on the night flight ban.
The CDU/FDP coalition has commissioned experts to have the more than 400-page VGH ruling examined legally, Economics Minister Dieter Posch (FDP) said.
The VGH in Kassel had on those days in writing reasoned that the country had to re-regulate the night flight ban in the event of the construction of the planned northwest runway at Frankfurt Airport.
The approval of 17 flights between 11 and 5 p.m., as provided by the state government, is not to be agreed with the statutory protection of the population from night flight noise.
The coalition must decide by January 4 whether to revise the verdict.
The opposition criticized this postponement and urged government representatives to refrain from a revision at the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
SPD party leader Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel called on the CDU and FDP to return to their pre-election promises of a night flight ban, otherwise it would be considered a "break-up".
It's damn hard to keep your word, Green chief Tarek Al-Wazir said in reference to the FDP election slogan "We keep our word".
Minister Posch rejected the accusation of Schäfer-Gümbel, the state government is trying to come to their night flights with "rights twisting and trickery".
A thorough legal examination takes your time.
The coalition does not want to operate on the basis of a “quick first impression”.
We need a legal decision, Stefan Müller (FDP) said.
As the opposition puts it, his group’s statements on the night flight ban were never.
U.S. banks pay back aid
The crisis-stricken U.S. major banks are stripping off their state bonds.
On Wednesday, the Bank of America repayed a total of $45 billion ($30 billion) in aid from the Tarp Bank Rescue Fund.
And the Citigroup also plans to reimburse the state aid, according to a report by the US broadcaster CNBC.
The institutions want to get rid of the constraints associated with the acceptance of the money – such as the limitation on the payment of manager bonuses and the payment of high fees.
The Bank of America had raised $19 billion in fresh money from investors through convertible bonds.
She took the rest of the sum from her own cash register, which was well filled, among other things, by savings sales.
Bank chief Kenneth Lewis thanked the U.S. taxpayer on Wednesday: The money injection has helped through a very difficult time.
The money house had risen to the height of the financial crisis with the acquisition of investment bank Merrill Lynch.
The Citigroup also seeks to obtain money on the capital market in order to be released from its liabilities to the state.
Already on Thursday, the U.S. bank could announce a $20 billion increase in its capital, CNBC reported, citing circles.
A Citigroup spokesperson declined to comment.
In June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had already paid back their aid.
Quick Selection
It all went faster than I thought.
Just two weeks after the ZDF Board of Directors had pushed incumbent editor-in-chief Nikolaus Brender out of office, the broadcaster can present a successor.
Last night, the panel wanted to vote on the personality.
The favourite was Peter Frey, head of the ZDF-Hauptstadtstudio in Berlin.
However, there was no confirmation from the broadcaster - officially, so as not to prejudge the procedure.
However, it may also have played a role in not further damaging the ZDF Superintendent Markus Schächter, should this proposal also not pass on to the Board of Directors.
Frey, Schächter’s candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 panel members.
The result of the vote was not yet determined at the end of the drafting of this issue.
Two weeks ago, Schächter had failed on the board of directors with his proposal to extend the contract with Nikolaus Brender for another five years.
Only seven members voted for Brender, seven voted against him, and Brender's re-election was a bitter defeat for Schäker, but an expected one.
The majority in the Board of Directors had already signaled weeks before the election that Brender did not want to be confirmed in office.
He had organized the resistance against the editor-in-chief of the Hessian Prime Minister Roland Koch.
With the argument that under Brender the news broadcasts of the ZDF have lost in turnover quotas, he rejected another term of office of the highly regarded editor-in-chief.
Until shortly before the election, there were protests in which the political influence on the ZDF was whipped.
Thirty-five state lawmakers had recently interfered in the debate, describing Koch’s actions as unconstitutional.
There is nothing to be enjoyed.
To the person
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogy and romance.
After that, he worked for Südwestfunk and the Frankfurter Rundschau.
In 1983 Frey moved to the ZDF, initially to the "heute-journal".
Subsequent stations: 1988 to 1990 personal speaker of the editor-in-chief; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998 director and moderator of the "Morgenmagazine"; until 2001 director of the ZDF foreign policy; since then director of the ZDF capital studio.
The Greens announced a constitutional lawsuit after the election of Brender, who was still voted Journalist of the Year by the industry magazine Medium Magazine on Wednesday.
Koch’s counterpart on the board of directors, the Rhineland-Palatinate Prime Minister Kurt Beck, said last week that the countries should change the ZDF state contract in such a way that the Intendant’s personnel proposals cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
However, an excerpt of party politicians from the ZDF’s supervisory boards also excluded Beck.
Brender’s presumed successor, Peter Frey, had recommended a wise move to the board of directors – criticizing the board vigorously for it immediately after the Brender election.
Thanks to this document of journalistic independence, he was able to be nominated by both the Schäker without loss of face for the post of editor-in-chief and to be elected by the board of directors without being suspected of hiring a party pedestrian.
In party arithmetic Frey is attributable to the left-liberals anyway.
Studying is debunked
After a year of education strike, the Ministers of Culture of the countries finally came forward on Thursday: At a meeting of the Ministers of Culture and Higher Education Rectors Conference, both sides agreed to improve the study conditions for Bachelor and Master.
Students should also be able to manage their studies in the future.
In detail, they agreed to reduce the exam loads: In principle, each study module should only be completed with a single exam.
In addition, the workload of the students is to be checked and "a realistic and reasonable level" is to be ensured.
Politics and universities also want to simplify the recognition of exam services between universities within and outside Germany.
The countries committed themselves to making common structural targets for undergraduate and master programmes more flexible.
Moreover, there should be no different national regulations.
Less Examinations
Since the beginning of the student protests in June, ministers of culture and university rectors have been carrying the winged word of better studenthood in their mouths.
For the first time, it has been filled with concrete content.
The so-called Accreditation Board decided to reduce the number of exams partly drastically: "Each module usually ends with just one exam", according to a 30-page paper, which is intended to partially re-regulate the admission of courses of study.
With the "significant reduction of the exam burden", explained Reinhold Grimm, chairman of the accreditation board, a "failure to stop, which significantly impaired the ability to study."
In addition, "studyability" is to be "the decisive criterion" in the design in the future.
Modules such as content are "strict to check" whether "unnecessary constraints on students' choice of
Events would be avoided.
The students were "entitled to receive playgrounds that enable and promote self-initiative".
The rules for the admission of new, but also for the review of existing courses of study should apply.
These must be “reaccredited” every five years – but that means that it will take until 2015 to review all the courses.
Responsible for this are ten accreditation agencies nationwide, which are subject to the accreditation council set up by the countries.
In October, the ministers of culture had urged the countries to act on the agencies in such a way that the abundance of substances is not too large and the examination regime is not too strict.
In some federal states, universities and universities of applied sciences have already agreed with the state ministries on such measures.
As the only country so far, Rhineland-Palatinate has allocated additional funds for the further development of the Bologna process.
Of this money, the universities will primarily set up tutoring programs and strengthen study counselling and examination and foreign offices.
Countries and universities want to spend ten million euros on it.
At the beginning of 2010, the government wants to introduce a novelty of the higher education law into the parliament.
After this, only one examination is required to complete a study model.
The study design is intended to be more flexible, as well as to ensure the recognition of certificates of achievement at other universities and to facilitate access to the master's degree.
By the end of next year, all studies in the country will be checked for their eligibility.
On Thursday, the government and the opposition again argued about the conditions of study in the country.
In addition to praise, there was also criticism of the decisions.
The Federal Board of Directors of the Juso Higher Education Groups demanded that the design of the education policy should no longer take place "behind closed doors" of the ministers and university rectors.
At the latest after the educational strikes, students should now also "speak a word" as affected.
The future academics received support from the President of the Higher Education Rectors Conference (HRK), Margret Wintermantel: "We need the experience of the students," she said at a meeting with the ministers of culture with whom the HRK advised on a joint reform paper on Thursday.
The Gewerkschaft Bildung und Wissenschaft (GEW) did not go far enough the Bonn decisions as a whole: it demands a legal claim that allows any graduate with a bachelor’s degree access to a further master’s degree program.
On the other hand, countries must ensure that there will be enough Master’s courses with the best possible study conditions for today’s generation of undergraduate students tomorrow, according to GEW Executive Board member Andreas Keller.
Countries need to hire significantly more teachers.
However, the Ministers of Culture did not comment on free access to the Master.
More than a footnote to Herta Müller
Getting into and out of Germany is almost no control..." is the beginning line of a poem by the poet Werner Söllner, in which he discusses the arrival experience of a dissident who gained freedom but at the same time lost his speech space.
Born in the Romanian Banat in 1951, Werner Söllner had initially worked as a German and English teacher in Bucharest and later as a lecturer in a children's book publisher before moving to Frankfurt am Main in 1982.
Söllner has been awarded various literary awards, in 1993 he gave the legendary Frankfurt poetry lectures at the Goethe University, and since 2002 he has been the head of the Hessian Literature Forum at the Mouson Tower in Frankfurt.
He caused considerable extra-literary upheaval last Tuesday during a meeting in Munich, where it was about "German literature in Romania in the mirror and mirror of their security acts".
Visibly insecure, Söllner leaked a statement in which he confessed to Romanian German writers Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer, his co-operation as IM for the Romanian secret service Securitate.
Together with some of the attendees, Söllner received the German Language Prize in 1989.
Recruitment attempts had begun sluggishly, first in 1971.
I am, concluded Söllner, "so someone who has not resisted enough intimidation attempts by the Securitate."
The poet Werner Söllner is IM Walter.
Almost at the same time as the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller and their unprecedented literary confrontation with the mechanisms of dictatorial rule, the literary scene, and in particular the community of German authors originating in Romania, is shaken by a case that reveals the abysses and the degradation of a political system.
Werner Söllner is, as far as we can tell, not only a perpetrator, but also a victim.
In his security files, IM Walter played a role, according to Söllner’s confession of the literary scientist Michael Markel, referring to the positive influence of IM Walter for him.
He “cut him out” in all the difficult points for him at the time, according to Markel.
It is a moral need for him to make this remark.
Söllner’s statement was unexpected in form and in front of this audience, but the confession of a former dissident and his cooperation with the Romanian intelligence service is not entirely surprising.
Germany had been a cozy reserve for security spikes, Herta Müller had already written in July in the time after reading her own 914-page file.
The victims, it may be assumed, are speculating and in some cases probably also knew which plain name was hidden behind the nicknames Sorin, Voicu and even Walter.
Unlike the now highly procedural view of the Stasi files, the handling of the legacy of the Securitate surveillance is still very diffuse.
A systematic enlightenment has been undermined and hindered in recent years.
A National Council for the Preparation of the Securitate Records (CNSAS) corresponding to the Birthlor Authority was founded only in 1999, but the publication of the records has been rather delayed since then.
Only since 2005 there is a law that regulates the administration of the files.
The fact that the influence of former Securitate members in Romania is still very large, after the announcement of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller, proved an interview in which a former Securitate head from Temesvar abhorred the laureate.
She has a psychosis, after all, she has only been questioned once.
The infamy of power meant to be able to express itself here quite openly in the form of freedom of expression.
Certainly, in the case of Söllner, as so often in connection with concealed guilt, there are inevitable questions.
The deliberate reaction of the listeners to Söllner’s confession gives hope that the continuation of this chapter will be determined by the urge to know rather than by blame and shame.
The genesis of the work of Herta Müller, who received the Nobel Prize yesterday, is more than a footnote.
Saturation appendix Champions League
It seemed as if there was just a nicely dressed field serviceman from a very nice Christmas party at which a sports goods manufacturer had distributed goodies, as the new VfB coach Christian Gross accompanied by an orange plastic bag of the equipment a quarter of an hour after midnight.
The man with the distinctive baldness had to be driven because of the city that was still foreign to him.
Otherwise, he could have driven himself - alcohol was not in the game after all, and drunk with luck the 55-year-old was just as little.
Had been a pleasant evening, but tomorrow the work just continues.
Or just go right ahead.
In the words of the Swiss, who had committed only three days before: "We have reached the eighth final", namely in the Champions League thanks to the 3:1 success against Unirea Urziceni from Romania, "but we must not be blinded by the success: it will be a brutally hard fight against the descent."
The "much more important task" is due on Sunday.
Then, in Mainz, it is necessary to repeat the performance of the king classes in the daily life of the league.
And the weaknesses revealed quite once again after the quick three goals to put off by Marica (5th), Träsch (8th) and Pogrebnyak (11th).
Lottery
The Champions League semi-finals (Hindi games 16/17 + 23/24 February/ Back games 9/10 + 16/17 March) will be drawn in Nyon on 18 December.
The joy of the fulminant standing of the Babbel successor thus remained.
Not only in the case of the supposed healer, who had given the insecure Stuttgart professionals self-confidence, commitment and playfulness in the short time.
I approached the players and told them to think about their strengths, and I told them to be braver, explained Seelenklempner Gross, the simple recipe for success that had no effect under therapist Babbel.
He sparked a certain magic, Babbel advocate Jens Lehmann admitted, "when a new impetus comes in football, sometimes things happen that you wouldn't have thought possible."
And Sami Khedira, who advanced to the best player on the pitch after weeks of injury breaks thanks to his dynamics, tried to describe the established "phenomenon" with the proverbial "fresh wind" and the way the new boss works: "He is a man who grasps and demands discipline.
That’s what we need in the current situation.”
Under Babbel, it was obviously lacking.
VfB Stuttgart is not over the mountain yet, warns sports director Horst Heldt
But VfB Stuttgart needs consistency above all.
Like Gross, players and managers were wary of overestimating the victory against a weakened and completely overwhelmed defense of the Romanian guests.
They would also have won in Glasgow, before the evil awakening came in Leverkusen at 0:4 four days later, Khedira said.
And sports director Horst Heldt warned that although one season goal was achieved, the other was still far away.
We're not over the mountain yet.
That Heldt on his 40th birthday, even after his first home win in three months, was not a good thing to celebrate, was due to the events of the weekend, which were freshly revived in the form of a television interview broadcast just before the start of the game by goalkeeper Jens Lehmann.
There are decisions that others make and not Jens, Heldt countered Lehmann’s harsh criticism.
He had accused the board of directors of leadership weakness and decided to change coaches on the pressure of adolescence fans.
Also that his free day had been deleted after games, Lehmann valued as a sign of lack of sovereignty and disfavor.
Lehmann's statements were "characterized by pure selfishness", Heldt retorted, announcing consequences for the finalist.
They will no longer be friends for life, the two forty-year-olds.
After all, they agreed with everyone else that without the preliminary work done by the replaced coaching team the playful and combatively strong idea would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants had "a large share of the success", Heldt and Lehmann said unisono - and the man with the plastic bag also agreed.
WM-Fight in heavyweight
Hot duel in Bern: Again and again challenger Kevin Johnson provoked world champion Vitali Klitschko with words and gestures.
However, after twelve hard laps, the Ukrainian defended his heavyweight title according to the WBC version.
The verdict of the judges was unanimous.
Hamburg - Vitali Klitschko remains boxing world champion in heavyweights.
The 38-year-old champion according to the WBC version defeated American Kevin Johnson unanimously by points on Saturday night in Bern (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
For Klitschko, it was the third successful title defense after his comeback in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainian was twice World Champion of the WBO and WBC associations.
Unfortunately, it didn’t work out with the K.O. that everyone had expected.
Klitschko expanded his record to 39 victories in 41 professional fights, twice having to give himself defeated due to injuries.
Challenger Johnson had to accept the first defeat in the 24th fight.
In front of about 17,000 spectators in the Bernese Arena, the 2.02-meter Klitschko wanted to dictate the fight mainly with his left-handed leadership.
The eleven-centimeter-smaller Johnson, who had announced the end of the Klitschko era before the duel, however, repeatedly withdrew from the World Champion's blows, so Klitschko could not decisively bring his dangerous rights to the finish line.
Overall, the passive Johnson did too little for a challenger and only tried to get over the rounds.
Although he provoked Klitschko with words and gestures, his blows rarely hit the World Champion.
After all, he was only the second boxer after Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who went over the full distance of twelve laps with Klitschko.
The challenger had caused some swirls before the fight in the Swiss capital.
He insulted Klitschko as an "ugly zombie" who "can't do anything right".
During the weighing, the champion was then provoked on Friday to push Johnson's sunglasses off his nose "to be able to see his eyes."
Fourth victory after Klitschko's comeback
Klitschko also remained victorious in his fourth fight after his comeback on October 11, 2008.
After nearly four years off, he had beaten the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and recovered "his" WBC belt, which he had previously had to leave without a fight.
This year he beat Juan Carlos Gomez from Cuba and Chris Arreola from the United States.
I only got one blow in this fight and I am physically in very good shape, Klitschko had justified the quick return to the ring.
His dream, however, remains the union of all four important titles in the family.
Brother Vladimir is World Champion of the WBO and IBF associations.
However, the WBA belt is worn by the British David Haye, after he was able to dethrone the 2.13-metre-high Nikolai Walujev in November.
Haye had previously cancelled a fight against Vitali Klitschko scheduled for September.
It is reported that his promotional company is already planning to fight Klitschko in London's Wembley Stadium.
Fall Kunduz
Frontal attack from the opposition: Green group leader Jürgen Trittin has called Minister of Defense Guttenberg a liar because of false information about the Kunduz affair.
The SPD and the Left demand enlightenment from the Chancellor.
Hamburg/Berlin - According to the latest findings of the Kunduz airstrike, the opposition Defence Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) has subjected a deliberate deception.
The minister said the deadly bombing of two September tanker trains was "knowingly untrue," Jürgen Trittin, leader of the Green Group, told the ARD news channel "Tagesschau" on Saturday.
It’s called: He lied.
The order to kill was issued in violation of the rules of the International Protection Force for Afghanistan (ISAF).
That is the substance of the report that NATO had and that Mr Guttenberg has read, Trittin said.
On Friday, it was announced that the attack was not only about the destruction of the abducted trucks, but also about the targeted killing of two Taliban leaders.
The U.S. air strike requested by German Kunduz commander Oberst Klein had killed or injured up to 142 people, according to a NATO investigation report.
On Saturday, Greens, the SPD and the left called on Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to speak immediately before the Bundestag and also to clarify what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Merkel needs to clarify whether a strategy of targeted killing is part of the federal government’s Afghanistan policy – and whether the Chancellery, the Bundeswehr and the intelligence service have approved this new strategy, Jürgen Trittin and Greens colleague Renate Künast called for.
Government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm strongly rejected the criticism.
The Chancellor’s office has not influenced concrete interventions by the Bundeswehr in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, doubts were raised about the ministry’s presentation on the background of the dismissal of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert.
According to information from the SPIEGEL, the two Guttenberg have accurately and completely informed about the background of the tanker stop.
Officials said they denied the existence of NATO reports and denied sensitive details to the minister.
However, from the surroundings of the two top officials, they reported that they had even pointed to several reports from the Department of Defense, including a two-page document from the Commanding Colonel Klein and a Field Hunter Report.
Wichert is said to have asked in a letter for clarification of the facts, reports the "Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung".
He has not received an answer so far, it is said.
The ministry did not comment on the allegations on Saturday, pointing out that this will be clarified in the Bundestag's committee of inquiry, which intends to constitute itself on Wednesday.
Dream worlds
Some see images in a waking state and hear voices that others do not see or hear.
It’s not just mentally ill people and drug addicts who blur the boundaries between imagination and reality.
As long as it happens in sleep, everything is fine.
When we lie in our dark rooms with our eyes closed, we are allowed to devote ourselves unhindered to the wildest imaginations and imaginations.
However, those who experience dreamlike states, see and hear things that others do not see or hear, in the modern Western world, are usually considered insane or addicted to drugs, at least as strangers.
But such images and voices do not only arise in mentally ill people or in drug abuse.
The same neural processes that allow us to design houses, paint pictures or write novels sometimes blur the boundaries between dream, madness and reality.
Dreamy altered states of waking consciousness can occur in a variety of forms, at best we call them visions, at worst madness.
Although triggers and effects may differ, the visions of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiences of the New Age prophet Carlos Castaneda, shamanic states of abduction, psychoses and hallucinations can still be traced to similar processes.
Hallucinations or delusions arise when the balance of the neuronal messengers of the brain - especially dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin and acetylcholine - is slipped and the interaction of various parts of the brain is disturbed.
Complex hallucinations and delusional thoughts very often occur during a schizophrenic psychosis.
Gravity no longer has power over him.
The connection of madness and dream has occupied philosophers and physicians since antiquity.
In 1861, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, found a "great resemblance of insanity with dream states", for Sigmund Freud, the dream was even "a psychosis, with all sorts of senselessness".
It is autumn 2001 when Henning T. turns into a comic character.
His body is two-dimensional and quiet.
Gravity no longer has power over him, he floats on the ceiling of the room.
He feels a kick.
Behind him are winged devil shapes with blood-red, distorted fringes, fluffy teeth.
They chase him, kick him with heavy, flaming boots, throw him against the walls, he feels the pain all over his body.
Loud, vicious voices roar from walls and radio.
He can no longer bear them, the voices that insult and insult him.
Henning T. tears two cables from the stereo system, ties them to a loop and attaches them to a hook on the ceiling.
He climbs on a loudspeaker and puts the loop around his neck.
Jump.
The loop loosens.
This is supposed to be a lesson for you, the voices in the drumming choir shout, "Go to the clinic and let yourself be healed!"
Today Henning T. is 40 years old, he has experienced six acute psychoses, the last is 2 years ago, the first almost 20 years.
It was triggered by LSD.
His diagnosis is schizoaffective-paranoid psychosis, in addition, he is manic-depressive, he takes medications, against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness, he has been married for three years.
In psychosis, I experienced the worst fear and deepest despair, he says.
Deception is a cruel reality
About one percent of the population suffers from schizophrenia at least once in their lives, in psychiatric clinics it is treated as the second most common condition after depression.
In an acute schizophrenic psychosis, those affected can no longer distinguish between the inner and outer worlds, they fall into an overexcited state, which can lead to hallucinations, magnitude, relationship or persecution.
Particularly common is voice listening – voices that command, comment or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are also not uncommon.
The affected person can no longer separate the important from the unimportant, the brain can no longer filter out disturbing signals, the consciousness is flooded with impressions.
Like the dream, psychosis opens the doors to a flood of ideas and fantasies that come from deeper layers of consciousness.
Reality perception in psychosis is subject-centered, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, Physician of the Clinic for General Psychiatry at the University Hospital Heidelberg.
The schizophrenia is at the center of the event, everything has a meaning directed at it.
At the same time, he enters into a passive role, he is overwhelmed, like in the dream, by the events and cannot actively shape them.
Schizophrenics often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
A balance of reality is usually not possible for them, the deceptions are cruel reality, the awakening is excluded.
Having experienced a hallucination once in a lifetime
Unlike in the dream, Fuchs says, "but the sensory and spatial structure of reality, which is perceived in psychosis, remains fundamentally preserved."
The delusional thoughts and hallucinations are in reality, the alienation of the experience takes place in the real context.
Why exactly our brain beats capriols, researchers still pose puzzles.
Exceptional states can cause any person to lose their relationship with reality for a short time, says Fuchs.
But not everyone will develop a psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but twin studies have shown that the genes are not the determining factors alone.
Researchers believe that there is minimal brain damage in those affected.
We suspect that the neuronal maturation of the brain is disrupted at an early stage of development, due to a viral disease of the mother during pregnancy, for example, explains fox.
But there remains a mystery as to how the disruption of the neural system occurs, which in addition does not manifest itself at first over many years.
Environmental influences also play a role – stress or traumatic experiences can be triggers for a psychosis if the predisposition is present.
Also hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychoses as they interfere with the transmitter system.
When our brains are hot
The crazy thing is, psychotics suffer from their hallucinations and swallow expensive drugs to get rid of them, others spend money on drugs to get which, says Lübeck psychology professor Erich Kasten.
Whether cheating images are perceived as pleasant or unpleasant is often just a matter of point of view.
Kasten has been collecting reports of hallucinations and deceptions for ten years, last year he evaluated his findings in the book "The Unreal World in Our Heads".
While hallucinations are one of the typical side effects of psychoses, they are also one of many other diseases.
In addition to mental disorders such as borderline or depression, these often include diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer’s and brain trauma.
Surprisingly, under certain conditions, even the brain of healthy people hallucinates.
Hallucinations, according to Kasten, are composed of memory contents that are usually held back.
They occur when brain areas where sensory perceptions are processed are overactive or too little inhibited; when our brain is running hot or even when there is no stimulation.
Drugs can trigger this condition just as much as brain damage or a psychosis.
But also resentment, stress, love pain or other mental states of exception.
In recent studies, up to a third of respondents reported having experienced a hallucination at least once in their lives.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. is 16 years old, living in a small town in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and attending the high school there.
A pretty normal girl, actually.
If it weren't for the pictures and the voices.
During the break, it may happen that a lazy boy with long, dark hair will respond to it.
If it answers him, the classmates look at it surprised - no one else sees or hears this boy.
They think the shy girl is a sleepy daydreamer, but Sarah K. doesn’t dream, she knows that.
She is awake, she hears and sees this boy, just as she hears and sees the girl in the bench next to her.
She can even feel his presence, at least for a moment.
A pleasant feeling is that she likes the boy.
Am I crazy? she asks herself sometimes.
But she knows that this boy and the other scams are not real and disappear again.
At night, the effects are usually scary.
Often the scams are also a burden.
When she sits in the classroom, she can sometimes not follow the teaching material, because the teacher in her eyes and ears is just introducing a new fellow student, while he explains mathematical equations to everyone else, both audible and visible at the table.
At night, the effects are usually frightening.
When she waits for sleep in her dark room, which is far too rare and far too late, she often cannot tell whether she is awake or already dreaming, whether the pictures she sees are the cracks or the girl with the bleeding cuts on her arms and legs, in front of her open or closed eyes.
Leave me alone, she yells at the figures.
She doesn’t tell her parents or friends anything about what they think she’s crazy about.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is now 20 years old.
She passed high school last year and lives with her boyfriend.
A year ago, the hallucinations stopped.
Ever since she made contact with the psychologist box on the Internet, she knows exactly that she is not crazy.
Madness is also a work of art from despair
If someone is socially isolated or suffers from rice withdrawal, they are more likely to have hallucinations after a while, Kasten says.
I suspect the brain is then under-employed and takes care of its own entertainment.
Sarah K., an only child, was afraid of other children as a little girl, often playing alone.
Her hallucinations began when she learned at 13 that the man she calls Dad hasn’t been her bodily father since she can think.
Since visual and acoustic hallucinations involve the same brain regions that process real impressions and sounds, it is difficult for people like Sarah K. to distinguish between false images and reality. "Every experience," says Kasten, "haves its place in the brain, reality forms there.
Hallucinations are also images that the brain creates, which is why they seem so real.”
Even nighttime dream pictures value boxes as a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people are not fundamentally different from those of acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenics, mentally healthy people are able to recognize their scams as unreal.
Kasten therefore advises his patients to appreciate the hallucinations as a special ability.
Limit state between dream and hallucination
In our too much-conscious world, imaginary experiences are unfortunately mostly pathologised, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, Professor in Heidelberg and Chief Physician of the Clinic for Psychiatry and Psychotherapy at the Florence-Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a serious, painful disease, but it also carries positive, creative – madness is also a work of art out of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard has explored the so-called oneiroid form of experience, a special form of dream-changed wakefulness.
Oneiroids are highly complex, detailed quasi-dreams that the experiencer believes to be real and that he cannot distinguish from the waking state even afterwards.
The oneiroid state of consciousness arises in extreme situations related to trauma or illness, for example, in polyradiculitis patients who experience motor paralysis with full consciousness.
When a person is threatened by loss of self and world, such as persistent, complete inability to move, he replaces the life-threatening real situation with his own, imaginary world, which is decoupled from reality, says Schmidt-Degenhard.
A sort of boundary between dream and hallucination.
Since it is not possible to cope with a situation in reality, a world change is taking place, but the real situation is presented in the imagination.
An intense form of sense-foundation and sense-meaning in an intolerable situation, which allows us human beings to be able to shape ourselves, not to go into nothingness of loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in memory
Zurich art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen also describes his oneiroid experiences in his book "Change of Hearts" as a rescue of the soul.
He is 49 years old when his consciousness travels for days after a heart valve surgery followed by a heart transplant, while his body is condemned to motionlessness in the intensive care unit.
Claussen immerses himself in a self-made world, visits strange times and places: he experiences himself as a bedridden, old man, aboard a train sanatorium, a robot guards his health.
He lived in the early Middle Ages among nobles who made drugs from blood.
When a Greek man takes a motorcycle to his homeland, he surfs with his hospital bed in the snow of the Alps and meets a Korean mobster.
He goes completely on in the imagined event, everything is real, even later in memory.
For Claussen, these inner journeys are fundamentally different from any dream.
The dream is a different state, he describes his experience.
On the contrary, the memories of mental journeys are still very clear to me after years and in substantive details.
Clearer and more intense even than really experienced.
The intensity of this experience blows the horizon of our other life-world experiences, says psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Ultimately, oneiroids, psychoses, hallucinations and drug noise show how fragile our inner images of external reality are also in the wake.
Any change in the state of consciousness, the psychologist summarizes, "can lead to a deformation of what we call reality."
An experience that can also be enriching.
The snowstorm may come
Burda
Children should take over the publisher at the age of 27
The new editor-in-chief Kallen is an intermediate solution: In the long run, Hubert Burda wants to give his company into the hands of his two children, he told SPIEGEL.
The holding company will continue to own 100 percent of the family in the future.
Hamburg - Publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the long term in the hands of his children.
Both children inherit at the age of 27 and have the firm will to enter the company, the 69-year-old told SPIEGEL.
The details of this have been carefully arranged.
The question of whether they are also active in the company only arises afterwards.
The question is whether they are able to do so.
You can’t hire 7,500 employees if they aren’t sufficiently qualified.
This kills the children and the company too.
Burda had announced on Thursday that he would step down from the chairmanship from January, and appointed Paul-Bernhard Kallen as his successor.
The 52-year-old Kallen has been a member of the Board of Directors at Burda since 1999.
At first, he was in charge of technology.
Later, with the Treasury department came the responsibility for the company’s assets and after the departure of Jürgen Todenhöfer also those for direct marketing, abroad, printing and finance.
For the first time, no family member is at the top of the publishing house.
Burda's children are 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, who would be 42 years old today, died a few years ago.
The naming of Kallen also serves to "bridge 10, 15 years," Burda said.
The holding should continue to belong to 100 percent of the family in the future, Burda said.
Regarding the Schickedanz and Schaeffler cases, Burda commented that even family businesses are not safe from the downfall: "It always involved families who got infected by a capital addiction, who have completely speculated and thought that they could rise to the very big player.
That was never my strategy.
He had “never had world power dreams,” Burda said.
I don’t see myself as the political preceptor of this country as Springer was, and I don’t want to play in the World League with ‘Time’ either, these stores have become too big.
Perfect Beauty (film)
Everything you want in terms of beauty and well-being is now at your disposal.
At least that is what El Corte Inglés has done, which recently opened a shop with an area of more than 1000 m2 in the shopping center in Callao (Madrid), where everything is just about body care.
The wellness area, located on the eighth floor, includes other prestigious companies such as Hedonai, which provide laser hair removal; Spaxión, with rooms for relaxation and beauty treatments; the hairdressers Luis & Tachi, Marina d'Or with a gym or L'Occitane with their natural cosmetics.
But there is also a food department that stands out through its tea house with more than 130 different types of tea.
Enjoy a relaxing massage together with your partner while having a fantastic view of the capital, or rent for two hours the relaxation area to put your own "beauty party" with eight girlfriends and then relax in the whirlpool or with massages and a glass of champagne, these are just a few of the possibilities.
The total area is 250 m2, which is divided into 12 rooms for the latest facial and body treatments as well as for hydrotherapy.
For example, for cavitation in the fight against cellulite or with vibrating surfaces.
The gym also has this type of equipment, and there are also virtual trainers who take care of the clients’ training sessions and thus offer them a completely personal training.
You start a training session by entering a personal password on a touch screen opposite the devices.
After that, various videos will show you how to perform your training sessions correctly.
The head of the gym assures that 15 minutes (including warm-up and stretching exercises) are perfectly enough to train the body muscles.
And if you still want to pass by the hair salon after you’ve trained your body, the Luis & Tachi company has a room where treatments to regain the radiance, shine and health of your hair are offered in a personalized way.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to be the key words for this wellness area in the middle of the city, which is always open from 10.00 am to 22.00 pm 365 days a year.
The most varied décolletés
Christmas is getting closer and closer and that’s why it’s again a good opportunity to copy the star’s looks and bring their festive dresses into our wardrobe.
The shape of the neckline, which is very important for highlighting the silhouette, is one of the points that must be considered.
Here are some suggestions.
The singer Fergie has chosen an exaggerated and very complicated décolleté, which can only be avoided.
Endesa and Barcelona by electric car
Endesa, together with the city of Barcelona, has created the "LIVE office".
This is a project to develop and promote the electric car in the Catalan capital.
The "LIVE Office" (logistics for the introduction of the electric car) will define and coordinate the roadmap for the introduction of the electric car in the city and make arrangements regarding mobility through management, coordination, subsidizing, etc.
On the other hand, the MOVELE project is being developed to promote the electric car and is intended to summarize the opinions and actions of the sectors concerned.
This is an attempt to advance the means of transport of the future.
3 "Electric cities"
However, Barcelona is not the only city that will be involved in the introduction of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville are also participating in this project.
These are the three cities selected by the government in the MOVELE project to accelerate the introduction of the electric car.
Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Government of Catalonia (la Generalitat).
The aim of this Framework Treaty is to promote research and technological development in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These activities include, but are not limited to, activities related to energy and, in particular, to its performance.
However, it is by no means the only initiative Endesa is taking part in in terms of promoting the electric car.
The company participates in standardization groups across Europe and has a number of additional projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees "a horizon of calm" for the automotive sector
Prime Minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero predicts the Spanish automotive industry, which is the country’s largest exporter, “a horizon of calm”.
In the presentation of the 2009 Economic Report by the Prime Minister, Zapatero recalled once again the measures taken by the government to support the automotive sector during the year of government.
"Without the plan for the competitiveness of the automotive industry, we would have a panorama today of neglect and closure of some of our main production facilities," he said.
"Thanks to this plan and the willingness of the car manufacturers to continue to produce in Spain in a very competitive industry in the future, we can see a calm horizon for the future of this industry, which is our largest export sector," he added.
He also recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, which is part of the overall Plan for the Automotive Industry (PIA), has provided <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>800 million for projects by 19 vehicle manufacturers and 137 suppliers, which in turn provided investments of more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3 billion.
The head of government explained that these investments are intended both for the development of new models and for the modernization of existing products and processes.
Zapatero also underlined the government’s measures to boost demand, citing the 2000E plan, which will be implemented in cooperation with the Autonomous Communities and car manufacturers.
According to the head of government, this plan allows to reduce the emissions of new vehicles sold on the Spanish market by an average of 6%, which in turn led to a "strong increase" in registrations, which increased "by 40%" in November.
On 20,000 square meters of classic vehicles
The first edition of the International Classic Motor Show will be held in Madrid, an exhibition for professionals and lovers of the world of engines.

Skill tests with classic cars and motorcycles are also carried out on a specially equipped racetrack in the outdoor area of the exhibition grounds.
Mazda3 i-Stop: Environmentally friendly sportiness
Mazda wants to prove that sportiness is fully compatible with environmental protection.
For this reason, Mazda recently introduced the engine’s automatic stop and start system, named i-Stop, on the Mazda3 model, a device that is currently only available for the 2.0 gasoline engine with 150 hp.
This second generation of the Mazda 3 stands out for its good grades in the overall picture.
The finishing, the design of the vehicle, the comfort, its road behaviour, the mechanics, the i-Stop system ...
All these aspects are "very good" in the new Mazda3.
Starting with the front seats, you can find that the front seats offer excellent ergonomics and good hold.
The game of the steering wheel is also excellent.
Looking further at the unit, which consists of the dashboard and dashboard, it can be seen that Mazda is located on the same line as the Japanese trend towards a futuristic interior design with a variety of buttons and switches in the eye-catching colors red and blue.
This style reminds us in part of the style of the Honda Civic.
Therefore, it can be said without further ado that both the Mazda 3 and the Civic, both Japanese models, stand out from the sobriety of German cars, especially from the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to surpass.
The passenger compartment of these two Japanese compact cars offers more than ever the appropriate comfort to allow four adults to drive extremely comfortably.
To all this comes a spacious and clearly shaped trunk.
Until now, the stop and start system is only available for the 2-liter petrol engine with 150 hp and a 6-speed gearbox.
This engine is a real pleasure. It stands out for its subtlety, its quiet noise, its performance and its low consumption.
And all those who do not drive many kilometers a year should consider this gasoline-powered i-Stop because of its great gearbox comfort and low consumption, even if Mazda is primarily the diesel models that are the best-selling.
In terms of equipment, the so-called Sportive model selected for the test drive is a special feature, as it has a significantly larger number of elements from the series equipment.
The main features of the standard equipment are the Assistant for the change of lane (RVM), which eliminates the dead angle, but also the controls for traction and stability, the speed control, the light-sensitive interior mirror, the on-board computer with a large screen, the air conditioning system, the sensors and the sensors.
In addition, this version also includes, as if that were not enough equipment, the Premium package, which includes the following for an additional 1,500 euros: in addition to other elements, especially the learning Bixenon headlights and the sound system BOSE with CD-loader.
Failed
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compact cars in its class.
It is particularly outstanding in terms of the materials used, due to its driving behaviour and the variety of equipment.
In addition, those who do not travel many kilometers a year can also buy the i-Stop version, which is only available with a 2.0 gasoline engine with 150 hp.
The only negative thing about this model is its somewhat high price, which is between 21,770 euros for the luxury model and 23,270 euros for the test-driven model Sportive.
However, in return for this high price, the Mazda3 offers us every day the highest driving fun.
A premiere with a lot of glamour
L.A. rolls out the red carpet of sensuality for Penélope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
At the premiere of "Nine", the stars, dressed in models that look as elegant as sexy, shined more than ever. (Photos: Gtresonline).
Our "Pe", as elegant as ever, chose a dark "Lady" dress.
The Promises of FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, a device that allows you to only read your emails without a way to see certain attachments or surf the Internet.
It enjoyed its five minutes of fame when it chose Time magazine as one of the products of the year.
It is rather unlikely to see it on the street, but the idea in itself is of particular interest to young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek costs very little and has a very affordable flat rate, for example, only half the price of the flat rate of an iPhone.
After seeing success with it, the company has launched two new devices: one designed only for Twitter, the other with a lifetime free data service, unlike Peek, where you have to pay a six-fold higher price.
Fonpeek, presented yesterday at the Le Web event, is the European version of this invention and therefore its third version.
It has the same boundaries as its American counterpart, but has a surprise ready.
The monthly maintenance price for the phone, about 12 euros per month, includes roaming for all of Europe.
Those who travel the world with a smartphone already know what it means to have to give up all the data in order to be able to read his emails once you have crossed the national border or if you are desperately looking for a café with WIFI (or a way to connect with Fon).
The idea of roaming with flatrate is incredibly seductive and should have been possible for a long time.
It is true that some telephone providers already offer special contracts and prices for stays abroad, but in my experience you already need a doctorate in physics and a good glasses in order to be able to read all the small print.
The European Commission’s repeated criticism of affordable roaming tariffs across Europe has almost always gone unnoticed.
Outside of your own country, you are always afraid to read your emails and rightly so.
That a small device like FonPeek (although it’s still amazing that it has the name Fon even though it doesn’t have Wi-Fi) can offer this kind of rates means that phone providers have to slowly but surely rethink and start considering different ways to use their data network.
Kindle is another good example of this, its prices include downloading books and other requests on the Internet.
Without a hammer and without a hook.
This is an internet-enabled device and you pay for it only once, namely when buying, and not month by month.
And that’s exactly what I expect from FonPeek one day, a lifelong Internet purchase option like Peek already offers in the US.
Not because I want to buy it.
I read my emails on the phone, thank you.
But I expect this because I think it would be a more appropriate model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
The fetish color of Michelle
Yellow is undoubtedly the favorite color of the American First Lady.
Already when Barack Obama took office as President of the United States, she appeared in a dress and a coat of this color and chose the same color again to accompany him in his undoubtedly second most important moment in his life: the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama wore very similar models on both occasions: besides that it was almost the same color - a shiny green-yellow - the clothing consisted of three parts - dress, jacket and coat made of the same fabric, and in addition she wore something coarsely embroidered or a necklace.
It goes so far that at first glance it seemed that the First Lady of the United States wanted to follow the example of the Princess of Asturias and decided to wear the same dress on more than one occasion.
However, the two dresses differ greatly in the type of fabric from which they are made.
At her inauguration, she wore a lace dress and a patterned velvet dress in Oslo.
The accessories were also different: the first time green shoes with semi-high heels and the second time a relative model, but gold colors.
The hairstyle was also different every time: the hair was raised on this occasion as a wreath, the previous one she wore her hair open.
75% of working mothers have problems at work due to their motherhood
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially among younger women who want to have children.
This is the result of the study "Fertility and Women's Careers in Spain" carried out by CSIC in collaboration with the Institute for Women.
The survey of 9,737 women between the ages of 15 and 75 leaves no doubt about this: 75% of working women see their career opportunities in the labour market limited due to their motherhood.
The study reveals that there are big differences in the decision to start a family and the number of children, depending on whether the women work or not and if so, what kind of profession they perform.
Those of them who do no other work outside the home, only work half-days or do not have a fixed employment contract are more likely to become mothers and have more children.
In contrast, women with fixed employment, especially in the public sector, shift the founding of a family and motherhood and therefore have fewer children.
"Women in the 35-49 age group with a fixed employment will have their first child on average only 3.7 years after contracting, a number that increases to 4.1 years for women with a fixed employment who have taken longer to achieve this and who have contracted their first child much later.
Moreover, the type of work also has a major impact on motherhood, albeit less than the calendar in terms of the readiness to conceive," explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that must be taken into account in the age of the women at the time of marriage and the first child.
According to the survey, the higher the age at the time of marriage and the first child, the higher the level of education.
This difference could also be found in women of the same age.
For example, women in the group between the ages of 35 and 49, depending on whether they only graduated from primary school or higher education, became mothers for the first time with an average of 25.1 or 32.1 each.
In addition, there is a further difference between women, depending on their level of education.
While women with a major degree are already getting married before their first fixed employment and have their first child, women with a middle or high school graduation are doing the exact opposite, first looking for a fixed employment and then getting married and then having their first child, Delgado notes.
Diane Kruger is worth it.
L’Oréal Paris recently added a new name to its all-envied list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
From next year, the German actress will be the image of various products of the brand and also say the well-known advertising phrase "Because you are worth it".
The main actress from "Joyeux No<0xC3><0xAB>l", one of the most elegant actresses on an international level, will thus become another famous pendant like Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penélope Cruz.
Before her, the last to join this exclusive club were actresses Evangeline Lilly ("Lost") and Freida Pinto ("Slumdog Millionaire").
Among the men, the cosmetics company also has only exceptional ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey ("Grey's Anatomy") and Matthew Fox (played by Evangeline in "Lost").
The award ceremony for the British fashion industry
The British have an important word to say in the fashion world.
Her top representatives – fashion designers and models, both from yesterday and today – met at the annual awards ceremony held in London at the Royal Court of Justice.
On this occasion, they all appeared.
Former model Jerry Hall and her daughter Georgia May Jagger, who was voted the best model of the year.
The Poker Game by Manuel Vicent
Manuel Vicent presents in "Poker of the Aces" (Alfaguara, illustrations by Fernando Vicente) the thirty x-rays of writers who have accompanied him in his literary life (and, in some cases, also in real life).
In doing so, he does not use a predictable and fear-influencing genre (short biography, life and work), but rather seeks a delight in the glowing heart of the Creator.
The journey is exciting and Vicent spares neither horrors nor enlightenments.
Aside from the fact that this book is a delicious reading experience, it is also a moving invitation to read and read again and again.
Here are some excerpts from the book.
On Albert Camus: "In reading his pages, I discovered that the Mediterranean is not a sea, but rather a spiritual, almost sensual impulse, just as I have always felt without having found words for it: the joy in contrast to the unholy destiny, the morality without guilt and the innocence without any God".
About Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, allegorical Christian, he wrote about what he had in blood, not in his mind, between powerlessness and ignorance, with an overwhelming poetic humor, without any sense, like the knife-knife that almost killed him."
About Graham Greene: "Our man was attracted by this woman with a passion that lasted for thirteen years, in whose flesh emotions were united with the pleasure of repentance due to adultery, a spiritual privilege that consisted in coming to heaven on the detour of decay."
About James Joyce: "The Odyssey" was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. This is one of the 8,000 peaks in the world literature, you have to climb up the north wall, the wall on which the best mountaineers try again and again."
About William Faulkner: "It was a funny thing.
He sometimes said of himself that he would be the heir of a county estate owner, and on other occasions he said that he would be the son of a black and a crocodile.
“Both of them had a dream.”
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: This writer took up the insane scream that was shouted from a bridge by that person from Munich, so that his echo would echo deep into the night of the twentieth century in his literary way.
“One day she knelt down and prayed, ‘My dear God, I beg you to do everything in your power so that I can finally stop writing like a woman.’”
On Joseph Conrad: "On his grave are engraved these verses by Spencer: 'Sleep after effort,/ after the storm of the harbour,/ the tranquility after the war,/ after a rich life one finds pleasure in death."
Virginia Wolf: "She always had her depressions in her luggage.
The husband took it with complete normality when she told him that Edward VII was spying on her among the Azaleas or that the birds were singing in Greek.
No other case is known where the man was so patient and in love with a neurotic whose literary talent was much greater than her madness.
About Pío Baroja: "What else did Martín-Santos do but try to infuse Joyce into Baroja?
What, then, did Benet intend if he did not lead Baroja to the weapons of Faulkner?
What did Cela do, then, but to destroy that man's fame, so that he could stand on this platform himself?"
Feige Aggression
My 70-year-old mother walked through our neighborhood in the village of Fuenlabrada last week, when suddenly a group of young people between the ages of 15 and 18 came up next to her and our dog, our dog is a mixture that we picked up from the animal shelter and just weighs six kilos, and then walks him out of the sky.
Our resentment can not be put into words, because it is incomprehensible to us, because the fun is supposed to be in a cheap aggression against a small and helpless animal, which of course was carried out on the line.
In addition to this, there is the suffocation that a woman who went for a leisurely walk had when she wanted to correct these people because of the incident, she was even afraid for her own life, because if such a madman attacks a dog, he may also do the same with a woman, a child, an older master, or probably even with the same one.
The incident took place in a normally quiet neighborhood at five in the afternoon on a very ordinary Tuesday.
The dog has been crying all day.
Of course, we filed a complaint at a nearby police station, but we have great doubts about whether this will bring anything at all and to prevent any prejudice from the beginning, we just want to make it clear that the cowardly criminals were Spaniards.
Our outrage at what happened has led us to point out this incident.
We cannot understand what is going on in the minds of these young people, that they find a cheap attack on a helpless animal funny, on an animal that gives us love, company and friendship.
We do not know where good education and respect for animals and people have remained.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of the helmet
The tyre manufacturer Michelin, in collaboration with the Spanish Foundation for Road Safety (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to promote helmet use, especially among younger motorcyclists, as announced today by both companies.
This initiative aims to draw attention to the importance of helmet use, since this is ultimately the only protective element that can prevent head injuries or even death in the event of a motorcycle accident.
Michelin pointed out that this campaign is part of its commitment to road safety, which "encompasses much more than just the design and manufacture of products that are becoming more and more safe every day" and reaffirmed that it also contributes with other actions of educational and informative character to bring this goal closer each day.
This new campaign to promote helmet use on the motorcycle, which runs under the slogan 'To be or not to be', will distribute posters to over 500 motorcycle workshops in a first phase, in order to achieve the best possible distribution.
In conclusion, Michelin stressed that road safety is “a constant concern” of the company, and precisely for the reason that as a manufacturer of tyres for two-wheeled vehicles, they always see themselves committed to one of their main objectives being the development of ever safer products.
Sales of small trucks are rising again
After almost two years, the car market for small trucks is finally beginning to see some light at the end of the dark tunnel.
The 9,425 vehicles registered in Spain in November represent an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008, and, more importantly, they are the first ever increase after 22 consecutive months of steady decline, according to the figures presented by the Anfac and the Ganvam car dealerships.
However, these good figures are currently to be enjoyed only with great caution, since the reference data used for comparison are from November 2008, which was a particularly bad sales year with a decrease of 60% compared to the previous year.
However, it must be borne in mind that, apart from last month’s increase, the total admissions for these 11 months are still 40% below the sales figures of the previous fiscal year.
Since January, a total of 95,853 vehicles have been sold, but this number includes all the vehicles that make up the small truck market: descendants of passenger cars, pick-ups, small trucks, small vans and lighter small trucks / trailers.
Furthermore, the same clouds of thunderstorms in the sky are still the ones that most undermine demand, because even if some of the vehicles are purchased by private individuals, the bulk of sales go to small and medium-sized enterprises, which in almost 100% of all cases make the purchase with a third-party financing.
For example, these constraints, which are the result of the credit institutions’ reversed monetary policy, must include additional factors such as the increase in the unemployment rate or the persistence of the bad economic situation.
In this panorama, and unlike passenger cars, the financial support for the purchase of a 2000E vehicle has helped little.
However, this plan is not only for private individuals, even self-employed and small businesses have a right to it if they want to buy a small truck up to 3.5 tons with a CO2 emissions that cannot exceed 160 grams per mile driven, but the low sales figures speak for themselves.
Just yesterday, Ganvam had reminded us that it is absolutely necessary on the part of the state to pay special attention to these small trucks as well as, of course, to industrial vehicles (trucks and buses).
The car dealership association predicts for 2010 a similar year to the previous one, for which it expects a sales failure (in passenger cars and SUVs) of 19%.
Assistance in braking manoeuvres in critical situations is now a duty
As was the case with the ABS anti-lock braking system at the time, and as is the case with the ESP stability control system at the moment, the braking assistance systems in emergency situations must become a mandatory equipment in European cars.
In fact, they are already mandatory for all newly licensed passenger cars and light trucks, for the rest of the vehicles a waiting period was set until the end of February 2011.
The measure adopted by the European Union aims to improve the protection of pedestrians, but due to its operation, these braking systems can also help to prevent many collisions.
The task of the emergency braking assistant is to exert more pressure on the brakes in the event of a critical braking maneuver, which the system detects on the brake pedal based on the braking force executed by the driver.
However, this system does not exert this pressure until the end.
According to an investigation commissioned by the component manufacturer for the Bosch vehicles, one-third of the drivers involved in an accident before the collision were no longer able to step on the brake pedal and half of them had not braked with full force.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The braking aid, on the other hand, engages the braking system with maximum force and thereby reduces the braking time and thus also the braking distance that a car travels during the braking process.
According to an EU study, every year up to 1,100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians could be prevented if all cars were equipped with this type of emergency braking assistants.
There would be even fewer accidents - one in four accidents with personal injury could be prevented - as soon as the so-called intelligent emergency braking systems become popular.
The vehicle is then equipped with a system that detects obstacles (via radar or a camera) and warns the driver, while already exerting a slight pressure on the brakes.
When the driver reacts, the system helps to increase the pressure on the brake pedal if necessary.
If the driver does not respond to the warning and even if the collision is already unavoidable, the brake assistant applies maximum pressure to the brakes in order to keep the damage as low as possible.
General Motors postpones plan for Opel to January
While the staff of the Opel plant in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) have already been informed by Nick Reilly, the new chairman of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva will start in the first week of April, probably on the 8th, according to Javier Ortega, the American car manufacturer points out that he needs more time to complete the plan to reopen the car.
Nick Reilly, the new chairman of GM Europe, wants to ensure that the affected party gives its consent in advance on every single point of the plan.
And for this reason, it may be that the final document, which will be presented first to the workers and then to the governments of the countries where there are works, will be moved to the beginning of 2010.
On the other hand, GM is assured that it will make a decision regarding the sale of Saab in the coming days.
It is not surprising that the Swedish government has increased the pressure on the American automaker to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to being in touch with some potential new buyers.
One of these buyers could be Geely, who would also like to buy Volvo, but the option of the Dutch manufacturer of the Skyper sports cars, which has back cover from the Russian group Converg, is gaining more and more popularity.
If there is no agreement with any of these buyers, GM could sell some assets to the Chinese BAIC.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year, if it has not been sold by then, will continue to be maintained.
At the wheel of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
For the development of their newest and very expensive jewel, the engineers used the Boxster S as the basis and really managed to make it 80 kilos lighter, which now only adds 1,275 kilos.
In order to do this, they first renounced the automatic folding roof of the Lit-F, which was replaced by a tent canvas roof with manual drive, so that you saved 21 kilos; thanks to the aluminum doors used in this model, 54 "disappear" in the GT3 another 15; because of the removal of the air conditioning system, you still have to remove the 7Si.
Then the CDR-30 audio system again reduced the weight by six kilograms and the replacement of the door handles by fabric handles reached the missing kilogram.
Although it is also available with the PDK dual-clutch transmission, the test drive was carried out with a vehicle with 6-speed manual transmissions, mainly on California’s smaller country roads, on mountain tracks that were really very curved.
With his driving behavior, you can only give him the impeccable note.
However, the reduction in his weight has not led him to not be so safe on the road anymore.
Rather, the opposite is true: for a long time we have not tested such a small and light model, which at the same time also gives you a feeling of great safety in the curves, even at high speed.
He is a small athlete, capable of warming his muscles at a low gear in the time necessary until we give him the orders to race, brake, recover and then again to get everything out of his engine again ...
The car does everything we suggest with our hands on the steering wheel, thanks to its steering that is as communicative as it is precise.
And he does it with the precision of a surgeon.
A motor sound for all tastes
The sound of his V6 boxer with 320 hp (10 more than the Boxster S) is pronouncedly successful and you can even increase it with the 'sport' option, as well as using a system that can change the engine noise, which was already used for the first time in the Panamera.
The ability to accelerate is unimaginably brutal, whether standing out or accelerating again.
The suspensions are strong, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt on the roads we drove on with the Boxster Spyder was already quite damaged, but the car mastered the impact holes well.
The electronic assistants had almost nothing at all to do on the entire route; even though we found ice in the morning and rollsplitt in the morning at some of these curves.
To sum up, it’s an ultra-light car, a car with an indescribable driving experience, as it might otherwise be rather rare, and there’s much more to it than just a small improvement to the Boxster Ss.
The car will be launched in February 2010 and will cost 70,831 EURO.
Bag Girl
The singer, a busty friend of Karl Lagerfeld, is the face of the cosmetics line Coco Cocoon and an occasional star at the fashion shows of 'Maison', she presents her evil face with the same stiff neck as her Chanel bags.
Much more than "Bad Girl" or "It Girl", she is a "Bag Girl".
The Baskonia gives itself a victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral, despite the many outstanding players in the team of Dusko Ivanovic, celebrated an outstanding triumph with 82-91 on his visit to the complicated football field of the Maccabi Electra and thus comes to the first place within his group after the great appearance of Mirza Teletovic, who was with eight of his team's best score (29).
The Vitoria team was able to replace the significant failures of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with a large dose of dedication and teamwork, even though they had to wait until the bitter end for their victory.
The great hits from the perimeter with 16 triples rated contributed significantly to their final victory.
The game began with the leadership of the Blues, who from the beginning sat at the top of the billboard.
Since the first four baskets of the team from Vitoria were already coming out of the perimeter, it could already be guessed that they had come to the field with well-heated wrists.
English and Teletovic were mainly responsible for the 18-20 at the end of the first quarter.
The second quarter was hardly different, except that the team from <0xC3><0x81>lava opted for an inside game of Barac and for the game of Eliyahu, who was received on his return to the team with pipes and applause, which is his home, to further expand their advantage until the break (34-43).
Teletovic already started to stand out as the best of his team with 13 points, even though the "minus six" rating of splitters already felt that this would not be the best evening of the Brazilian.
Nevertheless, despite the clear advantage in the break, the game was not decided for a long time and the Maccabees wanted to remind the Victorians once again that not everyone wins on their playing field, and thanks to the repeatedly attacking "hand of Elias" they came back into the game.
Eidson and Pnini contributed decisively to the "yellow" turning the rudder (50-49).
Even more disadvantages
Ivanovic's team, injured, but all but dead, had to prepare a few moves with accuracy to get air back and at one of them suddenly came the gun of Mirza Teletovic, who with three almost consecutive triples and with the support of English and Ribas made sure that on the end of the scoreboard was shown a 54-pointer with the end of the scoreboard again.
The Alavesians were bluffed in the last quarter and English and San Emeterio (60-75) already announced that they would not allow anyone to take away from them the victory they honestly earned in the first thirty minutes.
Nonetheless, Pnini and Eidson, the best of their team, did not resign and tried to give their team back three points off the line (70-77).
Despite this, and although splitters were put off from the pitch due to fouls, Ivanovic's team did not give up, defended well and although the Israelis still picked up at the last minute (80-85), the game already had a winner and Tel Aviv lost for the first time this season.
Injuries prevented Unicaja from being offered the forehead
Unicaja lost loudly in Greece to Olympiacos and had to give the lead in Group B of the Euroleague to him, and this was in a game characterized by the failures of the players of Unicajas (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), especially in the domestic game, which made it easier for the Greeks to win.
The team from Málaga was neither afraid of the mood in the Hall of Peace and Friendship nor of the opposing team, which is perhaps one of the strongest in Europe and has a lot of money.
Thanks to their match in the first quarter, the Andalusians were able to start dreaming. An aggressive defense and three consecutive triples, two of them by Omar Cook and one by Guillem Rubio, blinded the hosts with 12-18 in the 9th minute.
Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of the single Unicaja, although the local team with an indoor game between Bourousis, Vujcic and Shortsanitis managed to get the billboard in the 13th minute 22-20 in their favour, the minute in which it would have been disqualified due to an action almost to fighting between the two Williams and the Americans.
The Greek team finally began to warm up and its superiority on both halves of the game, while the departure of Englishman Joel Freeland due to an injury and the three mistakes himself caused by Carlos Jiménez left clear marks at Unicaja.
Among their in-field players and Lithuanian forward Linas Kleizas, with his triples, they increased their advantage in the 19th minute to 44-32.
A chase up was impossible.
The third quarter was characterized by many attacks against the team of Olympiacos, which proved superior despite his 19 losses and even managed to compensate the difference of the game played in Málaga with 66-48 in the 27th minute, which in turn caused the leadership within the group to fluctuate.
Unicaja tried to get away from the many failures and the departure of Scotsman Robert Archibald, who was injured during the game.
Despite the many drawbacks for the Unicaja, in the 31st minute thanks to the lead and the triple of Cook and the use of Lewis came back some hope at 66-57.
Nevertheless, it was actually impossible, as the Olympiacos, as soon as he attacked and showed his superiority with centimeters within the basket range, was not to be braked.
Croatian captain Nikola Vujcic managed to raise the basket difference to 81-62 in the 37th minute and Unicaja had to give up the lead to Olympiacos.
How much should you earn based on your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can now get the salary they should earn based on their profile thanks to the new application Trovit, the search engine with the most ads of real estate, jobs and cars in Spain.
The "How Much Should You Earn?" tool calculates users' salaries based on the more than 140,000 job offers available at Trovit in Spain. Users have a Facebook form to enter their career, work experience, age and the city in which they work.
Already a week after the application was available for the first time, the search engine found that the Spanish worker on average "feels badly paid," says Albert Ribera, the head of Trovit's product.
The Spaniards are the least paid according to the data Trovit has through its search engines in the UK and France.
A British programmer receives an annual gross salary of 45,226 euros and a Frenchman 31,059, in contrast to the 24,000 euros earned by a Spaniard.
As a result, a truck driver has a net annual salary of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>34,247 in England, <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>25,751 in France and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>16,420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the least paid job in Spain is that of a waiter with 11,592 euros net annually; followed by the work of a seller with 14,725 euros and that of a worker with 15,667 euros.
The most sought-after jobs on the Internet in the last three months are those of a driver, part-time jobs and social workers.
Brazil calls Zelaya a date to leave
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelaya’s stay at his embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The President removed from office must leave the diplomatic mission no later than 27 January 2010 when his mandate officially expires.
Francisco Catunda, the trade delegate of the Brazilian embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knew that before that date he must have left the embassy in which he had found asylum since September 21.
"He is aware that he has to leave on January 27, as his term expires on that day and he has to find a new accommodation."
The broadcaster also quoted the former president, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the scheduled date: "My position is to leave as soon as possible, logically with the backing of the government of Brazil," Zelaya said on the phone.
After the November 29 elections (in which Porfirio Lobo emerged as the winner), Zelaya assured that he would remain in the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, this week he tried to take refuge in Brazil.
This failed, however, in Zelaya’s refusal to recognize the status of an asylum-seeking politician that the “de facto” government, chaired by Roberto Micheletti, wanted to impose on him.
Thank you very much!
After the most tempting days since last spring, when asset inflation was the prevailing mood in the markets, the markets have returned to uncertainty, which is by no means surprising, as this is their natural state, in an environment in which the brokers make decisions from a natural perspective.
The measure used to stabilise the markets was to settle the debts with the direct purchase of assets and to leave liquidity indirectly at zero interest rates, so that the banks could buy assets for settlement.
The central banks have already confirmed that the direct purchases of assets are almost finished and, without questioning their heterodox liquidity policy, are starting to spill some sand into the gear, as the ECB has already predicted with its annual auction next week.
Therefore, investors are questioning the ability of the global economy to sustain economic recovery without these heterodox measures, and we are just witnessing a reversal in the reduction of risk premiums.
The volatility of the stock exchanges and the differences in corporate bonuses are rising again, even though they are still far from the paranormal amounts they reached at the beginning of the year.
States were forced to nationalize private risks and sovereign debts were rising again.
The US, Japan and Germany are the preferred place of refuge for investors, which in turn leads to an increase in the differences between the countries of the eurozone in relation to Germany.
Spain had so far been hardly affected by this episode of instability, but then Standard & Poor's came and threatened with a new revision downwards regarding Spain's rating.
On the other hand, a certain uncertainty should not harm new ones, in order to silence the defenders of the moral risk, who had once again tried to create among the world economic policy makers an awareness of what they had caused, since they had dissipated the devastating effects to which the restriction of credit led them to work.
Nonetheless, what happened in Dubai indicates a tribal war between the emirates to restore power in the emirates, and the development in Greece was predicted earlier.
A government that silences the public debt, elections and a new government that pulls in the same strand.
Prodi made it in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It makes no sense for Ecofin to save Hungary from defaulting on its foreign payments at the beginning of the year and thus allow a euro member country to no longer comply with its obligations.
On the other hand, it is logical that Ecofin has forced the Greek government to be transparent and to take its citizens into account the need for extraordinary measures in order to maintain the stability of state funds.
Yes, as expected, we are facing an episode of risk premium normalization, after some dilapidation to too high amounts, this would now be within what is expected.
In the case of Spain, there is no need to worry as long as the differences in government debt increase at the same rate as European corporate bonuses.
However, if the European disparities were to decrease and the Spanish continued to increase, this would be a special Spanish risk.
Standard & Poor's is a farce. While the locally preferred indicators force a large part of market research institutes to prefer their scenarios for recovery and to correct their scenario for 2011 upwards, including the OECD and the European Commission, which have long failed to come up with a Japanese scenario for the spa.
Again, it seems to be an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish shares, although at the moment "caution when driving" is in demand.
Connected Branches
The chairman of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to appear before the subcommittee of Parliament yesterday, where the strategy on Spain’s energy supply for the next two decades will be debated in these days.
After his appearance, which was followed by the chairman of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Galán gave the press some hints about what he had submitted to the subcommittee behind closed doors.
According to the chairman of Iberdrola, Spain must invest <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>50 billion by 2020 and another <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>60 billion by 2030, provided that the current nuclear power plants remain in operation.
If this were not the case, the required investments would not amount to 60 billion, but to 95 billion.
However, Iberdrola believes that we should no longer invest in increasing energy production capacity, but in distribution networks and international alliances.
From 2020 onwards, the issue will change and performance should be increased.
His proposal focuses on both gas and coal plants with facilities for capturing carbon dioxide and, of course, above all, on renewable energies.
In this case, it assumes that 18,000 MW more will be needed, under the assumption of course by other "support energies".
Galán, who believes that the bill for a sustainable economy, which has just been passed by the government, is in line with what his company has demanded, in no way wanted to say anything against this law, such as to create incentives for national coal use, which would be the exact opposite of all political strategies in the fight against climate change.
In his opinion, "one is clearly moving in this direction in the long term, despite some "single" measures, as the chairman of Iberdrola called it.
Whatever the case, Galán believes that investment decisions should be made right now, even if they are long-term, as it will take some time and a stable remuneration framework must be created to tackle them.
Ferrovial gets the "handling" of Aer Lingus at ten airports
Ferrovial’s subsidiary for ground-based airport services, Swissport, is the preferred partner of Irish flow company Aer Lingus for baggage services at ten European airports where they are represented.
Paris, London, Frankfurt and Brussels are some of the most important.
The agreement, for which no figures have been announced so far, is for a period of five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Government of Castile-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed a protocol on cooperation to create an innovation center for intelligent infrastructures.
The alliance plans to invest $20 million by 2012, 50% of which will come from Ferrovial.
One of the Centre's tasks will be to investigate energy efficiency on highways and airports.
Acciona competes with high-depth and Bouygues for its first highway construction in Australia
Acciona is fighting for the approval of its first highway in Australia, a market where it is already represented as an energy and water company.
The construction in question is a tunnel that will cost 1.7 billion Australian dollars (approximately 1.047 billion euros).
The French company Bouygues and the German Hochtief are its competitors.
A 5 km long tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the east coast, has become the best opportunity for Acciona to establish itself in the country as a construction company and motorway operator.
The city administration wants to complete the construction at the end of 2014.
After the PPP (Public-Private Cooperation) administration decided to move the project forward according to a business plan set up by Ernst & Young, the administration is already in possession of a final list of candidates for construction and toll office management.
In anticipation of the offers presented in May, the estimated investments amount to 1.7 billion Australian dollars (1.047 billion euros), with three consortia, consisting mainly of European construction companies, competing with each other in the last phase.
The Transcity Group is headed by Acciona, the only Spanish company, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first company is one of the largest construction companies in Australia, while the second, based in Italy, is one of the best specialists in deep construction.
The Northern Direct consortium, formed from the British company Laing O’Rourke, the Australian Transfield, which is responsible for the infrastructure, and the French Bouygues group, will compete against the Acciona team.
The third and last consortium, which is in the narrower choice, is called LBRJV, formed from the capital of the Australian Leighton (subsidiary of the German construction company Hochtief, which in turn belongs to ACS), the also native Baulderstone (owned by the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the French company speziele on Razel.
Australia’s infrastructure market promises huge construction and privatizations, but it has a hurdle to overcome, as only by buying a local construction company can you get access.
A strategy that has been followed by the above-mentioned companies Hochtief or Bilfinger, in addition to Asian references, and which has yet to be pursued by the Spanish construction giants.
Even ACS has gained access to this market only through its 30% stake in Leighton, the owner of Leighton.
Millions of assets
Acciona is committed to this geographical area of utmost importance for the industry, where it is already well known for its activity as an energy supplier and in the desalination industry.
Among other assets, it already has its largest wind farm (192 MW) in Victoria and leads the group of companies commissioned to build and manage Adelaide’s desalination plant with a budget of 700 million.
His intention is now to consolidate in these two areas and to use these synergies to gain access to the branches of construction and infrastructure.
The subterranean toll route, funded by the City of Brisbane's Infrastructure Office and named Northern Link (North toll road), is intended to connect the western highway in Toowong with the bypass road in Kelvin Grove (see map) on a length of 5 kilometers by way of tunnels to Ma<0xC3><0xAB>sbane to trade with each other.
The schedule issued by the city administration foresees the award for summer 2010 and the start of construction works in December next year.
Even if this toll route is already to be opened for traffic in the last months of 2014, it is expected that the construction work will continue until 2016.
The tunnel was designed in 2005.
It has two lanes in each direction, an electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The Queensland government is contributing 500 million Australian dollars (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>308 million) to the funding.
For the lows, Brisbane is already a big deal.
Australia is repeatedly placing significant orders at a high level, which yesterday signed a contract with the government of 154 million.
The subsidiary ACS, through its domestic subsidiary Leighton, will improve the infrastructure of the domestic broadband network with fiber optic cables.
This improvement will provide fast internet access for 400,000 people and will keep the German company in business for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has received the construction project of the King George Tower with 27 floors in the Australian city of Brisbane.
Also in the United Kingdom, in Manchester, it competes with Laing O'Rourke for the construction and management of two schools for 25 years.
Initial investments amount to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>75 million.
FCC receives order for a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
FCC, through its subsidiary Alpine, has secured the construction of a 2.1-kilometre-long tunnel for a highway in Slovenia worth more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>64.5 million.
The company received this contract only a few days after receiving the contract for the construction work to expand the Bosruck Tunnel (Austria) over 130 million.
In this way, Alpine reinforces its experience in tunneling.
Construction is scheduled to begin in early 2010 and will take 32 months to complete.
Mrs. Rushmore receives advertising from Renfe
Renfe has attributed the advertising and marketing services for the next two years to the agency Mrs. Rushmore over a sum of about three million euros annually, the railway company said.
Ms Rushmore was selected from among 16 agencies presenting the competition, 4 of which were finalists, including TBWA, which was responsible for advertising for the last three years.
From now on, Mrs. Rushmore will be responsible for the design and production of the campaigns.
France Télécom has been fined over $63 million for slowing down competition.
The French competition authority has imposed a fine of more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>63 million on France Télécom for anticompetitive conduct in the Caribbean territories belonging to the country.
According to the Authority, the telephone provider has restricted competition on landlines and mobile phones by signing exclusive contracts, pricing plans and loyalty programs for consumers on the edge of regulation.
Together with this sanction, the former French monopoly and still state-owned company has accumulated more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>560 million in fines since 1994 on disability of its competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday was even increased, as the competition authority believes that France Télécom has committed similar infringements in the past and has therefore become repayable again.
Application trading
On the other hand, the subsidiary of the French company has followed the example of other telephone providers and has opened an application trading page on the Internet for the purpose of increasing revenues from businesses that do not originate from the telephone connection.
Basically, this Orange website is active in France and the United Kingdom.
You have to wait until 2010 until these pages are also available in other countries, such as Spain.
The game in the Champions League has brought Madrid and Barça 476.4 million since the beginning.
Since its inception in 1992, the Champions League has developed into a source of revenue for football clubs.
So much so that Real Madrid and Barcelona have since made 476.4 million, giving them the third and fifth place of the football clubs that have earned the most money in the league.
The leader of this list is Manchester United.
The leader of this list is Manchester United.
Winning the UEFA Champions League not only brings fame, it is also one of the main sources of revenue for the big clubs.
According to UEFA, the league has distributed up to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>5,362.5 million to the 105 teams (including 12 Spanish teams) who have participated in this event since its establishment in the 1992/1993 season.
Real Madrid and FC Barcelona have benefited from this distribution.
The club ranks third in Europe, earning the most money from its participation, and the only one to win the trophy three times alongside AC Milan.
The current Catalan champion and last winner of the former 1992 European Cup occupies fifth place.
The list leads Manchester United and Bayern Munich, two teams that also made the most money from their participation in the previous Champoins League.
Even though they lost to Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only third of the countries that were able to collect money through the champions, although it has more titles than any other (five, unlike four bee Italy, three in England and two in Germany).
Distributions
This obvious contradiction is explained by the complicated funding procedure applied by UEFA.
This fiscal year, the organization, chaired by Michel Platini, expects revenues of 1,090 million from the Champions League.
Of this money, UEFA provides 413.1 million for fixed payments: each of the 20 football clubs that participated in the qualifying round (including Atlético de Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who competed received 3.8 million through their blobe attendance, in addition to the 550,000 euros for each game they contested.
There is also a bonus for winning (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>800,000) and for a draw (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>400,000 per team). The clubs that have come to the eighth final each receive three million; the four that have come to the quarterfinals, 3.3 million.
The last four will each receive $4 million.
The winner earns $9 million, unlike the second, who receives $5.2 million.
For example, a football club receives at least 7.1 million and at most 31.2 million in fixed income.
Barça, in turn, earned 2.5 million with his victory in the European Super Cup in August.
However, there are also variable payments, for which 337.8 million are foreseen.
This money is allocated in proportion to the value of each individual television market.
The Spanish is one of the first and has 4 seats allocated.
The last year’s champion receives 40% of the money awarded, 30% of the second, 20% of the third and 10% for fourth place.
The other part will be distributed depending on the number of games they play at this year’s edition.
Nueva Rumasa offers 61 million for 29.9% stake in Sos
The Nueva Rumasa Group yesterday leaked details of the offer to buy shares, with which it intends to acquire a cap between 25 and 29.9% of the capital of Sos.
A percentage that, due to the number of shares, does not force them to make a public tender (opa).
Concretely, Nueva Rumasa offers 1.5025 euros per share, which are paid out over ten years and at an interest rate of 1% annually due to this shift.
Yesterday, the Sos shares closed at <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.85, which is why Nueva Rumasa rated the company 18% below the market value.
According to Nuevan Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the real rating of Sos.
The offer is associated with the appointment of eight of the 15 consultants.
The Jeréz Group gives shareholders a 15-day deadline to communicate their interest in the sale of their shares.
CNMV assured that it was not informed of this offer, although the company Ruiz Mateos confirmed that it had contacted the authority.
At a close, the deposit would amount to 611.7 million, while the value of Sos is 254.27 million.
Meanwhile, Sos continues to restructure its management.
In an attempt to stay on the edge of possible purchase offers and the judicial queries of his former managers, the brothers Jesus and Jaime Salazar announced the appointment of María Luisa Jordá as head of internal audit.
A decision that will make her the first woman to hold a high position at the food company.
This is a newly created position, which is directly under the chairman of the group.
This is all but free of controversy because the company is engaged in a legal battle over the suspicion of diversion of more than 230 million Sos to other companies of the Salazar family.
It cannot be ruled out that Sos will shift further capital over the next few months.
With regard to Salazar’s loan, yesterday the former advisers Ildefonso Ortega and <0xC3><0x81>ngel Fernández Noriega (representatives of the CCM and Unicaja) appeared before the National Assembly and confirmed that they had approved the displacement of 212 million without knowing their destination.
CNMV approves Paternina’s tender submitted by investment company Mer
The National Stock Exchange Commission (CNMV) approved the open tender for Federico Paternina submitted by the investment company Mer on 9 October.
The supervisory authority stated that it approved this call after it had been proven that the conditions comply with the applicable laws and thus the contents of the explanatory leaflet submitted, as amended on December 2, can be considered "sufficient".
CNMV has also announced that this offer is aimed at acquiring 550.008 shares of Federico Paternina at a price of EUR 7.65 per share, which in turn is 8.95% of the share capital, which consists of EUR 6.142.786 in shares approved on the Madrid and Bilbao stock exchanges.
In addition, it was also announced that 5,592,778 million shares have been fixed, which cannot be transferred in any way until the conclusion of the tender, and the price of which was determined by Federico Paternina in accordance with the laws in force.
New programmes for the assessment of vehicles
In these days of storms and accidents, not only the car workshops earn
Every day, thousands of vehicles involved in an accident are towed to the workshops, where an expert has to assess the damage and the cost of repair.
No single accident is the same and calculating the cost of parts and working hours can be a lengthy and complicated task.
The calculation of the repair costs of between 20,000 and 30,000 euros per hand, including the parts and working hours, can take up to two or three hours.
On the other hand, with the support of the latest computer tools, it is a matter of minutes
That’s why nearly 100% of reviewers use these types of systems.
The service and application providers for accident assessment and repair collect the information they receive from the manufacturers to process it thereafter and offer it to their customers in the form of a useful program.
In Spain, Audatex, part of the American group Solera, is the market leader; 80% of all reviews are made with their products.
The other two companies competing in the tool market for reviewing and drafting a report are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data that the manufacturers provide is anything but simple.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, Sales Manager of Audatex, 63 manufacturers and importers are cooperating, each of them providing the information in a different format.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed is becoming ever larger, to the point that in the last five years more versions, variants and motorizations have come to the market than in the entire fifteen years before.
As soon as a new car comes on the market, work begins for the companies.
It is an arduous task, because each of the over a thousand vehicle parts must be cataloged and its price entered.
In addition, each model creates an "intelligent" graphic image, on which you can "click" different parts of the vehicle.
If this is a highly sold model, the work can be completed in a week if the procedure proceeds quickly.
If it is a less common car, it can take up to three or four months. Currently, Audatex has full information for 99.2% of cars sold in Spain.
Among the more exclusive models, for example, they have information about the Porsche models, but not about Ferrari or Lamborghini.
In terms of the fleet of vehicles driving on the roads, it is over 99%.
Audatex has eight centres worldwide (Spain, France, Germany, USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan) that specialize in specific brands for the purpose of documenting and producing databases.
The national headquarters is located in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There more than a hundred technicians (usually mechanics) work simultaneously with three computer screens.
Audatex invests <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>90 million annually in the development of these databases.
Every month, they record 2.5 million data and their customers receive updates every other day.
The development of this huge flow of information allows companies to use it in different ways and thus offer different products.
The most common use is the use for repairs and repairs, but depending on the country, there are also tools for managing scrap parts or for calculating the error or residual value of a car.
The only company that informs about a guide about the value of used cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not offer this offer in Spain, but in the United States.
When reviewing the products Audatex offers, you can easily get an overview of the type of support it provides to industry experts.
This company offers ten different tools, with the star of the products being AudaPlus, a standard solution for the assessment of accidents for the reviewers.
It includes vehicles, motorcycles as well as light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it includes the estimated repair times or the paint prices of the manufacturer.
This tool is paid depending on the purpose of use, i.e. for each opinion.
The most expensive will be for customers who rarely use it, a maximum of ten times a month, namely 5.75 euros per month.
On the other hand, every insurance company that produces thousands of reviews negotiates the price with Audatex.
With other products, such as AudaVIN, a vehicle and the equipment with which it ran from the mounting tape can be fully identified only by the chassis number.
AudaGlass deals with vehicle discs, and AudaSubastas is an online service open to the specialist market that can be offered for vehicles that have been declared total damage.
Your statistical service is very useful in identifying trends, conducting geodemographic analyses or for the purpose of obtaining information about the variations by brand and model.
For example, you can examine how many models of a particular car brand had to go to the garage due to breakdowns or how many of them were involved in a serious accident in a certain period of time.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of computer tools.
Among other things, it distributes Gt Estimate, which is also intended for reviewers and in the same way provides digital images, access to parts or prices and official working hours of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa Group, founded in 1971 as a provider of services and solutions for the assessment of damage, breakdown or maintenance of vehicles.
The GT Guide for Expertise is a reference product on the market.
They work with 24,000 users in workshops, 3,100 assessors and 53 insurance companies.
Its business volume has increased by 20% annually in the last three years and in 2008 its turnover amounted to 10.8 million euros.
At the beginning of last year, they also started to go on the international market with the opening of an office in Paris.
Audatex was founded in Germany in 1966 and established in Spain in 1979.
According to the company’s sources, 62% of its business is in Europe and the rest of the world, and the remaining 38% in North and South America. They work with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 workshops, 3,000 of them in Spain.
Total worldwide sales of the Solera Group (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) amount to $557 million, 3.35 more than in 2008.
In this country, the company has revenues of 19.1 million euros, 7.2% more than in the previous year.
In 2005, the Solera Group was worth $1 billion on the stock exchange and today its shares are traded at a value of $2.4 billion.
Since 2007, they have been on the New York Stock Exchange and part of the Standard & Poor's benchmark index.
Auction of accident cars on the Internet
Last October, the Solera Autoonline Group purchased a plate fom on the Internet for the sale of accident vehicles and motorcycles.
This purchase meant the payment of 59.5 million euros for 85% of the company’s capital, which could increase to the remaining 15% next year.
The purpose of this purchase was to offer its customers more services and added value, with the opportunity to gain access to a huge international market.
This assessment and purchase service is exclusively for industry professionals, such as insurance companies, assessors, car rental companies, workshops, scrap sites and car dealers, who must register before their activities.
Founded in Germany in 1996, this platform manages more than 650,000 operations across Europe, 500,000 of them in Germany alone.
Its main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
Today, the website has more than 1,500 registered sellers and 4,000 reviewers.
3,000 ads are managed every day and 100 new ads are added to the Spanish market every day.
According to Spanish legislation, a vehicle whose chassis number has been checked out is no longer allowed to drive on the roads, but certain undamaged parts may be used as spare parts.
On the other hand, cars with historical value may be re-registered, even if they have been unregistered after difficult government procedures.
Workshop cost estimate in four steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, the company Audatex ensures that the user receives a cost estimate in just four steps: identification of the vehicle, finding the spare part, creating and creating a cost estimate.
Easy handling of these systems is a fundamental condition, especially to convince older professionals who are usually more or less against the use of these new computer techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, 666 of which are passenger cars, 109 off-road cars, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Of course, you need a computer with an internet connection to use.
After the model to be repaired has been identified using the chassis number, a graphic of the respective model appears and then the required spare part is selected.
The user can include variables, such as the price for the working hours, surcharges or discounts, and afterwards he can print out the cost estimate and pass it on to his customers.
However, AudaTaller is not a review tool like AudaPlus, but rather a reference catalog.
The main difference between the two systems is that the workshop-oriented work hours are not estimated.
The cost of using this tool is 350 euros per year, an amount that the customer can pay without further ado.
Currently, the company Audatex is working to be able to offer these images in three-dimensional format.
This is an innovation that car mechanics have been waiting for a long time, because with it, for example, you can choose a door and then turn the picture completely to look at the inside.
