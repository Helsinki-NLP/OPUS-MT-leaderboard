The UKIP remnants who refuse those living with HIV are a perfect example.
You are talking about when Nigel Farage says the NHS should not be used to pay for those who come to the UK to do health tourism, and when, with that in mind, he answers yes when the interviewer specifically asks him if people living with HIV are included in the undesirable.
First you use special arguments, then discredit them by barely veiled homophobia.
Every time I or my family need the NHS, we have to queue behind chronic hypochondriac intolerants who think everything is theirs.
I think you're the one who uses special arguments.
Health tourism, as defined by right-wing madmen, practically does not exist.
I think that's what we call democracy.
Then no one would be affected by UKIP’s measures against health tourism, so there is no problem.
It is only in the UKIP parallel universe that Carswell can appear as a revolutionary.
A citation taken from a wiper is not evidence.
So, shoot the messenger.
The Mail didn't write the report, it just commented on it.
Those who control the majority of the media in this country should be shot for spreading such populist propaganda as if it were reality.
I don't think you know what a special argument is.
You also don’t know anything about my personal situation or my identity, so you should be careful when you try to kill the debate by accusations of homophobia.
Farage's phrase surprised many, but only because this problem is so rarely talked about.
He made absolutely no homophobic remarks.
You will have to be able to recover.
I’m not where you want to come from, of course, but I guess you don’t like when the media talks about what you don’t like.
It is so rare to talk about it because unlike Farage and his mad Thatcher followers who think that AIDS and floods are a sign of God and not a reflection on their own inability to understand that the complexities of humanity are something good, then no.
Finally, the situation is as rotten in Ireland as it is in Spain.
With the new crisis coming the period of austerity will not have solved anything.
Expecting nearly 5% growth in 2015 is a big joke.
Ireland, the ''TIGRE DE L'EUROPE'', was boasted to us a few years ago.
We've known the suite!
This begins to read the article again.
We are trying to suggest that Ireland is a virtuous country and that a ‘NEW ECONOMIC MIRACLE’ is happening.
With the Brussels agreement, taxes on the lowest companies in Europe, a very flexible labour market, an emigration that continues.
With these ingredients nothing to pave for the moment with the arrival of the Poles.
In the 1980s, Ireland was one of the poorest countries in the European Union, with Portugal considering a constant perimeter, without the new countries, the situation is always better than it was.
Greece was ahead.
That their development has not been a long quiet river, it is certain in view of recent events.
Lowest tax rate in Europe?
That's not true!
Latvia has a tax rate of 0% on businesses.
Now there is real hypocrisy in France on the part of policies on taxes actually paid by multinationals.
If you believe a report published in 2008 or 2009, they pay in France less than 5% in general.
Only SMEs pay full pot.
Now I confirm that road traffic has become huge again, and there are new (and expensive) cars all over the street, just like before the 2008 crisis.
I have been living in Dublin for 14 years, the recovery is evident in the daily bottlenecks since the return.
Is this supposed to be economic news?
Don't worry, I'm sure the comments will catch on soon.
In another article they are writing, 2 Vauxhaul Astra are involved in a hanging on the A140.
Is Ryanair now planning to transfer passengers from one flight to another in this way?
I believe that Mr. O'Leary will soon buy a whole new fleet of devices, so a few bumps and scratches on the old ones will soon be forgotten.
That said, I'm flying with him next week, so I hope it won't be on either of those two once they're ripped off.
Then it would be entirely the fault of the other pilot.
Did Ryanair make passengers pay a surcharge for the additional fear that we were willing to provide them?
But without this kind of Irish company, you couldn't afford to go on vacation, young man.
I never took Ryanair and the last 3 times I took the plane it was with BA.
I prefer when the airline offers a quality service.
No, but it's Ryanair, so they can be very happy.
Any article on Ryanair triggers dozens of comments from people who would never take Ryanair in the place of those who like to take Ryanair and think that those who pay something other than the basic fare just have to take care of themselves, etc.
It's pretty transparent.
Ryanair will not be satisfied with the additional costs due to this incident.
I wonder what the delays will be and whether it will be necessary to compensate passengers and, if so, whether Ryanair will be able to avoid paying by saying that it was an error of the airport air controllers.
Passengers were put on another plane in less than an hour, they are not entitled to any compensation.
I'm sorry to disappoint you and your compensation dreams.
Welcome on board this British Airways flight that takes English ISIS to Syria, not true as you say.
Have a good trip.
Last Sunday in Paris, rue des Francs-Bourgeois: the Marais is largely pedestrian, and literally crowds of people.
People don’t come in bulk for the quality of the restaurants (some, most) or for the Espace des Blancs-Manteaux magazine show (hyper-intellectual and slightly dusty).
The reason for this crowd is that the shops are all open and the neighborhood is incredibly lively and lively.
With a lot of foreigners spending .....
Do you think the opening of Sunday will create jobs?
Go to Paris Rue des Francs Bourgeois where shops are open on Sundays, crowded with 50% of tourists.
<0x40>Aloe is wrong.
The only argument that would seem acceptable to me is that of the areas receiving a significant number of foreign tourists and it is nuanced by the fact that they buy tax-free.
Tourist areas lose a considerable amount of turnover each year for the same reasons.
Remains the industry where expensive equipment, exploited on Sunday, allow to lower prices.
Sunday rest is a right that employees benefit from, except for exceptions.
This is why it is provided for and regulated by the Labour Code.
Neither the Minister for Economic Affairs nor the Minister for Foreign Affairs has the slightest competence to reform the Labour Code.
While they're locking it up.
What's the law for?
Satisfy a portion of the population and businesses who want to work on Sundays.
In Montreal on Sunday I take my little children to the municipal library.
In my city of 30,000 inhabitants where I live in France the municipal library is open 4 days a week but not the we!
This is access to culture...
And that is also the regulation of working time.
the way of life he has tenaciously defended against fascism
the way of life he has tenaciously defended against fascism and Bolshevism
What if his daughter's estate was, against his will, used to pay the estate fees?
There are paintings.
Some are good, others are not terrible.
No doubt his succession would want his share of the cake, if you pass me the expression.
his preference for a victory of the nationalists/Franco in the Spanish civil war...
And his hostility to the independence of places like Ireland and India and his fascist ideas as a whole and also his well-known hatred of Jews.
Churchill was not perfect.
Neither do I.
But for five years, and only for five years, it was perfect.
In 1940 he faced other government aristocrats who wanted to discuss a “deal” with the Nazis and he very skillfully won.
Thanks to his magnificent rhetoric and energy, he united the country in the idea that fighting the fascists was the only way to win.
The people of the United Kingdom, and of France, and of Belgium, and, ultimately, the whole world, can thank God for having had during these five years, just these five years, Churchill at the bar and none else.
Churchill's greatness has nothing to do with this discussion.
That his descendants sell the paintings on the free market to gather the money from the estate fees, they could even make a profit.
If the public wants to be able to admire one in a museum, let them collect the money to buy it.
It's as simple as that.
But we could use the tax money.
No one can deny that, when it was “the moment of truth,” Churchill’s personality was a positive advantage for his country during World War II.
A revival of the internal market through public works will only benefit large companies, which will increase their dividends by avoiding hiring, as infrastructure projects are by definition not renewable.
As for the social reforms advocated by the Minister, they well reflect the real French evil: the mistrust of dialogue.
Back to the principles.
A reform of unemployment insurance is not contradictory.
Let the weakest of us not be in need!
Either in solidarity we come to his aid, or he has RIGHT in exchange for the services he renders or rendered to a minimum of resources.
The SM40H that I prefer to smic corresponds to this vision.
There is also the landlord who lives on the income of his property.
There is a need to differentiate between the person who invests for a return at the time of his retirement and the one who lives on his pensions.
A property to rent or even two for a couple on top, it is vice
The little genius of finance is singularly lacking in imagination.
The New Deal was a policy of great work, but at a time of shortage of large infrastructure.
Nowadays, in Europe and France, this is not the case.
Developed countries are over-equipped.
The need for infrastructure is marginal so no new deal could be a solution.
Especially at a time when the question of degrowth emerges in response to a recession that is only a wild and therefore brutal degrowth.
You would have been right 30 years ago: no more need (or possibilities) for dams, coal mines, highways...
But if we want to make the future climate-energy shock less rude, then the need for investment is screaming: isolation, renovation of the railway network, urban transport, transport and storage of energy etc...
A taxation that favors high incomes and renters.
Who is in power?
Obsessed with smartphones.
Charles Arthur is really a galopin.
Samsung's profits are undermined by the iPhone 6 and its competitors of the same range
Apple’s mid-September introduction of larger screens for the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus may have seduced buyers who would otherwise have bought a Galaxy
I tested all of these phones and decided on the LG G3.
So Samsung lost me as a customer, but not to the benefit of Apple.
I think it is essential that we have an alternative.
When Microsoft implemented this philosophy, we experienced a decade of stagnation that was finally broken by Google, Apple and the open source community.
We need to have several dynamic platforms, to stimulate competition and development.
In addition, we all have different needs and they can not be satisfied by a single manufacturer, because they are not compatible.
For me, I tend to buy Apple, because I like their underlying philosophy and I enjoy design.
Some people do not attach any value to the design, for them the options, functionality and price prevail.
There's nothing wrong with that.
Let’s stop looking for a “better platform.”
Is there “a better car manufacturer”, not really, they are different, but similar.
I would like to see a thriving mobile industry, with radically different approaches to different people and markets.
It is healthier and should be encouraged.
This is of interest to all of us.
I’m glad you found exactly what you were looking for and that it’s not an Apple product, even though I made a different choice.
Most of the people I know have iPhones.
Our umpfrontist friends who, according to one of them, fight ideas and not men (on the contrary, on Parisian bobos) could tell us by what author(s) they fight ideas about gender and tell us the works they intend to fight.
Or are they just attacking the genre as described in Le Figaro, Minute or Current Values?
Is it Judith Butler or Eric Zemmour?
All right, Jean, I love you, and you're smart and cultivated.
I said that about Judith in Furusato’s vein evoking Holofernes, a rapprochement that hadn’t come to me (I don’t have her vivacity of mind).
Otherwise, in the "bottom", since you refer to it, this subject does not interest me, and honestly I do not see where the problem is: I hoped that you and your friends could get me out of my backwardness, because I am slow but I understand well...
<0x40>Jean: Recognize that, culturally, sending Judith back to Holofernes does it.
Who is afraid to ask the world?
But what are we afraid of those who are afraid?
Furasato and <0x40> give us elements of response.
The first by invoking the Judith of the Bible, the second by describing Judith Butler as a very symbolic throat cutter.
We can see how much these studies affect the most intimate in their homes.
We are no longer in the debate of ideas.
It is something else, much deeper.
Have you read, John, that the World has published an article on the necessity of theology?
<0x40>: As for an idea debate, I thought we should go to the sources.
Pretending to fight ideas from the only exposition that their detractors make of them (Cardinal Ratzinger, inventor of the Theory of Gender or X Lacroix, theologian) does not seem to me very rigorous.
But well, as I explained to our umpfrontist friend, there is all the difference between having an informed opinion and a simple opinion.
I’m not sure if I understand the nuance.
I did not read Judith, the very symbolic throat cutter, I was content with the "Second Sex" (it was more of my time) which is, I believe, the source of "the source" according to Lo's wishes.
As I watched the eclipse from Melbourne, I saw red lights when the moon briefly showed up when the clouds opened.
This sudden appearance of the red moon had its charm and compensated a bit for the disappointment of sometimes having the view blocked by the clouds.
It was fabulous here at FNQ.
Yes, last night’s cloud would really enclose the coast of Victoria and NSW, while most of the rest of Australia had clear weather.
Flash special blood moon.
Tony Abbott/Joe Hockey holds the Labor accountable.
But if Labour accepts our unjust budget, we will give it its true color as soon as possible.
You're obsessed with that, aren't you?
I was in Melbourne so of course I only saw clouds.
Melbourne has also managed to cover itself throughout the Perseid meteor shower week and for virtually all the important astronomical phenomena of recent years.
I am beginning to think that there is an evil genius whose sole purpose is to prevent the inhabitants of Melbourne from seeing anything from the sky.
Melbourne is really not the best place for an observatory, even though things are getting much better on the other side of the Cordillera.
There were periods of 10 to 20 minutes where I couldn’t see the eclipse because of the clouds above the suburbs of Melbourne.
I'm going to put a TAXE on this eclipse.
Anyone looking at this eclipse should pay a TAX.
I bet your first thought of the day is for Abbott, just like the last before you go to bed.
Who or what will obsess over you when he (forcefully) ends up disappearing?
It seems that you spend a lot of time reading the discussions looking for messages in which people criticize the Abbott government and then accuse EUX of being obsessed.
Great picture of the moon above Sydney Harbour Bridge.
It looks like Mars is going to collide with Earth.
Nothing about stock market and real estate speculation.
Nothing about the inequalities between labour and capital incomes.
Nothing about tax fraud.
Ultra-liberalism is killing Europe.
Nothing about the gardens of Babylon.
The article says too much or not enough.
The details and arguments of these recommendations are not given.
There is no hyperlink to the original documents so that an opinion can be made.
See today, Tuesday, October 15, the results of the miracle recipes: in Spain, exports are at their lowest in five years.
In Greece, the stock market is collapsing.
Yet these seem to be the examples to follow.
The reform of the notaries would generate a claim for compensation of the order of 8 billion euros.
The Ministry of Economy is telling us that these claims for compensation are not substantiated.
What if the Ministry of Economy makes a mistake?
Will the decision makers who have squandered the political benefit from the courageous attack of the notaries have the same courage when presenting the bill to the state budget?
The continuation in its time.
Okay, thanks, JYL...
<0x40>lol No The state is not comparable to households in terms of budget management because the time horizon of the state is theoretically infinite while that of the household is limited by the lifespan of its members.
In addition, unless public spending is considered to be unproductive, it contributes to the financing of tangible and intangible investments that will support future growth and therefore future revenues.
Some elements of response.
A regrettable decision.
But remember the sacred oath of Hippocrates: the health of the profits of global pharmaceutical companies must be preserved above all.
Nice conspiracy theory.
Unfortunately, the truth does not correspond to your fantasy.
Medical staff would like to be able to use it, but they have their hands tied by law as written by policies.
This is the same situation as for the product that causes medical abortions rather than having risky surgical interventions, safe shooting rooms for drug addicts rather than having them on the streets, etc.
On these questions the politicians want to please the uncultivated masses.
By the way, doctors don’t make money with medications.
That's why there are pharmacists.
Doctors don't make money with drugs Because the Liberals want our health care system to look like the U.S., you should find out how it works.
All over the world doctors are courted in the same way, but it is more or less visible.
It may have been wrongly formulated to blame the tubbies, but the reality is that many countries, including Australia, give priority to corporate profits and “research.”
So read the few rare reports on our Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme expenses and on negotiations with pharmaceutical companies compared to other countries.
Compare the global prices of drugs available everywhere, as well as the differences from one country to another on what is over-the-counter or just on prescription.
It is a political and economic process, not a medical or scientific process, directly or indirectly.
In fact, some companies are currently testing marijuana inhalations against oncological pain, despite laws that hamper them and expensive permits required.
Although manufacturers of certain drugs may not be happy that alternatives such as marijuana are being used, those who achieve a version that offers good quality products at known doses will benefit greatly.
Sorry to tell you, ma'am, but you're wrong, there's a lot going on behind the scenes for doctors and pharmacy.
As for this hospital, they were happy to use it until someone puts a chip in the ear of a hospital official.
We can't OWN patents on grass...
If “researchers” in the social sciences were doing research instead of doing politics and networking, one might be using their “works.”
A researcher investigates, he does not compare one fact to another.
Comparing is not looking.
To compare is to do pedagogy, not research.
You can’t say “the research is done, you have to apply it” and then in the same jet “you have to experiment at everything”.
If your research is successful, why experiment?
If your research is not complete, why do you ask us to apply it?
Can you explain to me how a “researcher” can deduce that a student who cannot assimilate mathematics alone could more easily assimilate mathematics and other subjects?
New technologies make it possible to learn on the condition that students learn to use new technologies, but how would they learn new technologies if they do not know how to learn?
Pisa tests are just an indicator we make an indicator that allows us to find indicators that are satisfactory to us.
What is the use of building an indicator that informs you of what suits you, a will to self-promotion, a deception?
There is only one way to train teachers: to remove sophists and ideologists from training and that practitioners teach practitioners.
Fabrique reread the paragraph on the internships (which unfortunately is not very argued) and you will see that your conclusion pushes us to the most ineffective conservatism: "It is a device that leads primarily to the reproduction of the practices in force, and that does not allow to advance the system ".
Given the general consensus on the state of the French system, it is not desirable that practitioners alone teach practitioners, even if they have their full place in a modern training of teachers.
Educational theorists should have no place.
Practitioners must have one.
Would you like to be operated on by a surgeon whose training is purely theoretical, and who has never set foot in an operating room before?
There is no consensus on the causes of problems in the education system.
To give more weight to education theorists would be to destroy it definitively.
Your analogy is totally false: if I would not like to be operated on by a practitioner who has only a theoretical training, I would much less like to be operated on by a surgeon who has no theoretical training and who has learned on the pile.
Mike Weatherley, the Conservative MP in charge of the fight against copyright infringement by David Cameron
Why doesn't he just tell Cameron to stop?
Somebody should make a popular arrest.
MDR exmaiers thanks.
If one day I start to feel guilty about copyright infringement, I’ll just read an article like this.
In an information economy, copyright infringement = vol.
This is the same as they need to cite their sources correctly.
Often, getting a license costs nothing.
No, it's a copyright infringement.
Not at all the same.
By using content without proper license, you deprive artists of their bread.
You can still debate pedantic assumptions - but it's theft.
And you can repeat it as much as you want, but it won't be true.
This is a copyright infringement.
Come on, repeat it again.
If one day I start to feel guilty about copyright infringement
Obviously, you don’t mind depriving artists of their income.
If they think they should receive money for images used in homework, an almost perfect definition of what reasonable use should be, then I'm happy to deprive them of that fictitious income.
Lesson 1 should be to show how, if the children themselves create anything and publish it on their favorite social networks, they abandon any intellectual property to the site under the terms and conditions they have gone through with a click.
Perhaps if they share the headphones of their mp3 stroller with a buddy on the school bus, they should be expelled for violating the law in such a way.
Oh, if we could export this resource that we are full of, the whisperer who says that everything is going wrong....
If it is a PS MP who claims it, then we must believe it.
I have 2 children and when they are of age to choose, I would advise them to leave France if nothing has changed by then.
France is pulling people down by constantly assisting them.
I do not want my children to bear the debt that this policy will have created.
What pulls France down are speeches like yours.
<0x40>gus I have always worked in a private company.
I had the CHANCE to have worked in companies run by excellent business leaders: it exists in France but it is rare.
I’m employed because I know I don’t have the skills to run a business and this choice allows me to shoot red balls at the zero bosses I meet frequently.
Comfortably in my sneakers I totally share the post of Jean-Pierre Bernajuzan: he says the horrible truth!
<0x40>gus, if we compare with the German companies that French business leaders constantly quote to call for reforms in France, in Germany companies have managed to structure their industrial fabric to make it competitive, especially by ensuring the link between large and medium-sized companies - What do French bosses expect to do so?
Does the state hold their hand?
Is this the state they accuse of being an empire?
<0x40> Jacques L.
Always this pair of anti-business leaders on your part!
Remind me, what did you create as a job, as an added value, to be so severe?
<0x40>Pat I understand your reaction.
In reality, France faces an insoluble problem: the incompetence of French business leaders who are unable to create jobs and who are eating and mining while waiting for the permanent assistance of the state!
It's awful!
But they have solutions: abolition of the Labour Code, employer charges, taxes, working 45h/week paid 35, and some, walking on eggs, dare to demand the reduction of wages if not their abolition!
I look forward to seeing all the “negative” comments on this topic.
Which is ironic given the way people still complain about First Group.
From where I come from, Last hasn't really been an investment for us taxpayers.
They tried to keep themselves floating rather than transforming themselves.
This does not mean that the Scottish railways have not improved since Last took care of it.
But they had also improved with their predecessors, including British Rail.
Unfortunately, we do not have the power to do so.
I tried to have them recently, but I didn't succeed.
But the Labour Party is going to get us bored, isn't it?
It is an international subsidiary.
They already operate trains in Germany.
Nothing prevents people in the UK from creating a more moral business and taking part in bidding.
But it seems that we are not very good at managing, most of our privatized services end up being managed by a foreign operator.
I still remember the scandal and the criticism when First won the Virgin contract, all this so that the decision was finally overturned.
MTR, a Hong Kong company, has won the Crossrail operating contract for 8 years.
Well, Labour, as they told us during the referendum campaign, is totally in favour of sharing and sharing and thinks that workers should all help each other across borders.
We can assume that they will be happy with this decision ;)
Perhaps it is because the Dutch management is on good track while the British management is not.
What ScotRail needs is not just a change of ownership but, above all, new ideas.
Abellio is perhaps the least bad choice possible, but the real problem is the ridiculous franchise system, not the franchisor.
“She was a fighting girl.”
Lord, I hate it, but I really hate that kind of expression.
Assuming that the fact of being "beating" is a quality superior to many others, the concern of others, intelligence, listening to it, for example, the fact of being "beating" has nothing to do with the fact of surviving a disease: cancerous "beating", which are not less dead, I know of palanques.
Getting out of a disease has nothing to do with merit.
Come on, let's start again, too.
I’m not telling you that this is the condition to manage, I’m telling you that it helps.
Nothing to do with any merit!
As for the examples of your life, there are only you to judge them.
I'll do it again.
Insinuating, even for a moment, that one can have the merit to get out of a disease or that one can not deserve to get out of it, is simply monstrous.
The body follows or does not follow.
A body that looses, from everywhere, despite the will, despite the trust in medicine, you have a vague idea of what C?
Sorry to think otherwise, if, having a solid morality makes it probably easier to accept heavy treatment and prepare for it, to try experimental treatments like this woman did and not refuse them out of fear.
Someone who is battling in medicine is first and foremost someone who trusts in medicine.
But if you prefer to turn to the "Lord" it's something else.
Neither with merit nor with courage.
These considerations are specific to moralists.
When you catch some dirt, a real one, you get stripped to the point of just becoming a zombie.
Personally, I caught two of them, dirt, fat ones, and if I "fighted" as these psychologists say, it completely escaped me.
Unless this fight consists only in squeezing your teeth, suffering hell and taking the blows.
I thought the indictment against Milosevic had been decided and finalized a decade ago.
I haven't seen that name in the papers in at least that time.
What's going on? What's going on?
It's a birthday.
A forgotten birthday.
His trial was conducted “quickly” and then swept under the carpet.
Is this the story we told at the time?
The communist-turned-nationalist who sparked three wars in the Balkans over the past decade?
The Communist President of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia?
So please ask what we have voluntarily left aside: 1.
How could NATO bombings be legal under the Least Rule of International Law?
Which country has Serbia attacked? <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
About RTS (Radio-Television-Serbia), why not mention that NATO destroyed this same building by killing civilians and then considered it a valid target.
Milosevic had no way out: if he did not defend his country against NATO attacks, he would be crucified as a traitor.
And if he defended it, he would be swallowed by the Western compressor roller.
The Westerners used a smokescreen to detach part of a sovereign state that then unilaterally proclaimed its independence and was widely recognized by Western states that then lied end-to-end about the situation on the ground.
The Serbian population has now completely disappeared (ethnic cleansing).
Vojislav Kostunica, mentioned here, died politically after his first term for not understanding the situation that had developed.
Zoran Djindjic was one of the most controversial figures in the political world of the time.
In the end, the Guardian shouldn’t call Milosevic a tyrant (even if we didn’t like him).
To my knowledge, there is only one method of predicting earthquakes in Greece that works roughly by measuring the piezoelectric level in quartz.
This type of study is undoubtedly useful and thank you for sharing the results.
This water has nothing to do with that of the exoplanet named HAT-P-11b, located about 124 light-years from Earth in the constellation Cygnus, which would be "the smallest and coldest planet to present detectable water molecules" from the Univers's Drahane, according to one study.
Method to be followed.
As well as those involving animals feeling a threat to arrive.
Thank you Passer of science for delighting us, often, with these experimental prowesses that are realized in the world.
How would the animals know (in advance)?
Undoubtedly by the perception of other elements whose rate evolves in the event of an earthquake.
Like radon, for example.
A gas a priori odorless to humans but perhaps detectable by animals.
All these methods are undetectable to man, but not to the measuring instruments at his disposal.
However, we do not have a reliable result on these tracks...
It has been observed many times (and for centuries) that some animals act strangely for a few hours with an earthquake, notably chickens, cows, dogs but especially fish and snakes.
I had seen an art report about the struggle of two scientific teams, one from California and the other from Japan, to recognize the validity of their work on the sensitivity of animals to terrestrial magnetic fields, and in particular their modification before an earthquake.
I am not a scientist, but their hypotheses convinced me.
Where are we at with this research?
Why so much contempt for this track?
We should learn to listen to nature.
If you examine things calmly and rigorously, you publish it in a serious journal, and no one despises it.
As soon as we talk about the “signs” given by the animals, we clash in the same way: everyone will remember that 5 minutes before an earthquake the red fish bizarrely turned round.
I don’t understand that we can think that Boris would be a good leader for the Conservatives.
He has done too much as mayor of London.
When you listen to the LBC program you can't help but think that this man knows nothing about it and that he's always trying to divert with a joke.
He never responds directly to anything.
He also said he agreed with Farage, then Nick Ferrari the presenter asked him about what.
He couldn't name a single point.
He made so many promises to be elected mayor and he didn’t keep one.
It only underscores how much the rest of the Conservative Party is just a bunch of shit, right?
Because he's popular.
Because he's funny.
He was in "Have I Got News For You".
Because it's a celebrity and people have been taught the worship of celebrities.
The Londoners voted for him and so will the rest of the country.
When (and not if) he takes the leadership of the party, the rating of popularity of the Tories will break the ceiling I am sure.
May God help us.
I'm not so sure: people like jokes, but they don't want their prime minister to be one.
That's exactly what they said about the Londoners.
He should have brought with him his friend the parpaing, smarter than him
In many ways, I think he's trying to copy R Branson.
The Americans had one as president.
The French have truly and always been disinterested in the history of the Pacific War.
For all those who have bothered to read a few books (there are some, including a French and excellent B.
Millot), the “Salomon” and the “Scratch Strait” speak, as unfortunately as the dead who remained there.
It is understood that the Australians, who know (one of their heavy cruisers, Australia, must still be there in the background since the Battle of Savo) do not want to return there.
We actually passed by the island of Savo, in the "Iron Bottom Sound".
Even if the mission comes to an end.
They're the little ones.
But the ecolo side is a total smoke.
Calculate the kerosene consumes to achieve the goal totally discredits the concept.
Just browse through the list of sponsors than philanthropists.

The cow is so jealous!!!
I am looking forward to the web series!
Your recital makes me look back, identifying myself a bit when passing (I also learned to sail with the Crocos de L'Elorn to the Moulin Blanc in the rade of Brest!).
Hat also for the ecological message, even if some criticize the impact of displacement.
The end justifies the means.
Continue to make us look back, and proudly show that the Bretons are great travelers!

Good evening I think the red hat that has protested against taxes is happy to know that this trip is sponsored by the Region of Brittany and the City of Brest.
More seriously, it seems to me that local authorities and public bodies of all kinds should not devote a penny of our taxes to financing the dreams of a few adventurers even as friendly as these!
Are there any players in the current Serbian formation who are of Kosovo origin?
I know that Dusan Bajevic in Lyon and Milos Krasic, once at Juventus and now at Fenerbahçe, are from Mitrovica, but I don’t know if they’re still on the team.
Bisevac is Lyon's defender, not Bajevic.
Bajevic was midfield or before in the 70s and 80s and coached many teams in Greece, but I don’t know where he is from.
Bajevic is from Mostar, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and played as an attacker in Velez's great team which, under the tutelage of the legendary Suleman Rebac, finished twice in second place in the Yugoslav league (and also had sizes like Vahid Halilhodzic and the loyal team of We Arsenal).
Well, thank you Mole!
Of course I know Halilhodzic and Primorac.
Just out of curiosity, what happened to Krasic?
It was said that he was going to become a great player when he was at Juve, he is currently in Turkey, but the last time he appeared on my radar screen he was related to Blackburn *frisson*
There, I can't help you.
I know he lost his place when Conte arrived, then he went to the Fener and as far as I know he's not a holder.
Maybe he can still do something, maybe in the Indian Super League?
Seriously, Serbia.
Seriously, Albania, don't be afraid.
You should love Albania because you are neighbors.
The thing is that the flag of this drone is not the flag of the real Albania of today.
Apparently it was the flag of Greater Albania, which encompasses all regions where there is a significant Albanian presence.
A bit of excessive nationalism, actually.
Fortunately, there was not too much damage (which I know).
In fact, it was an Albanian flag with the map not of what is called Greater Albania, but of Albania before 1913, when the great European powers decided to give ends of the country to neighboring countries.
How can one feel “an explosion of joy” when one sees two towers collapse knowing that women, men, and probably children are inside?
How ???
What annoys me a bit in this "testimonial" is that the only fact of having been able, even once, to spontaneously rejoice in the horrible death of thousands of people, testifies to me of a "border line" personality whose all "testimonials" should be taken with the utmost care.
Undoubtedly, in the short moment of "joy", we will not have thought of the dead or the reality of the horror inflicted.
We will have just thought, for a moment, that, for once, Muslims had succeeded in truly and apocalyptically hurting the great villain Satan in his very heart.
To make qqch powerful.
The grandiose.
It would seem that this feeling was shared by thousands of Muslims roasted by their sense of humiliation.
With testimonies filmed in Palestine.
Classical Schadenfreude.
We had a little doubt about it.
The Western “Christian/White/Galician” cannot measure the degree of frustration, anger, and hatred of the Musulman when he contemplates the general misery, the social and cultural underdevelopment of today’s Arab Muslim world.
I'm talking about the suburbs of Cairo or Algiers, not the towers of Dubai.
The past splendor, certainly magnified, is not a consolation, on the contrary.
How to get the Muslim world out of this diabolical funnel?
Totally in phase, 2 major poisons irrigate the Arab world: bigot conservatism of the powers in place and fascist nihilism.
The common point, the freezing of thought and the excommunication (sweet or armed) of its critical expression.
Let it be understood before, we must not turn back the Muslims.
That's the only way.
Did Edwy Plenel read this article?
I guess that's true in many countries.
But in Britain, autumn marks the beginning of six long dark, damp and depressing months that affect the well-being and mood of many people.
In addition, everyone gets sick.
Seasonal depression.
I suffer from it myself.
When the light goes away, it becomes hell for me and those like me.
A dose of vitamin D should help a little for mood and well-being.
Autumn is beautiful in Great Britain, with or without rain.
The countryside in particular is breathtaking in autumn.
Not as breathtaking as the green of summer when everything is alive instead of being about to die.
In Britain, if you’re lucky, summer falls on a weekend.
We had a nice summer this year, don’t make your grizzly that rattles clichés!
Not everyone.
I rarely get sick in the winter.
But now I am retired and I no longer develop immunity to germs from the outside, it can change, I guess.
It's not being about to die, it's just one step in a cycle...
A wonderful stage full of intoxicating smells, with a fever that culminates with festivities such as Halloween, Guy Fawks, Christmas, the risks of snow and full of other wonderful words.
Just don’t stop doing things!
Here are my recommendations for the holidays for you.
Yes, these dark and grey months actually make me a lot happier and more relaxed.
For the taxation of increases for children , it is the amount received by the State that comes mainly from deciles 8 to 10 .
However , as regards the number of households whose taxation has increased as a result of this measure , it is mainly the 4th and 5th deciles ( median income ) that are concerned , as shown in Figure 2 .
The removal of half of the majority of widows is not covered in the article at all, or rather its impact is completely underestimated: 230M euros is a joke that does not take into account the impact in 2012 and 2013 and implies that it is painless.
And he's not ready to make it.
Well, we are not on the straw, certainly, but singers
For once the PS makes a policy rather of the left we will not cry...
It is obvious that those who are among the richest 20% have to bear much more than 75% of the increase in taxes, why not 90%?
Keep doing this and you will encourage these 20% to work less or to leave.
Well, I know that's not politically correct, but I'm saying it anyway.
Long live the Trots and the OCIs recycled to the PS: they understood everything.
Adam, you don't see what you're looking at.
The proportion is still the same, here or in Bahrain: 20% of the population owns 80% of the wealth.
A fair tax is when it prohibits anyone from collecting as much as they can.
Beyond a certain limit, money loses all its usefulness.
And once the usefulness of money has been overcome, money serves only to make money, that is to say, to make the unhappiness of the greatest number.
We are among the richest 20%.
Undoubtedly also the 20% of households that work the most (and create wealth, part of which is logically redistributed).
A fair tax must allow these households to benefit from part of their efforts.
Or so much lower your arms and live social minimums, especially if you have a social housing .
The utopias of the Khmer Rouge head cutters have happily lived.
I did two AirBnBs in Norway recently.
It's all right.
In one of the two, we had things we wouldn't have had in a 5-star hotel and we didn't have to show up at the reception or face the slightest hassle.
All you have to do is go to someone's house, sleep there, lay behind you, and leave.
This will be my first choice when I travel.
The logo has changed, people...
Check your insurance before renting your home.
In most cases, you’ll need some kind of homeowner’s insurance.
Make sure to use a service with the right logo!
Ah, 6 o'clock too late.
I love Airbnb.
“It’s very dangerous and highly risky” No, it’s not true.
You've just really been out of luck.
According to the link provided in the article:
At its unloading, Airbnb's response to Teman was fast, almost absurdly fast.
Within 24 hours, according to an email provided to Gawker by Teman, Airbnb had sent a locksmith to change the locks, arranged for him to spend a week at the hotel and transferred $23,817 (for which Airbnb is insured, but still).
So why does this article quote Teman complaining that he received no support from Airbnb?
I LOVE AIRBNB, to receive as to travel
Hello I am looking for people who have already used air bnb just to reassure me.
I plan to pay a down payment and a month's rent at once but I'm a little scared to send <0xC2><0xA3>1,600 to a site I've never really heard of.
But where are we going?
“Supporting the troops,” the Bu$herie chanted in every tone.
Innocuous weapons.
I am sure that it will please families and close friends of the thousands of Kurds who died in Halabja to learn that their parents and friends have succumbed to something other than the chemical bombings of Saddam Hussein.
Unless the content of the article has been radically altered by the author, your comment is inappropriate (to remain polite).
In addition, how would this mass crime committed in 1988 prove that chemical weapons discovered nearly 20 years later were still usable?
It is not hyper clear the author's style: "in search of weapons of mass destruction.
Well, we're in agreement.
You think it's time to weaken the army to strengthen education.
This is never the time to strengthen education, because we are still at war.
Alternative: Is it ALWAYS time to strengthen education, because we are still at war?
Education would be greatly enhanced if “them” were to work 35 hours instead of 17.
Currently, our teachers are earning more than engineers.
And don't let us believe that teachers spend 18 hours a week preparing their program.
But this is not seen since the National Education does not have the means to provide an office to the college / high school to its teachers so they work at home.
Some kind of forced telework in sum, except that the employer does not pay for the computer, Internet connection, or supplies.
By the way, it's so much the board at 17h per week and 4 months of vacation that we can't fill the CAPES with maths, come on, we're waiting for you.
How come you don't want to hang out with poorly educated peasants whose parents are spitting on you and calling you a branler?
I think the priority in this area is to disarm the jihadists so that the Khurdi population can flourish better.
Where we can see that the Bush administration has absolutely done everything wrong.
My first job as a graduate was in the London sales department, earning three times nothing, and yet it was a job that required a degree.
A year later, I saw an advertisement to be a worker for the London Underground, it was paid <0xC2><0xA3>5,000 more per year and we weren’t even asking for the patent.
I've never regretted it.
In this regard, don’t worry if you don’t find a graduate job, try to find something either that pays well or that you like to do.
If I had stayed in graduate jobs, I would still have to pay my student loan
I don’t really like working in companies, so I hope to eventually move either into the public service or the academic world.
LOL LOL This article is coming really late!
Exactly, when I graduated in 2011, there was already a three-year arrear.
The best way to reduce the number of unemployed graduates?
Getting rid of sloppy lines like art/letter/theatre/media/philosophy/political sciences, that is, what are called unemployed diplomas.
I have one of these degrees and I finished production manager.
It turned out that the important thing was not the degree but, as the article above says, a good career path, starting at school and throughout the university.
Certainly the starting salary was lower but we quickly climb the ladder because in the real world what matters is the results more than the knowledge.
This engineering/artistic studies debate has been going on for years.
Scientists can’t solve all problems, it’s more important to be able to get up in the morning, get to work on time and interact with people so as to get results.
Are letters, philosophy, and art a no-brainer?
That's ridiculous.
I guess you're talking about media-study-type diplomas or whatever the hidden sector you've been to.
Letters, philosophy, political science and art are real channels.
We need people who can explain the big questions to high school students, who understand the importance of the foundations of culture such as literature, art, etc., and highlight them.
Wouldn’t it be better to have a real territorial policy to de-escalate Paris and dynamize the rest of France?
Personally, I do not see the inhabitants of the end of the Essonne and Val-d'Oise doing 80km back and forth every day by bike to come to work in Paris.
Intra-muros and small-belt residents already have many otherwise more convenient means of public transport (metro, bus, tram).
> Several secure and locked parks, as there are already in northern European cities, in Dijon or Lyon, will be installed on the road.
That's a good idea.
On the surface, the space is cannibalized by the 2RM.
Incidentally, it is hoped that the City of Paris will work with professionals from the Netherlands and Denmark.
They also benefit from their extensive experience in the field.
Well, we haven't found a place for ONE bike hanging device.
The motivation seems stronger when it comes to finding an office for Bertrand Delano<0xC3><0xAB>.
Well, it's not good at all.
When we talk with pedestrians and other users of the road, it is not possible to adapt the road to the public transport (30) because they do not pedal, it seems to me that the main reasons that come out are: 1 / it is super dangerous with all these cars, these trucks, these scooters that run super fast and fuck about the survival of bicycles 2 / we take full of pollution
The cycle paths are apartheid, we must coexist but rebalance the occupation of the urban space.
Nothing on the bike in Greater Paris?
Not a word about the place of the bike in public transport?
EELV is right.
The goal of 15% cycling trips is ridiculous.
I'm beginning to believe that Anne Hidalgo rolled the greens in the flour.
By the way, after what OR reports, the EELV deputies seem skeptical.
I prefer to be optimistic.
Before the racket starts, it would be better to find who really hides behind this massacre.
Note: This is not Russia.
I’m not sure I like the way the world evolves.
That sounds awful.
My children are not a financial asset.
One lawyer expressed his intention to bring the case before the ECHR, but I did not hear that a complaint was indeed filed.
In addition, they should file a complaint first in Germany or Ukraine.
I also expect these cases to be adjourned pending the outcome of the accident investigation report and the resulting criminal investigation.
Yeah, but Libya didn't blow up Pan Am 103 either.
Malaysia Airlines is not wrong, the fault lies with the authority in charge of airspace security, in this case the Ukrainian government.
Was the accident predictable?
Other aircraft had previously been shot down, Ukraine was launching air strikes against the rebels in the area, and any aircraft could of course be considered a possible and immediate threat.
Has the Ukrainian government taken reasonable precautions in view of an obvious threat, or has it chosen to play with the lives of innocents in order for airlines to pay the overflight rights of the territory?
Where are all the pro-Kiev trolls who defend their usurping government / the ultranationalists of Western Ukraine – and who want to demonstrate wholesale that Putin shot down MH17 flight.
As far as I know, there is already a complaint against the Kiev government because they are responsible for what is happening in their skies.
The previous: a 1986 ruling by the International Court of Justice that concluded that the CIA’s supply of weapons to the Contra rebel forces in Nicaragua did not mean that the United States was responsible for their actions.
There is no chance that Russia will let this matter go to the ICJ.
It’s funny to think that Abbott means to Putin that Australians were murdered by rebels backed by Russia.
I hope he can provide evidence to substantiate his allegations.
So far, the investigators have not said anything like that.
To be called Ricardo and be such an echoing beotian, it's awful!
To be called Polaris is to lose the North is to be joyful.
There is only one question: is the poor of today poorer than the poor of yesterday?
I can't help but notice that those who criticize Piketty's book most virulently haven't read it!
It's easy to read, I took a few days.
It shows the statistical evolution of income-production, income-capital, inequality-concentration, inequality of labor income, ownership of capital, merit and inheritance in the log term.
It shows that the concentration of today's capital reaches that of the beginning of the 20th before 1914, it shows that it was the two world wars that brought down the concentration of capital, from 1914 to 1945, and then how the concentration resumes after...
Bernajuzan: You say no to what.
I ask you how long it took you to read this pavement knowing that an individual's ability to concentrate has some limits.
Secondly, the question is not whether it is easy to read.
The question is whether the summary of the central thesis given by the press is correct or not.
If it is correct, one can debate it without having read the book, the main thing of which is to argue in one direction in favor of it.
No, it's easy to read...
Bernajuzan: How long did you take to read it?
Is the central thesis of his pavement summarized by the press wrong?
I have not read it and will not read it.
I therefore rely on the summary of his central thesis and it is that which seems to me pure fumigation.
The distinction between rich and poor is subsidiary.
Hasn't humanity become globally enriched?
And this enrichment added to an increase in population is the real political issue today.
Malala Yousafzai is an impressive personality and undoubtedly deserves the prize.
But remember, she's only 17 years old.
An age at which most people are just beginning to find their place in the world.
I hope that this award will not be a burden to the girl and that she will find her way to lead a happy life.
The problem is not the price but the political capital of Western governments who want to prove the old adage that colored perverts are the embodiment of evil.
All my best wishes to Malala, but she must realize that she is being used and that nothing will be done to educate girls in Pakistan or elsewhere - not even in the popular neighborhoods of Britain!
Somebody thought his speech was a little strange.
She thanked her father for giving her a lot of freedom but mentioned that if she wasn’t where she is now, she would have been married at the age of 14.
Isn’t Malala herself one of those “colored perverts”?
You should not have any “antenne time” on this site.
You yourself are a terrible pervert.
It's absolutely revolting.
No, her father wasn't going to marry her when she was 14.
She was 15 when she was shot.
Her father runs a school where girls are educated and he is in favour of equal rights for women.
He is, and always has been, so that she may receive a higher education and have the right to decide for herself her marriage.
However, he is unusual in Pakistan, as he believes that women are equal to men.
What she said is that an average Pakistani girl often has to get married at the age of 14, without having her word to say.
I'm sorry she didn't say it eloquently enough for you.
This may seem contradictory, but perhaps it means that if her father had not given her freedom, she would have been married at the age of 14.
Rather disappointed by this entry on the subject of season 4 and especially by Jessica Lange who apparently has a bit of a hard time finding her sosie character of Marlene Dietrich.
I’ve just watched the last two seasons that are quite different but I have to admit it’s one of the best horror series, one of the most successful!
A fascinating first episode.
The realization is close to perfection and the show of Jessica Lange singing Bowie’s anachronistic Life on Mars is simply stunning.
I haven't watched this new season yet (which will be the last for me, without Lange bof bof).
In the case of American Horror Story I preferred to have all of a sudden watch 13 episodes spread over 3 to 4 months.
But one thing is for sure, apart from Jessica Lange extraordinary, it was especially the risks of staging and editing that stood out to me.
There is an avalanche of original plans in AHS that ridicules the asepticization of today's productions.
I miss seeing you throwing the sponge in advance for the next seasons without even waiting to be able to gauge the quality.
Jessica Lange is certainly a pillar of this series but, you say so well, there are many other things.
It’s not just that for me Jessica Lange (and especially her way and how she uses it) is really ONE of the pillars of the series beyond the technical qualities.
And good bah I look a lot for her.
Then I find that the series sins by writing, she wants to do too many things at the same time.
Season 3 was slightly below, in season 2 it was too scattered despite a few excellent episodes.
I don't see them doing 10 seasons of American Horror Story or it's going to end like 24 hours of what.
But good everyone does what he wants!
It is because of what I say “I will not look after” that everyone is obliged to do the same!
I simply share my point of view nothing more, nothing less.
The loss of Jessica Lange, I think she will be fatal to him.
But then, that's just my opinion.
Let's talk less about tax hikes, please - cuts rather into state spending.
No, let's increase the expenses, please.
Those who wanted to sabotage the spending failed.
Provoke controversy about relatively small spending items, such as development aid
The problem is that this represents less than the margin of error in government spending in the UK.
The truth is that we are all talking about nuances rather than about the change of direction that voters seem to call their vows and throughout this time some in each camp pretend that these nuances are much more important and substantial than they are - and voters see clearly in their game and find them in bad faith.
Less than 1% of expenditure.
“Debt” is an asset held mainly by financial institutions in that country.
“Debt” is nothing to worry about.
I would have no problem with the government appropriating a third of my income (before even talking about consumer taxes) if I thought it was going to be used wisely.
But that is not the case, and many taxpayers feel the same way.
It is said that Nigel Farage has not been quite honest about how to reduce taxes but good, if you add our net contribution to the EU, development aid, High Speed 2, subsidies to wind turbines almost useless and nuclear power plants that cost twice as much as they should, you come to a figure that seems ridiculous.
Your first <0xC2><0xA3>10,000 is not taxable.
This means that someone who earns <0xC2><0xA3>35,000 a year will pay about <0xC2><0xA3>5,000 (a seventh of their salary), someone with <0xC2><0xA3>50,000 would pay about <0xC2><0xA3>10,000 (a fifth), etc., and someone with <0xC2><0xA3>200,000 would pay about <0xC2><0xA3>70,000 (a little over a third).
What about social contributions?
The more social contributions, the more local taxes, the more parking fees and the car stamp, and this is before VAT.
Almost exactly 30% of my money is collected at the source before local taxes and the car vignette.
I am paid decently, but not extravagantly.
Not that this is a problem, of course, I am happy to pay my taxes.
But let’s not pretend to believe that money falls from the sky, or that it’s not important to know where billions of pounds of taxes are going.
How can an unemployed person who is looking for door-to-door work prove it?
Even if 20% of the unemployed would not look, that means 80% are looking and not finding.
Since I am unemployed, am I more interested in what others are looking for or not?
If a potential recruiter gets 10 or 20 CV, it increases my chances of that.
In fact, I haven't heard from Pôle Emploi in months, that means that the agents are more busy with check-ups than really getting job ads back?
I don't see the interest.
Because it is not up to the state to provide work.
If Pole Emploi does not provide enough jobs, then you need to do without Pole Emploi.
What is a sensitive subject matter?
We all have rights and duties, in this case ensuring that the unemployed do their duty well in return for their rights.
Just as a controller requests their transport title from users of a means of transport, a head of service or are the employees of their work, etc.
Nobody shouts at the scandal in these cases, right?
It is indeed good to remember that the unemployed have rights: the only two times that I dealt with Pôle Emploi, my rights to the ARE had been poorly established, and on one of the files, amputated by 40%, it was necessary to fight hard.
It takes time!
I am not an expert in law.
Pôle Emploi is currently taking the lead in filing and control, while by statute Pôle Emploi is close to being, in fact, an insurance company.
I would add that the subject of compensation should concern only employees, they are the ones who pay the fees.
Politicians and non-wage French people are granting themselves rights that they do not actually have!
That's not normal.
I would add that a dignified unemployment insurance contributes to the value of wage-earners' work.
More than waiting for killer tweets in Arabic...
In reality, there needs to be a direct military response in Iraq/Syria that will stop ISIS so that this virus does not reach this conflict zone.
The situation would then resemble the spread of the Black Plague in 1348/9 in connection with the war and displacement of populations at the time.
The Saudis had the presence of spirit to ban the Hadj in Mecca from Muslim pilgrims from the three affected countries this year.
El Pais reports that 7,400 have been denied their visa application because of their country of origin or recent travel.
In fact, there was the case of a pilgrim from Bosnia who contracted measles in Mecca during Hadj in the 1980s, probably contaminated by a pilgrim from Somalia, where the disease still exists.
I hope the rest of the world will have the same presence of mind.
Is it heartless to propose to prevent Ebola patients from taking a plane to Europe?
I thought it was common sense, but apparently those “who know” decided that we could risk the lives of tens of thousands of people...
Those West African countries where Ebola is out of control should be placed in strict quarantine.
No one's coming out.
Only health personnel can enter.
21 days of waiting after treating patients before they can leave.
If they contract the Ebola virus while they are there, they stay there until they are cured.
These are not draconian measures.
Just last week, people were contaminated after having had contact with people in West Africa even though they took “all the necessary precautions.”
We can stop the progression of this disease.
It is mainly spread by airlines.
Let's ban them from offering to fly to these countries.
In addition, customs officers at airports should be trained to spot people with typical Ebola symptoms, so that they can be immediately quarantined.
That he manages to pass the message of the first individual and the second (including religious) group and he will have earned the Nobel Peace Prize.
I doubt that he is able to erect in dogma the image of God characterized by the totality of the cortexes of the planet in operation.
It is still far from that conception.
It's only been 20 years since information has emerged as humanity's given premium, while religion, coming from the cerebellum, has been directing our actions since maybe Lucy.
What is the purpose of becoming a Protestant church?
For those who have not noticed, Catholicism is largely minority in France today, no one is forced to join it.
Those who criticize would not put their feet on the Church anyway, there is only to see the small number of Protestants in France.
What is the next step, we remove the notion of sin, too "anxious"?
<0x40>louise: Sorry the church does not have a vision limited to France.
And in the world, maybe it will touch more people...
<0x40>Martine E, to be honest (as usual) the respect of others as you envision preexisted to Christ.
Hillel a century before him already said: "Do not do to others what you do not want to be done to you, this is the whole Torah and the rest is only commentary: go and study!".
Christianity goes far beyond a mere reciprocity but introduces the agape.
Your "advancing justice, peace, fraternity" but without God?
Is it a return to communism? :-)
The next step is to remove incarnation and resurrection.
Jesus will remain the hero who changed moral laws by redefining respect for others.
Christians will then be ready to take on their role in the ethical debates of our societies and to advance justice, peace and fraternity.
Not very Catholic?
I think I remember that the small number of Protestants in France is mainly due to the fact that their ancestors were exterminated and then converted by force and pushed to immigration a few centuries ago.
I'm too hesitant to buy this, the new Alien game, or Wasteland 2.
And the new Elite game is coming soon.
It can't be invented.
I personally would choose SoM.
I like Wasteland 2 (I even participated in its fundraising campaign) but I don’t think it’s worth <0xC2><0xA3>30.
If you are interested in the PC version, Green Man Gaming currently sells SoM at <0xC2><0xA3>30 and also offers a 20% discount voucher.
Green Man Gaming currently sells SoM at <0xC2><0xA3>30 and also offers a 20% discount voucher.
I'll take a look.
Obviously not at work.
The IT department's cheerleaders are blocking all the nice sites.
Hello, is that <0xC2><0xA3>30 then 20% off, or are the <0xC2><0xA3>30 including the 20% off?
Please note: the PC version is only for DX11.
It took me by surprise, I bought it, but I can't play it.
In addition, I bought it on Steam, so no refunds, it is zero.
It's time to buy a new video card *shut up*
This is a Brazilian site, but you get a valid Steam ID, I think.
Caveat emptor and all that: I didn't use it myself.
Amazon <0xC2><0xA3>30 for PC, <0xC2><0xA3>35 for Xbox 360 and PS3, <0xC2><0xA3>44 for Xbox and PS4
Thank you, I'd be afraid that one day they'd erase it from your library if they decided to crack down on the people who buy it there while they're out of the intended area.

So, was France of 1940 a “putrid land”?
So tell me, this Nobel Prize looks like a poisoned gift to me.
Should we love the France of 40, that of the "strange defeat"?
When one sees who gets the Nobel Prize in Literature one wonders whether Proust or Dostoyevsky would have it today.
The Nobel Prize is not even an event, we don’t even want to read the award-winning authors.
Will Brazilians, Chinese or Australians read Modiano, which is already difficult to read in French and which describes a universe so limited and so egocentric?
I hope the other Nobels are more credible, but frankly I doubt it.
Modiano, Levy, Musso have only a distant relationship with literature.
Did you at least read it?
Or another Nobel Prize?
It would be better to judge.
As for the Chinese, the Brazilians and others, don’t worry about them.
Foreigners are very sensitive to French literature and culture, they.
You will appreciate mr.
Modiano at its fair value, if they do not already know him!
On your side, keep going with Lévy and Musso.
I agree with you.
Marc Levy and Guillaume Musso keep their chances.
Let’s see who won the Nobel Prize in Literature.
Pinter in 2005, D.
Say hello to the awful ones.
Ever since I drove one in Iceland, I haven’t stopped seeing Kia Sportage everywhere.
I think this thing has followed me so far.
Maybe she's trying to smash me?
Or swallow me like the horrible computer of Superman III?
Hello Dantra, still hate?
Hello DQ - no, not today, I took my meds.
It's Wednesday!
I had a few days off.
That was cool.
Last weekend I went to the Nottingham beer and cider party.
It was bordelace.
I managed to taste 19 different beers, Wobbly Weasel being one of my favorites.
I was pleasantly surprised by the mix of people there, there were not only CAMRA fanatics (not to be confused with camera fanatics).
Driving back on Sunday was really hard.
On Monday night we went to a friend's grandfather's house to play nine card brag.
Thanks to a real chance of a beginner I was able to leave with several decent bets.
I hope if I get to be 95, I'll be as alive as he is.
Last night I went to a chic cocktail bar in Farringdon.
One of my drinks came with a slice of fat on it.
I admire M.
Read a little Buddha and you will understand how wrong you are, dear Christian.
That said, without wanting to bother you, I think you're getting a little bit away from the subject.
This famous totality, it forbids the quests for the jihadists at the exit of the mosques.
It signals arms trafficking without delay.
Either you have big eyes open like Meddeb and Ta<0xC3><0xAF>a or Boubaker or you have big eyes closed.
We have to choose.
It is not by keeping your eyes closed that you get to the light.
Forgive me, dear Christian, but once again, you are making a monumental contradiction: all the authorities, organizations or associations representative, Muslim or not, who have formally condemned ISIS and its crimes, the French, Muslim or not, have nothing to add to these unanimous official condemnations.
Who doesn’t say consent?
The problem is that people like you see them first as Muslims, Arabs or Africans.
Not like the French.
Unfortunately, dear Kentoc'h Mervel, doubt exists for everyone.
As I have said a thousand times, some doubt the French Jews’ approval of the Israeli massacres in Gaza, but it would be stupid and indecent to accuse them of it a priori and to demand that they demonstrate publicly to the rest of French society that it is wrong to doubt it.
This principle is, in my view, the denial of the republic and can only contribute to the delirium of French society.
If there is no doubt, say so.
Who does not say “consent” but “consent” to what?
Consent to a closeness with IS or to the condemnation of IS.
Silence is very practical, it is the main weapon of those who want to house the goat and cabbage.
Your position is intellectually honest but pragmatically unsustainable.
Alex Salmond predicted that Scotland could, in the elections, "revenge" the parties represented in Westminster because a huge gap has crept between their proposals for decentralization and what they promised on the eve of the independence referendum.
Cameron must be petrified at the idea of losing all these seats in Westminster...
Cameron must be laughing.
What are these threats?
The Conservatives don't give a damn about Scotland because they don't have any seats in it.
They can do whatever they want with impunity.
I don’t think even Cameron is stupid enough to believe that Labour losing seats in Westminster to the SNP is a good thing in the long run for him and the Conservatives.
Who will shed tears for the Labour Party.
They will be totally eliminated in Scotland by the SNP and UKIP who will cut their heads in the north.
Ed Miliband joined the "PROMISE" thinking he was saving his party but not realizing that he was signing the death warrant for his Scottish MPs.
No wonder some Labour MPs are asking their leaders to account.
If the SNP wins 20-25 seats and there is no majority in parliament, even if the seats do not come from the Conservatives, then they will be in a very good position to negotiate any coalition and they will be able to force both the Conservatives and Labour to do what they have promised for maximum decentralization.
I think that's what matters.
Not if Labour or the Conservatives want to be re-elected one day in England.
Waxing the pumps by 8% at the expense of 85% is not a great electoral strategy.
In addition, once Scottish MPs are no longer able to vote on matters relating to England, the Conservatives will win all the votes.
Oh, I think he is.
Cameron may not have much to lose, but Miliband does.
Maggie did it with the Ulster unionists and she did it well.
Still, he is still running for prime minister in 2015 and that is since he won the leadership of the Labour Party.
So, basically, these boxes will be virtually behind each reader to look over his shoulder and see what he reads, how he reads, and to the end.
It's "The Life of Others" from East Germany or the KGB applied to the world of FRIC...
Always the same fascination for surveillance techniques.
In the long run, this will have at least a sterilizing effect.
I’m waiting for the next post: Amazon makes YOUR book based on YOUR profile and automatically thanks to an algorithm of its secret!
It's just like the world.
Strongly stimulating.
Thanks for the article.
As under this system, DRM management is not implemented, I have to read pirated files, books in the public domain or purchased from a few publishers who have the intelligence to offer files without a wallet.
Given the price I paid for the Kobo, I have no regrets.
I am thrilled with the widespread abdication of users in the face of the widespread appropriation of their privacy.
At your public library, you will systematically notice that everyone gives their loyalty card (fn*c, d**itre, ...).
There are also demanding masterpieces whose opening and completion rates are probably ridiculous.

It is the data published by Kobo that are, not allowing to identify readers or authors.
But Kobo has all that information.
There have been so many exaggerated, erroneous and contradictory statements by the Turkish government in recent days that the country seems to be run by a kindergarten class full of under-acid schizophrenic kids.
This is even worse if you take into account Erdogan’s religious fundamentalism.
Interestingly, some Erdogan supporters think Islamist is such an insult that they suppress your comment, but not mine. ;-)
Well seen :-P But Turkey does not want to shoot a bullet in the foot, unless it wins something.
If she attacks ISIS, ISIS will respond, so it’s actually shooting a bullet in the foot.
A retired diplomat wrote on his blog: “The AP reports that Iran has warned the United States that it would be a mistake to seek to overthrow Syrian President Bashar al-Assad because it would endanger Israel’s security.
It is not clear in the article whether Iran was sending a serious warning of retaliation there or whether it was simply advising caution.
This second option is more likely and, in any case, what is really surprising is that today’s Iranian and US diplomatic engagement concerns Syria, Israel and the security of the region.”
Reading Indian Punchline is highly recommended to anyone paying attention to the details rather than to the c*neries balanced by the traditional media.The short article you give the link is important and should be read keeping in mind the realistic observations / previous warnings coming from Iran to 1979 proposed by the auto-Afghanistan.
Who are these “moderates” who are seriously fighting the horrific secular Assad and at the same time the perverts of ISIS?
Pipeline policy is pushing the world to the brink, and I would suggest that those who refer to non-existent “moderates” pay more attention to the facts and alternatives before sending the children of others to fight in World War III.
“It’s even worse if you take into account Erdogan’s religious fundamentalism” Are there other religious fundamentalists in power in the Middle East?
I've got one in my head.
There would be a Nuremberg trial for the Armenian genocide committed by the Turks.
Should we “should”?
Do you realize that neither the criminals nor the victims have the slightest chance of being alive?
A little late for that, my friend.
Wouldn't criminals be barely old now, like 120 years old?
It's a little late for that, isn't it?
Particularly concerning the triumvirate of the CUP that planned and directed the genocide, Talaat and Djemaal killed just after World War I by revenge by the Armenians, and Enver killed by the Bolsheviks in a shattered place in Central Asia about the same time, when he went there dreaming of founding a car.
What a delusion!
An impressive mastery of the sophism of the fatal slope, but besides that, one seeks in vain contact with the real.
Just clichés without arguments.
The fetus will always hear a heart beating even in the womb of a carrying mother.
Lesbian couples may simply have a desire to have a child and not a desire to be accepted.
Straight sterile couples too.
As for the children!
What a shame to call them psychologically imbalanced futures.
One day, they will have the age to defend themselves, to say that they are happy to live, to earn their lives and to pay the pension of this lady (?)
GPA is undoubtedly a temporary "solution" in the evolution of medicine that our world knows.
It doesn't date from today.
Many women bore and gave birth to children who were not their husbands.
It is still so, we are so made...
The important thing in this regard is that this practice is framed so that the "marketing" of the body is limited.
But cosmetic surgery, cosmetics, aren’t they also the merchandising of bodies?
Anachronistic color unit ...
It is certainly more elegant to enlarge a good in faraway countries via the Internet and Pay Pal than to endorse its responsibilities and or to avoid the scandal in another century near home without shouting it at that time on all the roofs! ...
These practices were not done in the name of the church! ...
There are not only Christians and believers who reject these practices.
Nevertheless, the exploitation of bodies is a real problem.
Oh shut up, this man is passionate about something.
In the late 1970s in the Midlands I saw this only from afar.

But if you like it and you listen to music - this music today still touches you as much.
I don’t know why there are so many scornful comments here about what Paul Mason is saying, maybe they’re posted by people who have never been cool, even for a few years!
I think in the sports section there is an article about football waiting for your comments.
Great article, very true.
Since Tony Parson’s film, there is a shortage of reports that really reflect the reality of Northern England’s culture.
It is no wonder that Paul Mason understood the social and political context well, he understands things well.
The Northern soul is still alive, but it has been vampirized by capitalism and today it is essentially a superficial phenomenon.
That said, if you’re in the London area in November, 99psoul will once again pass soul vinyls, including full Northern soul, on Saturday, November 15 at Betsey Trotwood in Farringdon.
I also thought “always the same story”, but here is a little article well written and well thought out.
Your critics really need to be more constructive.
That's a great article.
I loved your documentary.
I'm guessing you're glad you escaped Newsnight.
Last train to Wigan from Victoria/Exchange and get off at Wallgate.

The beginnings of the Northern Soul scene are described in an excellent episode of the George Gently police series titled Gently Northern Soul, which takes place in Newcastle in 1968.
Things are becoming more and more poisonous.
The Palestinians have no partner for peace.
Unfortunately, Netanyahu never misses an opportunity to negotiate peace.
<0x40>Jonathan: Netanyahu does not seek peace because he wants to continue to occupy and colonize (by the way, that was Rabin’s case).
It is obvious that Rabin, Netanyahu and their voters all preferred occupation-colonization to peace.
He took off his clothes, put them on the rock, and went into the water.
An Israeli had stolen them from him.
The Israeli representative stood up in anger and shouted, “What are you talking about?
The Israelis weren’t even there at the time!”
The Palestinian representative (UN) smiled and added: And now that things are clearly established
Israel and the majority of its population have no confidence in the bipolar government of the Palestinian Authority and will not lower their guard.
That this displeases the anti-Israeli is obvious, it is not the goal sought ...
Anti-Zionist: But I answered you, I translate: the global geopolitical report ...
This has been the case ever since the globalization of politics.
Avoidance, avoidance...
In the Israeli-colonialist conflict, for the creation of the Palestinian state, of course, it lasts!
For the creation of Israel you do not answer.
What relationship of force allowed the creation of Israel?
Anti-Zionist: The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is still a forceful relationship today!
Do you doubt it?!!!...
In addition, it’s not just about Russell Brand, but the Guardian reporters seem to have a hard time going beyond anything he doesn’t have to say.
Much of what he says is just pseudo-chomskyst bulletin boards written not others.
This proves that you don’t understand what Russell Brand is saying, or what Noam Chomsky is saying.
It’s just a continuation of personal attacks and insinuations (my 13-year-old daughter likes it, which would mean it’s a matter of immaturity).
A really vicious charge, with just a suspicion of awareness that Russell Brand is telling certain truths, perhaps truths that one prefers not to think about.
Hang on, this feeling is going to be more and more widespread!
I can understand why Brand horrifies some: he sometimes speaks pretentiously and after all the absurdities of the tabloids he actually gives the impression of being a novice populist, but this whole story of not voting has been completely misinterpreted in my opinion.
The general consensus seems to be that it's just saying to people not to vote and rather to cross arms and to ignore the whole political process, but if you look at Paxman's interview and other articles/videos that he posted, it's saying that voting once every 5 years only for Labour or Conservatives (or Lib Dems I suppose) is in politics.
I am not saying that I am necessarily in agreement with his solution (because I really think that being politically active in presenting his demands can go hand in hand with voting, since politicians are giggles who will change their minds if they really risk losing the elections), but it is outrageous to see all of these answers that are condescending because they say that.
His solution is extremely questionable and it would be good if people were debating what he actually says rather than simply labeling him as irresponsible and putting aside the concerns of him and a large amount of people left behind.
Yes, thank you.
The thing about the vote has been completely distorted.
The uselessness of sliding a ballot into a ballot box every five years annoys me deeply because my vote really doesn't count for anything.
I want more referendums, electronic voting, direct democracy, and locally accountable MPs to their voters.
In addition, I challenge the idea that Russell Brand’s words are not his own (written by others).
He is clever enough to have his own words and ideas, even though these are strongly influenced by the kind of anti-establishment thinkers and academics from the counterculture that Suzanne would like to group under the label "pseudo-chomskyst bullies".
I am rather convinced that in a debate he would succeed in convincing Suzanne.
Perhaps that’s what the Guardian could do, that Suzanne do like Polly Toynbee and interview Russell on a veranda, with even the headscarves added to the editing!
Like Max Keiser, who initially attacked Russell but eventually became one of his fans and invited him to his show, it is too easy to attack him without really understanding where he wants to come from.
It draws on a political discourse that has existed for generations, but has been marginalized by traditional media — including the Guardian — for generations.
In my opinion, this “spin” reveals above all that the intellectual debate has not been held for a long time at the RDVs of History where trade historians have become minority and where exchanges of specialists have become impoverished for the benefit of condensed Sciences Po type ready-to-think for press files.
For my part, I had seen in the intellectual attitude of Pierre Bourdieu as well as that of Michel Foucault, a need to deal with a guilty man, an emissary goat.
They develop one and the other of very rational reasoning, but this rationality rests on those emissary goats who are the key to their thinking.
Instead, I believe that for Foucault the state was indispensable as a culprit.
This is a very archaic thought, sacrificial thought, which is also magical thought.
The problem is solved from one relationship to another by eliminating it.
There is an anarchist, neo-lib and / or /libertarian slope (of both terms the second marks a hardening of the desire to eradicate the state, the first knowing how to go to seek state aid for its markets) in the sense of at least state / not state at all at Foucault.
The old dream of the base that organizes itself beautifully.
Her thought is built on the guilt of the state: without this guilt she cannot stand.
Who says guilty, says elimination, murder, sacrifice.
This is not a stand against the three intellectuals cited here.
No support, by the way.
The totalitarian left remembers the good old days, that of its then god, Stalin, the little father of the peoples.
Oulala, you probably read a chouya too quickly if you took Foucault’s texts on the Iranian revolution for an apology from Khomeini.
Today, even Pierre Manent would no longer have fun attacking Michel in this way...
Gauchet poses a deep reflection on the contemporary individual and the collective, on the difficulty that the accession mechanism represents in our advanced liberal societies.
Whether we agree with him or not, he is an original and respectable thinker.
To see this cabal orchestrated by hard-left human scientists who can't stand to pass allegiance to their mantras is quite ridiculous.
The narcissism and authoritarianism of these people is limitless.
An important point to add seems to me to be the stance of these "rebels", which is only intellectual and theoretical.
The treatment of the Chinese and other “yellow” I witnessed in Russia is absolutely incredible.
You didn't have the pleasure of hearing our Australian friends about this then.
And where was it in Russia that a Russian could meet a Chinese and have a personal opinion?
I don't remember the last time I saw a Chinese.
In London and they were kind to me when they learned that I was Russian.
In Russia here - in the 1990s the last time, in a market.
The Chinese think the same way about white people.
My family lives in Australia after coming from Hong Kong and Guangzhou long ago, in the middle of the 20th century, and I still hear some of them saying violently anti-White words.
My father is not happy that his eldest daughter is dating a white man.
I also believe that attitudes have changed in Russia since the 1990s and especially in recent years: they are getting richer, prosperity is spreading outside the big cities, and thanks to this prosperity people travel abroad and see how others live.
From what I have been told, the Russians mostly have prejudices against unskilled temporary workers from the Caucasus and Central Asia, who work in occupations and areas where they are very likely to be exploited by their employers or face high crime and violence.
Although I lived on the banks of the Yenisei River in Siberia.
Unfortunately, I have heard the views of Australians about Chinese and Aboriginal people.
It's really weird that a stranger tells me I can't stand the Chinese, when I've met two of them in my life (including one abroad), I haven't kept any bad memories, all people are worth it and, in fact, those in London have been very kind that's the only reason I remembered they were chino.
Otherwise, you don’t remember who you meet, everyone is worth it, how to remember who was who.
You know what's weird?
That you and the other Russian here spoke of the Chinese as a kind of unique fascination, as if they were an attraction in a zoo.
And yet you always go out with said White.
How many Chinese men are with whites, by comparison?
None, because there is a good chance that the parents of these Whites would physically assault them.
There is no measure of impartiality of justice.
Yet it is the mother of all battles and justice in France remains manipulated by groups strongly marked on the left like the union of the judiciary...
<0x40>Marabout: Sorry, but the courts are frankly branded right.
When in the judiciary syndicate, it represents only 25% of the judges.
If a measure of its bias can be made from the relativity of the application of laws in the courts, it orders the removal of two obstacles.
The political view of the observer as well as that of the factual interpretation of the magistrate.
It remains the mandatory tool of the law to focus the evaluation on the fundamentals.
The measure of its non-compliance in all judicial acts of magistrates, including prosecution, forces to make a distinction between the error and the bias of magistrates.
It would be futile to claim that the acts of justice are not distributed among these three groups.
Pretension and ignorance are not subject to objective analysis.
And if all this is not analyzed, then how can we say that justice is improving in France?
If only by means of statistics that implicitly reveal that it starts from the very bottom.
The preceding preamble makes it possible to include the following in the third ratio.
The corruption* of the judiciary.
Sensitive subject in proportion to the power of nuisance* that is conferred on the judicial institution capable of such heresy.
The domain in question is that of the deprivation* of heirs committed through fraud to the procedure* by successional genealogists mandated by notaries.
This profession receives <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>150 million in good and bad while benefiting from the coverage provided by the French notariat’s quasi-judicial impunity.
In order to understand their mechanism, some of them were reported in the comments following the first publication.
Where this joins the said statistical improvement* moderated by the previous commentary, is that the judicial institution has produced, in many disputes between genealogist and heirs reluctant to be thus plundered, a whole set of jurisprudences contrary to all laws favorable to heirs.
Isn't the presentation of European statistics ignoring such rational criteria an elaborate form of lies?
Absolutely prohibitive prices.
More equipment to scam the disabled.
We can say that, but my brother has one of these all-terrain tricycles, built to measure his size and weight and it really allowed him to enjoy the outdoors like never a normal wheelchair, with bulky wheels and tires, could not.
As they say, tastes and colors...
The Tankchairi looks like what Jeremy Clarkson could invent for a challenge in Top Gear.
The tank chair looks like an epic one.
I think the inventor of the Whill never had to clean a dog's barn on a caterpillar.
I'm sure my sister would love the all-terrain tricycle, but it's just too expensive.
The ultra long distance wheelchair would be perfect for a disabled person with a longboard inclination.
There are hills here that they would like.
The prices actually seem high, but there are really people who put that kind of price on a bike, so “you see.”
The all-terrain tricycle seems particularly useful to me.
However, not all people with disabilities are poor.
Many of them have reasonable amounts of insurance at their disposal.
Only if they have become disabled.
The thing is that the wheelchair market is a niche, so they can afford to practice high prices for things they know we need.
We can't really say that the Whill is minimalist.
This is an example of excessive design.
Unfortunately it is just a sketch, it is not planned to make it.
I'm HAPPY that the "long-distance" wheelchair doesn't arrive on the market, because apparently there's no way to drive this damn thing.
Nearly 20,000 homes were destroyed by the Israeli army in Gaza during intensive bombings of densely populated residential neighborhoods.
Two million human beings have been prisoners of the Israeli blockade of Gaza since 2007 (Israel is the occupying power of Palestinian territory, not Egypt).
Half are children and young people under the age of 18.
Eight-year-olds have lived under Israeli blockade all their lives.
A unique situation in the world, an unacceptable situation, an illegal situation too, since this blockade imposes a “collective punishment” on all Gazan civilians.
“Entrepreneurs working on their projects are diverting a little bit of their cement to the black market.”
Oh, it's not a wooden tongue, rather concrete and armed the lady...
References are there to support an argument or fact.
The anti-Zionist...
The right cement goes into the tunnels!
There's the black market, that's for sure, and it's recognized.
Two million people have been held captive by the Israeli blockade of Gaza since 2007.
A unique situation in the world, an unacceptable situation for anyone who has a heart and a moral sense.
The U.S. has a well-kept territory: Saudi Arabia.
Morsi did not have the time to rule because the dictatorship (supported by who you know) excluded him!
Remember also that after lifting it, Morsi had restored the blockade!!!
And I'm a Westerner, so I approve...
Jonathan. Jonathan.
The blockade is Israeli-Egyptian.
The children of Gaza live on an underground fortress, built in front of the people who chose their masters!
Having a boat is a lot of work, Aleks.
I hope you've thought well.
Couchsurfing is much cooler than Airbnb.
This is the very definition of a non-profit sharing economy.
Many are just looking for a one-night stand on Couchsurfing.
So it’s getting paid (or at least hoping) in another way.
It is always much cheaper than a hotel, if you have to look for the right addresses.
In addition, trusted owners and tenants often stop using Airbnb and deal directly in cash, circumventing Airbnb.
Where is the community in all of this?
“What do you rent on?”
No problem with the verb, what is the problem with your grammar?
The verb “to let” is not used in the United States.
The author simply used an American expression.
It's an international newspaper now, in case you didn't notice.
It would be better to have the right insurance for the boat, make sure it is 100% compliant with all the safety rules and ask those who manage canals and rivers for permission to do business there (which they will certainly refuse). I have a boat and I really tried to see how to rent it...
Have you thought about the fact that boats can be moved, stolen and painted, sunk, etc.?
The penalties are so slow that if someone tried to steal it it would still be close to where you left it.
Or hijacked by pirates...
All these Somali immigrants who come here and attack our penises...
Where are you going to harness it?
Marine Le Pen is wrong.
Populism?
There is no truth other than that which exposes the facts!
Poverty is rising in France.
More than 150,000 young people leave school without training.
The increase of wealth in the hands of the wealthiest is a reality.
Who defends who?
Who's defending what?
In 2017, it will be announced!
Capitalism is not going to get poor.
High finance, he speculates, plays with our companies, with our jobs, with our raw materials, with our purchases, with our food, with our healthcare structures, with our health, with our debts, with our institutions.
They are a threat in our daily lives by the same and by the money they hold.
All this for the benefit of some hyper-mega-obese money.
Until proven otherwise, FH said: "My enemy has no name, my enemy has no face, my enemy is finance".
That was in 2012.
In 2014, he appointed a former Rothschild Bank Minister of Economy, a story of better defending the interests of the banksters, the only ones responsible for the 2007 crisis.
Was there no one else competent?
What do you call it? Turning his jacket back, lowering his pants?
Primary and populist reaction
We don’t really know what Marine Le Pen thinks.
Where'd you see that?
Because the Germans refused to rescue the survivors.
I’m not sure Spee really “refused” to rescue the survivors.
One aspect of this battle is that none of the parties seemed sure of the exact strength of the enemy.
Robert Massie in his book "Castles of Steel" suggests that Spee quickly left the area because he had received a report indicating a British battleship in the area.
The sea was heavier at the beginning of the day; I do not know if it was still at the end of the battle?
Similarly, the fight ended after sunset, making any rescue operation more difficult.
Compare this with the next battle, that of the Malouines, where, on the photos showing the survivors being rescued, one sees a calm sea in the middle of the day.
In addition, the rescuers knew that there were no more German fighters in the area at this point.
Hmm, it doesn't really match what I remember reading about this battle, so I did a quick Wikipedia search:
“There was some confusion among the German ships as to the fate of the two armored cruisers, who had disappeared in the dark after the shooting ceased, and a chase-race began.
Leipzig saw something on fire, but as he approached he saw that it was only a wreck.
The Nuremberg, slower than the other German ships, joined the battle late and saw the Monmouth, tilted and severely damaged but still in motion.
After pointing his headlights at the flag of the ship, the proposal to surrender was rejected and he opened fire, eventually sinking the ship.
Without reliable information, von Spee felt Good Hope had to escape and stopped searching at 10:15 p.m.
Concerned by reports indicating a British battleship in the vicinity, he headed north.
So, if this is true, the Germans, tapping in the dark before the invention of the radar, did not know that a ship had sank, and therefore could not search for survivors.
They also thought there was a larger Royal Navy battleship in the area that could have severely damaged them, so in confusion they derailed to take advantage of their advance.
They were far from their base and Spee was well aware that they should make their way through many Royal Navy ships.
Cradock’s sacrifice had already caused them harm and cost them about half of their ammunition, thus condemning them when they were finally taken.
Several votes have been cast at the UMP to demand that a definitively convicted elected person be enrolled in the law as a result of which he is definitively ineligible.
This is a courageous position, which would also affect the elected members of the left, of course.
But nooon, it's a joke.
FOR THIS IDEA I PROPOSED A INSCRIPTION ON THE WALL OF THE MAGISTRATES
When to ban trade unions in already protected sectors?
How long will this distortion of equality between citizens be tolerated?
Maintained by politicians whose vision of society is limited to these sectors, always quick to soften those themselves who will take advantage of their inevitability to hinder the actions of real politicians, who really try to make things move, not the beautiful speakers whose immobility is to the measure of their sufficiency.
I met them in the subway around noon with their little banners "singles for justice" they came from the province and didn't make the difference between Bercy and the POPB.
It supports the existence of politicized unions whose members put the enormous power they hold in the service of their party.
It would not defend the same theses if right-wing or even far-right unions targeted personalities on its side and waged a legal-media war against them.
Your claims are totally free.
If the right is currently defying the judicial news, it is simply because it has committed the facts that are relevant to it!
There is no example of a left-wing personality who has had so much to do with Justice, but all those who have been the subject of its attention have not been treated favorably.
On the other hand, it must also be remembered that the union of the judiciary, which is on the left, is not the only union of magistrates and is a minority.
That a minister is so committed to supporting unions shows how useful they can be.
<0x40>MCR The union you quote may be a minority among the magistrates, but its influence is great at the Chancellery, it's no secret.
The question now is whether the "mission" of some judges is not more dirty than instructing.
<0x40>gus - You should be satisfied, SM is a minority.
What are you complaining about?
<0x40>Pivoine: You forget that the magistrates are not public servants like the others: they are the only ones who have the power to charge and imprison everyone.
Jade Goody?
What if none of the participants ever came back?
Hello, Katie Waissel.
I believe that even the most glorious asshole realizes that X-Factor can only mean the end of a career, so I would be surprised if someone accepts their offer.
Many have used it as a springboard to start a successful career.
The One Direction fills stadiums around the world.
Others then sold a lot of records or left for West End.
Popstars, the forerunner of all these programs, launched Chreyl Cole, who, in fact, is one of the jurors.
Even ABBA, Olivia Newton-John, Céline Dion, Cliff Richard, all made the Eurovision contest, like so many others.
While others like Frank Sinatra and everything else participated in competitions in the United States.
In the 1970s and 1980s, New Faces and Opportunity Knocks launched most of British television’s light entertainment stars.
Of course, some have fallen into oblivion.
But that’s what happens to most stars who don’t participate in the contest anyway.
Rare are those who, after a tube, manage to make others.
Either way, most singers/groups can at best expect three albums and a best of.
Yeah, but now Cole, or whatever his name is, has fans only in the UK.
His celebrity comes in part from his marriage to a footballer who breathes through his mouth.
Most Americans know who Jeremy Clarkson is.
It can only mean the end of a career.
In fact, it's more likely to lead to a career than the typical rock path, even if in your dreams you think that all the guitar breakers who smoke grass in their father's garage and swing three chords on a primary school level poem will surely become stars and the only question is how much they want to get out before they even get out.
And worse than ridiculous: it establishes a completely artificial distance between the Western public and the peoples studied – a distance that turns rather quickly to racism, because the ethnologists present these distant people to us as infinitely superstitious and petrified of ritualistic bigotry, while most of their ways of doing are strictly non-practical, non-inspired and non-inspired.
Except that you imprudently interpret in the opposite direction.
Or, rather than saying that the drum is devoid of sacred character, is it not better to admit that our Marianne and our Molières do not also have a somewhat sacred character?
Our bias is as reminded to see the sacred as a kind of well-defined and circumscribed object in the religious sphere.
Very interesting article whatever it is.
It is deco ephemeral to furnish the void.
It's all right.
Great article, thank you.
The recent Pantheonization of illustrious figures of the Republic is an illustration that the feeling of sacred is still alive.
Who still believes in the interpretations of archaeologists!
Any other discipline would throw at the urtices not at all scientific interpretations that last the life of a mandarin, rarely less.
When is a comparative criticism of disciplines enough to make you laugh a little?
Because what is valid for archaeology is also valid for the interpretations given by other disciplines.
This would bring a healthy dose of modesty.
Your contempt for archaeologists is completely unjustified!
It is thanks to them that treasures are constantly discovered, valuable testimonies for reconstituting history, understanding societies, and the example here of comparative archaeology is exciting.
This method is not very ancient and earlier archaeologists relied on their “instinct” and knowledge, and could be wrong.
Nowadays we have technical and scientific means so powerful that the interpretation of the excavations is better but can always be questioned by other discoveries!
One is there in full (and old) controversy about the shamanism advanced by the prehistoric Jean Clottes (cf. his book “The shamans of prehistory”, especially the increased re-edition of the scientific controversy, published in the editions La Maison des Roches).
Thank you for this very informative article
Do straight men like anal sex?
For you, Mike, I could do it.
So it's over between us?
I really don't understand why can't we go on to three?
This journal is supposed to be serious, made for adults.
Do you really need to fall into the pit?
No, but we're not against a play on that.
We couldn’t watch a musical about it, on the other hand, it would be too gay!
We could have expected to have that kind of comment from you.
Looks like Mary Whitehouse came back from the dead.
Since your trial offer is almost complete, may I suggest you switch to the Catholic Times.
I'm sure you'll feel more at home.
He prefers Mikedow.
May I suggest that we all look for a newspaper that pays real journalists, brave, to write about the Middle East, Ebola, etc. at their own risk.
Rather than making fun of these kidding ass jokes.
Not very clever.
Go on, then.
If these “baby ass jokes” shock you so much, you don’t have to participate, do you?
Do you also know that this newspaper also covers the Middle East and Ebola and that it is quite possible to do both and publish an article about anal sex?
Is it the subject that shocks you, or the fact that people laugh at it?
However, we find the amateur video of the crash on the net...
Video of the crash on the net...??
If the FOM chose not to show these images, it is only to protect its interests under no circumstances those of the pilot.
If the FOM had wanted to protect the drivers it would have released the safety because at the time or another vehicle (defender for example) entered the circuit.
But we had to finish quickly before the typhoon that we knew was coming, but for which the FOM did not consider it good to advance the time of departure (television right, pub, money...).
Apart from that, they protect the pilots.
I also share this opinion.
But there is also that if the very British FOM lets in the SC, it will allow Nico Rosberg to have at restart a chance to beat the English that led then...
This is my blog, my dear Dayrton.
But it doesn't matter, I have a little time to unravel all your fucking shit.
No, just no.
There have been a lot of conspiracies in F1, but never one that puts commissioners at risk of death for a distant story of possibility of victory from one driver to the detriment of another.
It's not the FOM that puts out the safety car it's the FIA.
Shade of size.
In view of the amateur images, the lack of image especially allows the FIA to avoid the annoying questions of the type: How is it that the Commissioner shakes a green flag in full intervention and continues to do so after the accident (see the full video after the accident)
No, it is not because the video is considered too violent that the FIA blocks the images of the accident, but because one of the commissioners clearly sees a green flag agitated, a sign that the race can resume normally and that one is more under a yellow flag regime.
Some comments show a dark disregard for F1.
Yes dear Etienne, the race is no longer under the yellow flag regime AFTER the place of the accident, hence the green flag stirred.
This is the usual procedure.
The police station just downstream of the accident (depending on the case, it can be 10 meters or 100 meters after the accident) shakes the green to tell the pilots to resume a normal pace.
Sensationalism sells advertising.
I used to think the media was an integral part of the government’s “patriotic” propaganda offensive, but I’m afraid it’s just for the money.
And sex, let’s not forget sex, the fear of not having a sex life, advertising and the media are good at selling us things that are supposed to improve our sex lives.
The news is doing exactly the same thing.
To buzz with information that we really don’t need to worry about is just to keep scaring people so we can keep controlling them.
“When the tabloids cough about Ebola, we all catch the fear” It should be ‘derail’, not ‘cough’.
Given the medical reference, “coughing” is much better said in this context than “derailing”.
I wonder if all the people who are upset that Ebola could start spreading by air realize that they now believe in evolution?
You're doing them too much honor.
They probably think that this is the end of the world and that Ebola is just one of the signs of the approaching apocalypse.
Ebola is the Antichrist.
You're confusing Ebola and Murdoch...
Great article, thank you!
A short and concise article that beautifully and firmly ridicules this abject pseudo-journalism.
It made me laugh. It made me laugh.
It depresses me that the media is talking about most things with this optimism upside down.
The goal is once again to keep us frightened and anxious enough (without reaching the hysteria) so that the government can get us off the ground when it needs it.
I think it makes perfect sense that if we have to go through a budgetary emergency in the absence of any crisis, a terrorist emergency in the absence of any attack, why not have an Ebola crisis in the absence of any proven case?
It seems that this government is trying to save us from crises that it has invented itself.
Isn’t there something fundamentally problematic about the idea of governing by fear?
Congratulations on this post, and to still be from this world almost 35 years later.
In the beginning, it must have been awful, given the context of the 1980s and 1990s.
I am bluffing, living with the certainty of spending years there .....
Absolutely useless testimony.
As always when we talk about science.
Not only are the testimonies useless: taken in isolation, they cannot serve as scientific material.
But they have a detrimental influence on the objective assessment of the facts.
<0x40>trafic: Testimonials cannot be used as scientific material.
Perhaps that is why we refrain from asking questions to patients in psychiatry when we have reliable observations from relatives.
My psychiatric record mentions that my psychiatrist mother explains that I was telepathically educated by her mother-in-law.
This is therefore an objective symptom.
When I say it's bullshit, it's a subjective testimony that doesn't matter.
Ah, because the attestation of a fact (= here this testimony, which attests to the contamination and effectiveness of the new treatments) is of no use in a scientific approach?
What do you base your research on, then?
About ghosts?
Do you put fantasy theories and facts at the same level (= giving rise to verifiable testimonies)?
"Resilience": the sloppy word used by grandmothers, fans of J-L Delarue, who take themselves for great psychologists after reading D'Ansembourg.
<0x40>Jim: There are a lot of meaningless buzzwords in psychics.
Cyrulnik gave us the blow of “resilience”.
Since he is a great scientist, Cyrulnik, I hope he has given us a reliable scale of measurement to quantify this famous resilience.
I wonder if the Air Sentinels could save us all from Farage and company??
Does that make you think of Team America?
Seriously, it's *not* a good idea to get the Sentinels out of the air...
So why?
It was a great series and it looks like those who come out of it are aware of it!
Let us leave our salvation to the Almighty who can do miracles.
But how are they going to make the kids hang out?
The only solution that comes to mind is the pipi-caca kind of humor, which would kill the series.
It was already a children's series.
The children were hanging.
Oh, because it's a children's series?
UKIP is working for the Mysterons.
So keep your Team America.
Still in Supermarionation?
It will not be the same if you do not see the sons and the animation is well done. :-)
I look forward to seeing this (although being an adult), but I hope it will give the idea to a channel to recast the old ones.
The series has almost never stopped airing here in Australia; it’s been at least 40 years since we have one-hour episodes on Saturdays and Sundays at 6:00 a.m.
Since the arrival of free digital television a few years ago, it is on one of the second-order commercial channels and you can still see it at these times.
And in addition, the half-hour episodes now run at 5:30 a.m., from Monday to Friday!
Okay, I'm probably a "sad" 60-year-old guy, but I don't watch this show every day!
There is no "Mount of the Temple" in or under the mosque of the esplanades!!!
Radical Zionists invented this to give themselves political legitimacy to colonize Jerusalem.
In fact, all the Israeli excavations below and around the esplanade mosque for several decades have not allowed anything to be found.
The Temple Mount, if it exists, is elsewhere.
Could it be in Argentina?
This mountain is not sought for the simple reason that it is the hill on which the esplanade of the mosques was built.
Its summit, or dome of the Rock, stands out in the middle of the Omar Mosque.
For Muslims, Muhammad ascended to paradise from this rock.
For the Jews, it is Mount Moriah where Abraham almost sacrificed his son Isaac.
Since it was taken and contextualized, there is no propaganda, but information, dear K1K1.
Israel also has its extremists, it is good to remind it regularly, and they are unfortunately relayed to the government (Naftali Bennett, Avigdor Liebermann, and even Netanyahu, the latter had accepted the two-state plan, and overturned it continuously!).
It is also good to show how the annexation of Jerusalem is not a peaceful fact.
Will God be able to recognize His people?
The shortest Jewish joke: “Praise be to God!”
To brag about tourism in Israel, we are often shown na<0xC3><0xAF>ve young people half-naked, drowned on the beach.
The reality is, as usual, very different from what advertising shows us, as can be seen in the photo that illustrates the article.
It's a little scary anyway.
And this photo is a wonderful piece of propaganda!
It is a pity that the Reuters photographer did not photograph the hundreds of Palestinians allowed to return to the Temple Mount and who prefer to slap the faithful Jews downstairs, praying to the Wall of Lamentations.
<0x40>Mat, If this photo bothers you, it's rightly not the newspaper or the photographer, but this woman and the ideology she conveys that it must be condemned.
This system is not sustainable and will end in tears.
The only way to end this system is the revolution.
Since the economy seems to be falling apart, large companies have benefited enormously from their employees.
They have succeeded in convincing their employees that they are fortunate to have a job and that they cannot afford to increase wages, while at the same time and without hiding, they have given ever greater wages to the small elite at the top.
You are right, it is not sustainable, but it will change in this country only when workers really speak with one voice.
Instead of grumbling and wailing when someone else is on strike, support them, show a little solidarity and understand that their strike is not only about their problems, but also shows your employer that you don't screw people up with impunity.
Unless democracy is abandoned, in which case it is sustainable.
I totally agree with you.
The only thing you have forgotten is that British and American companies have sold our industry and now our services to countries where social and environmental conditions are the worst.
For example, China and India.
All this cannot end well.
It is because we are in democracy that this has happened.
Did you vote for the PTCI?
The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) aims to increase the profits of corporations held by these people in short-circuiting national governments by secret courts.
It sounds incredible, but that’s exactly what the Investor-State Dispute Settlement Mechanism (ISDS) proposed by the agreement is for.
The Greens are against this project and are trying to warn people about the unimaginable damage this deal will have on our lives.
It's only recently that we start talking about it in the media: Independent Guardian World Development Movement So look at these links and you'll understand what's being negotiated in your back.
Didn't Churchill say "blood, sweat and tears"?
That’s what makes great returns, while digital money has no reason to fall, let alone grow on trees.
The next weak link will probably be the automotive market.
This gentleman is right, in the eighteenth century there were unions in all regiments.
In the very Catholic French army, there is a sacrificial dimension.
Let him (finally, his officers, the others, no one knows anything) believe himself the safe of France’s eternal values, and she will fight and shut her mouth.
And then with the decline of the country, globalization, Europe, the crisis of values, in short: the dissolution of the idea of Nation, having this little relic, is comforting.
Even if for her, it's getting more and more uncomfortable...
You still miss the union of married men, single women, married women, single men, lost dogs and I don't know what else.
If you don't write French correctly, I sign up.
You are warned, it will be your fault.
Protected trade union professions are already suffering enough for the defense of categorical interests, which has created a break in equality with other citizens.
Please do not laugh at the fear of risk on the part of a grievor.
One can very well imagine a system that ensures a certain freedom of expression without trade unions, or without the right to strike as in Germany, in return for the protection they enjoy.
Otherwise, it's a disaster.
And with the wagons getting ready, the government welcomes it.
What security are you talking about?
Ignorance indeed...
Ignorance for ignorance Sybille I was referring to the military and other civil servants, since this is the topic here commented...
Delete "through its delegates" in Article 8 of the Preamble to the 1946 Constitution.
It will become: "8.
Every worker participates in the collective determination of working conditions and in the management of enterprises."
This is absolutely necessary with the intrusion of information power.
And yet you opened, probably read and commented on an article specifically titled “The Great British Bake Off review”.
Wait, the section was there, completely empty.
I thought we should start the conversation.
Anyway, this is Joffrey's wedding I watched, and I can tell you that some have been well seasoned.
In the episode of Joffrey's wedding we have one of the best moments (although misleading: it was wine) in the history of television.
Also, from the tart mmm...
Game of Thrones!
I love GBBO!
This is the second time in a row that, oddly enough, the show ends with a victory of the least bad baker; no one has ever done "boom, here's my fucking cake now eat it and bow down to your master!"
Perhaps the extra pressure from friends and relatives outside has finally had an effect on them?
In the previous weeks, all these outsiders were kept away.
And there’s also the idea of “playing security, there’s always next week” that disappears last week.
I like to cook, but I don’t think I can do that.
I am grateful to those who do it and thus offer us great entertainment and pushes us to try new things.
Forward to GBBO 2015!
I agree, the last challenge last year, the wedding cake, was absurd.
Professionals usually take days to make them and they had to DIY one in 3-4 hours.
The three challenges were really hard to deal with, I don’t know how they were able to choose a winner.
With Luis, the only real flaw they could find was the base a bit dry (although I agree with Hollywood to say that the green glazing on Richard's mill didn't make sense, anyway Richard had already lost at that time).
I have to admit that several challenges in this series seem a bit artificial because of the time spent.
There is also the cancer that is waiting, with the solar winds.
Definitely, everything is going well for us right now.
It's a bad time for humanity, I hope.
You confuse solar wind and ultraviolet rays.
UVs are mainly blocked by the ozone layer, which is formed precisely by the impact of residual solar wind particles and UVs.
So even if the magnetic field were weakening, there wouldn't be enough solar wind to "chase" the ozone out of the stratosphere.
There would be even more, and therefore less, UV and “cancer”.
Fortunately, the ozone layer does not block UV.
They have a lot of useful features that you don’t suspect.
If we limit ourselves to man they have the interest of allowing us to have bones (vitamin D synthesis), to warm us (less than infrared), to modulate our immune system and, it seems, to improve our morale.
The ozone layer blocks cancer-causing UVCs and releases UVA and most UVBs.
Do you know that you are not obliged to be condescending and to consider your interlocutor as a remainder when posting a comment?
Especially for a minor precision that was implied in the commentary, which itself intends to demonstrate pedagogy.
Not to mention that I am used to melanoma, UV only accelerates its development.
They do not provoke it.
Proof: Not all tanned people necessarily have melanomas.
So, when a tuubib tells you to avoid the sun and live in the bottom of a cellar, it is better not to listen because UVs are necessary for any human.
The excess, on the other hand, is like everything: it kills.
But for other reasons.
UV directly causes melanoma.
Can we fold it?
And more importantly, can we pass it on to the mixer?
or pass it to the mixer...
I believe that the majority of those interested in it have established that everything can be folded if sufficient strength is applied to it and the robustness of the iPhone 6 is perfectly acceptable, for the use for which it is intended.
I think the military would need something more resilient and therefore has not yet adopted the iPhone6 as a front-line communication hardware.
But for the rest of us,
It's still a good choice.
The majority of those who are interested in it have established that anything can be folded if sufficient force is applied to it.
Except for a Nokia 3310.
Specifically, is it already folded?
This is a joke in every discussion.
I decided to count them.
This is the fourth folding joke I read in the comments today.
It is difficult to understand how a prototype can be distributed like this.
Before installing specific software, one imagines that the phone has been removed from the main production line and it is hard to see how it could return there.
Well so far so good, knock on wood. . .
Most likely, it is a production unit on which the iOS has not been installed correctly and which is therefore stuck with the factory test code installed.
I don’t know how they do these things.
But, would they put testing software on everyone?
The photographs on Ebay clearly show the absence of FCC or CE logo and the presence of a red prototype connector.
This article is for bobo par excellence.
We want cheap products and we are surprised that the industrials produce in "industrial" We put super u but all the brands and meme the small commerce are concerned How to eat good, organic avac 1650<0xE2><0x82><0xAC> (average wage in France)?
But to answer your post, if it is possible to eat properly with a small salary.
After all, everyone is free to put their priorities where they want them to be.
For me, food is one of them.
Go without resentment, I'll kiss you
Bobos are people who see the world through an ideological “software” that leads them to disconnect from reality.
It is the total degrouping of reason-thought.
They are experts in gesticulation, for example claiming to save the planet because they have avoided taking a shower.
They are also experts in tartuffery, joining the left-caviar, from which they sometimes come, for example, by condemning CO2 emissions while spending their holidays in the Maldives.
The vast majority of our fellow citizens do not tolerate this mixture of heavy ideology and tartuffery so do not be surprised to encounter frequent criticisms about them.
Wow, thanks for this complete and exhaustive theorization as well as for all the associated details (plane, shower...).
I'd like to be a part of it, but I don't get it.
The concept is not so complicated.
The boboecoles are monobloc.
Do you understand the concept of left caviar?
Well, you are able to understand the concept of boboécolo.
It is the perfect copy with just an ideological nuance.
The classification would be more complicated if we were interested in the environment.
The boboécolo is part of it but only represents the most visible fringe of the environments because it is the one that infests the media.
This is a beautiful giraffe.
Apparently, no one wants to look at this giraffe in the face.
It is so badly made that it looks vaguely like a female nude.
Shut up, you're next to the plate.
One must be part of the microcosm of art to understand the astonishing beauty of truth in this work.
But you simply have no legitimacy to comment since you haven’t spent countless decades studying and flattering great artists.
The important thing is not the fact that Emin does not know how to draw and always seems obsessed with the same subject.
The important thing is that she really managed to become fabulously rich and famous by having no artistic ability.
That's art, that's art.
No, it's a pig.
The fact that Emin does not know how to draw
This is not really a proven fact.
It is rather an opinion.
Unless the only thing you can enjoy are realistic reproductions of dogs that smoke while playing billiards.
Judging art can be problematic, but not in this case.
Drawing is more than just representing the real thing.
If you’re just looking for that, a camera will do the trick.
The author also talks about Emin's expressionism.
Look again and let the image speak for itself, without comparing it to the kind of drawing you might prefer.
If it's so easy, why don't you do it yourself?
There is still a lot to save: riding activities, the number of Republican guard horses or the status of generals who are no longer in active service.
Honesty obliges to say that France is decreasing its numbers, but as all countries, sometimes even more drastically, have done, to begin with Britain.
It's only half encouraging...
Operational without support, it quickly finds its limits!
A singular approach, at a time when we are observing the weaknesses, the inadequacies of our defence tool, especially in the Sahel.
A bad blow for the local authorities concerned, who are losing a dimension of their activities, or even part of their history.
Where is the promised sanctification?
<0x40>edmond: that's what I was saying, look elsewhere where to make savings but especially not at home, at home it's really not possible...
This is exactly what you propose to do, look elsewhere where gabegie is certain.
Let all those who have sided little or nothing with the military thing dare to come here and say, eyes in the eyes that there is no money wasted in this perimeter and this without burst of laughter...
That we apply the same potion to the whole of the public service and the public finances will go a little better.
And for Josi: really loud: look at the inflation of public jobs in the other ministries and you will understand why La Défense can be a bit burdened!
Well, yes, the savings on which everyone agrees to say that they must be done, although it must be seen somewhere, right?
Lack of pot, those on whom it falls groan at murder when it happens at home, the poor dear ones.
It should be done, but most importantly, it does not fall on me because, in this case, it is a crime and not an economy.
Guignols, go!
How will closing the Grace Valley weaken our defense tool in the Sahel?
As for local authorities, history repeats itself with every closure of posts, maternity wards, hospitals, barracks.
Everyone is in favor of savings, of course.
It's weird, a UMP mayor who wants compensation and is not happy with the savings made in public spending.
This article is really the most stunning thing I have ever read!
This embarrassing moment when the first three people who comment are doing the same bad joke.
It’s depressing to scroll through her Facebook thread and see that 80% of her friends started their statuses with the phrase “this embarrassing moment.”
I think they're going to make a movie of it.
It will probably be based on hilarious scenes where someone accidentally falls on his ex on the bus going to work and only realizes there that his skirt has gone back into his panties.
It's not embarrassing, it's completely stupid.
Not really, in my opinion, the author takes on the role of the typical British man who has always been taught to bury his emotions and clench his teeth.
I’m sure if you’re a fan of Kate Bush, the announcement of her return to the stage after 25 years of absence has been something strong.
Do you realize that your comment is now at the heart of a battle to find out who will have the rights?
I don’t have the “internet.”
I do not think I can comment.
Not having a computer.
Oh, my God, I need to see this movie before I die!
I can't believe how much this article is the most amazing thing I've ever read!
Charlie has just really shown that he is at the top of the cosmic universe, which is satirical journalism!
I'm falling in the opposite direction!
It is absolutely necessary that I share with all my friends on Facebook and Twitter so that they finally have the enlightenment and discover the incredible brightness and unsurpassed genius that springs from Mr. Brooker’s keyboard like a divine glow.
Oh, my God, it was really nothing.
Especially if they are not women or transvestites.
I'm a parasite.
This shows a positive development within democracies: the rise of effective regional policies and associative initiatives.
Until further notice, we are confiscating the right to save our planet by states that play truffles at every meeting to save the planet.
Therefore, we citizens decide to take matters into our own hands.
With the commissioner they planted in energy, all these beautiful recommendations flew away ....
Translate: Windmills and solar farms are the Round Points of Tomorrow.
All funded by the taxpayer.
Please stop this pro-nuclear talk.
Pollution is not limited to CO2.
Radioactivity is much more harmful in terms of its waste and in the event of an accident.
As long as the industry is not fully mastered, it is better to limit it to laboratories.
Renewable energies are our only salvation, provided, of course, that our consumption is drastically reduced.
Electricity through renewables to combat CO2 emissions?
France is not concerned at all.
Nuclear electricity is zero CO2 emissions to production and epsilon for the other stages.
The electricity from renewable wind or PV is already more GHG on the other stages and especially gas, or worse than coal as in Germany, to compensate for intermittentity.
Replacing nuclear with renewable wind or PV would go against the fight against CO2.
Christial I don't insult you I'm State Doctor of Physical Sciences 1981 plus I've done research in nuclear physics I challenge you to prove otherwise of what I said.
For what I did not say it is you who lend me ideas I did not say anything about Germany nothing in fact you did not respond to what I said and like all right-wing people to demolish the interlocutor I never do.
I also quote the conclusion of experts mandated by the German Government: Germany's current renewable energy programme is an unprofitable and inefficient way to reduce GHG emissions and should be stopped.
0 emissions if you do not count the extraction of uranium and construction and if you do not count the greenhouse gas water vapour of less effect than the Co2 it is true recall two thirds of the energy produced by a nuclear power plant shares in water vapour and a little in river water.
I stopped reading when you talked about Pakistan as a “Giant of South Asia”...!!
Last time, Pakistan won against Hindustan.
I am not surprised, most Indians who post comments only want to read and comment on articles against Pakistan.
By the way, it shows your state of mind.
It would have been the same if they had called India the giant of South Asia...
I have nothing against the fact that some Pakistani players participate, but having a Pakistani version would be unacceptable.
It would simply open a box of Pandora full of corruption and mafiosi.
As for the ISL, today's opening match was surprisingly interesting, with Athletico de Kolkata imposing 3-0 against Mumbai.
Pakistan still has a long way to go.
Compared to the billions and billions that India devotes to IPL cricket and now football, how could we one day compete with our “noisy neighbors”...
The low-cost launcher race pays cash.
Too bad for such a beautiful project.
For the incident, the possible design defect is only manifested with too cold helium.
So perhaps we are not in a design defect, but in implementation...
unlike arianspace which is a private company, it seems well that soyuz belongs to the Russian state...
And if the rule is the same as here the state is its own insurer..
Maybe they'll pay for satellites in frigates who knows.
This is all the more annoying as many media outlets are looping back the titles of articles alone – and many readers are holding back only those titles.
Overall, this creates an erroneous impression contrary to the content of the article itself.
Totally agree with you, the title is not appropriate, it unfairly challenges the project while it is only a launcher problem.
