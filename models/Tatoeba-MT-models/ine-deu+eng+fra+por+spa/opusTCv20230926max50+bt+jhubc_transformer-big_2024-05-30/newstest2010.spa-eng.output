Barack Obama will be the fourth U.S. President to receive the Nobel Peace Prize
U.S. President Barack Obama will arrive in Oslo, Norway to spend 26 hours and receive the Nobel Peace Prize, as the fourth U.S. president in history.
The diploma, medal and cheque of $1.4 million will be awarded, among other things, for the exceptional effort in strengthening world diplomacy and cooperation among nations.
The head of the White House and his wife Michelle will arrive at the Norwegian metropolis in the morning and will have a lot to do.
First, a visit to the Nobel Institute, where he will meet for the first time with the five members of the committee that, in October, elected him among 172 people and 33 organizations.
Afterwards, the presidential couple has scheduled a meeting with the King of Norway, Harald V, and Queen Sonia.
In the afternoon, the visit will culminate with a ceremony in which Obama will receive the prestigious award.
He will be the fourth U.S. president to receive it, though the third to receive it in his office.
The White House has already announced that, upon receiving the award, it will talk about the Afghan war.
The President does not want to avoid this issue, knowing that he is receiving the award as president of a country that is currently at war in two countries.
His war efforts increased even more with the sending of additional troops to Afghanistan, which does not forget to mention any of his critics.
At the ceremony, Obama will also receive the gold medal, diploma and check of ten million Swedish kronor (approximately 24 million Czech kronor).
It is proposed to donate them to charitable paraffins, but it has not yet decided to which organization in particular.
During his full program, the President and his wife will participate in a banquet attended by the Norwegian kings, the Prime Minister and 250 other guests.
Obama from the beginning had a rather reserved attitude towards the prize.
He mentioned, for example, having the feeling of not deserving it at all.
He also repeated several times that the prize is not only for him, but for all those who fight for the same values as him.
Immediately after the announcement he mentioned that it represents “a challenge to take action.”
Defender of nature accused of blackmail
The police of Litom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice accused the president of the civic association Spole<0xC4><0x8D>nost ochranc<0xC5><0xAF> narody Litom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice (Society of nature defenders of Litom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice) of blackmail.
Last year he appealed several times against some construction licensing procedures and to withdraw the appeals he demanded investors money for his own benefit, Litom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice police spokeswoman Alena Romová said.
The president of the Litom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice Nature Defenders Society is Lubomír Studni<0xC4><0x8D>ka.
He is currently in detention and faces a sentence of up to three years in prison.
Brno doesn’t like containers too much to separate the trash
In Prague, citizens can separate beverage packaging and in the villages of southern Moravia can be found containers to separate garbage everywhere.
And in Brno?
It takes several minutes to find the respective containers.
I do not want to say that in Brno the garbage is not separated at all.
It seems to me that, in order to be the second largest city in the Republic, the municipalities are not interested enough in this problem.
Brno is totally behind in the separation of waste, not only because we citizens can only use containers to separate paper, glass and plastic, but above all because of the number of containers for such waste.
Have you ever tried, for example, to throw a PET bottle into the right container in the center?
It is almost impossible, especially it takes a lot of time and patience.
The only place I have found so far is in Moravské nám<0xC4><0x9B>stí square, opposite Potrefená Huse.
Don't get mad at me, Mr. Onderka and his colleagues, but that seems too little to me.
Needless to say, it is not easy to separate the garbage elsewhere either.
That's why many of my friends prefer not to separate her.
by Vaganza
The thing is, the containers are far away.
I'm not surprised.
I offered myself, after a party, to throw away several bottles of glass and plastic.
But on Kaunicova Street I didn't see any red containers nearby.
Fortunately, going to the tram I found the right place.
However, the trash was already filling the container.
It’s still the center of Brno, the most representative part of the city, isn’t it?!
What happens is that ecology and aesthetics do not seem to interest the Brno socialists too much.
They prefer to buy the city the hockey extraliga, which embarrasses us throughout the republic, and not to buy more containers or offer the separation of other materials so that Brno is cleaner.
I am glad to be able to compare my hypothesis, after browsing the Internet a little, with the official statistics.
According to the EKO-KOM company, Brno is indeed the worst of the entire South Moravian region.
The budget of "Paroubek" removed money from income and sickness allowances
After the left, despite the government’s opinion, added funds for farmers or officials, there may not be enough money in the budget for income, sickness allowances, or construction savings.
But neither for the interests of state debt or international litigation.
This will hurt all those who rule in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and Communists imposed the increase on some groups, they were confident that the government would subsequently apply for a loan for sensitive expenses, income or sickness allowances. "That only postpones the problems for the future, is laying mines," says Janota.
What happens is that when you borrow money, you have to pay higher and higher interest, and someday you have to return the money.
The state does not have many options to get money.
If you do not reduce the social benefits or operating expenses of the state, you have to increase taxes.
To all who the left added now: firefighters, teachers, farmers.
And, later, their children too.
People do not have to worry about income or sickness allowances, they will receive them. Of these accounts disappeared 1.8 billion.
But the price to pay will be the increase in public debt; next year not only 163 billion will be missing in the treasury, but more.
Despite Minister Janota’s efforts, the debt will continue to rise alongside interest expenses.
The state will need money to cover them and will no longer come up with a slight increase in VAT or a reduction in maternity allowances, as the government did in its deficit package.
Due to displacements of money to the benefit of some groups of voters, next year there will also be a shortage of five billion to complete the construction of highways and railways.
These are, above all, the sectors where the tender has already been held and where the construction process has already begun, whose projects cannot be changed and their prices cannot be reduced.
The best that can be done is to preserve them, which is also not free.
That means delay or cessation of the thirty major constructions; the possibility of obtaining European funds is also at risk, warns Transport Ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka.
<0xC4><0x8C>SSD proposed a Solomonic solution for the reduction of funds: it will get money from the dividends of <0xC4><0x8C>EZ, which is mostly owned by the state, and will add the transport fund.
The problem is that the value of the dividend is never safe nor is it a bottomless bag.
Last year, <0xC4><0x8C>EZ spent $18 billion on the budget.
Each year the dividends are liquidated ecological damage, serve to complete the account for the income or serve as a reserve for the prepared reform of the income.
In addition, this trick, according to EU rules, increases the real budget deficit to the level of 5.7% of GDP.
The carnival of money transfers doesn’t end here.
Nearly three billion were obtained from the budget to grant various compensations to victims of communism and crime, or for litigation expenses, even in construction savings.
It is unclear whether the state will need such funds.
It's a lottery.
If we lose any international litigation, we may have to pay for it, says Janota.
Then, the Minister will have to save money inside the spring or, in the worst case, use the government budget reserve.
There are also a hundred million left for the statní pokladna (State Box) project, which is priced at two billion and which has already been launched. It should allow you to monitor online what the various authorities are spending on.
The first stage starts in January.
If the finance minister does not find the money elsewhere, the project will have to stop and sanctions will come, warns Janota.
Your future smartphone will be able to work with two operating systems
Americans will have a mobile phone in which the user can, by pressing a key, switch between several operating systems.
The plans revealed sound promising.
With just pressing a key, they pass in seconds from Windows Mobile to Android.
Precisely this possibility is the goal of the American company VMware, which focuses mainly on the development of virtualization software for computers.
On your mobile, you can carry two user profiles at the same time.
They can change between them and divide them between home and work.
The two operate at the same time, said Srinivas Krishnamurti of VMware in an interview with Computerworld magazine.
It was introduced in November last year and was demonstrated for the first time several days ago.
It will be released in 2012.
The virtualization of smartphones is no longer a fiction.
VMware has already successfully demonstrated to journalists how the smartphone works with two operating systems.
It was the Nokia N800, modified with a 128 MB RAM, where the mentioned systems, Windows Mobile and Android, work at the same time.
The development of new technology for mobile phones is at its apogee.
VMware is partnering with European and U.S. carriers to test smartphone virtualization and these phones will reach customers in 2012.
Lack of snow in the mountains worries hoteliers
It is not only the ski-managers in Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e who are concerned about snow-free slopes.
The lack of snow makes people not book ski stays in hotels and guesthouses.
Therefore, in Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e you can still get free rooms for all winter dates, including for Christmas and New Year's Eve.
We have a lot of visitors on our pages.
People look at the deals, check the prices, but are still afraid to book with commitment.
And if they call us, they immediately ask about our opinion, whether this Christmas there will be snow or mud," said Martin Jandura, the keeper of the Spindl.Info news portal.
Those who want to spend a New Year's Eve in <0xC5><0xA0>pindler<0xC5><0xAF>v Ml<0xC3><0xBD>n according to their expectations, should not hesitate to book the stay.
Those who prefer to save money and put the quality of accommodation second, can try to wait a few more days.
The hoteliers of <0xC5><0xA0>pindler<0xC5><0xAF>v Ml<0xC3><0xBD>n mainly offer weekly stays for New Year's Eve.
I think they will continue to offer them, but soon they will give in and offer shorter stays.
And then the free rooms will sell quickly, Jandura estimated.
Ingotours, a travel agency from Vrchlabí, continues to offer free beds for all winter dates.
Now what interests us most is the Christmas week, which is not yet complete.
Half of the seats offered remain vacant.
That’s why we’ve already prepared some last-minute Christmas breaks,” said Ingtours director Petr Schiefert.
The Vrchlabí travel agency can still offer New Year’s Eve in Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e, but there are fewer vacancies.
They sell very well also the first fourteen days of February, the remaining winter dates are sold regularly.
This year the interest in winter stays is undermined by the lack of snow in Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e.
People are waiting to see if there will be snow.
No one wants to spend the end of the year in the mountains without snow.
If the tracks stay snowy during the week, the Christmas dates will run out too," says Schiefert.
On the contrary, it is a little easier to occupy the rooms at the Hotel Horizont in Pec pod Sn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE>kou; last year was more difficult.
We're about five percent better.
For New Year’s Eve and Christmas, we have the last available seats.
Interest increases during the Polish holidays in January and February also sells well," said the director of the best hotel in Pec, Karel Rada.
Eighty percent of New Year’s Eve stays are already occupied at the Omnia hotel, near the central car park in Janské Lázn<0xC4><0x9B>.
On the contrary, in the newest hotel in Janské Lázn<0xC4><0x9B> at Christmas half of the beds are still free.
This January was a big surprise for us, as we find ourselves at about sixty percent of the occupancy capacity.
February has been a little weaker, but as soon as snow falls, interest in stays in Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e will surely increase, said Erik Sporysch, the director of the Omnia hotel.
However, for the moment it seems that the hoteliers of Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e will spend the cravings for snow waiting.
On Thursday temperatures should fall and, if there is rain, in the mountains should snow.
But then temperatures will rise again, Ji<0xC5><0x99>í Jakubsk<0xC3><0xBD> of Hradec Králové, of the Hydrometeorological Institute of the Czech Republic, reported.
USA: Repetition is the Mother of Wisdom
It is funny that Barack Obama, the president with the reputation of the smartest man, as a diligent student repeats in the Afghan question the strategy of his predecessor, whom he himself took for the dumbest.
When he finally revealed his eagerly awaited Afghan approach, it was shown to be a copy of the script used for Iraq by Bush, created three years ago.
Not only does the same text use the phrase “equal to Iraq” several times, but he also did not hesitate to use the title of Bush’s January 2007 statement for his own statement: “A new path forward.”
He himself, who three years ago criticized Bush’s idea of sending new military reinforcements to Iraq, the country that is suffering from the civil war, and that criticized him as “an irresponsible decision with catastrophic consequences.”
The following months, however, demonstrated that Bush’s strategy, based on the recommendations of field captains, was the only possible and successful one, so much so that nothing about Iraq is talked about today in the news.
Bush's reputation did not improve, but objectively left his successor a much more favorable initial situation than could be expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama expects the miracle to happen again.
The field captains again asked him to increase the military contingent, especially the commander-in-chief of the Afghan operation General Stanley McCristal, who, despite traditional subordinate relations, subjected the undecided rifles in the White House to harsh criticism.
He called for 40,000 men to improve the situation.
The president hesitated for three months, but he didn’t think of anything better, so at least he tricked the general about 10,000 military.
He managed to get Europe to promise him another 5,000, although he himself previously had at least 10,000.
The most problematic thing in Obama’s entire strategy seems to be his goal, to start withdrawing troops from Afghanistan in 18 months and finish this procedure in three years.The whole Obama doctrine generated more questions than the answers he offered.
Many doubt that the increase will bear the same fruit as the procedure in Iraq.
Despite the fratricidal wars in recent years, Iraq’s society is relatively well organized, its leaders respect the agreements.
The situation in Afghanistan is different: no one can be trusted and no agreement is fulfilled.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare Afghan security forces, if they are accustomed to changing the head every day according to their needs.
The political institutions, although formally established, will remain only a Potemkin people, after which patriarchal tribal relations will remain.
Balancing the interests of different ethnic groups is extraordinarily complicated due to the confusing relations, even more complicated by Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Not even establishing a state that is "capable of action", a minimum goal of the whole operation, seems very real.
The horizon of Obama’s strategy shocks at his voluntarism.
Over the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has continued to deteriorate and is now about to explode.
Only a romantic soul, who knows nothing of reality, can believe that the military sent to war to "go home soon" will do some miracle here.
From a political point of view, setting the date of the withdrawal of troops is sheer irresponsibility, as the Taliban will regard it as an indirect statement of American defeat.
The latest NATO summit showed that Europeans are less and less willing to participate in military operations in Afghanistan.
European politicians do not know, nor do they want to explain to their voters, what the security of Germany or Italy has to do with the war with the Hindu Kush.
The other factor, capable of radically affecting the situation, is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to worsen and the increased sanctions have no effect on the Iranians, the US will have to make a difficult decision: try to solve the problem by military force or not.
It will be necessary to seek answers precisely when, according to Obama, America begins the triumphant withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan.
However, any such solution will mean a dramatic setback for the Afghan situation.
The only positive point for Barack Obama is the fact that there are three years left for the presidential election and therefore there is still a long time to find another strategy, if this is a total failure.
Goldman Sachs executives will not receive cash bonuses again
US bank Goldman Sachs executives will not receive cash bonuses this year.
The entity announced it to react to the harsh criticism of its wage practices.
The group of 30 senior executives will receive, instead of money, shares that cannot be sold within a minimum of five years.
In addition, the shares may be withdrawn if they have assumed excessive risks.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs thus became the leader in the effort to combine bonuses on Wall Street with long-term power.
I guess Wall Street is fully aware of the longest path it must take, said former JPMorgan investor banker Douglas Elliott.
The problem is in the details, he added.
Bank Goldman Sachs faced criticism after spending nearly $17 billion (nearly CZK 300 billion) on bonuses in the first three quarters of this year.
The total amount of bonuses in the entity for this year, according to the agency Reuters, is likely to exceed, despite the measure announced today, $ 20 billion.
High bonuses in the banking sector became, with the arrival of the financial crisis, a delicate issue in politics.
Britain announced on Wednesday that it plans to one-time tax, with a tax of fifty percent, on bonuses for bankers exceeding <0xC2><0xA3>25,000 (approximately CZK 712,000).
France is also preparing similar measures.
This year, women received the Nobel Prizes in all categories except Physics.
Five women, which is a record figure, received today in Stockholm from King Charles XVI Gustav of Sweden the Nobel Prizes this year, in specialized categories and in literature.
In addition to the four scientists, among the winners was also a German writer of Romanian origin, Herta Müller.
The Nobel Prize in Medicine was awarded to two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, as well as her compatriot Jack Szostak for research in the field of chromosomes.
The Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to Israeli Ada Jonath and Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishna and Thomas Steitz for explaining the structure and function of ribosomes.
The latest prize, the Nobel Prize in Economics, was given to American Elinor Ostrom and her compatriot Oliver Williamson for the analysis of an economic report.
The only specialized category, without an award-winning woman, was Physics.
This award was given today by Charles Kao for research in the field of optical cables, and George Smith with Willard Boyle for the invention of the CCD chip, which forms the basis of all digital cameras, faxes or telescopes.
Each awardee collected the diploma, the Nobel medal and the certificate of the money received.
This sum in each category is up to ten million Swedish kronor (approximately 25 million Czech kronor).
If there are several winners in each category, the prize is distributed to each other.
The traditionally most awaited Nobel Peace Prize was received this afternoon in Oslo, Norway, by US President Barack Obama.
In his speech he acknowledged the controversy of having been awarded, as he is at the beginning of his career and is also at the head of a country that participates in two wars: Iraq and Afghanistan.
To defend his policy, he added, however, that in certain situations wars are indispensable to achieve peace, even if their price is high.
Minister Janota considers resignation. Klaus invited him to the Castle
President Václav Klaus will receive Finance Minister Eduard Janota on Friday morning, who is considering his stay in the government, as he does not agree with the version of the state budget for next year, approved Wednesday by the House of Representatives.
It is assumed that the budget, and perhaps also Janota’s stay in the cabinet, will be the themes of his Friday meeting.
The budget is also criticized by Klaus.
According to him, the deficit is too large, which continues to deepen the crisis of public finances.
The meeting was announced by President Radim Ochvat’s spokesman.
On her tenure in office, Janota wants to negotiate on Monday with Prime Minister Jan Fischer.
According to the budget law, prepared to be signed by Klaus, the Czech Republic should govern with a deficit of 163 billion kronor.
The House of Representatives, however, on Wednesday approved the left's proposals for transfers of funds and raised money for civil servants' salaries, social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government does not agree with the proposals of the Social Democrats, as they covertly increase the budget deficit.
Between the left on the one hand and the government, Klaus and the right on the other, there was a serious conflict of domestic policy. Due to this conflict, the future activities of the Fischer bureaucratic cabinet, whose form was agreed in the spring by the ODS, <0xC4><0x8C>SSD and the Green Party, are starting to be controversial.
Critics say the budget, in the version approved by the House of Deputies, de facto liquidates the austerity package imposed in the fall by the Fischer government to curb public debt.
Klaus can but does not have to sign the law on the state budget; today he stated during a breakfast with businessmen that politicians have long neglected "the serious problem", i.e., "the unsustainable deficit" of the public finances.
According to him, they no longer have a good solution.
Only a strong government, which can be supported by a broader consensus among political parties, could improve this situation, the president said.
ODS leader Mirek Topolánek mentioned that the budget is scary and that the government should think about its future existence.
ODS Vice President Petr Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as told <0xC4><0x8C>TK that the bureaucratic cabinet concept with the support of <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, ODS and the Greens obviously no longer works.
Prime Minister Fischer reacted and called similar words “strong sentences.”
The head of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, Ji<0xC5><0x99>í Paroubek, reacted to Topolánek saying that the budget deficit is appalling, prepared for this year by the former government of Topolánek.
On Wednesday, the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD said the approval of the state budget for the coming year was successful.
The people were happy too.
Mandela in Clint Eastwood's new film, starring Morgan Freeman
South Africans claim that Hollywood’s new film, Invictus: Invincible, tells a lot about the country, its struggle and its victories, although some critics say the protagonists play American actors.
The story is about sports, race relations and Nelson Mandela.
The relentless fighter against the racist apartheid regime in the South African Republic and its first black president, Nelson Mandela, is played in his biography by Oscar-winning American actor Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said Mandela, 91, asked him to play him in the Eastwood film.
Another important role is played by Matt Damon.
I said, "When I interpret you, I'll have to have access to you.
The 72-year-old actor, who received the award for his role in Eastwood's drama about the world of boxing Million Dollar Baby, played the role of the leader of the movement for the abolition of slavery, which ended up being a slave, of the fictional president of the United States, and even of God in Evan Almighty still remains someone.
The former South African statesman spent 27 years in prison for his activities to end apartheid in the South African Republic.
He was released in 1990 and for four years became president of the country.
In 1993 he received the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus - Invincible is a Latin word and the title of a poem by English author William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The challenge was to talk like him.
The film is a true story about Nelson Mandela, who joined forces with the captain of the South African rugby team, Francois Pienaar, to help unite the country. Mandela, the new president, knows that after apartheid his nation remains racially and economically divided.
He believes that he is able to unite his people through sport, and that is why he decides to unite the rugby players, who belong on the global scale to the outsiders.
The South African team managed to reach the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked for several years to get Mandela’s story to the movies.
I had no other goal than to play this role in such a way that it was as close to reality as possible, Freeman said.
Of course, the biggest challenge was to speak like him.
The actor said that if he and the world politician were from the same area, he would have tried to meet with Mandela, have dinner with him, be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing was that I wanted to shake hands with Mandela.
I discovered that by squeezing her hand, I receive her energy, it is transmitted and I had the feeling of knowing how you feel, she said.
It is important for me to try to become a different person.
Matt Damon plays François Pienaar, the captain of the national rugby team, in which the white players were predominant.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in the tough world of rugby.
A big surprise for him was when he finally met Pienaar for the first time at his home.
I remember knocking on the door, he opened it and the first thing I said to François Pienaar in my life was, "In the movie I look a lot taller."
Despite the obvious differences between the characters of the actors and their real models, and under the direction of director Eastwood, Invictus: Invincible received positive reviews and there is also talk of ambitions for the Oscar.
The Daily Variety film critic Todd McCarthy summed up his assessment with these words: "It was a very good story, a very well made film."
In movie reviews on rottentomatoes.com, Invictus received 76 percent positive reviews.
The secret of splendor over Norway solved: the Russians tested a missile
A special luminous effect of unknown origin was observed in Norway.
The Russian Defense Ministry acknowledged yesterday that near the borders with Norway it tested an intercontinental ballistic missile.
The missile, of the type "Bulava", formerly intended to be the pride of the Russian army, is becoming the nightmare of Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Even its repeated presence in the missile tests has not had the desired effect on the success of test flights.
Bulavá, in most cases, did not fly out or there was a failure in the air.
In Russian newspapers they write of "Bulava" as "a missile that does not fly".
A missile that does not fly, but shines.
During this, the 13th test, there was no problem at first.
At the end of the flight there were again technical problems in the aircraft.
Probably the engine exploded in the third stage of the missile.
This time "Bulava" was launched from the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donskoy, which floated submerged in the White Sea.
This type of missile makes it possible to launch from a vessel that is moving and is submerged at the same time.
That is why it is likely that the mysterious light over Norway, caused by an unidentified flying object, was actually the failed "Bulavá".
The Norwegians did not hesitate from the first moment that it was a Russian missile.
The generals this time defend themselves by stating that one cannot speak simply of a failure.
The first two stages of the missile endured and the failure occurred in the third.
In the previous cases, the engines were immediately damaged in the first stage.
Although none of the launches went completely error-free, according to the Ministry of Defense management, only six of the thirteen failed.
The success of almost fifty percent is full of optimism to the generals and that is why they continue to say that "Bulavá" will one day fly smoothly and that it will even manage to carry up to ten nuclear hypersonic blocks, whose total maximum weight is 1.15 tons.
The legendary Fetisov signed an annual contract with CSKA Moscow at the age of 51
The legendary defender Viacheslav Fetisov will return at the age of 51 to a professional hockey match.
The former world champion, Olympic champion and Stanley Cup winner will help his CSKA Moscow team and possibly play on Friday in the KHL duel against St. Petersburg.
Fetisov finished his professional career at the age of forty in 1998 and currently chairs the CSKA.
After Denis Kulyash is injured, we urgently need another defender.
Fetisov is constantly practicing and has committed to helping the team.
We just have to solve some formal issues, the AP agency quoted Sergei Nemchinov, the coach of the Moscow club.
It is not yet clear whether the return of the famous player will refer to a single match.
I think Fetisov is one of those who manage to lift the spirits of the other players, Nemchinov said.
According to AP, if Fetisov returns to the ice, he will become the longest-serving professional player in Russian hockey.
Legendary forward Gordie Howe played in the NHL for Hartford at the age of fifty-one, throughout the season, and scored 15 goals and 26 assists.
The largest of the group of five famous players Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov, is one of the best and most successful hockey players in history.
Playing for the Soviet Union he won two Olympic golds, seven world championships, won the Canadian Cup and the junior world championship.
In the second half of his career he also had successes in the NHL: playing with Detroit he won the Stanley Cup twice.
Since 2001 he has been a member of the Hockey Hall of Fame.
Hyundai has met union requirements. It will cancel all additional work
The management of the No<0xC5><0xA1>ovice car factory agreed with the unions to cancel all additional work.
Precisely because of the frequent additional work, the unions on Monday declared the emergency by strike.
The information was confirmed by Petr Van<0xC4><0x9B>k, the spokesman for the Hyundai car factory.
The management, however, wants to agree with the unions for another Saturday shift this year.
We cannot resign to our manufacturing plan, as it is essential. That is why we proposed additional voluntary work for Saturday, December 19, that is, it will be worked in two shifts, Van<0xC4><0x9B>k said.
According to the server Sedmi<0xC4><0x8D>ka.cz, the company offered a bonus of 400 CZK to employees working the Saturday shift.
The bonus will also be paid for last Saturday, November 28.
According to Va<0xC5><0x88>ka, the company decided to change the way to motivate its employees with the additional work offered.
Employees can collect the bonus for overtime or they can take a day off on December 28, i.e. extend the Christmas holidays in one day, Van<0xC4><0x9B>k said.
In addition, all employees of Saturday shifts will receive money for the trip and for the meal.
Because the supplementary work was the most urgent and problematic point of the comments and complaints of the unionists and strikers, who stopped manufacturing last week, the management yesterday afternoon decided to immediately cancel all the supplementary work for the month of December, Van<0xC4><0x9B>k said.
The employees of the car factory were forced to work two more hours in addition to eight-hour shifts and this situation lasted almost every day until last week.
After signing the agreement, the unions will cancel the strike emergency.
Another negotiation between the factory management and the unionists is due to take place on Monday morning.
Trade union chief Petr Kucha<0xC5><0x99> said Wednesday that if they pledged to meet the requirements and the document was signed, they were ready to cancel the strike emergency.
The situation at the car factory worsened last week when about 400 employees spontaneously went on strike due to frequent additional work.
They also protested against poor payment conditions and alleged harassment.
The management felt that employees had to work overtime to meet the requirements and be able to supply the cars.
Trade unionists in Monday’s strike emergency statement also demanded that none of the employees, who stopped manufacturing last Wednesday, be penalized in any way.
As far as supplementary work is concerned, unions demand that the company reduce it to a minimum.
In addition, this year they require a remuneration of 5,000 crowns for this work.
The car factory in No<0xC5><0xA1>ovice Hyundai currently has 2,000 employees.
Mass production began last November.
As of last September, it produced approximately 80,000 cars; its current production potential is 200,000 cars a year.
A Czech discovery: an effective substance even in the 'entangled' HIV viruses
A team of Czech and German scientists tests new compounds capable of moderating the spread of HIV in the body
The main advantage of this enhanced substance is the fact that it is also effective against drug-resistant viruses.
In some cases this is more important than the fact that the compound is not as effective in a common variant of the virus as some affordable drugs already.
AIDS disease cannot be cured so far.
However, the lives of patients can be significantly prolonged thanks to a mixture of drugs that prevent the replication of the HIV virus in the body.
However, its use has many side effects.
If the replication of the virus is not completely suppressed, so-called resistant viruses will be created; against them, drugs no longer work.
The work of experts from three Institutes of the Czech Academy of Sciences, V<0xC5><0xA0>CHT Prague and the University of Heidelberg demonstrates the possibility of mastering the resistance of the virus.
They demonstrated that substances called metallocarbons have an effect on albumin, which is responsible for the spread of the HIV virus.
The metallocarbons are compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block the spread of the virus in a different way than all drugs used today, and therefore can solve the problem of resistance.
In their work, scientists find new, ‘improved’ compounds, prepared by knowing the molecular mechanism of their binding to the virus’s albumin.
Metalocarbons have a single three-dimensional structure: two polyhedron cages composed of the boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms are joined by the metal atom, in this case by cobalt.
A treacherous and resistant virus
HIV protease is an albumin of the HIV virus, and is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without HIV protease, HIV virus fractionation does not occur and no mature and infectious corpuscles of the virus would be created.
If we stop the HIV protease, we also stop the spread of the virus in the patient’s body, the scientists explain in a press release published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry at the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In an article published in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, scientists describe a series of compounds, in which two pairs of cages (see table) are joined by a short organic series, which continues to be systematically modified.
A little weaker, but more effective
The effect of this series of substances against HIV protease was tested in a test tube, and also against its resistant variants, obtained from patients with HIV.
The effect of metallocarbons on the common variant of the enzyme is not as strong as in clinically used drugs, however, they do not lose their effect on resistant variants, in which drugs often do not work.
The mechanism of the unique effect, its other qualities such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical modifications makes, that metallocarbons are interesting compounds for research with the aim of proposing effective drugs against HIV, says Pavlína <0xC5><0x98>ezá<0xC4><0x8D>ová, head of the laboratory of biological and chemical genetics at the Institute.
Fight for the budget. ODS attacked Fischer, he defends himself
The head of SDGs Mirek Topolánek said the budget approved for next year is "scary" and the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should, he said, think about its future existence.
The ODS statements were pointed out by the prime minister as strong sentences.
They say there is time for analysis.
ODS Vice President Petr Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as said that the concept of bureaucratic cabinet with the support of <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, ODS and the Green Party obviously no longer works.
According to Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as, the prime minister has to decide whether in the Chamber of Deputies he wants to lean on the minority, who tries to fight the growing deficit, or whether he wants to stay in office with the help of the parliamentary left.
The attitude of SDGs and social democracy towards the public deficit problem is completely different, Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as warned.
The House of Deputies approved the budget for 2010, however with amendment proposals from the left, for more than 12 billion crowns.
The House of Representatives increased the money for state officials’ salaries, for social services, and for direct payments to farmers.
The government blamed the SDG proposals, as they covertly increase the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should rule with a deficit of CZK 163 billion.
ODS before the vote left the room and thus fulfilled the government’s wish, that the amended budget is better than an interim budget.
Disillusionment and uselessness
Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and feeling of uselessness; Prime Minister Jan Fischer mentioned that the government will reassess the current situation.
Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as is convinced that if Janota seriously threatened resignation in the event of approval of the amending proposals, the situation could have been different.
According to <0xC4><0x8C>eská televize Janota called for a meeting with the prime minister.
He said he was thinking of staying in the role.
The reason is his disappointment with the budget negotiations.
If Fischer agrees with another fight against the budget deficit, according to Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as in the government have nothing to do with the nominees by the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, which imposed the changes in the budget.
The prime minister should also say clearly, if he will resign, if the House approves other deficit-intensifying laws, such as those pertaining to sickness subsidies, income, or the amendment of the service law.
Topolánek: Ministers nominated by the SDGs are not to blame
This is a matter for Prime Minister Fischer and the entire government.
The ministers nominated by the SDGs have done nothing wrong, Topolánek stressed in the US text news.
He recalled that in several ministries in the posts of lieutenants there are people who belong to the TOP 09, who voted against the budget.
Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as stressed, that if Fischer decides to resign the principle of the struggle with the height of the public finance deficit, "it is absolutely logical and correct, that it is based on the leftist majority, which is currently in the Chamber of Deputies".
However, they will not be able to count on the support and tolerance of the SDG members.
I have not thought about that, when the time comes, I will take care of it, told reporters in the Chamber of Deputies Minister of Defense Martin Barták, who was appointed for the government precisely by the members of ODS.
Prime Minister Fischer went to a meeting of the European Council in Brussels in the afternoon.
ODS surrendered at the request of the Prime Minister
Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as stressed that ODS on Wednesday in the Chamber of Deputies would likely vote against the amended budget, if the prime minister does not explicitly ask ODS deputies to allow acceptance of the budget.
We do not feel like orphans, we are not small children, reacted to the question, if ODS does not worry about the absence of the head of the party in the parliament and in the Czech Republic, during the negotiations on the budget.
I didn't realize my vote was missing.
When he resigned, he knew that in the following months it would be mainly about the Bolshevikization of the Chamber of Deputies and the destruction of all the positive, Topolánek himself reacted.
According to the new train schedule of <0xC4><0x8C>D there will be fewer trains for almost the same fares
<0xC4><0x8C>eské dráhy (Czech Railways) will cancel or restrict some less-used fast and local trains from 13 December and, on the contrary, will strengthen some links.
The total extension of traffic will be reduced by two percent compared to today, after the new train schedule comes into effect.
Most rates including basic and customer price will not change.
More possibilities of connections to the capital will win for example the inhabitants of the region of Ostrava, dráhy for this line will add a pendolino road.
The direct train, on the contrary, will not circulate again in Bratislava.
On the line Prague - Písek - <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice there will be fewer fast trains, direct links Prague - Letohrad will be restricted.
In the regions, the largest reduction of transport planned by dráhy is in the Hradec Králové region, eight percent in total, on the contrary, transport will increase in Prague and its surroundings.
Two night trains will also be cancelled on the Prague - Tábor - <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice route and some fast trains on the Prague - Písek - <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice line will be reduced to only a few days a week.
One of the biggest changes is the introduction of a new direct line from Milovice to Prague, the inhabitants of Milovice have to change in Lysá nad Labem.
It is the 15th line of the Esko system, in the vicinity of the cities, its opening is possible thanks to the electrification of the line from Lysá nad Labem to Milovice.
Long-distance links to the capital will end at Prague Hlavní nádra<0xC5><0xBE>í station.
<0xC4><0x8C>D will introduce more SC Pendolino links between Prague and Ostrava and trains to <0xC5><0xA0>umperk/Jeseník will run every two hours.
From December 13, travelers will not travel to Bratislava again in Pendolino.
This year’s count for regional railways: 200 million more than before
The high-speed trains are commissioned and paid by the Ministry of Transport, to cover the so-called demonstrable losses Dráhy will receive a total of four billion crowns next year, just as this year. The local trains are commissioned by the regions, next year will pay eight billion crowns in total, and the State will help them almost three billion.
This year, regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
For high-speed and local trains dráhy have a new ten-year contract, until now the contract was always one-year.
Dráhy are happy with the system, and maybe that’s why they didn’t raise the prices of a large majority of tickets.
Changes will only occur on one-day tickets - <0xC4><0x8C>D Net and on cheap eLi<0xC5><0xA1>ka internet tickets.
For travelers without a customer card, the price of <0xC4><0x8C>D Net will increase from 450 kronor to 600 kronor.
The price of eLi<0xC5><0xA1>ka will depend on the distance, so far there was a single price of 160 crowns for travel between any two regional cities.
Philippine Armed Forces Still Arresting More Than 50 People, Children Released
The armed forces have kidnapped 75 people in the southern Philippines today, including several elementary school students and their teachers.
This was stated by the AFP agency, which previously reported only 65 abductees.
All 17 detained children and a teacher were released after eight hours.
The kidnapping took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
Approximately 19 gunmen are said to be using the hostages as a live shield in the escape from police.
Local negotiators are trying to agree to hand over the remaining hostages.
According to AFP, the armed forces belong to the New People's Army (NPA), an armed faction of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AP agency, the police had previously persecuted the kidnappers because of the violence, which was caused by adjusting the accounts between two clans of local families.
In the southern Philippines in the province of Maguindanao it was because of the recent massacre, in which 57 people died, imposed martial law.
Among the victims of the November 23 massacre, related to the governor’s election, were 30 journalists.
On suspicion of involvement in the massacre, they arrested the governor of this province in the southern Philippines and his father Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of an influential Ampatuan dynasty.
Muslim separatists also operate on the island of Mindanao.
However, on Tuesday they renewed peace talks with the Philippine government.
RSA's story concerns everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
In the coming days, a new Hollywood film by Clint Eastwood Invictus (his official Czech title is Invictus: Nepora<0xC5><0xBE>en<0xC3><0xBD>), which captures part of the biography of the former President of the South African Republic Nelson Mandela, is premiering in American cinemas.
The role of the world-famous anti-apartheid fighter is played by Morgan Freeman, whom Mandela himself chose years ago for the lead role.
The second role, that of legendary rugby champion Francoise Pienaar, was played by Matt Damon.
With the premiere they are born from the reactions of critics and the public
Nelson Mandela 's
Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela was born on 18 July 1918 in Mvezo, South Africa.
In 1988 he received the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought, in 1993 he received, together with Klerk, the Nobel Peace Prize.
He was President of the Republic of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
There is great hope, as it comes to the public at the time, when in the Republic of South Africa the preparations for the world football championship culminate. At the same time, the media are shaken by alarming news about the growing racial hatred and discrimination of the inhabitants by the dominant black majority.
According to the AP news agency, the reactions to this new film on RSA have been positive, despite numerous reservations against the distribution of the leading roles by the "uninteresting" Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman, however, says he is proud of the new film.
For many years I dreamed of the role and prepared myself well to play it.
Many times I met in person with Nelson Mandela, to — as they say — charge his energy, he mentioned in an interview after the festive premiere in Los Angeles.
I think it’s good, if through the film we can remember the character and the message of Mandela.
It is a history of the Republic of South Africa, but it refers to everyone, he added.
In the costume of the national rugby team
The film is based on the book by British writer John Carlin with the title freely translated In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the game. Thanks to this game was born the nation. It portrays the South African human rights lawyer during his first presidential term.
Morgan Freeman in the film is trying to unite two groups of inhabitants, racially and for long separate years. Like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he as the protagonist also puts on the suit of the South African national rugby team and enters the field of play. RSA then won the world cup.
By stepping into the suit, which in RSA is considered almost sacred, Mandela fourteen years ago won great ovations, especially from the white public and the recognition of the white inhabitants.
The football championship may succeed in helping people join and form a nation, rugby player Chester Williams, the only "black" in the national team in 1995, said.
It will still be seen, if the tense situation in the RSA improves.
White South Africans, however, are skeptical, as Christopher Dawson, a rugby fan who fled his country to Britain, said in a recent interview with LN.
The championship starts on June 11, 2010.
In Lounsko burns a transformer with a value of tens of millions of crowns
In the morning, a <0xC4><0x8C>eps transformer in a switch box near the village of V<0xC3><0xBD><0xC5><0xA1>kov in Lounsko caught fire.
According to Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Marvan, the spokesman for firefighters in the <0xC3><0x9A>stí region, the fire is extinguished by six groups.
Previously, firefighters wanted the transformer to be destroyed by fire, but later changed their minds and the fire is extinguishing it with a mixture of water, foam and a special extinguishing material.
The fire was caused by a technical defect, the short circuit of the transformer.
There were no injuries, according to Pavla Mandatová, the company's spokeswoman, the breakdown does not endanger the safe operation of the distribution system.
The estimated damage is several million crowns, it will not be possible to list it exactly before the fire is extinguished.
According to Mandatová, it will be necessary to replace the destroyed transformer with a new one.
During the ten years of the activity of <0xC4><0x8C>eps nothing similar happened, the breakdowns of this type are sporadic, he added.
According to Sona Holingerová Hendrychová, the spokeswoman of the <0xC4><0x8C>EZ company for the northern Czech Republic, the supply of electricity was not cut, and the fire at the power substation did not affect the operation of households, offices and companies.
A.s. <0xC4><0x8C>eps operates on the territory of the Czech Republic as the exclusive maintainer of the distribution system, the 400 kV and 220 kV electrical wiring.
It keeps in good condition, renews and develops 39 switch boxes with 67 transformers, which carry the electrical energy from the transmission system to the distributor system, and also maintains the electrical conduction of 4,339 kilometers long.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura will file a charge of slander against three <0xC4><0x8C>SSD hetmans
Student Agency owner Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura today will file a slander complaint against three social democratic hetmans.
These are Michal Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek of the South Moravian Region, Radko Martinek of Pardubice Region and the hetman of Olomouc Region, Martin Tesa<0xC5><0x99>ík.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura mentioned it in Twenty Minutes on Radio<0xC5><0xBD>urnál.
Demand has to do with the company’s effort to maintain regional rail transport in some regions.
All regions, however, ended up signing long-term contracts with <0xC4><0x8C>eské dráhy.
All three Hetmans are attacking us and talking about the fact that we are "taking the pass from the cake", yet we only brought the offer for what they themselves wanted.
They claim that we are more expensive than <0xC4><0x8C>eské dráhy, which is not true. We know the prices of <0xC4><0x8C>eské dráhy, which were fixed last week.
So we have nothing else to do but defend ourselves.
It is for the slander against the Student Agency society, he told Radio<0xC5><0xBE>urnál Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura.
He also mentioned that he had the evidence of all regions, and he said that the necessary measures had not been taken in accordance with European law.
That is why he is preparing an incentive for the European Commission.
Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek considers this complaint to be the continuation of Mr. Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura’s media show, which serves as free advertising for his company and for himself.
Naturally I am prepared to defend my good reputation and that of my region and appeal to the other Hetmans to do so as well.
I suppose, this time too, it will be clearly demonstrated that Mr. Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura manipulates the public in the matter of regional rail transport, and uses false and false arguments, Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek mentioned.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura announced last week that he would invest several million crowns in advertising, the aim of which would be to warn of these measures from the regions.
He told Radio <0xC5><0xBD>urnál that he would interrupt the campaign after Christmas and wants to continue it after the New Year.
He said that the campaign will be carried out against corruption as such.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura started the campaign after the regions agreed with <0xC4><0x8C>eské dráhy to maintain regional rail links and for the order of approximately 150 billion crowns did not call for tender.
According to Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura, similar steps are in disagreement with the law and the opinion of the European Court.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura claims to have been threatened by a member of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, due to his criticism of rail transport in the regions.
The only threat was, if we don't quit, we could lose the bus licenses.
He presented himself as a member of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, I know, what gentleman this is about, I will not say his name, Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura said today to Radio<0xC5><0xBE>urnál.
The pneumococcal vaccine will be free and voluntary
The pneumococcal vaccine from January will end customs.
As a first vaccine it must be free for families and at the same time voluntary.
However, there are already opinions that compulsory vaccination would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of the free pneumococcal vaccine culminate.
The Medicines Institute is already setting the maximum prices for vaccines, which will be covered by insurance companies.
Experts also already know this clearly in the vaccination procedure.
The New Vaccine
Free vaccines for children born in August
As of January, children born since August 2 of last year will be able to receive the pneumococcal vaccine free of charge.
The condition is that you have not received a single dose of the vaccine before.
Those who started with the vaccine last year or earlier need to cover other doses of the vaccine as well.
The first dose of the vaccine must be received between the third and fifth month of age of the child.
Last year, a quarter of families voluntarily vaccinated their children against pneumococcal disease.
The parents, however, paid for a dose of 1,600 crowns and more.
To vaccinate younger children, four doses are needed.
Generally, experts estimate, insurance companies will spend on vaccines from 300 to 450,000 crowns annually.
No clutch will save on treatment, which is needed for unvaccinated children.
So far, the state has spent on the entire vaccination of children approximately 500,000 annually.
Covered vaccination was initiated by the so-called Janota package.
Pneumococcus is the cause of otitis media, but also of serious infections including meningitis and septicemia.
Of pneumococcal infections in our country every year, according to research in hospitals 28 children not older than 10 years of age die.
In addition to the Czech Republic, the pneumococcal vaccine cover in children was introduced in approximately 40 countries.
Will the vaccine be compulsory?
However, at the same time there are opinions, that this vaccine could be compulsory in the future.
As of January it must be covered by the insurance and voluntary companies.
The compulsory vaccine would be better, for example, said Rudolf Kalovsk<0xC3><0xBD>, head of the Nahlas civic association.
Their association has been spreading pneumococcal vaccines for a long time.
The experts at an international conference, in which our association participated, were not completely satisfied with the fact that we have the voluntary vaccine.
It's not entirely ideal.
On the other hand, we are happy to achieve at least this.
I think this is the path we now have to take, Kalovsk<0xC3><0xBD> said.
The Ministry of Health, however, does not want to change the procedure of vaccination against pneumococcals.
At the moment we do not think about it at all, said its spokesman Vlastimil Sr<0xC5><0xA1>e<0xC5><0x88>.
Voluntary vaccine has its drawbacks, doctors say
The president of the Society of Pediatricians, Hana Cabrnochová, recognizes that the voluntary vaccine has its disadvantages.
If all children were to receive the vaccine, one could reason on reducing the number of doses. "In the situation, when the vaccine costs such a high amount, we relatively understand the political decision to have started the vaccination as a voluntary," says Cabrnochová.
Experts expect that from next year more than 80 percent of young parents will allow their babies to be vaccinated against pneumococcal diseases.
The pneumococcal vaccine is a big change also because as the first vaccination in children is covered by health companies, not by the state.
Insurance companies should spend more money on prophylaxis, to save later on treatment, explains Cabrnochová.
Doctors will have to buy the vaccines for themselves.
However, pediatricians are concerned about the purchase of vaccines.
Previously, vaccines had to be purchased by insurance companies and distributed to doctors, just as when the state gives them other vaccines.
Some MPs, however, feared that insurance companies could “get the money out of health insurance.”
Doctors will have to buy the vaccines and wait until they are paid by the insurance companies.
It is estimated that pediatricians will invest in 40,000 vaccines a month, which is a remarkable sum.
It won't be easy, says Cabrnochová.
The son of an American artist involved in "the theft of a museum"
The son of renowned American fantasy artist Frank Frazetta has been accused of trying to steal paintings worth $20 million from his father's museum.
Pennsylvania police say Alfonso Frank Frazetta was caught carrying 90 paintings in his vehicle and trailer.
They claim that Frazetta and another man used an excavator to break into the museum, in the Pocono Mountains region.
Frazetta's father, 81, is famous for his portrayal of characters such as Conan the Barbarian and Tarzan.
The Associated Press reported that the artist was in Florida at the time of the incident.
AP reported that an unidentified police official claimed that a family dispute may have motivated the young Frazetta.
Frazatta’s son, 52, told police that his father had ordered him “to enter the museum by any means to transfer all the paintings to a warehouse.”
The agency said Frazetta’s father denied granting such permission.
Labour Party Defends Tax Increases in Budget
Ministers have defended tax increases and spending cuts in the pre-budget report, against criticism from the opposition, businesses and trade unions.
Conservatives said Alistair Darling “wasted” an opportunity to show his seriousness about cutting the deficit, delaying decisions until after the election.
The Minister of Finance also received harsh criticism for harming low- and middle-income workers.
Among its main proposals are an increase of 0.5% in Social Security spending and a 1% cap in public sector wage agreements from 2011.
Angry for Social Security
Trade unions have lamented that low-wage workers are being punished with a recession generated by others, and warned of future “problems.”
The increase in Social Security spending, which will grow by about three billion pounds a year, has angered the business community, which claims this is a job tax, when the focus should be on economic recovery.
The increase, limited to those earning more than <0xC2><0xA3>20,000 a year, will affect approximately 10 million workers.
KEY POINTS OF THE BEFORE-BUDGET REPORT
Social Security with an additional 0.5% increase, as of April 2011
Economy will shrink more than expected 4.75% this year
New 50% tax on banker bonds
The 1-point increase in corporation tax for small firms was ruled out
Tax exemptions for electric cars and wind turbines
The state pension would increase by 2.5%
According to the Ministry of Finance estimates, a person who earns <0xC2><0xA3>30,000 will lose <0xC2><0xA3>90 a year and a person who earns <0xC2><0xA3>40,000 will lose <0xC2><0xA3>190, while a person who earns <0xC2><0xA3>10,000 a year will earn <0xC2><0xA3>110.
The ministers said their goal of halving the deficit by 2013 involved "difficult decisions", but insisted that 60% of the additional tax burden would fall on 5% of the higher wages.
Treasury Minister Stephen Timms denied that the tax hikes and spending cuts outlined were a “grain of sand in the desert” compared to what was needed.
"These are large figures, and it will allow us to cut the deficit in half, which is absolutely essential for the next four years," he told the BBC.
Mr. Timms said he was confident that the economy would grow again by the end of the year.
However, the Labour Party’s forecasts for future economic growth, which will influence the amount to borrow and how quickly the deficit will be reduced, have been questioned after the Finance Minister was forced to modify the first figures.
In his statement, he said the economy would likely contract by 4.75% this year, much worse than the 3.5% decline forecast in April, while the loan request would be <0xC2><0xA3>3 billion above the previously estimated.
“A wasted opportunity”
The Conservatives, who will launch a new advertising campaign on Thursday, warning of the Labour party’s “debt crisis,” said the <0xC2><0xA3>789 billion loan application projection for the next six years was unsustainable.
The ministers had failed to present a credible plan on how they would return the money, they added, "cynically" circumventing difficult options until after the June 2010 elections.
"They have not included anything significant about what they will do," said the Minister in the shadow of the Ministry of Finance, Philip Hammond. "They had the opportunity to do so and they have wasted it."
“All major announcements will be made after the election, whoever wins wins.”
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
The Labour Party insists that schools, hospitals and police be protected from future cuts, unlike conservative proposals, which would seek further short-term deficit reductions.
But the Liberal Democrats claimed that the money raised by tax increases and spending cuts would be used to sustain next year’s spending, not to reduce the deficit, arguing that the projects were like “sandcastles.”
BBC political editor Nick Robinson said the timing chosen for the announcements, such as the aforementioned increase in inflation of some disability subsidies next April, would leave the Treasury Minister exposed to accusations of election maneuvers, as the money could simply be recovered the following year.
However, the Labour Party insists that it is providing people with the most need and the situation will be reviewed in September 2010.
"False budget"
Although ministers did not release spending data after 2011, economists said it was clear that the public spending adjustment would only be felt in the medium term.
The respected Institute of Fiscal Studies said the figures of the Minister of Finance involved substantial cuts in many areas, potentially including in the future transportation, higher education, science and defense.
“This is really postponing the pain for later,” said its director, Robert Chote.
“All major announcements will come after the election, whoever wins wins,” added Roger Bootle, Deloitte’s financial advisor to accountants.
"This has been the fake pre-budget report. Markets realize this."
FBI investigates "detentions of Americans in Pakistan"
The FBI is investigating the detention in Pakistan of five American men suspected of extremist connections.
The U.S. embassy in Pakistan told the BBC that the men were arrested in a raid on a house in Sarghoda, in eastern Punjab province.
The FBI has said it is investigating whether they are the same men who disappeared from their homes in the state of Virginia last month.
The U.S. Department of State said it was also looking for information about the men.
It is reported that three of them are of Pakistani descent, one of Egyptian heritage and the other of Yemeni origin.
“If they are U.S. citizens, of course we will be very interested in the charges for which they have been detained and in what kind of circumstances they are being held in,” spokesman Ian Kelly said.
FBI spokeswoman Katherine Schweit said the agency was aware of the detentions and was in contact with the families of the missing students.
"We are working with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identities and the nature of their business there, if in fact these are the students who were missing," the spokeswoman said.
The Pakistani embassy in Washington said the men were detained in a house that belongs to the uncle of one of them.
He said the house was already under the sight of local police and that charges had not yet been filed against the detainees.
Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton declined to comment on the detentions, Reuters news agency reported, but said the U.S. had to “work more closely with both Afghanistan and Pakistan, to try to eradicate the terrorist infrastructure that continues to recruit and train people.”
The families of the five students reported their disappearance in North Virginia in late November.
Amnesty International condemns Iran's "abuse"
Human rights in Iran over the past 20 years have always been equally deficient, according to a report by the Amnesty International campaign group.
The report details "the abuse models" of the regime, before and after the presidential elections held in June.
One man quoted in the report said he was beaten and burned with cigarettes, another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran has rejected previous criticisms of its human rights history.
Officials have said that such criticism has a political basis.
Thousands of people arrested and dozens killed in Iran after President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad’s election sparked the biggest street protests since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Dozens of people have been sentenced, and prosecutors say at least five people have been sentenced to death.
Tehran-based BBC correspondent Jon Leyne, who is now in London, says that during the protests, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei acknowledged some allegations of abuse, ordering the closure of Kahrizak’s detention center.
But since then, the authorities have shown very little tolerance for criticism, according to our correspondent.
"False Confession"
Amnesty International quoted Ebrahim Mehtari, a 26-year-old computer student, as saying he was accused of “working with Facebook networks” and protesting the election result.
"They often hit me in the face" according to his words.
"They burned me with cigarettes under my eyes, on my neck, my head... They threatened to execute me and humiliated me."
Amnesty said after five days he signed a false confession and was released and abandoned on the street, still bleeding and semi-conscious.
In August, defeated presidential candidate Mehdi Karroubi said some protesters detained after the election had been tortured to death in prison, and others had been raped.
Iranian officials denied the allegations of rape, but admitted there had been abuses.
Amnesty also cited the case of a former detainee, who claimed to have been held in a container along with 75 other people for more than eight weeks, at a detention center in Kahrizak.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian parliament and the judiciary had set up committees to investigate the discomfort of the post-election and the government's response, but said the mandate and powers of the agencies were confusing and the investigations of the parliamentary committee had not been made public.
The group said at least 90 people had been detained in the past three weeks to prevent further demonstrations.
A ski run was made in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow were used to turn a Bristol landmark into a racetrack.
The Piste at the Park event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders who competed for cash prizes.
At the top of the slope in Brandon Hill Park was a short jumping ramp, facing a 100-meter-long track.
John Hickman, a fourth-year medical student, said there was a beautiful view from the top of the track, but it was quite frightening.
You can see below a beautiful view of the city lights titillating.
Here are some of the county’s best skiers and snowboarders, true talent,” he added.
The prizes were given to the best tricks or maneuvers performed on the track.
After the Thursday afternoon event, the snow will be allowed to melt.
Still them and us
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when Swiss voters have asked for a ban on minarets and there is a widespread warning about the supposed Islamization of Europe, John Bowen, an American academic, has written a detailed and studied report on the possible integration of Muslims (who are actually integrating) into one of the continent’s most openly secular societies.
Some readers will come to this new book as admirers of the author's latest work "Why the French Don't Like Headcarves" (2006), an elegant and detailed study of a problem that divided and worried the country for a decade and a half, and whose effects are still perceived today.
Mr. Bowen’s last book has a broader and more ambitious perspective.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and the media are saying about Islam in France, but what is really happening.
He has spent months in mosques, schools and institutes that now provide France’s 5-6 million Muslims with what Mr. Bowen calls “Islamic spaces.”
He is a good listener who reproduces debates between teachers and students about the questions they are most interested in.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or in a town hall (or both)?
Should young Muslims be taught about the evolution and rights of homosexuals?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim man?
Is it legitimate for a Muslim to use an interest-based banking system to get a mortgage?
It is these seemingly mundane issues, he argues, of everyday life, that concern the media more than political dramas.
The author identifies a new generation of magnets, professors and intellectuals, none of them reputable, with the possible exception of Tariq Ramadan, an Arab scholar and scholar born in Switzerland.
This new generation seeks to open the debate about how to be both a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They are not able to spread this argument completely.
Conservatives doubt only the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists that Mr. Bowen interviews tend to disagree with his Salafi counterparts, supporters of Sunni Islam purist associated with Saudi Arabia, who currently have a small but influential presence among Muslims in Europe.
Bowen thinks that Muslim values and French secularism might be compatible.
But adaptation requires mutual concessions.
It questions the extent to which French political strategists (and the intellectual elite who so ferociously defend secularism) are really committed to pluralism.
It suggests that Muslims are likely to be treated more unfairly than Catholics, Protestants and Jews, who have also had to make their historic commitments to secular republicanism.
More than a growing pragmatism, he perceives “an adjustment of values.”
After reading this book, one tends to say "Yes, but not yet."
The most desolating panorama in the world
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than any other habitat on the planet.
The ice that defines it is melting at an alarming rate, taking with it life that cannot survive anywhere else.
The interests of oil, gas, transport and fisheries have been focused on recently opened waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now authors, as a consequence.
In On Thin Ice, Richard Ellis, a writer and illustrator, paints a natural story of the northern icon, the polar bear.
Knowing the complicated history and politics of whaling, he describes the long tradition of Arctic explorers, who gave proof of courage in the face of the white bear.
Admiral Nelson’s encounter as a brave 14-year-old cadet, fighting only with the end of his musket, is certainly a myth, but others are true.
The young, captured while swimming following the bodies of their newly exterminated mothers, were trapped and sent to zoos and circuses.
A circus presentation in the early 20th century, exhibited 75 polar bears at the same time.
Even today, zoo enclosures are still generally one-millionth of the area of a wild adult habitat. The weather is almost never adequate: a Singaporean polar bear is greened by algae growing within the hairless areas of its fur.

Ellis draws on accounts from other writers and historians, and often returns to the threat that hunters pose to the survival of species.
Although it is banned in Norway, the U.S. and Russia, the killing continues in Greenland and Canada, where helicopter hunters and Eskimo Indians in snowmobiles use high-powered assault rifles to shoot down their prey.
Ironically, it is in the waters north of those two hunting nations where the ice will last longer.
In his new book, "After the Ice," Alun Anderson, a former New Scientist editor, offers a clear and chilling account of Arctic science and a stunning look at how the future of that place can be transformed.
It’s not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospheric scientists nor oceanographers can adequately explain the speed of change.
It is not for lack of effort.
Fridtjof Nansen’s pioneering travels in the late 19th and early 20th centuries gave clues for the first time about the displacement of ice masses.
Then the Cold War submarines drew a map of the moving cords of ice circulating beneath the masses of ice.
Satellite exploration and extensive series of iceberg-mounted probes are a useful supplement, but resistant individuals encamped in the cold still perform many tasks.
Mr. Anderson looks into the extraordinary, tiny world of the affluent system within the Arctic ice, formed by jets of salt water that are compressed as it freezes.
But from the bear on the surface to the microscopic wonders of the interior, they are all doomed once the summer ice is removed, which is believed to happen sometime between 2013 and 2050.
In a few months... these could be us
Marines among 6,000 placing crowns in Arlington tombs
De'Angelo Robinson, 19, traveled seven hours by bus to place a single crown on the grave of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other Marines who traveled from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, N.C., to Arlington National Cemetery to decorate tombs, it was a day to pay tribute to men and women who once stood in their boots.
In a few months, from where they are embarking, these could be us, Robinson said of the fallen soldiers.
If it's us, I'd like someone to do the same for me, so I'm just trying to show respect.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who gathered on Saturday morning to place crowns on veterans’ graves in several sections of Arlington Cemetery.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, the owner of the Crown Company Worcester in Harrington, Maine, started the event when he and others decided to decorate several hundred tombs at Arlington Cemetery.
In what is already an 18-year-old tradition, Morrill and his wife Karen make the trip each year stopping in different cities along the way, to officiate events dedicated to the military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a non-profit organization, Wreaths Across America, which has extended the event to other states.
This year, volunteers placed more than 16,000 crowns in the graves of Arlington Cemetery, areas in the Pentagon, graves at Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, Battery Park in New York City, and at the United Airlines Flight 93 memorial site in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second year, the Walmart Foundation donated more than $150,000 to buy and transport the crowns.
Charleen Hunt, 70, of Westminster, said she made the trip to Arlington in honor of her husband, a late military career.
As long as her husband is not buried in Arlington, Hunt said this was his way of giving retribution to those who made sacrifices.
This is a modest way that civilians can support our troops, he said.
It's like visiting a family grave.
Wrapped in layers of warm clothes, the volunteers walked through the vast meadows and hills of the cemetery.
Volunteers headed to older graves from World War I, World War II, and the Vietnam War because they don’t receive as many visits as new graves, the organizers said.
The atmosphere was cheerful as the children played and the couples held hands while carrying the fresh pine to the tombstones.
Each circular crown was of a deep green, with a small red loop tied at the top.
Near there, Section 60, where most of the veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars are buried, remained virtually silent.
The United Service Organizations donated 1,000 crowns to decorate the section, but the bleak atmosphere of the current wars invaded the area.
People wept openly, others prayed, and families and friends leaned on each other in the icy air.
Some read aloud names carved on the stones, while others leaned to see small white and black plates placed inside the wet mud, for those whose tombstones have not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers who wiped the tears of her eyes in front of her son’s grave.
He drove eight hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the tomb of Marine Artillery Sgt. David Shane Spicer, who died in combat in July.
No one should ever forget why we are free. . . my son paid for it, he said.
“A long time after I die, I want someone to remember it.”
Cuban officials arrest U.S. government contractor
The Cuban government has arrested a U.S. government contractor who distributed mobile phones and laptops in the country, State Department officials said on Saturday.
The contractor, who has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc, based in Bethesda.
The company works on projects for clients such as the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular officers along with the U.S. Interests Section in Havana are seeking access to the detainee, who was arrested on December 5.
The specific charges have not been made public, although under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor may be detained for almost anything considered "dangerous".
All so-called counter-revolutionary activities, including mild protests and critical writings, carry the risk of arrest.
Anti-government graffiti and speeches are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has an incipient blogger community, led by popular commentator Yoani Sanchez, who often writes about how she and her husband are followed and harassed by government agents.
Sánchez has applied on several occasions for permission to leave the country to accept awards, but the permission has been denied.
The arrest of a U.S. contractor may likely spark tensions between the Castro brothers’ communist government in Cuba and the Obama administration, which has been seeking a “slow-motion” approach to improving relations with the island.
The New York Times was the first to release the news of the arrest on Friday night.
The new U.S. policy emphasizes that if the Cuban government takes concrete steps, such as releasing political prisoners and creating more space for the opposition, there will be reciprocity on the part of the United States.
Mobile phones and laptops are legal in Cuba, even if they are new and coveted products in a country where the average salary of a government worker is $15 per month.
The Cuban government granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones only this year; they are mainly used for text messages, as a 15-minute phone conversation would cost the daily wage.
Internet use is extremely limited on the island.
It is available in expensive hotels and for foreign hotel visitors, and in some government establishments such as universities.
Cubans who want to connect often have to give their names to the government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
Arrest of an American in Cuba is unusual.
Gloria Berbena, a press officer in the U.S. Interests Section in Havana, said most of the handful of U.S. citizens in prison in Cuba are in jail for crimes such as drug trafficking.
Berbena said she could not provide more information about the arrest.
Arrest and detention are clearly wrong.
An activity that in any other open society would be legal, such as distributing mobile phones for free, in Cuba is a crime, said José Miguel Vivanco, director of the program of the Americas of the organization Human Rights Watch, who recently published a tough report on freedoms in Cuba, called "New Castro, Cuba itself", a reference to Raúl Castro's placement as the country's elder brother.
Vivanco said the defendants are often detained, prosecuted and imprisoned in one day.
He expressed that any solution would likely be political, and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, just as the two countries begin to have more dialogue.
Pakistani officials unveil plot to send men to Afghanistan
On Saturday, Pakistani authorities neutralized the alleged brains behind a plot to send five men from North Virginia to Afghanistan to kill U.S. troops, saying they hope the case could help unravel an extensive network of terrorist recruiters, who roam the Internet in search of radicalized youth.
The investigators said they were chasing a mysterious insurgent figure, known as Saifullah, who invited the men to Pakistan after discovering that one of them made comments approving terrorist attacks on the YouTube video site.
Saifullah directed the men once they were in Pakistan, trying to help them reach the remote area in the tribal belt of Pakistan, which is a familiar place for al Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani intelligence official who had been briefed on the case said on Saturday Saifullah could not convince al-Qaeda commanders that the men were not part of a CIA plot to infiltrate the terrorist network.
Therefore, they were isolated for several days in the eastern city of Sargodha, away from the imposing mountains of the northwest, which have become a terrorist paradise.
They were considered part of a covert operation.
For this reason they were rejected, said the official, who spoke from the anonymity due to the delicacy of the case.
The official said the men did not mutate and were even trying to get proper approval to access the al-Qaeda camps, when Pakistani police authorities arrested them.
The case of the five men, who remain in Pakistan and are being interrogated by the FBI, underscores the critical role of recruiters in identifying potential terrorists and, perhaps most importantly, determine who are trusted.
Since the September 11, 2001 attacks, U.S. intelligence has made it a top priority to try to infiltrate people inside al Qaeda.
The recruiters of the organization act as guards, not letting go of those who do not demonstrate a serious commitment to the holy war, and those who could be spies.
Analysts said al Qaeda is paying special attention to aspiring American recruits.
But for the organization they represent a huge attraction, due to their potential to have access to U.S. targets and due to their propaganda value.
But Evan Kohlmann, senior analyst for the US-based NEFA Foundation, said terrorist groups have also become much more cautious in recent years with respect to those who admit it, because U.S. intelligence agencies have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you are trying to infiltrate someone in these groups, what better way than to follow the recruitment model how many have already followed?
It has become a much more web-based model.
Tens of thousands protest in Copenhagen, demand "climate action"
On Saturday, tens of thousands of protesters marched here on the streets demanding negotiators working at the city’s Bella Center Convention Center bolder actions for the climate.
The protesters said 100,000 people participated in the event, but police estimated the number was closer to 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, although a handful of masked activists placed small explosives near a group of government buildings in the city center.
On a day in which little happened in UN-sponsored climate talks, thousands of activists walked around the city holding banners in English saying “There is no planet B” and one in Spanish stating, “Earth says “enough.”
Several celebrities joined the protest, including Danish model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said that trips to Peru, her mother’s home country, made me aware of the distressing issues that the country must deal with due to the impacts of climate change that are already happening.”
This is part of the reason why I have decided to join the great demonstration, to spread the word and appeal to the leaders of the world, to present a fair, ambitious and binding agreement.
This is not an easy task, but it has to be done, there is no way to bypass it any longer.
Police prevented protesters from getting too close to the Bella Center, saying they had arrested 19 people, mainly for wearing masks or carrying pocket knives.
According to Danish law, such activities are prohibited during the demonstrations.
According to one witness, who asked not to be identified for being involved in the climate talks, activists wearing sports masks and black suits placed several explosives near the main canal in Copenhagen, which is close to several ministries.
They were around the buildings, he said, adding that they started out as flares, but were followed by "a couple of big explosions."
Within the convention center, people gathered around the TV screens to watch the march throughout the afternoon.
But the protest did not seem to penetrate the consciousness of key officials like Su Wei, China’s chief climate negotiator.
When asked if he thought the demonstration was having a constructive impact on international discussions, he replied in English, "I really wasn't aware of the situation."
Then he went on to say in Mandarin, "as the meeting place is great, I can't hear what's going on outside."
He noted that it depended on the perspective of each to define whether the march was being harmful or beneficial.
He said this shows the general public and different sectors’ attention to the issue of climate change.
On the other hand, "it can also be said that they affect negotiations, or the freedom of other people.
Data from a Test Reveal Persistent Racial Differences
Last week’s federal grade book on math performance was very good news for the public schools in the Capital District.
Although the District is still far from the country’s best performing systems, the scoreboard showed that fourth and eighth graders have been staggering at a faster pace over the past two years, compared to the cities of Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what remains recorded in the recent figures of the National Evaluation of Educational Progress is the persistent difference in performance between African-American students and white students, both locally and nationally.
D.C.’s average scores of white fourth graders over the past two years grew from 262 to 270 (on a 500 scale), but their African-American peers rose only three points, from 209 to 212.
In fact, the performance difference grew between 2007 and 2009, from 53 to 58 points.
Eighth-grade African Americans’ progress remained essentially fixed, dropping a statistically insignificant point from 245 to 244.
The average white scores were not included in the test results, because the sample size was not large enough.
Throughout a six-year extension, the picture is no more encouraging.
The difference separating white and black fourth graders in 2003, when the first ENPE was unveiled in the District, was 60 points on the scale (262 to 202).
Although scores achieved by children in both groups have increased during this period, the difference has barely been reduced to 58.
Some education lawyers in the District expressed concern last week, as advances celebrated by Rector Michelle A. El Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (Democrat), were largely driven by white students, who are already very good students.
This would suggest that we’ve improved the whole thing by serving those at the top of the scale, which is problematic and conflicting, said Jeff Smith, executive director of D.C. Voice, a nonprofit organization that advocates for educational equity in the District.
I’m not jumping for joy by a two or three point difference, said D.C. Council member Kwame R. Brown (Dem.-By Accumulation), who has a daughter in fourth grade Eaton Elementary.
Brown, an avid critic of Rhee’s administration style, said the message from the test scores is that the city’s high schools have a desperate need for attention.
Clearly, you always want to see positive signs, and I respect that.
But what worries is that we are not dedicating the time or energy needed for our middle schools.
Rhee said the District needs to continue to find better ways to address the needs of low-performing students.
This fall, for example, some teachers are being trained to use a new reading curriculum, the Wilson Reading System, aimed at high school and middle school students who have not mastered the fundamentals of early reading in their school courses and are considerably behind their peers.
Everyday Maths, a math curriculum from kindergarten to sixth grade, which emphasizes real-life games and experiences, was introduced to the District under former superintendent Clifford Janey, who is credited with some of the progress reported by ENPE last week.
I just think we have to keep working to offer the best interventions to those students who are below grade level, Rhee said.
Others say the ENPE results highlight the question of whether Rhee can continue to increase the overall performance of the system and still provide additional money and resources for low-performance schools, which will be needed to narrow the gap.
Here’s a sort of scathing dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, an education professor at the University of California at Berkeley, who studies urban test scores.
The conventional policy solution is to allocate its resources and administrative reforms to schools located in the poorest sections of the D.C.
Then the goal can generate political repercussions that go against that important timetable.
But the problem, of course, is that, like other urban overseers, she tries to cling to the white and black middle class.
Our focus is on ensuring that we build a system of excellent schools.
We need to strengthen our neighborhood schools so that all families, regardless of where they live, have confidence that their children can access excellent public education.
Janey, now superintendent of Newark schools, said in an interview this week that an essential element to end the performance difference is to extend the traditional public school year, currently 180 days in the District, to compete with autonomous schools.
It takes nearly 200 days to get the strength of change, Janey said, who reached an agreement with her teachers' union last year in a year of 185 days, which she sees as an "indicator" for seeking a further increase in the next convention.
Making Higher Education a Part of the Future
The tourist bus arrived at the University of Gettysburg with a strong resounding.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, went down and blinked for a moment before the white columns, the brick facades and the emerald meadows.
Graciela’s parents had barely graduated from a high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a college campus.
Still, when she and the other eighth graders explored Gettysburg, where tuition costs $38,690 a year, her attitude was less that of impressed guests than that of enthusiastic potential students.
Yes! That’s where I’ll be! exclaimed Graciela, who would like to study medicine, when the guide announced that they had entered the science building.
Caray, seriously?” he said thoughtfully, when the guide talked about the school’s low teacher-student ratio.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh the children had visited on their three-day trip, and they had already completely absorbed their deliberate message: The question is not whether you will go to college.
The question is to which.
While there is growing concern about the large number of children born in the United States to Hispanic immigrants who drop out of high school or become pregnant in adolescence, there are also hundreds of thousands who access university education they need to access the middle class.
In fact, one in five of these “second-generation” Hispanics graduates from college, a remarkable achievement given that many of their immigrant parents, mostly Mexicans and Central Americans, entered the United States without finishing high school.
Their success stories are important, the researchers say, because they point the way forward for a generation that will play a major role in the country’s workforce.
Those who analyze the highest-performing ones say they often have a natural affinity for school and an innate tendency to succeed.
Many also have parents who set high goals for their children and find ways to make up for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
But mentoring programs can also play an exceptional role in helping Graciela and millions of kids like her get to college, particularly if efforts are sustained over time.
Looking at low-income children, whose parents lack the experience and skills to help them navigate the system, it follows that any intervention at any time will not fix it, said Patricia Gándara, a researcher at the University of California, Davis, who has examined Latino students.
We have to think about providing a support network for these children, from kindergarten to high school.
The federal program that funded the Graciela University tour is a useful example.
Known as GEAR UP, it provides more than $300 million a year to local school systems, to run college-prepared programs, which begin when low-income students are in high school and continue through to high school.
Since 1999, the program has helped more than 10 million students, with more than 60 percent attending college, according to the U.S. Department of Education.
Iraqi oil ministry reaches agreements with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government managed to attract major oil companies to rebuild their fragile infrastructure, during two auctions that concluded on Saturday.
The 10 deals that the Iraqi oil ministry reached with foreign oil companies suggest that China, Russia and European oil companies are prepared to play a leading role in restoring Iraq’s oil industry, mutilated by decades of war and sanctions.
U.S. companies moved away after bidding on only two of the 10 auctioned sites.
Seven U.S. companies had paid to participate in the second auction, which began on Friday.
The only one who made an offer lost.
Two U.S. companies reached agreements for auctioned sites in June.
The poor representation of U.S. oil giants in the opening up of Iraq’s oil industry surprised analysts.
Iraq finally opened its doors after six years of war, and instead of American companies, there are Asians and Europeans at the head, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum, an online news center.
It will be a long time before anything else is on offer in Iraq.
Security concerns, accentuated by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday, and political instability as the U.S. military pulls out, likely prevented U.S. oil companies from taking a more energetic risk in Iraq, which has the world’s third-largest crude reserves, analysts said.
U.S. companies were at a disadvantage in some cases because rivals, particularly Chinese and other government-controlled energy companies, have considerably lower labor costs and are more likely to take risks because they do not respond to shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only U.S. companies to reach agreements with the ministry.
Major U.S. firms, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which have been close to the Iraqi oil ministry and have provided technical advice in recent years, have moved away empty-handed.
Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main protagonists in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The Chinese state-owned National Petroleum Corporation offered in more contracts than any other company and made large contract investments for two major deposits.
We know that China is on its way to becoming a major economic and technological power, said oil ministry spokesman Assam Jihad.
We are confident that the Chinese company will be on par with its competitors and will deliver on its commitments to Iraq.
The companies pre-selected to submit proposals made bids that were then confronted with the barrel subsidy the ministry was willing to pay to increase production above the current levels at each site.
Al Qaeda's chief planner has apparently been killed in Pakistan
An alleged U.S. missile strike on Pakistan’s border with Afghanistan is believed to have killed a top al-Qaeda operations planner this week, U.S. counterterrorism officials said on Friday.
If confirmed, this would be the second deadly attack on a high-ranking terrorist leader this fall.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arab men believed to have died on Tuesday when a pair of missiles struck his car near the city of Miran Shah in North Waziristan province, according to U.S. sources and Pakistani officials in the region.
Local authorities said the missiles were launched by an unidentified CIA-operated aircraft inside Pakistan’s illegal tribal zone.
They were driving a white car towards the Afghan border when the car was hit, a Pakistani civil intelligence official said, speaking on the phone from Miran Shah.
The official said the suspected local militants rushed to the site and quickly confiscated what was left of the "totally shattered bodies."
Local authorities were unable to verify the identities of the victims, but two U.S. counterterrorism officials cited unspecified evidence that Somalia was among the dead.
Somali was described as a high-ranking al-Qaeda military planner who led the terrorist group's operations outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
He devoted himself to conspiracy around the world, said a senior official, who spoke from the anonymity, citing the delicate nature of U.S. airstrikes within Pakistani territory.
Considering its central role, this probably included conspiracy attacks against the United States and Europe.
He had a strategic guidance from al Qaeda’s top command and translated it into operational patterns for potential terrorist attacks.
The second U.S. official said Somali had quickly ascended the ranks of al-Qaeda and was well-connected with other extremist groups in the region.
It may not be a well-known name for some Americans, but that in no way diminishes the threat it posed to us and our allies, the second official said.
If his death is confirmed, Somalia would be the second al-Qaeda leader or Taliban leader killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant faction in the tribal zone, and three other high-ranking agents.
The pace of CIA-led unmanned aircraft attacks has declined since summer, from an average of about six operations a month to two, according to a census by The Long War Journal, a website run by a non-profit organization.
The decline may be due to improved tactics by terrorist groups, which have taken steps to limit their vulnerability while ruthlessly killing suspected informants, the site said.
UN Highest Envoy in Kabul to Resign
U.N. envoy to Afghanistan Kai Eide said on Friday he would resign in March, ending a tumultuous term that was hurt by accusations of widespread corruption in the U.N.-backed presidential election in Afghanistan.
Eide’s departure comes when the Obama administration has decided to send some 30,000 additional U.S. troops to Afghanistan.
The U.N. envoy said he supports the increase, but is concerned that the U.S. military withdrawal schedule that begins in 18 months will prompt other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the preparation of Afghan security forces and send the right signal to Afghans so they can trust the international community, Eide said in a phone interview from Kabul.
Commitment has to be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also pressured the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international civilian officials, who are collaborating with the political transition of Afghanistan.
The increase in the military sector has to be reflected in the civilian sector, he said.
Eide said he was not resigning, but simply fulfilling a promise he made to his family in March 2008, to spend only two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to notify the secretary.
UN General Ban Ki-moon, so he had time to find a replacement.
What I've said is that it's better that they start looking for a successor, Eide said.
When I arrived here, there was a two-month gap between my predecessor’s departure and my arrival.
Ban has started looking for a replacement, according to UN officials.
Officials say they have been considering Staffan di Mistura, a Swedish-Italian citizen who recently led the UN mission in Baghdad, and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a Frenchman who previously led UN peacekeeping missions.
Eide’s position in Afghanistan was tested before his former delegate, Peter W. Galbraith, who accused him in September of favoring President Hamid Karzai in the country’s presidential vote and of covering up evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide denied the incriminations, but said Galbraith's accusations, who was fired, "certainly hurt the mission, because there was already a lot of skepticism about international interference" in the election.
Eide said he proposed the appointment of a high civilian representative to coordinate assistance efforts by U.S.-led forces in Afghanistan.
He also boosted UN leadership to allow his successor to hire more personnel from the United States and other Western countries, lending themselves to the Afghan mission, saying this would increase his confidence that his money is being used correctly.
Eide expressed frustration at the limitations on his powers in Afghanistan, arguing that cumbersome UN hiring regulations impaired his ability to capture talent.
The UN rules have allowed me to recruit only one person since May, he said.
That is catastrophic and cannot continue.
Gates: Iran will face additional sanctions
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said on Friday that world powers would soon impose "significant additional sanctions" against Iran, for its failure to enter into talks on its nuclear ambitions.
Gates, addressing a group of approximately 300 U.S. troops in northern Iraq, during a week-long trip to war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, disregarded the prospect of military action against the Islamic Republic.
There are no good options in Iran, he said, in response to a soldier’s question about the likelihood of such an event.
One of the things that weighs on me is that if we’ve learned something from Iraq over the past six years, it’s the inherent unpredictability of war.
The Obama administration is considering a package of sanctions aimed at Iran’s military and political elite, but Gates noted that some sanctions could also affect the Iranian population as a whole.
He argued that a “package of incentives and disincentives” would be needed “to persuade the Iranian government that they would actually be less secure with nuclear weapons”, because “its people will suffer enormously” the sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement by White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the administration joined European leaders to warn that Iran will face “credible” consequences if its nuclear program does not fully respect the directions of the UN Security Council and its nuclear control body, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran insists it wants to develop nuclear knowledge only for peaceful purposes.
In talks in Geneva on October 1, he said he would renegotiate the restriction of his nuclear program and agree to leave a substantial portion of his enriched uranium reserves in exchange for the fuel desperately needed for a medical research reactor.
The administration has pushed for such an agreement, as a way to build trust between the two sides and gain time for negotiations.
But since then, Iran seems to have drifted away from the tentative deals, in part, experts say, because the Iranian command is divided over the possibility of committing to the United States.
Frankly, I think Iran’s toughening with the international community over some proposals they actually accepted in early October has united the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, in a way they haven’t been in terms of significant additional sanctions against the Iranians, Gates said.
President Obama has set a deadline of December 31 for Iran to respond to the proposals, before reconsidering other options, including pursuing what Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton once called “devastating sanctions.”
In a statement made in New York, Iran’s mission to the United Nations denounced what it called Thursday “unfounded and baseless accusations” by some members of the Security Council on Iran’s nuclear activities, and said it was willing to continue talks with the United States and five other world powers, “in order to achieve a long-term, appropriate solution.”
Gates, who was due to return to Washington on Friday, met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Al-Maliki in the morning before flying to the oil-rich Kurdish region of Iraq to meet troops in Kirkuk and Kurdish officials in Irbil.
Tensions remain high between the Kurds and the Arab majority of Iraq, particularly with regard to borders, property rights and co-participation.
Gates urged both sides to diminish the potential for the conflict, to avoid any delay in U.S. projects, to reduce the number of U.S. troops from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
US officials quoted Gates’ words to Massoud Barzani, the president of the Kurdistan Regional Government: “We will preserve his security, prosperity and autonomy within a unified Iraq.
We will not abandon them.”
In an ageing China, a change of course
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters sermoning them about the fact that "Mother Earth is too tired to support more children" and "one more baby means one more grave."
They learned the lesson so well that when Shanghai government officials, alarmed by their city’s low birth rate and aging population, suddenly changed course this summer and began encouraging young couples to have more than one child, their reaction was instant and firm: No way.
We have already given all our time and energy only to one child.
We have nothing left for a second, said Wang, a 31-year-old human resources manager with an 8-month-old son.
More than 30 years after the one-child policy was introduced in China, creating two generations of notoriously hooked children, single malnourished children, affectionately nicknamed “little emperors,” a demographic crisis is emerging in the country.
The average birth rate has dropped to 1.8 children per couple, compared to six when the policy became effective, according to the Division.
UN demographics, while the number of residents aged 60 and over is projected to explode from 16.7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 percent by 2050. This is well above the global average of about 20 percent.
The imbalance is worse in rich coastal cities with highly cultured populations, such as Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and over accounted for nearly 22 percent of Shanghai’s registered residents, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of the Shanghai Commission on Family Planning and Municipal Population, said that fertile couples should have babies to “help reduce the proportion of the aging population and mitigate future labour shortages.”
Shanghai is about to be “as old (not as rich, however) as developed countries like Japan and Sweden,” he said.
A gradual relief
Drafted in the country’s 1978 constitution, China’s single-child policy is possibly the most controversial mandate introduced to date by the Communist Party.
Couples who violate the policy face huge fines, up to three times their annual salary in some areas, and labor discrimination.
Chinese officials have endorsed the policy for its contribution to avoid critical pressure on its natural resources, while human rights defenders have denounced abuses in imposing the policy.
In rural areas, some officials have forced pregnant women with a second child to have abortions.
In addition, many couples have had abortions according to the sex of the fetus, leading to a high unnatural male-female ratio.
In recent years, demographic officials have gradually softened their stance on single-child policy.
In 2004, they allowed more exceptions to the rule, including urban residents, members of ethnic minorities, and cases in which both husband and wife are single children, and in 2007 they mitigated many of their hardline slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at Beijing University’s Demographic Research Institute, said central government officials have recently been debating even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the spouses is an only child.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage more births.
Almost at night in the morning, the posters that ordered families to have one child were replaced by copies of regulations detailing who would be eligible to have a second child and how to apply for a permit.
The city government sent family planning officials and volunteers to visit couples in their homes and slide leaflets under the doors.
It has also promised to provide emotional and financial guidance to those who have chosen to have more than one child.
Family planning officials say the response has been very little overwhelming.
Disappointing response
Although officials in a rural city on the outskirts of Shanghai say they saw a moderate increase in requests from couples who want a second child after the campaign launch, more urban districts do not indicate any change.
The municipality of Huinan, with a population of 115,000, for example, is still receiving only four to five applications per month.
Disappointed Shanghai officials say that despite the campaign, the number of births in the city in 2010 is still projected to only reach around 165,000, slightly higher than in 2009 but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee in Shanghai’s Caolu municipality, said financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people don’t want more children.
They want to give the best for their first child, he said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said they would love to have two children and are legally qualified to do so.
But like many Chinese, they only have insufficient health and life insurance provided by the government.
Without a social protection network, they argue, that option would be irresponsible.
People in the West incorrectly view single-child policy as a matter of rights, said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is seven months pregnant with the couple’s first child.
Yeah, they're stealing from us the possibility of having more than one child.
But the problem is not just a political issue.
It's the money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons for their doubts.
Wang, the human resources manager, said she wants an only child because she too was: “We were the center of our families and we were used to everyone taking care of us.
We are not used to taking care of others and we really don’t want to take care of others.”
Chen Zijian, 42, owner of a translation agency, explained this in a more convincing way.
For parents with two middle-class careers who reduce the birth rate, he said, it’s about being successful enough to be selfish.
People between the ages of 20 and 30 grew up seeing their parents’ struggle during the first days of China’s experiment with capitalism and they don’t want that kind of life for themselves, he said.
Even a single child requires a lot of time from parents, he said.
A mother has to give up at least two years of her social life.
Then there are space issues, "they have to remodel their apartment," and the strategist "has to have a resume prepared for the best kindergartens when the child is 9 months old."
Most of his friends are willing to face this once, Chen said, but not two.
Ours is the first generation with the highest standard of living, he said.
We don’t want to make too many sacrifices.
A UN group outlines a plan to reduce emissions
The UN-sponsored climate conference, characterized so far by challenging stances and mutual recriminations, caught renewed attention on Friday with the release of a document that foresees ambitious reductions in greenhouse gases over the next 40 years, with industrialized nations carrying on their shoulders most of the time on their shoulders.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases, highlighted the remaining obstacles and highlighted the way forward.
But it was seen as a major breakthrough in a negotiation that is running out of time, with more than 100 world leaders arriving in Copenhagen next week.
Elaborated by a UN ad hoc working group, the text does not talk about how much money rich countries would give to the poor to tackle global warming in the short and long term.
And this offers a variety of options for key questions, including how developed economies and major emerging economies would cut their coal production, and what the limit of the global temperature rise political strategists would be willing to tolerate.
This gives a lot of flexibility to the process, said John Coequyt, senior representative in Washington for the Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who drafted the six-page document, summarized a 180-page negotiating text to focus on what the top UN climate official, Yvo de Boer, described as “the big picture.”
It shows the profiles for a possible agreement, in which industrialized nations would collectively cut their emissions by 2020 between 25 and 45 percent, compared to 1990 levels, while major developing countries would cut theirs during the same period between 15 and 30 percent.
Together, countries would cut emissions between 50 and 95 percent by 2050.
The European Union also spurred talks on Friday, promising to provide $3.6 billion annually over the next three years to help poorer countries adapt to the impacts of climate change, from floods and droughts to deforestation.
Anyway, Friday was the same kind of verbal fireworks that have dominated conversations last week.
U.S. Special Envoy for Climate Change Todd Stern rejected claims calling for mandatory greenhouse gas emission cuts for industrialized countries, compared to volunteers from major emerging economies, if they were not funded by the developed world.
The move indicated that the Obama administration is adopting a tougher line with China, compared to what Bush administration officials did just two years ago.
The United States will not make a deal without major developing countries moving forward and taking action, Stern said, who also regretted that the text did not do enough to ensure that the cuts could be verified by external observers.
Stern made his remarks an hour after Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister He Yafei said the top U.S. climate negotiator lacked “common sense,” or was “very irresponsible” for saying earlier this week that the U.S. would not help China economically cope with global warming.
With the future economic trajectory of the world’s major powers at stake, fault lines have erupted both within the developing world, as well as between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current battle is both to save individual economies and to save the planet, with China and the United States facing their respective obligations, while the poorest nations insist that the twenty-four most influential countries in the world are ignoring the scientific imperative to take the bravest action.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said it’s not surprising that major powers are arguing about who should be spending to limit greenhouse gases, even as vulnerable countries have become more aggressive seeking to contain the big emitters responsible for their actions.
This is clearly a game where a new economic hegemony is being developed, said Ulate, who also works as a regional climate change advisor to Mexico and Central America, for International Conservation.
Some of the countries most vulnerable to the impact of climate change indicated they would continue to push for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although most major participants say the talks will produce at most a political agreement.
The Alliance of Small Island States, which has 43 members, drafted a 24-page preliminary treaty proposal early on Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who heads international climate negotiations on behalf of the European Commission, said the push of small island nations has "put political pressure on the entire political process," in part because they are now unified and demanding action from emerging economies such as China and India.
The talks took on a new urgency as delegates focused on the fact that most of the exceptional issues must be resolved before the heads of government reach a deal.
High-level officials, such as Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and China’s deputy minister, disembarked and rushed to the corridors of the Bella Center, to closed-door meetings and press conferences, to be able to delineate the claims that will be arbitrated over the next week.
The absolute mess of the meeting (where every day 13,000 people come and go from the convention center, the guitar-playing activists present night shows mocking the countries they say are selling, and preliminary proposals hand in hand instead of by mail) poses a challenge.
The intensity only builds: almost all key ministers are here right now, and on Wednesday 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen.
We are entering the major leagues, said Carlos Manuel Rodríguez, vice president for the global policy of International Conservation.
The heavy weights are coming.
Britain’s first train at 225 km/h redefines Monday’s feeling
At 5.13 a.m. on Monday morning, a whistle will pierce the darkness to signal a train departure that marks a revolution for travel in Britain.
The country’s first high-speed intercity train will reach 225 km/h when it passes like a lightning bolt from Ashford, Kent, to London’s St Panrcas station, covering 93 kilometres in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Secretary of Transportation, will then be joined by Lady Kelly Holmes, aboard the first Javelin interurban service outside London.
He hopes the new service will finally connect Britain to an international network of fast, reliable trains and connect the major Midlands, North and Scotland conurbations to London.
Neglected remote areas would become thriving suburbs, business travel times would be shortened, and changing planes and cars to the railroad would reduce national carbon emissions, as well as alleviate road congestion.
In theory, the three main political parties believe in this vision.
But the tens of billions of pounds needed to build a new national rail network, the inevitable battle of planning and fears of environmental damage, can still curb Britain’s high-speed lines.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company set up in January to provide the government with a feasibility study, will deliver its report to Lord Adonis on December 30, the Times reported.
This will provide you with a detailed itinerary of the next stage planned for the high-speed network.
The new line linking London to the West Midlands will be drawn within a five-metre radius in urban areas and areas where the environmental impact may be controversial.
In rural areas, the plan will be drawn up within a 25-metre radius of a definitive route.
HS2 is also expected to set three options for a broader high-speed network heading north.
Lord Adonis will respond in spring.
The preferred option being proposed is a Y-shaped configuration, in which a single high-speed line would reach the West Midlands.
The line would be divided into or near Birmingham, with one branch heading west from the Peninsula to Manchester and Scotland, and another to the northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line would enter Scotland.
"It seems this will be the most beneficial option," said a member of the railroad.
Once completed, the travel time between London and Edinburgh would be reduced to 2 hours and 40 minutes.
The first stretch, which would not open before 2025, would allow passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to the current little more than an hour.
The proposals would allow trains to travel at 402 km/h, making the British network the fastest in Europe.
The initial track is being designed to support 400 mt long trains, capable of carrying 1,100 people.
Every hour at least 18 trains could operate from London to Birmingham.
This means that a London terminal capable of receiving 20,000 passengers per hour would be needed.
Considering the capital’s space constraints, an existing station is expected to be expanded to accommodate the high-speed network.
Experts in the rail industry argue that only St Pancras International or Euston Station offer that potential.
Lord Adonis will announce if he believes the scheme should proceed, but a broad public consultation and planning procedures mean that a final decision will not be made until after a general election.
Even if it starts the work, the network would have to be built in sections.
Initially, trains would be forced to leave the high-speed lines on existing lanes north of Birmingham, keeping travel times between London and Scotland above three hours.
This is seen as the crucial point necessary to ensure a change from planes to trains, a benchmark for the rail revolution.
Taxpayers Face Mortgage for a <0xC2><0xA3>75,000 Orange from a Conservative
Alan Duncan, the Conservative Party spokesman, charged the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year for the cost of an orange tree he built in his constituency’s house.
The party’s prison spokesman, who was demoted by David Cameron for complaining that MPs were living on “rations,” increased his mortgage by <0xC2><0xA3>75,000 to build an oak-framed extension in his second home in Rutland.
They allowed the taxpayer to charge the supplemental interest, adding hundreds of pounds a month.
The House of Commons authorities approved the applications at the time and have not been consulted by Sir Thomas Legg, who conducts a review of members' expenses. Last night Mr. Duncan said the applications "could not be clearer or simpler".
Mr. Duncan, one of the wealthiest Members of Parliament, owns a two-story house in a village in his electoral district of Rutland and Melton.
Nearby homes have been sold for nearly a million pounds.
The ground floor comprises a kitchen, living room and dining room, but the fee office agreed that Mr. Duncan needed more space.
Last year he added a greenhouse to the house, described in the plans as an "orange".
Neighbors described it as "a greenhouse for entertainment".
Mr. Duncan was not asked to make any reference to the increase in the loan, during a recent investigation by the House of Commons Committee on Standards and Privileges into his previous mortgage agreements.
Last month, the committee acquitted him of violating the rules, after an investigation into his expenses.
In 2004, Mr. Duncan exchanged the legal guarantee for a mortgage of <0xC2><0xA3>271,406 on his property from London to the house of his constituency, which he had bought in 1991, the year before becoming a deputy.
Documents released this week show that Mr. Duncan was applying for approximately <0xC2><0xA3>1,400 per month in mortgage interest until March last year.
In April, their applications increased to over <0xC2><0xA3>1,800 per month.
Mr. Duncan’s Royal Bank of Scotland mortgage interest rate did not change at the time, suggesting that the entire increase would finance the <0xC2><0xA3>75,000 loan.
The standard variable mortgage rate of the BRE fell from 7.94% in December 2007, to 4% in March of this year, the rate it is now.
The most recent document issued by the House of Commons authorities shows that Mr. Duncan continued to apply for <0xC2><0xA3>1,250 per month in May.
Duncan lost his job as Speaker of the House Opposition in September, after a covert reporter filmed him saying MPs had to survive "rations" after the spending scandal.
"Basically this is nationalized, you have to live on rations and be treated like shit."
He said: “I spend my money in my garden and apply for a small fraction based on what is appropriate.
And I could ask for a lot more, but I don’t.”
The deputy, a millionaire for his former profession as an oil merchant, was first questioned about his spending in May, when it turned out that he had requested thousands of pounds for his garden, before agreeing with the payroll office that this "could be considered excessive".
An activist dug a hole in Mr. Duncan’s lawn in the shape of the pound symbol after it was revealed that he requested 4,000 pounds for three years.
Last night, when asked about the mortgage increase, Mr. Duncan said: "It was for primary improvements, approved both by the payroll office and subsequently by Legg."
He added: “It’s not about circumventing and delinquenting or breaking the rules or whatever.
This is absolutely within the limits, according to the rules, authorized and everything.
It couldn’t be any clearer or simpler.”
Come those who have faith, to see the calendar of the Advent of the Brighton Beach Palapa
Brighton’s palapas have found a new impetus for the winter months in an interactive Advent calendar.
In addition, an alternative religious group that encourages spiritual exploration through creativity, invited 24 owners to decorate their palapas for each December day, using holiday dresses as their theme.
The event began on December 1st, with guests who could watch the last palapa from 5:30 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. every day, with stuffed cakes and ponche served for free.
The villancicos chosen so far include Vi Tres Barcos, Oh Ven, Oh Ven, Emanuel and The First Christmas, where the palapa presents the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, a 50-year-old Hove TV marketing assistant, is an unpaid clergyman from the Diocese of Chichester and the leader of Beyond.
He said, “We want religion to be more relevant to people in a post-Christian society.”
"Why do we as Church expect people to come to an old strange building? I think the Church should come to people and celebrate in exciting ways.
“The idea of the palapa advent calendar began as a conversation with some friends during a dinner.
Brighton is an incredibly creative and vibrant place and we’re trying to prove and represent that through spirituality.”
Massive climate mobilization in Copenhagen and around the world
Tens of thousands of protesters protested on Saturday in demand of an ambitious and binding deal to fight global warming, worldwide and in Copenhagen, where police detained several hundred people.
Some thirty thousand people, according to the police; hundreds of thousands, according to the organizers, paraded through the icy Danish capital in demand of an agreement that the United Nations Conference on Climate Change should reach by Friday, which would enter into force on January 1, 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, the Danish president of the Climate Conference, the growing mobilization for climate around the world, represented by these demonstrations, contributed to the "political price" of a failure in Copenhagen being very high.
The incidents erupted shortly after the start of the demonstration in the Danish capital, when a group of 300 people, all dressed in black, broke windows with tiles and hammers, an AFP journalist reported.
The riot police intervened swiftly and firmly.
The police announced the arrest of 600 to 700 people in total, according to her, especially members of the "Black Blocs", ultra-violent groups that had already acted during the NATO summit in Strasbourg, east of France, last April.
The Climate Justice Action (CJA) coalition, one of the organizers of the demonstration, denounced the conditions under which hundreds of militants were detained "without distinctions", underlining that a hundred of them "were immobilized in the street on Saturday night, handcuffed and seated despite the intense cold".
The demonstration, quite peaceful, left Parliament and took to the Bella Center, the seat of the negotiations.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the building without attempting to enter.
A stage was set up to welcome the invited speakers. Former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu, headed a candlelit vigil.
Most of the protesters arrived by bus and train from major European cities, but numerous Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, were also present, as were some Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly with skyscrapers, responded by forming a first concentration in the morning in Copenhagen to the call of Friends of the Earth to form "blue seas" for "justice and for the climate".
Today we take to the streets to demand compensation for the ecological debt in favor of the South, said Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino activist from the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can’t keep saying: there’s time, Beninese singer Angélique Kidjo said.
In Africa, there are dried rivers, watercourses that you can walk on like never before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, created in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the anti-globalization movement approached environmental organizations.
French MEP José Bové, a figure of anti-globalisation, explained that he came to Copenhagen to "unite climate justice and social justice": "Today the fight against global warming is not opposed to the fight for another world".
The Asia-Pacific region, which brings together numerous islands very vulnerable to warming, gave the initial footing to the demonstrations.
According to the organizers, about 50,000 people took to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, more than a hundred people, mostly students, paraded dressed in red and wearing scarves with slogans in favor of solar energy.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, as well as in Canada, there were concentrations of hundreds of protesters claiming to act vigorously against climate change.
In France, the demonstrations organized by the network "350" gathered hundreds of people, mainly in Paris, Marseille (South), Lille (North), Bordeaux (West) and Lyon (East).
In Geneva, dozens of people gathered.
Separatist Abkhazia elected president, although Georgia denounces "fraud"
On Saturday, Abkhazia, a pro-Russian separatist region of Georgia recognized by Moscow more than a year ago, elected president; however, Tbilisi denounces "fraud".
Some 131,000 people were summoned to participate in the first election after the Russo-Georgian war in August 2008 by the control of South Ossetia, another Georgian separatist region recognized by Russia.
The polling stations closed at 5 p.m. GMT.
According to the officials of the Abkhazian Electoral Commission, the participation was 58% a few hours before the closure.
The first provisional results would be announced on Saturday night.
The five running candidates, including outgoing President Sergue<0xC3><0xAF> Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which disapproved of the vote scrutiny.
This election is a farce.
Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili "deplores that Abkhazia has fallen under total Russian occupation," his spokesman Manana Manjgaladze said.
In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela recognized the independence of this territory of 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world considers it part of Georgia illegally occupied by Russian troops.
Following its separation from Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict that ended with several thousand deaths, Abkhazia tries to demonstrate through this election that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a stage in our new life, our new era as an independent state, said Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian, who claimed to have voted for Bagapch.
She was among the electors who went to the electoral table at a school in the capital, Soukhoumi, a beautiful white building with palm trees at the entrance.
The subject of Russian domination is the central theme of the presidential election in this region with sumptuous landscapes, on the shores of the Black Sea.
Large boards show Bagapch alongside the Russian president and prime minister, Dmitry Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, in different places in this small territory of 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, west of the country, the head of the district, Beslan Archba, warmly welcomed the Russian officials who came to control the development of the scrutiny.
In a brief ceremony, he said: We, the people of Abkhazia, appreciate Moscow’s support, and very particularly, the decision to recognize Abkhazia’s independence.
I hope that your country will be quickly recognized by the United Nations, replied Alexei Ostrovsky, a member of the Russian parliament, lifting his glass of vodka.
The opposition represented in the election by former vice president Raoul Khadjimba and two businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticizes the agreements signed with Moscow last year, as one that cedes to Russia the control of the Abkhazian railways for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, argues that he does not support the current government or the opposition.
It takes a 50% majority plus one vote to win the election.
If no candidate reaches this threshold, a second round will be organized two weeks later.
Climate: World demonstrations, incidents in Copenhagen
On Saturday, tens of thousands of people took to the streets of the world to demand an ambitious and binding deal before the Copenhagen Climate Change Conference, where police, on alert, detained more than 700 people around an imposing demonstration.
Some thirty thousand people, according to the police; hundreds of thousands, according to the organizers, paraded in the afternoon amid the cold of the Danish capital, which hosts delegates from 193 countries until December 18, in search of an agreement that should enter into force on January 1, 2013.
The demonstration, quite peaceful, left Parliament and headed for the Bella Center, where negotiations are taking place.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the center, without trying to enter.
A stage was set up to welcome the invited speakers. Former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu, headed a candlelit vigil.
A few moments after the demonstration began, a group of hundreds of people, all dressed in black, broke windows with bricks and hammers, an AFP journalist reported.
The riot police quickly surrounded them and intervened firmly, throwing several of them on the floor.
Police announced the detention of 600 to 700 people, stating that they were mainly members of the "Black Blocks", ultraviolent groups that had already acted during the NATO summit in Strasbourg, eastern France, last April.
In the late afternoon, a police officer was injured in the jaw with a dowel, and four cars were set on fire near an occupied house during the incidents that led to the arrest of about twenty people, according to police.
We did not take our eyes off the extremist groups, police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen warned, as law enforcement helicopters flew over the area.
Most of the protesters, who arrived by bus and train from the major cities of Germany, London, Amsterdam, even Milan, were of European origin.
But numerous Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, were also present, as were some Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly with skyscrapers, responded by forming a first concentration in the morning in Copenhagen to the call of Friends of the Earth to form "blue seas" for "justice and for the climate".
Today we take to the streets to demand compensation for the ecological debt in favor of the South, said Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino activist from the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.

French MEP José Bové, a figure of anti-globalization, told AFP that he came to Copenhagen to "unite climate justice and social justice": "Today the fight against global warming is not opposed to the fight for another world".
The Oxfam organization, along with former UN refugee commissioner Mary Robinson, who was to lead the crowd, mobilized several celebrities, including Danish model Helena Christensen.
The Asia-Pacific region, which brings together numerous islands very vulnerable to warming, gave the initial footing to the demonstrations.
According to the organizers, about 5,000 people took to the streets in Australia.
In Manila, hundreds of people, mostly students, protested in red dresses and wearing handkerchiefs with slogans in favor of solar energy in front of the Philippine capital’s City Council.
In Hong Kong or Jakarta, hundreds of protesters demanded action against climate change.
In France, the demonstrations organized by the network "350" gathered hundreds of people, mainly in Paris, Marseille (South), Lille (North), Bordeaux (West) and Lyon (East).
In Geneva, dozens of people gathered.
The subject of history and geography comes reinforced from the reform of secondary education, according to Chatel
The Minister of National Education, Luc Chatel, stated in an interview that will be broadcast in the Informatif de dimanche (JDD, according to its French acronym) that history and geography would be "strengthened" by the reform of general secondary education, despite being removed from compulsory education in the second year of scientific bachelor's.
From now on, all first-grade students will have four hours a week and the same program for a shared common culture, Chatel says.
For the Minister, "enough with hypocrisy" because, according to him, "branch C is no longer a scientific branch", but "in general, it summons the best students".
The General Teaching and Literary branches cannot be sub-branches of the C, he goes on to underline even: "I also did not hear that historians or intellectuals were outraged for having eliminated history and geography in second-degree tech schools."
An IFOP survey published on Saturday in L'Humanité revealed that approximately seven out of ten (69%) French voters disapproved of the government’s plan to eliminate compulsory history-geography teaching in secondary school C. Numerous intellectuals and teachers, the left and some elected representatives of the right, also criticized this fact.
Instead, the Minister added that "no talk" of removing philosophy from the C-secondary program.
Luc Chatel also advocated teacher training reform, while 16 organizations (students and trade unions) called for a mobilization day on Tuesday to protest against the project, which they say sacrifices the pedagogical training of future teachers.
In Master 2 (M2), at the beginning of the year they will pass an admission test that will aim at their discipline, and at the end of the year, an admission test on their ability to teach, the Minister explained.
In addition, they will be practicing in real conditions during the M2 year, then they will be a first year in front of the classroom as internship teachers.
If you do all the proposed practices prior to the competition, you will already have a great experience in front of the classroom, that is, more than 300 hours, he added.
Finally, the Minister points out that he will propose "the individual right to education, which does not exist in national education".
He also confirmed the project to remove the school map "before 2012".
At the Normal School Superior, experts will have 15 minutes to convincingly explain the evolution of the climate
Fifteen minutes to talk about the challenges of the Copenhagen summit, a challenge that Jean Jouzel, vice president of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) invited by the Ulm Street Higher Normal School, accepted Saturday morning.
Jean Jouzel, also Nobel Peace Prize laureate, inaugurated the "Ernest" conferences, a day composed of a series of 15-minute expert presentations, filmed and open to the public, an AFP journalist reported.
We wanted to do something that attracts people and convey to them the desire to know more, explained during the conference Edouard Hannezzo, 22, one of the organizers of this so-called day as the students baptized the fish in the school pond.
We chose about twenty participants from the experts in their discipline and selected them for their charismatic side, he said.
About global warming, "we can talk for hours, but we can also talk about key targets in a few minutes," Jean Jouzel, who exposed without notes but with the help of graphics in front of about fifty people, told AFP.
It’s part of our scientific role, he stressed, hoping the public understands that “the Copenhagen conference is based on an extremely serious scientific record.”
The videos filmed during those lectures will be online on the school’s website from December 15.
The next "Ernest" day is planned for February, followed by others at a bi-monthly pace.
Delay in payments: disgust among prison guards, plans to take action
Prison guard unions called on Friday for a "general mobilization" to demand payment before the holidays, bonuses and overtime, which was postponed until January for budgetary reasons.
The Prison Workers' Force (2nd Guards Union) asked the out-of-service personnel to join the demonstration Tuesday morning in front of the prisons and "block" them to report the theft of their belongings.
The CGT penitentiary (3rd trade union of the profession) calls them to "meeting in general assemblies in the different prisons to achieve a massive mobilization", since it is "shameful and unacceptable" the failure to pay in December the "extra hours, night premiums, Sundays and holidays" worked in October.
And the first union of guards, the Federal Autonomous Penitentiary Union (UFAP/UNSA), "convenes the general mobilization (...) in order to increase discontent and fury".
The Directorate of the Prison Administration and the Ministry of Justice explain that overtime increased significantly in 2009 and not all were accounted for, but they assure that the balance will be paid in January.
At the last hour of the day, the Chancellery reported that Michèle Alliot-Marie had sent a letter to the unions of guards guaranteeing that the payment would be made next month.
I do not doubt the efforts made by staff for the operation and modernization of our prison system, writes the Minister of Justice in this letter.
I asked the Directorate of the Prison Administration to immediately implement a set of measures aimed at ensuring that this situation generated by a poor evaluation of the number of extra hours does not occur again in the future.
December’s pay will then be scarce, except for management staff who enjoy the benefit of the famous bonuses for functions and for objectives, and who “always blames budgetary demands,” Ufap/Unsa regretted.
It is a real scandal, said the Marseille interregional FO union indignant, announcing its decision to boycott until new order "all meetings and convocations".
Staff will not come to work on Sundays and holidays if the October ones are not paid in December, the same will happen with overtime, also threatens FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
At a time when our tasks and missions are increasing without taking more staff, it is more than regrettable to dare to attack the salaries of staff, the CGT Prison of Bordeaux estimates.
According to the trade unions, not all regions are the same, as some are more fortunate than others.
But anyway, the result is not the expected, Ufap secretary-general Jean-François Forget said.
For Christmas, Obama says he makes “better gifts” than the ones he receives
U.S. President Barack Obama, who will celebrate his first family Christmas in the White House, confessed to the famous TV presenter, Oprah Winfrey, who came to a simple conclusion as to the gifts: “I make better gifts than the ones I receive.”
During a special interview that ABC will air on Sunday night, the President and his wife Michelle explain how they plan to celebrate the end of the year at their new and prestigious residence.
Even Bo, the family’s little four-legged companion, will be out of the game.
Santa also loves Bo, Michelle Obama said, clarifying that the dog will receive “of course” a gift, according to excerpts from the program broadcast in advance.
And Michelle Obama disagreed with her husband’s claims about the quality of the gifts she receives: “By no means, last year I made you nice gifts,” she said provoking the president.
True, he was forced to admit it before responding humorously pointing at the First Lady's pearl necklace: "Who gave you that?"
During the one-hour interview, in a relaxed atmosphere with the famous cheerleader who devotedly supported Barack Obama’s presidential campaign, the president and his wife also remembered their favorite childhood gifts.
Barack Obama recalled a two-speed bike, as well as a basketball that his Kenyan father, whom he rarely saw, gave him for Christmas.
I remember that time when my father came to see us at Christmas and gave me a basketball, the President said.
Only many years later, I learned that he had given me that ball.
For his part, the First Lady remembered her dollhouse.
I had no idea how to organize a house, so I put all the furniture online against the wall, instead of accommodating them around the house, yet I loved that dollhouse, said Michelle Obama.
Johnny Hallyday again operated on, RTL claims to be in coma induced
Johnny Hallyday was again intervened in Los Angeles due to major "injuries" stemming from an operation in France, but the situation is "under control" according to his relatives, while RTL claims the singer was subjected to an induced coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker was again intervened on the night of Wednesday to Thursday at Cedars-Sina<0xC3><0xAF> hospital in Los Angeles where some doctors checked for "injuries stemming from the operation" of disc herniated disc performed in Paris on November 26, his press service in that same city said, indicating that such injuries "needed a restorative operation".
However, the singer's press service tried to convey tranquility stating that the situation was "under control", and reported that a new medical part would be communicated within the next 48 hours.
According to RTL, sponsor of the singer's last tour, Johnny Hallyday accepted, however, to be subjected to an induced coma to avoid "pain and complications."
In less than 48 hours when the patient wakes up, we will be more certain about his condition, adds RTL.
The press service, questioned by AFP, did not confirm or comment on the information.
RTL also claims that "according to some sources" no cannulas would have been introduced after the first operation in Paris.
The rocker had been operated on at the Monceau Park International Clinic due to a herniated disc.
The intervention, scheduled for a few days, was performed by neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known physician in the artistic environment.
On Thursday night, Delajoux declined to comment on the information transmitted by RTL.
Singer Johnny Hollyday was admitted to Cedars-Sina<0xC3><0xAF> hospital in Los Angeles on Monday for an infection stemming from Delajoux’s intervention.
Singer Eddy Mitchell, a close friend of Johnny Hallyday, explained on RTL on Thursday that his friend was going through "a bad time," but said there was "no problem" because the rocker is "a fighter."
He called me just before he traveled to Los Angeles, and I told him it was nonsense to take a 12-hour flight after such an operation, it's not possible," Mitchell said.
On Wednesday night, the musician's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, pretended to reassure, stating that Johnny Hallyday, "reacted satisfactorily to antibiotics" and that the infection was "controlled".
Camus said he had spoken to Laeticia, the musician's wife, and that he had not noticed any particular concern.
But the singer's health problems have multiplied since July when he was interned for nine days in the wake of a fall on his yacht.
Two months later, for general surprise, Johnny Hallyday revealed he had been operated on from a “colon cancer” after a mild infection.
In late September, the singer resumed, as planned, his long "Gira 66", presented as his farewell tour.
Fanatics and journalists noticed the musician’s difficulties in moving on stage, and the musician’s difficulty in moving on stage.
In mid-November, his relatives even had to deny a new hospitalization.
Euro-2009/short pool: Bousquet's first title at his favorite distance
Frenchman Frédérick Bousquet, triple medalist at the 2009 Long Pool World Championships, won an international title on Thursday at a distance for which he feels particular affection, 50 m free, during Euro-2009 in short pool in Istanbul.
On the first day of this competition in which the polyurethane swimmers were last allowed, only three world records were surpassed when in fact many more were expected.
One was improved by the Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto in 200 m 4 styles; and the other two, by the Russian in relief 4 x 50 m 4 styles (male).
A penalty for Bousquet, who coveted the world record in 50 m free, brand he owns in long pool (20.94).
In one of the two distance queens of swimming, in 50 m free, the 28-year-old Frenchman prevailed with 20''53 during a final where ten swimmers competed instead of eight as usual, a primacy at the international level.
Bousquet was ahead of Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but failed to lower the world mark (20.30), as planned.
We can always aspire to something better and, in that case, I already said that if the world record was within my reach, I would try to achieve it.
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers wore polyurethane swimsuits that from January 1 will be banned.
These swimmers, originating from 238 world records since February 2008, end their epic in Istanbul, where they first competed in 1999 for the same test.
This time the wearing of the swimsuits did not help the German Paul Biedermann, double world champion in the long pool this summer in Rome, consecutive world records.
The young swimmer failed to lower his mark in the 400 m freestyle (3:32.77), however, he prevailed with the second best time of his career (3:34.55), against the Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and the Danish Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
I didn’t give up thoroughly in this race.
I knew that this time I would not be able to break a world record, but I managed to defend my title and fulfilled my mission.
Lobintsev will be a tough rival in the future, Biedermann explained.
U.S.: Zola-owned sarcophagus panel sold for $1.5 million
A Roman sarcophagus panel belonging to French writer Emile Zola sold on Thursday for $1.5 million, well above the estimated price, Sotheby's art dealer announced.
This panel, 2 meters long by 63 cm high, dates from the 3rd century AD, and its price had been estimated between $150,000 and $250,000.
The marble "representing four Dionysian scenes, in a sophisticated architectural setting, surrounded by satire and drunken women, is an unusual piece, as there are only four or five in the world," Florent Heintz, vice president of art auctions of ancient Rome and Egypt at Sotheby's, told AFP on Tuesday.
It was sold in a hundred lots.
The sale continues, but so far, this lot was the most bidded by buyers, no doubt, Sotheby's spokesman Dan Abernethy told AFP.
Just a few days ago, it was discovered that marble was an acquisition of Emile Zola.
For nearly 300 years, the panel was part of the famous collection of the Borges family in Rome, then appeared successively in the house of French actress Cécile Sorel, as an element of her bathtub in her particular Parisian mansion, and in the house of Paul Raynaud, minister of the Third French Republic and president of the Council for a short time, before Marshal Pétain took the power.
For about fifty years, his whereabouts were uncertain.
Reviewing the Louvre database, Florent Heintz discovered that this panel was part of an "Emile Zola succession" opened in 1903, a year after the death of the author of "Thérèse Raquin" and the fresco of the "Rougon-Macquart".
Honduras aborted Zelaya's departure to Mexico
On Thursday, Mexico estimated that conditions were not given to move to its territory the ousted president of Honduras, Manuel Zelaya, whom the coup government denied the safe conduct.
At the moment, after a telephone conversation at night with President Zelaya, everything seems to indicate that there is no possibility of carrying out the transfer, Mexican Foreign Minister Patricia Espinosa said.
The Mexican government plane that arrived in El Salvador on Wednesday to take Zelaya back to its place of origin, according to a source from the General Directorate of Migration.
To grant him a bailout, the coup government wanted to force Zelaya to “renounce” and seek political asylum abroad.
But the ousted president refused because he wanted to come to Mexico as a visiting head of state.
The coup government "suffered a new defeat by asking me to resign from my office (...), they wanted me to present my resignation," Zelaya told Globo radio on Thursday, in which he has often made statements since the start of the five-month political crisis in the Central American country.
Here I can stay ten years, I have my guitar, added the deposed president, who has been a refugee at the Brazilian embassy in Tegucigalpa for two and a half months, playing chords.
The Mexican embassy presented us with a request for a bailout, but unfortunately we could not accept it because it did not contain an asylum application, Interior Minister Oscar Raúl Matute told Honduran radio HRN on Wednesday.
I will not ask for asylum from any country,” Zelaya said in an interview with Telesur, which is headquartered in Caracas.
If I leave Honduras, I will do so as president of the Honduran people, he stressed.
Rumors about Zelaya’s departure mobilized supporters of the deposed president, who gathered around the heavily besieged Brazilian embassy.
Brazil’s Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticized the government’s stance.
This reflects the marginal character of this government vis-à-vis international norms, he estimated.
Zelaya, who had approached Venezuela’s socialist president Hugo Chavez, was overthrown on June 28, a day when he had organized a referendum to prepare for his re-election, rejected by the Supreme Court, the army and Congress.
Since his exile in Costa Rica, he returned surprisingly on September 21 and took refuge in the Brazilian embassy.
If he leaves, he will be arrested and will have to answer to the Justice for the crime of "high treason", according to the coup government.
De facto President Roberto Micheletti managed to hold a presidential election on November 29 to replace Zelaya.
The election was recognized by the United States, but questioned by Latin American countries, such as Venezuela, Argentina and Brazil.
Three days later, Congress voted massively against Zelaya’s return to power until his term ended on January 27.
Wall Street rises, U.S. trade balance fuels optimism
The New York Stock Exchange closed up on Thursday, U.S. trade balance figures are a faithful witness to the economic revitalization of both the United States and its partners: the Dow Jones won 0.67%; and the Nasdaq, 0.33%.
According to the definitive figures at the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced 68, 78 points reaching 10,405.83 points, and the technology component Nasdaq, 7.13 points reaching 2,190.06 points.
The expanded Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1,102.35 points.
We receive good news from different sectors of the economy, said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
But this is anecdotal, he clarified, considering that the market was concentrated "in the half-full glass".
For Peter Cardillo, of Avalon Partners, investors focused mainly on the figures of the US trade balance, “which reflect an improvement in activity in the fourth quarter.”
The U.S. trade deficit fell 7.6% in October from September to $32.9 billion.
Analysts, on the contrary, expected a deepening of the deficit.
Both imports and exports increased.
The big news is the growth in trade volumes, particularly goods exports, which reflect the growth of the major economies trading with the United States, said Christopher Cornell, of the research firm Economy.com.
In contrast, last week, unemployment registrations in the United States rose unexpectedly, 474,000 applications were filed.
But over the past four weeks, the average number of new job seekers “was the lowest in a year,” said Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market has fallen.
The yield of the 10-year Treasury bond rose to 3.482% against 3.423% on Tuesday night, and that of the 30-year bond to 4.492% against 4.408% the day before.
Cuba: more than a hundred supporters of the power abjure the "Ladies of White"
On Thursday, hundreds of supporters of Cuban power harassed the wives of political prisoners gathered in Havana for World Human Rights Day and prevented another demonstration to which a dozen dissidents were summoned.
Some forty “Damas de Blanco”, wives or relatives of political prisoners, were assaulted on the street by supporters of Raúl Castro’s government as they walked towards the center of the capital demanding the release of those detained, an AFP journalist said.
The Yankees are dead!, "Mercenaries!", "The street belongs to the revolutionaries!", "Long live Fidel and Raúl!" shouted with their fists high up the militants of the power to the dissidents.
The latter were escorted by civilian-dressed agents who came to “protect” them.
On the eve, a similar demonstration was unleashed against the "Ladies of White" in Havana, without injuries or arrests.
But in the Havana neighborhood of Vedado, a dozen dissidents who were also preparing to protest on Thursday for International Human Rights Day, were detained by police officers dressed in civilian clothes, an AFP journalist reported.
Agents forced dissidents to drive up the vehicles who were harassed by supporters of the government, according to the journalist.
In general, the arrest of dissidents under such circumstances lasts only a few hours.
The "White Ladies", awarded with the Sakharov Prize 2005 awarded by the European Parliament, had organized an unauthorized march to "request the release of all political prisoners", some 200 according to the dissent, said one of their leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband, Hector Maceda, purges a 20-year prison sentence.
Maceda is part of the group of 75 Cuban dissidents imprisoned in March 2003, of whom 53 remain behind bars.
Cuban authorities vilify opponents of "mercenaries" or "agents" on the salary of their declared enemy, the United States.
Rarely reported in the media, Cuban television reported on Thursday's demonstration of government militants against the "counter-revolutionaries".
Cuba, ruled by a single party, the Communist Party, is constantly accused by European or American NGOs of trampling on rights and freedoms, especially those of expression.
A stranger kills an octogenarian with a knife and leaves 5 wounded in Clichy-la-Garenne
An unbalanced man with two knives killed an 80-year-old man and wounded five others in the centre of the city of Clichy-la-Garenne on Thursday at the peak of the afternoon.
According to the first elements of the investigation, the 28-year-old aggressor was reported to have hit an elderly man with two knives and for reasons not yet determined, at the pharmacy or in front of it at No. 85 of Jean-Jaurès Boulevard, police sources and witnesses reported.
As a result of the serious injuries, the 1929-born man died in the hospital, according to a spokesman for the Alliance police union.
Then in the pharmacy or in front of it, he attacked a pregnant woman who was with her partner.
The husband, about thirty years old, interposed and was wounded.
The first two victims, seriously injured, were taken to the hospital where the elderly man died.
The life of the other wounded, with the vital organs apparently affected, is in danger.
Then the pregnant woman suffered a fainting and was hospitalized "in a state of shock," a police source said.
The gunman, who appeared to be under the effects of alcohol or drugs, according to a police source, would have escaped by Jean Jaurès Boulevard.
Apparently by chance, he would have wounded two more pedestrians: one thirty-year-old man, and another forty-year-old seriously.
At night, the crime scene was still unclear.
He was armed with two butcher’s knives that he was carrying crossed on his back, Arnaud Presse, a trade union official in the Upper Seine, said at the scene.
Several passers-by, including young people, attempted to control the alien, according to testimony obtained by AFP.
I saw a 30-year-old guy in a green jacket.
Three young people tried to intercept him.
They didn’t make it because the guy was strong, Alberto, a waiter at a nearby bar, explained.
A crowd hurled at him, including a police officer who broke his wrist, he added.
By Boulevard Jean-Jaurès, at the height of No. 61, two municipal agents, including the chief, attempted to arrest the gunman and were wounded in punches, according to police testimony.
The events occurred in one of the main arteries of Clichy-la-Garenne, where numerous shops are located.
Some people came to tell me there was an injured man on the street.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old gentleman on the floor. When I put him in a safe position, I noticed a very important wound in the abdomen, told AFP Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist.
Five minutes later, a second person, about 35 years old, arrived with knife wounds.
National police officers detained the man without identity papers.
The Nanterre Prosecutor ' s Office submitted the investigation to the jurisdiction of the Departmental Service of the Judicial Police of Altos del Sena (SDPJ 92).
The madman was hospitalized Thursday night.
During his detention, he did not say a word.
A police source does not rule out the possibility of him being admitted to a psychiatric hospital.
According to another police source, it took six police officers to dominate him at the Clichy police station where he was transferred.
He was "in a state of overexcitement" as "any disordered of this kind whose forces increase considerably under the effect of action."
US: Polanski's lawyer again calls for the case to be dismissed
The lawyer of the Franco-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski again claimed Thursday in Los Angeles (California, West of the United States), that the case against his client, who is under house arrest in Switzerland, is dismissed for a case of sexual abuse that occurred more than 30 years ago.
Chad Hummel, a lawyer for the director of The Pianist, denounced three California Second District Appeals Chamber judges for serious procedural errors at the time of the events, in 1977.
Hummel said: "I demand that the charges be dismissed at this very moment, as the conduct of the judge in charge of the case at that time, Laurence Rittenband, "was terrifying."
According to him, Judge Rittenband (deceased since) would have spoken to a prosecutor who would have told him that Roman Polanski deserved to go to prison, before dictating a sentence, which constitutes a serious lack of procedure.
This conversation was made public in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" (Roman Polanski, sought and desired), from the very mouth of the prosecutor in question, David Wells.
But at the end of September, Wells finally declared "having lied" to the author of the documentary.
Hummel called for a trial that would allow him to present evidence of his argument in case the court rejects the dismissal of the case.
The prosecution, for its part, reiterated the argument put forward in the first instance, namely that no dismissal of the charges could be seriously assessed as long as Roman Polanski did not appear before the court.
The 76-year-old filmmaker fled the United States in 1978 before his conviction for “illegal sexual relations” with a 13-year-old girl was dictated.
Since then, he has never stepped on the United States again.
Los Angeles Deputy District Attorney Phyllis Asayama said Roman Polanski “has to be here to appear in the hearing.”
With this cause, we want to convey the message, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other accused, that there is a possibility of fleeing?
For her, the filmmaker "demands a favor from the court, although he despises his authority".
One of the three judges, who now have 90 days to pronounce his sentence, also stressed "that there were other alternatives to the decision to flee."
Hummel was not the only one asking to dismiss the case against Roman Polanski.
Samantha Geimer’s lawyer, the victim, also claimed, once again, to close the case.
She claims that her client no longer can stand being harassed every time the Polanski case resurfaces, adding: “No one in this room can say that the procedure was fair.
Thirty-two years is enough.”
Roman Polanski was arrested on September 26 in Switzerland on a U.S. arrest warrant.
After more than two months behind bars, he was sentenced to house arrest in his Gstaad hut, awaiting eventual extradition.
Wall Street loses direction and slows down due to the rise of the dollar
The New York Stock Exchange closed without direction on Friday, in a market that is debating between better-than-expected indicators in the United States and the dollar's rise: the Dow Jones won 0.63%, but the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to the definitive figures at the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 65.67 points to 10,471.50 points, while the technology component Nasdaq lost 0.55 points to 2,190.31 points.
The expanded Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 0.37% (4.06 points), reaching 1,106.41 points.
Honestly, the market is very quiet, said Mace Blicksilver, of Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains with narrow margins, the volume of exchanges is increasingly reduced and I think it will remain so until the end of the year.
The trend was sustained by the publication of better-than-expected economic indicators, which "helped improve market opinion as to the robustness of economic revitalization," the analysts at Charles Schwab summarized.
In the United States, retail sales rose 1.3% in November for the second consecutive month and higher than expected.
In addition, U.S. consumer confidence rebounded visibly in December, 73.4 against 67.4 the previous month, according to the University of Michigan’s preliminary index estimate.
However, the indices were slowed by a new rise in the dollar that reached the highest level in the last two months compared to the euro, which "leads down to the sectors sensitive to the economic situation," explained Owen Fitzpatrick, of the Deutsche Bank.
In this way, technological values have lost ground.
The bond market has fallen.
The yield of the 10-year Treasury bond rose to 3.540% against 3.482% on Wednesday night, and that of the 30-year bond to 4.497% against 4.492% the day before.
The election of Miss World again in South Africa
After a month of touring South Africa, the 112 candidates for the Miss World title are in the final row to fulfill their dream: to be chosen the most beautiful woman in the world in front of a billion viewers.
During this great beauty celebration organized for the second year in a row in the vicinity of Johannesburg, five of them have already achieved their participation in the semi-final.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Pearl Beltran of Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo of Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino of Gibraltar and Yanbing Ma of Canada were elected Miss Athlete or even Miss Top Model during their stay in Africa.
It was a real riot.
It was extraordinary to visit beautiful cities like Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Town.
I saw a lot of things and experienced countless experiences!” said Miss Sierra Leone astonished.
This contest, which takes place for the ninth time in South Africa, will be broadcast live on Saturday from Midrand, North Johannesburg, starting at 17:00 (15:00 GMT).
It is impossible to imagine a better country to hand over my crown.
This experience was fascinating.
I am very happy to have lived twice, notes Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of the southern summer.
For the young Russian, her second stay in South Africa was marked by numerous exchanges with the candidates and the possibility of rediscovering "African landscapes that take your breath away".
After a month of galas, rehearsals, press conferences and safaris, Miss World candidates focus on the contest.
Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to follow in the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, winner in 2000 and present in this election, as well as those of Aishwarya Rai in 1994, both turned Bollywood stars.
Every woman’s dream is to be crowned as the most beautiful in the world, but it’s not just about appearance.
We are the ambassadors of our countries, and I want to return to my country with the crown, Miss India says with a big smile.
According to the organizers, music and dance will mark this 59th edition.
The candidates will parade in traditional dresses and, of course, swimsuits.
Chinese presenter Angela Chow, former South African beauty queen Michelle McLean, and Miss World committee leader Steve Douglas will lead the event.
South Africa has proven to be able to welcome the world with warmth and pride difficult to match, says Julia Morley, president of Miss World.
Like last year, the candidates went on a safari, visited the famous township of Soweto, but this time by bike, and tasted the local cuisine.
As an exceptional fact, they met South African President Jacob Zuma, who shook their hand.
Uncommon for a head of state, observes Miss Sierra Leone.
His best memory will undoubtedly be the draw in Cape Town (Southwest) for the World Cup in June 2010, a way for the country to further promote the event.
I dealt with people I never thought I'd get to know.
Probably back for the 2010 World Cup, says Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
Johnny Hallyday's news is 'very positive', says son David
The news about Johnny Hallyday "is very positive," his son David said on Friday when he arrived at Los Angeles airport to accompany his father who had been hospitalized for several days.
The news is very positive.
Dad is strong and everything is going very well, David Hallyday told the press as he got off the plane that brought him from Paris shortly after 1pm local time (21pm GMT).
The singer's relaxed son said he would move "as soon as possible" to Cedars-Sina<0xC3><0xAF> hospital in Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday was admitted on Monday for an infection stemming from a herniated disc surgery last November 26 in Paris.
The musician is "in a coma induced since that night in Los Angeles for comfort reasons, to prevent him from suffering and thus be able to administer his treatment," the press service said.
Johnny Hallyday had already undergone a coma induced by doctors at the Cedars-Sina<0xC3><0xAF> hospital in Los Angeles, where he entered on Monday for an infection, following a disc hernia operation on November 26 in Paris.
The singer was once again operated on the night of Wednesday to Thursday due to serious injuries caused by the previous intervention.
His wife Laeticia went to French high school in Los Angeles on Friday morning, attended by his daughter Jade, to witness a school event, an AFP photographer confirmed.
The head of Orthopedic Surgery and Traumatology at the Pitié-Salpêtrière hospital, Yves Catoné, announced that he would travel to Los Angeles on Monday to be with the singer.
The producer violently accused Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, the neurosurgeon who operated on the singer on November 26 at the Monceau Park International Private Clinic in Paris.
They told us it was a massacre.
Los Angeles surgeons said they were outraged, Camus said.
There is talk of a possible lawsuit, he said.
Camus claimed that Johnny Hallyday had "traveled too fast to Los Angeles with the authorization of the Parisian surgeon."
I spoke directly to the doctor and I was surprised when he assured me that there was no problem in making the trip, as I was operated on twice for a herniated disc.
Earlier on RTL, he said the singer had apparently "departed without cannula, without anything" after his Paris operation.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the artistic environment.
She operated on actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius, a few days before her death, at a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine where Delajoux was working at the time.
In 2007, she also intervened with actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to reabsorb a hematoma formed as a result of a cerebral hemorrhage.
This is a doctor with a bad reputation, convicted by justice on several occasions for misconduct, as well as for tax fraud and fraud.
Olivier Metzner, a lawyer for the Order of Doctors, accused him of being "an unscrupulous man" sued "regularly" before the Council of the Order, and is "far from being advisable".
After several days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux spoke Friday through his lawyer, David Koubbi.
He stated that the intervention was "performed without any inconvenience" and that the results of the postoperative studies were "normal".
The operation "could not cause hemorrhages and therefore did not need drainage," he added.
Either way, the singer’s tour, whose health problems have been multiplying since the summer, came in a blink of an eye.
Undoubtedly, resuming the tour on January 8 (in Amiens, NDLR) as planned, seems very risky to me, Camus said.
The association UDF raises the tone and warns the New Center about the use of its acronym
The association UDF (Union for French Democracy), controlled by the MoDem (Democratic Movement) of François Bayrou, reacted on Friday to the attempt of the President of the New Centre, Hervé Morin, to launch an OPA (Public Procurement Offering) on the acronym of the former party of the Giscard d'Azur, under the guise of a demand.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to regain the acronym UDF, considering that François Bayrou was not in a position to defend his political heritage after stretching out his hand to the left.
On the other hand, the Minister of Defense, whose party is associated with the UMP, had planned to confirm the strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the NC.
As a support to his management, he received the help of deputy Hervé de Charette (formerly UMP, present NC) who claimed ownership of the UDF brand, as he was the first to register it at the National Institute of Industrial Property in 2004.
But on Friday night, the office of the association UDF, controlled by friends of François Bayrou who do not want to be deprived of it, broke the silence to launch a request to the Minister and the MP by urging them to renounce the acronym and transfer the ownership rights of the brand, under penalty of lawsuit.
In recent days, you have made many statements insinuating that you would propose to your political movement to recover the acronym UDF, writes the association in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the office, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez del MoDem, as well as Senator Jean Athuis of the Alliance Centrist.
They also believe it is correct to continue with the use of the name of the movement, the +Nouveau centre+, and the slogan +l'UDF d'aujourd'hui+ in its militant material and on the presentation page of its site, the signatories of the letter argue.
As you already know, they have no right to use the acronym, explains the UDF office that demands that the NC "immediately remove the mention of the name of the UDF from all media, as well as from (its) website".
He also asks Hervé de Charette "to transfer the ownership of (the) trademark to the legitimate rightholders".
Failure to do so will be appealed to justice to enforce the law and the legitimate rights of UDF members, the signatories warn.
In the letter, they specify that the UDF "is a real political movement since 1978" and recall that Morin and his friends "chose" to leave in 2007 "to create a new party, as others had already done in 2002 to create the UMP".
Therefore, the New Centre has, according to them, no right to use the acronym UDF.
They also recall that the last congress of the UDF voted in 2007 for its membership of the MoDem for three years and the creation of an office in charge of defending "the material and moral interests" of the movement founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, the office continues, "when he registered the trademark", he was no longer a "member of the UDF for three years", but of the UMP.
It uses the absence of registration of the acronym UDF in a scandalous and fraudulent way to do it on its own.
This indiscretion is turning into crime, they denounce, before mocking the NC strategy: "We believe that in politics, as in life, it is more worthy to make your own name than to try to get out of anonymity by fraudulently taking a name to which you have no right".
Liliane Bettencourt: François-Marie Banier to be tried for abuse of weakness
On Friday, the Nanterre Court decided to sue the artist François-Marie Banier to determine whether, as billionaire Liliane Bettencourt’s daughter claims, she took advantage of the octogenarian’s state of weakness to rob her of a portion of her fortune.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his photos of stars of the show, will be tried on April 15 and 16, 2010, for abuse of weakness, a crime whose conviction consists of a maximum sentence of three years in prison and a fine of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>375,000.
This means that in this case there will be a process worthy of a saga about one of the richest families in France, in which mother and daughter dispute the rules of the L'Oréal cosmetics empire.
But the Correctional Court No. 15 also ordered 87-year-old Liliane Bettencourt to undergo a medical examination by three medical professionals.
The heir and main shareholder of L'Oréal has always refused to undergo such examinations, even more so under the conditions proposed by the Prosecutor's Office of Nanterre during the investigation.
Physicians appointed on Friday will be required to submit a report by March 10, 2010, stating whether Liliane Bettencourt suffered from weakness and for what periods.
I think he'll take it.
“I’m going to talk to her,” Mrs. Bettencourt’s lawyer, Georges Kiejman, said as he left the hearing.
Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers’ lawyer, Olivier Metzner, was pleased with the court’s decision.
It is excellent news (...) The expertise will show that he (Banier) manipulated this older lady, whom we must protect, he said.
For the past two years, Liliane Bettencourt’s only daughter has initiated criminal proceedings against François-Marie Banier, a photographer and multifaceted artist, accusing him of taking advantage for years of his mother’s weakness to obtain <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1 billion in donations, through checks, life insurance contracts or artwork.
For her part, Liliane Bettencourt has always denied being manipulated by the photographer, whom she considers a long-time friend.
On Friday, while the court was examining the origin of the action brought by Ms Bettencourt-Meyers, the lawyers’ allegations resulted, on some occasions, in a great family confession.
In this way, Liliane Bettencourt’s lawyer took into account three letters that her client sent to her notary (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) in which she said she distrusted Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers’ husband.
In the 2003 letter, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to the lawyer: "I could explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier between once and twice a day for fifteen years.
Since her wedding, I have never been able to talk to Françoise again.”
The Nanterre Prosecutor’s Office once again considered that the plaintiff was not in a position to appear, especially since a guardianship judge had refused, in recent days, to give way to her request to open a judicial guardianship procedure for her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "has full capacity to appear before the courts, is not under guardianship and has no guardian.
No one else will be able to appear in his place," said Prosecutor Marie-Chrsitine Daubigney.
Finally, the court decided that it would rule once the trial on the admissibility of Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers was conducted.
Management revolution or the end of business intelligence?
If nothing changes in the management of large French companies, our struggle for the development of business intelligence will have been in vain.
More than ten years ago, the attitude of the management of large companies towards their employees recalls the position of companies towards consumers before the marketing revolution: it is about employees adhering to "values" determined from above as before it was about imposing on consumers products thought by factory technicians.
By placing the customer at the heart of the company, the marketing revolution gave way to market conquest strategies... although the authoritarian temptation to impose products that have nothing to do with customer preference factors is repeated on a regular basis.
A demobilization of employees can end in deadly demoralization.
Suicides in France Telecom, PSA or Renault are just the tip of the iceberg of a much more general phenomenon that particularly affects executives.
This demobilization seriously compromises the development of all intellectual functions of the company, especially R&D and, even more, business intelligence.
Indeed, BI (Business Intelligence) "demands that all parties involved (...) have proactive conduct and a forward-looking vision"; it needs a commitment on the part of employees that is completely opposed to the recommendations of an authoritarian management.
For this reason, we called for a managerial revolution, which would consist of putting employees at the center of the company’s concerns as well as the customer.
Internal opinion polls have a relative utility
Will internal opinion polls, such as the questionnaire conducted by Orange among its employees, incite the managerial revolution in practice?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
-In principle, because I was able to verify that, in the face of a new situation, and after many laps, all companies end up doing essentially... what they always did! B989
Secondly, because authoritarianism, one of the pathologies of power, grows in proportion to the importance of its own failures.
-Finally, because most managers have a simplistic view of human behavior.
As they come from the great schools of engineers, they interpret psychology in a mechanistic way.
They adopt, for intellectual convenience, the ancient behaviorist theory that American “neurosciences” recently reactivated, and that the Institutes of Studies and the media spread widely behind their backs.
In this way, by suggesting that it is possible to handle the "commands" (sic) of executive engagement, a recent research by Ipsos published in Le Figaro.fr reaffirms the managers in a mechanistic management position, unsuitable for today's world.
Identify and measure mobilization factors
On the contrary, the management revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern enterprises, involves adopting a finalist vision of human behavior.
It consists in integrating in every reasoning or practice of business management, a fundamental fact: for employees, engagement with the company is only possible if it appears clearly as a means to make reality part of their dreams, ambitions and projects.
Today, only studies from Motifuncional Analysis adopt this conception of employee motivations.
Studies have shown that they judge their company based on a predetermined doxa that allows them, through the image they have of the company, to evaluate what the company offers them to achieve their own life projects.
By identifying and measuring mobilization factors, business managers can monitor, predict and anticipate their “social performance” and relocate human resources management “on the spot”.
In this way, they create a favorable terrain for the organized development of a strong and effective business intelligence.
Oslo Speech: Obama Receives Right Praise for 'Just War'
On Friday, the U.S. right, satisfied that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize had defended the concept of “just war” against U.S. enemies, hailed Obama’s speech on Thursday.
The Conservatives, who had discredited Obama’s Oct. 9 award, this time applauded the presidential speech, as did Sarah Palin, former vice presidential candidate during the 2008 election.
I loved what she said, Mrs Palin, a leading figure in the Republican party’s right wing, told USA Today, adding that she herself had addressed the issue of “sometimes necessary” war in her recently published memoirs.
In my opinion, war is, of course, the last thing Americans want to be forced to do, but it is necessary.
The terrorists must be stopped, he said.
Obama, who inherited the two wars of his predecessor George W. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan, dedicated himself, on Thursday in Oslo, to justifying the use of force, a way to explain his decision to send 30,000 more soldiers to Afghanistan nine days earlier.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, considered that the president had done "a very good job" in Oslo.
I think the speech was really very good, the former Speaker of the House of Representatives rejoiced, who particularly appreciated the mention of "the existence of evil in the world" in the presidential words.
For a moment, the speech seemed very historic, Gingrich said, during an interview on the radio show "The Takeaway".
The former elected representative, whom some regard as a possible candidate for the Republican investiture for the 2012 presidential election, was pleased to hear "a leftist president" when he reminded Nobel Committee members "that they would not be free nor could deliver a peace prize if the use of force did not exist."
According to Michael Gerson, author of George W. Bush’s speeches and current Washington Post columnist, Obama delivered “a very American speech.”
In addition to presenting himself as a “citizen of the world,” as “always does,” he “talked like an American president” by reminding Europeans “that they live in a security bubble that they didn’t create and that they don’t do much to preserve it,” Gerson said.
Among the few not-so-convinced right-wingers, a Bush-era falcon, former U.N. ambassador John Bolton, called the speech "monotonous, pretentious and lacking in inspiration" on the National Review Online website.
On the left of the president, Democratic Representative Dennis Kucinich was alarmed to see Barack Obama justifying the use of force.
When we cover war with the notion of justice, it is easy to justify the massacre of innocents, he warned.
However, the center-left press praised the president.
Los Angeles Time, while still believing that Obama received the Nobel Prize prematurely, called his speech "superproduction" especially for a speaker known for his talent.
Oslo's speech "should serve as a roadmap to guide international decisions in the fight against conflict, poverty and oppression," the California newspaper said with enthusiasm.
Obama “pronounced the speech that was necessary,” the New York Times estimated, judging it “at the same time bleak and uplifting.”
Road Transport: Three Marathon Negotiations to Ensure Christmas Supply
After three sessions of marathon negotiations, the road trade unions and the TLF (Transport and Logistics of France), the only employers' organization that remained until the end, reached an agreement on Friday afternoon that puts an end to the strike slogan and the threat posed to Christmas supplies.
During the signing session on Friday night, Transportation Secretary Dominique Bussereau "rejoiced" about the deal, after several negotiating sessions that began on Wednesday morning.
After a second night of discussions, the negotiators bid farewell at dawn on Friday in the hope of quickly signing the text in accordance with the last hour of the morning.
Even when three employers’ organizations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) withdrew giving a break.
But a more than six-hour meeting that began at 11 a.m. was necessary for everyone to agree and the text to be signed at 6 p.m.
The conflict "would have been very damaging to businesses" and "would have been feared to disrupt the holidays," Bussereau said.
The text foresees an increase of 4% for the lowest wages (in local and regional road transport), and of 2.9% for the highest (international transport).
The hourly rate rises from 8.72 euros to 9.06 for low wages.
It's not much, but we started with a lot of disadvantage, Patrice Clos (FO) explained.
If so, we will give the order to our militants that there will be no more cuts or blockades in the supply centers.
But there can always be some dissatisfied rebel, he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of the TLF, acknowledged that this is a "good deal", although it was "difficult to grant increases to high wages given international competition".
According to him, the increases will be on the order of 170 euros per month for low wages and 100 to 120 euros for the highest.
It is a common sense agreement that respects wage earners, Maxime Dumont (CFDT) said, while Thierry Douine (CFTC) recognized it as "a historic agreement".
For Richard Jaubert (CGT) it is "an acceptable commitment".
The agreement also foresees an increase in travel costs of 3% and the holding of general assemblies for road transport in the first half of 2010, which will mainly address the issue of an extraordinary salary and a modernization of the collective agreement.
Bussereau recalled that “a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million drop in employers’ fees” was the subject of a government amendment to the 2009 amending finance bill, which the National Assembly voted on Thursday night.
The government will ask the Senate to vote “under the same terms.”
The signing of TLF allows the agreement to be applied, firstly, to the companies affiliated to this organization and, secondly, to the whole profession, in the event that the Minister of Labour makes an extension.
It will be done “with the utmost urgency,” Bussereau said.
The opposition of employers’ organizations could only delay the process.
The FNTR denounced it as a “naive business”, as the 100 million euros “had already been promised to the sector to offset part of the CO2 tax”.
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to negotiate in an emergency situation, not as a conclusion to an analysis discussed by the parties, but not to discourage those who wish to eat turkey at the next Christmas dinner, Unostra lamented.
For the OTRE, the agreement puts "the stability of many SMEs in the sector over the next 12 months" at risk.
RER A: conflicts during the weekend, unions dissatisfied with the proposals of the RATP
Conflicts in the RER A, France’s largest public transport line, will continue over the weekend, because at Friday’s meeting, the 2nd day of strike between trade unions and the management of the RATP, there was no agreement and the unions were dissatisfied with their premium request.
For this important Christmas shopping weekend, on Saturday and Sunday only trains will run between 10 a.m. and 8 p.m., due to one train in two on the central section (between La Défense and Nation) and one train in four on the other lines.
Interconnection with the SNFC will be suspended in Nanterre Prefecture, forcing passengers to change trains.
The Lafayette Galleries, which expect 200,000 customers every day, were delighted that "RATP is striving to provide service to the big stores."
The RER A crosses from West to East the Parisian city.
The RATP route runs from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
This Friday, roughly one in two trains ran in peak hours, and almost no trains in valley hours, as had been anticipated.
On Thursday there was no unrest in the Andes thanks to the organization of the inhabitants of the Isle of France.
In this way, at dawn, the station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was much less crowded than usual, mainly due to the absence of students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, a 29-year-old engineer, explained that he had got up "an hour and a half earlier to get on schedule".
The Saint-Lazare station was not saturated, the SNCF said, which had planned the supervision of police and law enforcement.
The RER A operated by the SNCF from or to Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or departed from Saint-Lazare station to join the subways.
New general assemblies of workers on strike will take place on Saturday and Sunday. The results, "unsatisfactory" according to the unions, will be analyzed from a meeting held with the management on Friday afternoon.
The Director of RER proposes to negotiate a specific protocol in all aspects for RER A: working time, professional development, etc.
That’s not what drivers want when they claim a premium they owe, according to Thierry Garon (South).
The RATP even puts its premium proposals between parentheses, the CGT commented outraged, noting that the management "was not able to solve a problem that the SNCF and the road sector had already solved".
A new meeting is planned on Monday to carry out "a more extensive analysis on the conditions of the exercise of the profession," the RATP said.
This also prompted unions to say that the company “didn’t care about the weekend users.”
In the morning, about 150 drivers invaded a committee at the headquarters, in Paris.
Then the management, which until then refused to dialogue during the strike, suggested the meeting "to calm the waters".
The conflict could extend to RER B on Tuesday, after UNSA and the Independents have filed a pre-warning.
The unions ask for a premium of 120 euros (Unsa) to 150 euros, of which 30 euros are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud, Indépendants) and complain about the degradation of working conditions on this line that has one million passengers daily.
RER drivers, all in the second grade of their professional career, charge from 2,200 to 2,700 euros gross and from 600 to 650 euros of premiums, for schedules with alternate shifts, Sundays and holidays.
Turkish Justice Dissolves Pro-Kurdish Party, A Decision With Serious Consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court ruled Friday in favour of the dissolution of the country’s main pro-Kurdish party, a decision that immediately provoked anger in the Kurdish community, in the southeast of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision could greatly complicate the task of the government, which has just given a helping hand to the Kurdish community trying to put an end to 25 years of conflict.
The Democratic Society (DTP) party was dissolved because it had become the "focus of activities that undermined the independence of the state and its indivisible unity," Court President Hasim Kiliç told reporters after four days of deliberations.
The decision of the 11 judges was unanimous, although only a seven-vote majority was needed to achieve the dissolution, Kiliç said, adding that 37 of the party's leaders, including its president Ahmet Türk and MP Aysel Tugluk, were separated from political life for five years.
The judge also announced the end of the parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Türk and Tugluk, and the confiscation of the party's assets by the Treasury.
The DTP has 21 seats in Parliament (out of 550).
Its leaders warned before the verdict that deputies would leave parliament before being unbiased parliamentarians.
The decision follows a procedure launched by Supreme Court prosecutor Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya in 2007, accusing the DTP of obeying the "principles" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), considered a terrorist organization by Ankara and many other countries.
Numerous observers believe that the DTP is the legal political showcase of the PKK rebels.
However, the party says it has no “organic ties” with the PKK, but refuses to classify it as a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The court’s verdict comes as the government lends a hand to the Kurdish community by proposing a series of measures to strengthen their rights so that the Kurds stop supporting the PKK and end the conflict.
The DTP leaders said a dissolution could generate an escalation of tensions in Southeastern Anatolia, where a large number of demonstrations against the detention conditions of PKK leader Abdullah <0xC3><0x96>calan have degenerated into clashes with police over the past few weeks.
Since the announcement of justice, thousands of protesters have gathered in front of the DTP premises in Diyarbakir, the major city in the southeast, mostly populated by Kurds.
Law enforcement fired tear gas grenades and used water cannons, while demonstrators threw Molotov bombs or stones with spears.
In Istanbul, about a hundred people were also concentrated.
After the verdict, Türk said the justice decision was going to "deepen discouragement".
Turkey cannot solve this issue (Kurdish, NDLR) by dissolving a party, he told the press.
The government, made up of a party from the Islamist movement, also regrets the decision.
In principle, we oppose the closure of parties.
This is not going to solve anything, Energy Minister Taner Yildiz said.
This decision completely boycotts the democratic openness launched by the government, commented political analyst Ahmet Insel.
We can expect, of course, a reaction from the PKK, he added.
On Thursday, the PKK claimed an attack in which seven soldiers were killed three days earlier in northern Turkey, one of the bloodiest attacks in recent months.
Snow can start suddenly.
A truly cool winter is what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
It is absolutely something with which you want to make life impossible for citizens, says the director of road maintenance in the winter of the ESF
But with this, your employees can learn to test and master the entirety of vehicle technology.
On the weekend, meteorologists may announce it for the first time.
More than 330 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to take care of snow and ice.
In this case, the EDF acts in accordance with a detailed plan.
As soon as it snows heavily in Frankfurt and temperatures fall below zero degrees, 20 of the so-called A stretches with large vehicles with salt come out, Brauburger explains.
These include, for example, the main arteries and avenues such as the Neue Weg and the Hanauer Landstraße.
But also accesses for firefighters, public transport routes, pedestrian areas and sloped sections, such as the Atzelbergstraße.
ESF service starts around 3 a.m.
Approximately 1,040 kilometers should be covered, as needed, in a maximum of three hours with wet salt, which sticks better.
That is why the ESF starts around three o'clock in the morning, "with this the tracks are free until the traffic of the peak hours begins".
The hard part is when it starts snowing around 7:30 a.m.
"Then we have a problem," says the director of road maintenance in winter, "because then no one is ready to clear space for salted vehicles."
Immediately afterwards, when it is no longer snowing, it reaches the secondary and private roads, to which the Rat-Beil-Straße also belongs.
The last priority is the side and secondary streets.
That’s where the inconvenience is generated, Brauburger knows well.
Around five o'clock in the morning, the ESF infantry are launched, the dangerous points and cruise ships are mainly cleared.
In general, the ESF could not take over all bicycle lanes.
In Frankfurt there is a special service, which does not lose sight mainly of the bridges, says Brauburger.
As these become slippery quickly, the vehicle with salt starts as soon as the temperature drops below two degrees.
In case of an emergency, the police can also call them.
The Cradle of the Dinosaur
The Tawa hallae had the same appearance as many other carnivorous dinosaurs: an animal two meters long and 1.50 meters high that ran over the two strong hind legs, had an elongated head with sharp and curved teeth, short arms with claws in the shape of a shovel and a long tail.
If the species had lived a couple of million years later, it would not have been something special.
But the Tawa hallae was one of the first dinosaurs with these bodily characteristics, reports Sterling Nesbitt of the University of Texas at Austin and colleagues in Thursday’s journal Science.
The species lived about 215 million years ago in what is now New Mexico, which at that time was in a dry zone of the supercontinent Pangea on the equator.
Tawa opened a new window towards the early evolution of dinosaurs, says Nesbitt.
It tells us a lot about the genealogical relationships, the propagation and characteristics of the first dinosaurs.
Nesbitt and other paleontologists began an excavation at Ghost Ranch in northern New Mexico in 2006.
Sometimes, we have found a dozen dinosaur bones in one day, this is something unprecedented for Triassic sediments, reports Randall Irmis, a team member at the Utah Museum of Natural History.
Researchers quickly identified some bones as belonging to a new species.
In the course of the excavation, the remains of five specimens were collected in total.
A finding confirms theories about the ancient history of dinosaurs
The name "Tawa" comes from the sun god of the Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt, it is an exceptional finding: "Triassic dinosaur fossils are extremely rare, usually only individual fragments are found."
Other dinosaur experts do not entirely share such enthusiasm.
This finding is not particularly spectacular, but it confirms some theories about the ancient history of dinosaurs, says for example Martin Sander of the University of Bonn.
According to current opinion, dinosaurs first appeared about 230 million years ago.
But many of the oldest fossils are incomplete, so the classification of these early dinosaurs is quite controversial.
Thus, experts discuss, for example, when the saurians were divided into their three most important genealogical lineages: the carnivorous theropods, among which are the Tyrannosaurus Rex, the Velociraptor and also the birds, the quadruped sauropods known as the "long-necked" sauropods, the Stecenus per hernivorius and their relatives.
According to the analysis of Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa hallae is a primitive theropod.
This shows an interesting combination of primitive and progressive properties, says Nesbitt.
For example, in Tawa’s skull, researchers found hints of airbags, such as those also possessed by the descendants of theropods, birds.
Thanks to air bags, the breathing of birds is more efficient than that of mammals.
In the case of Tawa hallae also the bones of the spine were evidently partially filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive airbag theropod, says Randall Irmis.
Because the related lineage of later giant sauropods also possessed air bags and light bones, it was likely that the common predecessors of both groups already produced this useful innovation.
At least three waves migrating to North America
Because the earliest dinosaurs known to date lived in South America, researchers deduce that the saurians first appeared there.
Accordingly, the three genealogical lineages separated at first and spread from South America to all corners of the Earth, which at that time still formed a single terrestrial mass, the supercontinent Pangea.
However, the facts say the team found along with Tawa the remains of two other theropods not very closely related.
The three cannot descend from a single related predecessor, the researchers argue.
We believe that at least three waves migrated to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, co-author of the Science study.
Of course, there are opponents as well.
An even older species, Silesaurus, belonging to a sister group of dinosaurs, lived in what is now Poland, says Bonn paleontologist Martin Sander.
Their view could give a distorted picture, because simply in South America many dinosaur fossils are still preserved, while on other continents there is hardly anything to discover.
The question of how dinosaurs managed to evolve from a relatively rare collateral line from reptiles to Mesozoic dominant terrestrial vertebrates remains an enigma.
While in the Triassic, dinosaurs still shared their living space with many other reptiles, for example with the ancestors of current crocodiles and pterosaurs and with many other saurians.
Towards the end of the Triassic the dinosaurs spread around the world and many new species developed, while the kinship became extinct at the Triassic boundary to the Jurassic.
Success stories were not eternal.
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
There may have been a mass extinction to which the dinosaurs survived by chance, but the other reptiles did not.
Or the dinosaurs were better adapted, so they could beat the opponents in the area.
Successful stories are not always eternal.
150 million years later, a meteorite impact halted the rise of a group of species, which had also evolved in the Triassic and since then had a miserable existence: mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the international signatories.
Participate professors from the University of Toronto, Cambridge, Vienna or Berkeley, California.
Teachers from Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen participate.
The police eviction of the occupied casino from the Goethe University in Frankfurt had an impact worldwide.
278 professors and professors from Goethe University, although also from higher education centers across Germany, Europe and North and South America, stand in solidarity with protesting students at the Westend Campus.
In a statement written in German and English, they "reject" the police eviction promoted by the board of directors.
Werner Müller-Estler, president of the university, evicted the building occupied by students and teachers on an educational strike last week because the walls and works of art were covered with propaganda.
As a result, five students were injured.
The material damage, the signatories judge, does not justify "the violent dissolution of the courses organized by the same students and faculty by a police command".
The eviction represented an "unacceptable attack" on freedom of research and learning.
The exclusive focus on vandalism served to "de-legitimize and criminalize the protest" and diverted attention from the content.
The Governing Council has refused to enter into the necessary negotiations.
Teachers demand the immediate withdrawal of the judicial claim.
Most occupants have not caused any material damage, it is said.
Legitimate protest
The youth of the Verdi union and the German Federation of Trade Unions also stand in solidarity with the students.
The protest is the legitimate expression of a growing concern for the future itself, says Verdi national youth secretary Alexander Klein.
Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU), Minister of Science of Hesse, however, defended the performance of the university’s rector and the police.
We are grateful to the Rector of the University.
Destruction and occupation are totally unacceptable means, he said in an issue of Aktuelle Stunde on Thursday in the parliament of the province of Wiesbaden.
We are sympathetic to the protest, but we are not sympathetic to vandalism,” said Peter Beuth, CDU’s provincial parliamentary delegate.
The opinion of the opposition factions, the SPD, the Greens and the left, is different.
The CDU used painted walls as a pretext to criminalize the protest, Janine Wissler (Left) said.
Instead of thoroughly studying the students’ arguments and demands, they are evicted.
The Left has submitted a motion requesting the Minister of the Interior to submit a report on police intervention.
New Silicon Valley
For many years, it was considered a secret city, inaccessible to Western visitors.
Selenogrado, one of the ten districts of Moscow, was in the Soviet Union a heavily guarded site for secret weapons research.
Today, the community of 216,000 inhabitants, located 37 kilometers from the center of Moscow, is considered the "Russian Silicon Valley".
Here are important research and production centers of micro and nanoelectronics.
Since September 2008, representatives of Selenograd have contacted the Riedberg Scientific Headquarters in Frankfurt, university institutes and the companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Center (FIZ).
Several mutual visits were made and now, on Wednesday, Selenograd and Riedberg sign a "close collaboration protocol" in Frankfurt.
Deputy Mayor of Moscow Yuri Rosljak and the Mayor of Selengrad, Anatoly Smirnov, headed the Russian delegation; for Frankfurt signed the head of planning services Edwin Schwarz.
In 2010 representatives of the FIZ and directors of small and medium-sized enterprises of the Natural Sciences Research Centre will travel to a seminar in Selenograd.
Scientific exchanges
This is a continuous scientific exchange.
But it also addresses trade relations.
FIZ companies will have the opportunity to set foot in the growing Russian market.
In return, Russian scientific companies want to have access to contracts in Germany.
Selenogrado is home to important Russian companies and research institutes.
Among them are, for example, the Moscow Institute of Electronic Technology, the large consortia Citronics and Rossiyskaya Elektronika.
The community was founded in 1958 as the so-called "Socialist Planning City" for arms research.
Selenogrado (literally translated as "Green City") got its name from the forested mountain landscape, in which research facilities were settled.
Brakes of Stuttgart
The dimension of Stuttgart 21 is not placed high enough at all.
For supporters of the project, it is simply and plainly "the new heart of Europe".
The so-called S21 law is much more than the reduction of a railway station, more than a monstrous construction project, which will precipitate the capital of the Banden-Württemberg region a decade of chaos of irreparable construction sites.
Stuttgart 21 emerged from the spirit of the 1980s.
Rail terminals, which end in the middle of the city, were then considered engineering fossils of the 19th century, which acted as brakes for modern rail traffic, as it used to take a huge amount of time to hook the locomotives backwards.
Rolling, stopping dry continue the journey; but so it must be done.
And that’s why the terminals had to disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a passing station, which is about halfway between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava; hence the slogan of "Heart of Europe".
The S21 will actually be launched, even though the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even the most ambitious designers have known that in the Hessian and Bavarian capitals it is almost priceless to implement the reduction.
The railway terminals of course also have no more problems of entry and exit, since there are reversible locomotives with tractor unit and driver's carriage at both ends.
Stuttgart 21, including the new ICE section to Ulm, will be launched.
Federal and communal politicians have arranged it this way.
The railway continues, also because the risks of the Republic’s large individual infrastructure projects are borne by the taxpayer and not the state.
From an urban point of view, the project is still justified to some extent.
New urban space is created, provided with many green areas, probably from the graphics generated by the designer’s computer.
For the rail transport system the S21 is harmful.
The crossing station and road support are designed for the transportation of people, which was attributed to the huge growth typical of the 1980s.
At that time, there was no competition for low-cost flights.
But modern transport policy must first deal with strengthening freight transport, as rail transport is considerably more environmentally friendly than truck transport on roads.
However, the new sections under construction are good for cargo trains due to the intense gradients.
Even more serious is that the S21 also indirectly affects many other railway projects.
More than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>6 billion should be buried in the Zuavos.
That's the official figure.
Experts consider it to be more realistic between ten and fifteen billion.
It is certain that in the next decade the money will be lacking in other crossings and narrow passages on the network.
A total of 60 major projects are listed by the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the extension of more than 180 kilometers of long rails through the Rhine Valley.
Since 1987, the slow-paced route has been built.
It would be urgent here to step the accelerator as it should.
However, the S21 acts as a brake.
The stretch of the Rhine Valley will be the bottleneck for international freight transport: through the heart of Europe.
The government is reviewing the ruling on the airport.
The federal government is still pending in the Wiesbaden autonomy parliament, if it is going to file an appeal before the ruling on the Hesse administrative court's night flight ban.
The CDU/FDP coalition appears to have commissioned experts to investigate the more than 400-page ruling of the VGH, according to Economy Minister Dieter Posch (FDP).
The administrative court in Kassel had argued in writing on this date that in the case of the construction of the planned northwest runway at Frankfurt airport, the federal state would again have to regulate the ban on night flights.
Admission of 17 flights between 23 and 5 p.m., as foreseen by the federal government, would not be compatible with mandatory legal protection of the population from noise due to air traffic.
The coalition has until January 4 to decide whether to file an appeal against this ruling.
The opposition criticized this postponement and pressured government representatives to waive the appeal to the nation’s Administrative Court in Leipzig.
The head of the SPD group, Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel, urged the CDU and the FDP to respect their promises of banning night air traffic, which they had made before the elections, otherwise this could be taken as a lack of speech.
It is quite difficult, if one is allowed to carry out his word, said the head of the Greens Tarek Al-Wazir, referring to the slogan of the FDP "We carry out our word".
Minister Posch rejected Schäfer-Gümbel’s recrimination that the federal government would be attempting to get its night flights by misrepresenting the law and tricks.
A thorough legal investigation would take a long time.
The coalition would not want to act on the basis of a “first quick impression.”
We need a legally impeccable decision, Stefan Müller (FDP) said.
As the opposition represents, it would never have been your group’s claims about the night air traffic ban.
U.S. banks are repaying loans.
The major U.S. banks shaken by the crisis are stripping their state ties.
The "Bank of America" immediately returned the aid that the Tarp bank bailout fund had lent to it for a total of 45 billion (approximately <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>30 billion).
And the Citi group also plans to return the state aid, according to a report by the US CNBC.
With this, the institutes aim to free themselves from the restrictions that had gone hand in hand with the acceptance of money, such as the limitation on the payment of bonuses to directors, as well as the payment of high rates.
The Bank of America had made approximately 19 billion cash through convertible bonds.
The rest of the sum he took from the box itself, which had enough means, among others, for the sale of rubrics.
Banking director Kenneth Lewis thanked U.S. taxpayers in particular on Wednesday night: the financial injection helped overcome very difficult times.
The banking house had miscalculated the effort of the bank’s absorption of investments at the height of the financial crisis.
The Citi Group also aims to raise money in the capital market in order to free itself from its obligations to the state.
CNBC reported from known circles that the U.S. bank could announce an increase in its capital by $20 billion on Thursday.
A representative of the Citi group declined to comment.
In June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had already returned their aid.
Quick Election
In the end, everything went faster than we thought.
Just two weeks after the board of the ZDF pressed editor-in-chief Nikolaus Brender to leave his post, the channel could introduce a successor.
Yesterday night the guild intended to vote on the candidate.
The favorite was Peter Frey, director of the main studio of the ZDF in Berlin.
There was no confirmation of this by the broadcaster, officially not to anticipate the procedure.
But it certainly also influenced not to harm the director of the ZDF, Markus Schächter, if this proposal was also not approved by the board of directors.
Frey, Schächter’s candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 guild members.
The result of the vote was not yet finalized at the end of the drafting of this edition.
Two weeks ago Schächter failed on the board of directors with his proposal to renew Nikolaus Brender’s contract for another five years.
Only seven members supported Brender, seven voted against him; Brender's impeachment was a bitter failure for Schächter, but one that could be expected.
Because the majority of the Union in the Governing Council had already indicated weeks before the election, that they would not support Brender in his post.
The opposition to the editor-in-chief had been organized by the Hessian government president, Mr. Roland Koch.
He declined another term of the prestigious editor-in-chief with the argument that, under Brender’s direction, ZDF informants would have lost audience ratings.
Until shortly before the elections there were protests because of this, in which he flagellated the political influence on the ZDF.
In the end, 35 public law specialists had interfered in the debate, who called Koch’s conduct unconstitutional.
But it didn't help.
About the person
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogy and Romanesque philology.
He then worked on the radio station "Südwestfunk" and on the newspaper "Frankfurter Rundschau".
In 1983 he switched to the ZDF, initially to the "heute-journal" newspaper.
Following stations: 1988 to 1990 personal speaker of the editor-in-chief; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998 director and conductor of the morning program "Morgenmagazins"; until 2001 director of foreign policy of the ZDF; since then director of the study of the ZDF in the capital.
The political party of the Greens announced a constitutional lawsuit after the dismissal of Brender, who was elected as journalist of the year on Wednesday by the media magazine "Medium Magazin".
Unlike Koch on the board, the president of the government of Rhineland-Palatinate, explained last week that the federal states should change the state convention of the ZDF in such a way that the director’s staff proposals cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
A withdrawal of supportive politicians from the ZDF controlling bodies was ruled out by Beck.
Brender’s likely successor, Mr. Peter Frey, was recommended to the board with a clever move: he strongly criticized the guild for the dismissal of Brender.
Thanks to this test of journalistic independence, Schächter was able to nominate him for the post of editor-in-chief without losing his face, as the board of directors was able to vote for him, without falling under the suspicion of giving the post to a sectarian supporter.
In the calculations of the parties Frey is awarded anyway to the liberals of the left.
College careers are clearing up
Partial success for students: After a year of education-related strikes, the Ministers of Education and Culture of the federated states finally gave in. At a meeting of the Ministers of Education and Culture with university principals, both sides agreed to try to improve the conditions of study in the cases of bachelor’s and master’s degrees.
Students in the future should be able to overcome their careers.
For example, they agreed to reduce the exam load: basically each module of the race should end with a single exam.
In addition, it is intended to examine the workload of students, and it is intended to guarantee a "real and justifiable measure".
Politics and universities want to further simplify the recognition of exam results between universities within and outside Germany.
The federated states are committed to making structural rules more flexible together for Bachelor and Master careers.
Regulations of federal states that diverge from this should no longer exist.
Less Exams
Since the beginning of the student protests in June, the Ministers of Education and Culture and the principals of the universities have continuously talked about the improvement of being able to carry out and successfully complete a career (studyability).
For the first time, a specific topic has been discussed.
The so-called accreditation board agreed to drastically reduce the number of exams: “Each module ends with a single exam,” says a 30-page document, which aims to partially regulate the approval of university courses.
The "sensitive reduction of the exam load" is intended to prevent development in the wrong direction, which would significantly affect the studyability, explained the director of the accreditation board, Mr. Reinhold Grimm.
In addition, in the future, "studyability" should be the decisive criterion in the configuration.
The modules and contents should be thoroughly examined as to unnecessary restrictions of students in the choice of ..
The courses.
Students would have “the right to obtain more spaces, which enable and foster their own initiative.”
These rules would apply to new races, but also in examining existing races.
These should be "recredited" again every five years. But this would mean, that it would take until the year 2015 to examine all races.
Responsible for this would be nationwide 10 accreditation agencies, which are under the supervision of the accreditation board, which is installed by the federated states.
The ministers of education and culture urged the federal states in October to influence agencies in such a way that the amount of subjects and exams are not too strict or demanding.
In some federated states, universities and technical schools have already agreed with ministries to take such measures.
So far only Rhineland-Palatinate has ensured to provide additional means for the subsequent development of the Bologna process.
With this money, universities must implement student mentoring and counseling programs, as well as strengthen exam and overseas offices.
The federal state and the universities intend to have 10 million euros available for these purposes.
In early 2010, the government wants to bring to parliament a novel of university law.
According to her, a single exam should be enough for the completion of a career model.
The configuration of the course should be made more flexible, furthermore it is intended to ensure the recognition of assessments at other universities and facilitate accessibility to the Master.
Until the end of next year it is intended to examine all races about their "studyability".
On Thursday, the government and the opposition again discussed the conditions for studying in the federal state.
Apart from the praises, there were also criticisms about the decisions.
The federal board of directors of the Juso (Socialist youth) university groups demanded that the setting of the education policy should no longer be carried out "behind closed doors" by ministers and university principals.
At the latest after the education strikes, now the students as principals involved should be able to comment as well.
Margret Wintermantel, chair of the Board of University Rectors (HRK), gave her support to the students: “We need the experience of the students,” she said Thursday at a meeting with the Education Ministers, with whom the HRK discussed a joint reform document.
For the Education and Science Union (GEW) the Bonn agreements were not at all sufficient: the union demands a legal right for every student with the Bachelor’s degree the possibility of accessing a subsequent Master’s degree.
In addition, the federated states have to ensure that for the current generation of Bachelor students there are enough places of study for Master in the future with the best possible conditions of study, according to a member of the GEW, Mr. Andreas Keller.
The federal states have to hire quite a few more teachers.
But about greater access to the master’s degree, the Ministers of Education did not comment.
More than a footnote about Herta Müller
"Entering and leaving Germany is practically uncontrollable," says the first line of a poem by Werner Söllner in imbalanced language fragments, in which he thematicizes the experiences of arriving in Germany experienced by a dissident, who gained his freedom but lost the environment of his language.
Werner Söllner, born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, initially worked as a German and English teacher in Bucharest, and then as a reader in a children’s book publisher, before moving to Frankfurt in 1982.
Söllner was awarded several literary awards, in 1993 he gave memorable lectures or poetry talks in Frankfurt at Goethe University, and since 2002 he has been director of the Hesse Literature Forum at the Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
He gave enough talk last Tuesday during a meeting in Munich about "German literature in Romania in the mirror and the disfigured mirror of his Securitate files"
Visibly insecure and embarrassed, Söllner read a statement in which he admitted participation as an IM in the Romanian secret service Securitate in front of fellow German-Romanian writers, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer.
Together with some of those present in 1989, Söllner had received the German Language Award.
Recruitment attempts had begun slowly, in early 1971.
“So I’m someone who didn’t defend himself enough against the Securitate’s fear provoking attempts,” Söllner concluded.
The lyricist Werner Söllner is IM Walter.
Almost at the same time as the award of the Nobel Prize in Literature to Herta Müller and her unparalleled literary controversy with the mechanisms of dictatorial domination, the literary scene and especially the community of German authors from Romania are shaken by a case that highlights the abysses and evils of a political system, which is based on control and espionage.
Werner Söllner is, as far as we know, not only an author, but also a victim.
Walter had played a role in his Securitate IM dossier, literary scientist Michael Markel said after Söllner’s confession, and stressed the positive influence of Walter IM for him.
I had excused or defended him in all the difficult points for him, Markel said.
“I feel the moral need to make this statement,” he said.
Söllner’s statement in this form and in front of this audience was unexpected, the confession of a former dissident and his work with the Romanian secret service, however, is not so surprising.
Germany would have been a comfortable haven for spies of the Securitate-Spitzel, wrote Herta Müller in July in the weekly "Zeit" after reading her own 914-page dossier.
Those involved may have speculated and in some cases known what names were hidden behind the pseudonyms of Sorin, Voicu and also Walter.
Unlike the review of the Stasi files with a controlled procedure in Germany, the handling of the files of the control by the Securitate is still quite vague.
A systematic clarification has been boycotted and hampered in recent years.
A National Council for the Clarification of the Records of the Securitate (CNSAS), corresponding to the Birthler authority, was formed in 1999, and the handing over of the records since then is rather given to traces.
Since 2005, there has been a law regulating the administration of files.
An interview, after the award of the Nobel Prize in Literature to Herta Müller, proves that the influence of former members of the Securitate in Romania is still quite large. In this interview, a former head of the Securitate of Temesvar spoke derogatoryly about the awarded.
"She has psychosis," in the end she was interrogated only once.
The infamy of power seemed to be able to be shown without turns in the form of freedom of opinion.
Of course, unavoidable questions arise with the Söllner case, as so many times when there are silent faults.
The calm reaction of the listeners to Söllner’s confession suggests that the continuation of this story will be governed more by the cravings for knowledge and not so much by the attribution of blame and shame.
For the genesis of the work of Herta Müller, who yesterday accepted the Nobel Prize in literature, it is more than just a footnote.
The Champions League as a garrison to fill the stomach
When the new coach of the Stuttgart VfB football team, Christian Gross, accompanied by an orange plastic bag from the supplier of his team, boarded a Mercedes C-Class taxi a quarter of an hour after midnight, he gave the impression that a member of the elegantly dressed outdoor service was leaving for a very nice Christmas party.
The man with the bald feature had hired a driver, because he still did not know the city.
Otherwise, he could also have driven the car himself: after all, there was no alcohol at stake, and the 55-year-old man was not drunk with joy either.
It had been a pleasant evening, but tomorrow I would start work again.
Or I'd start for the first time.
In the words of the Swiss, who had been hired just three days before: "It is true that we have reached the final eights", namely, in the Champions League, thanks to the triumph 3:1 against Unirea Urziceni, of Romania, "but we cannot be blinded by the success: we will have to fight brutally against the downturn."
The "much more important task" awaited them the following Sunday, he said.
Then, it will be necessary to repeat in Mainz the success of the "real classes" in the daily life of the league.
And eliminate the weaknesses, which have been clearly demonstrated again, after the quick three goals of Marica (5), Träsch (8) and Pogrebnyak (11).
Sorteo
The Champions League finals (one-way games on 16/17 and 23/24 February/back games on 9/10 and 16/17 March) will be drawn on 18 December in Nyon.
So the joy was limited by the fulminant entrance of Babbel’s successor.
Not only in the supposed savior, who in a short time had inspired the confused professionals of Stuttgart self-confidence, willingness to surrender and taste for the game.
I went with the players and told them that they had to focus on their strengths, I urged them to be more thrown, explained the soul repairman Gross his recipe for success that sounds so simple, but that with the therapist Babbel had no longer taken effect.
He deployed a certain magic, Babbel supporter Jens Lehmann accepted, "when in football a new impetus arises, sometimes things happen that were not thought possible."
And Sami Khedira, who after a break of several weeks due to an injury immediately advanced to become the best local player thanks to his dynamism, tried to describe the "phenomenon" perceived with the proverbial "fresh wind" and the way of working of the new boss: "He is a man who intervenes thoroughly, and demands
This is what we need in the current situation.”
And this is what was missing, obviously, when Babbel was there.
VfB Stuttgart has not yet passed the test, warns sports manager Horst Heldt
But the VfB Stuttgart needs above all constancy.
Like Gross, the players and the manager also refrained from overestimating the triumph against a defense weakened by lack of relief and wholly outnumbered by Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow, before four days later in Leverkusen with the 0:4 had come the sad awakening, Khedira thought.
And manager Horst Heldt warned that while one goal of the season had been achieved, the other was still a long way off.
We have not yet overcome the problem.
That Heldt did not want to celebrate his 40th birthday, even after the first victory at his headquarters in three months, was due to the events of the weekend, which were updated again in the form of a television interview, broadcast just before the start of the game, which had been granted by goalkeeper Jens Lehmann.
There are decisions made by others, not Jens, Heldt faced Lehmann’s harsh criticism.
He had blamed weakness in leadership on the board, which had decided to change coach under pressure from teenage fans.
Also that he had eliminated his day off after the games, Lehmann described it as a sign of lack of sovereignty and hostility.
Lehmann's statements were "marked by pure selfishness," Heldt replies, and announced consequences for the latter.
They will probably not be friends forever, the two quarantines.
But at least they agreed with everyone else that, without previous efforts with the substituted coach's team, the show of great game and battle power would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants had "an important share in the success," Heldt and Lehmann said in unison; and the man in the plastic suitcase also agreed.
Wrestling at the World Heavyweight Championship
Burning duel in Bern: Again and again challenger Kevin Johnsonn was provoking world champion Vitali Klitschko with words and gestures.
But after twelve hard rounds, the Ukrainian defended his heavyweight title in the WBC version.
The judge’s decision was unanimous.
Hamburg: Vitali Klitschko remains heavyweight world champion.
The 38-year-old champion in the WBC version defeated American Kevin Johnson on Friday night to Saturday in Bern by unanimous decision by points (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
For Klitschko, it was his third successful defense of the title since his return in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainian was already twice world champion of the WBO and WBC associations.
Unfortunately, it was not possible to perform the knockout that everyone had expected.
Klitschko expanded his balance to 39 wins in 41 professional fights, twice having to give up due to his injuries.
Challenger Johnson had to accept the first defeat in his 24th fight.
In front of some 17,000 spectators in the Bern Arena, Klitschko, with a height of 2.02 meters, wanted to dictate the fight above all with his left hand.
But Johnson, eleven centimeters lower, who before the duel had proclaimed the end of the Klitschko era, was evading the blows of the world champion over and over again, so Klitschko could not decisively bring his dangerous right to his goal.
Generally speaking, the passive Johnson did too little for a challenger, and only tried to pass the rounds.
While he was provoking Klitschko with words and gestures, his blows only rarely reached the world champion.
However, he is now the second boxer, after Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who endured twelve full rounds with Klitschko.
Before the fight, the challenger had already caused a certain scandal in the Swiss capital.
He had insulted Klitschko as a "horrible zombie", who "knows nothing to do".
As he weighed, the champion was provoked on Friday to remove Johnson’s sunglasses from his nose “so he could see his eyes.”
Fourth victory after Klitschko's return
Also in his fourth fight after his return on October 11, 2008, Klitschko remained invincible.
After a nearly four-year break, he defeated then-Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin, and had recovered "his" WBC belt, which he had previously had to deliver without a fight.
That year he later defeated Juan Carlos Gómez of Cuba and Chris Arreola of the United States in his defense of the title.
In this fight I only received one blow, and I am in very good physical condition, Klitschko had explained his quick return to the ring.
But his dream remains to gather all four important titles in his family.
His brother Vladimir is world champion of the WBO and IBF associations.
However, the belt belongs to the British David Haye, after he dethroned in November Nikolai Valujev, 2.13 meters tall.
Last summer, Haye had cancelled a fight against Vitali Klitschko scheduled for September.
Supposedly, the company that promotes it is already planning the fight against Klitschko at Wembley Stadium, London.
The Kunduz case
Frontal attack by the opposition: the leader of the Greens, Jürgen Trittin, called Defense Minister Gutenberg a liar because of false information about the Kunduz case.
The SPD and the Left demand an explanation from the Chancellor.
Hamburg/Berlin – Following the latest revelations about the Kunduz airstrike, the opposition has accused Defence Minister Karl-Theodor zu Gutenberg (CSU) of knowingly cheating.
In Saturday's "Tagesschau" news broadcast, broadcast by the ARD television channel, the head of the group of the greens, Jürgen Trittin, said the minister had "knowingly not told the truth" about the deadly bombing of two convoys.
In such a case, it is usually said: he told lies.
The order to kill would have been given without taking into account the rules of the International Protection Troop for Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the essence of the report that NATO had, and that Mr. Gutenberg has read, Trittin said.
On Friday, it was revealed that the attack was not only about destroying the hijacked trucks, but also about intentionally killing two Taliban leaders.
In the U.S. air strike, requested by the German commander of Kunduz, Colonel Klein, according to the NATO investigation report, up to 142 people were killed or injured.
The Greens, the SPD and the left urged Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) on Saturday to speak immediately before the federal parliament and clarify what Gutenberg really knew about the incident.
Merkel needs to clarify whether an intentional assassination strategy is part of the federal government’s Afghan policy, and whether the chancellery, army and intelligence service have approved this new strategy, Jürgen Trittin and his Greens colleague Renate Künast demanded.
Government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm resolutely rejected the criticism.
The chancellery exercised no influence over specific actions of the German army in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, doubts had also passed over the ministry’s presentation on the reasons for the dismissal of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert.
According to SPIEGEL information, both had informed Gutenberg correctly and completely about the background of the attack on the convoys.
Officially it had been said that they had denied the existence of NATO reports and had concealed sensitive details from the Minister.
However, from the surroundings of the two high-ranking officials it transpired that they had even pointed out to the Ministry of Defence the existence of several reports, including a two-page document from Colonel Klein, who was in command, and a report from a field patrol.
In the meantime, Wichert would have asked in a letter to clarify the matter, reports the "Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung".
No response has been received so far, he said.
The ministry did not comment on Saturday on the allegations made against it, noting that this would be clarified in the federal parliament's commission of inquiry, which will be constituted next Wednesday.
Oniric worlds
In a waking state, some people see images and hear voices that others do not see or hear.
It is not only in the case of mentally ill and drug addicts that the boundaries between imagination and reality fade.
As long as it happens during sleep, everything is in order.
When we lie in our dark rooms with our eyes closed, we can unhinderedly surrender to the wildest imaginations and creations of fantasy.
However, anyone who experiences sleep-like states during waking hours, or sees and hears things that others do not see or hear, is most often considered in the modern Western world to be a madman or a drug addict, or at least a maniac.
But such images and voices do not only arise in the mentally ill or in drug addicts.
The fault lies in our imagination: the same neural processes that allow us to design houses, paint paintings or write novels, sometimes cause the boundaries between sleep, madness and reality to be undone.
Onirically modified states of alert consciousness can appear in the most diverse forms, at best we call them visions, and at worst, madness.
Although the triggers and effects can be distinguished, similar processes can be referred to the visions of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the psychedelic experiences of the New Age prophet Carlos Castañeda, states of shamanic possession, and psychosis and hallucinations.
Hallucinations or delusions arise when the balance of neuronal communication substances in the brain – especially dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin and acetylcholine – has been derailed and the interaction between various parts of the brain is disrupted.
During schizophrenic psychosis, complex hallucinations and insane thoughts often occur.
Gravity no longer has power over him.
The relationship between madness and sleep has occupied philosophers and physicians since ancient times.
Aristotle conceived hallucinations as a form of sleep in a waking state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, observed in 1861 a "great resemblance of the state of madness with the oniric states", for Sigmund Freud, the dream was even "a psychosis, with all the unpurposed, alouds and forms".
It is the fall of 2001, when Henning T. becomes a comic book figure.
His body is two-dimensional and outrageously colorful.
Gravity no longer has power over him, it is floating near the ceiling of the room.
He feels a kick.
Behind him, figures of demons with wings, with red muzzles like blood, deformed, shaking teeth.
They're chasing him, kicking him with heavy, flaming boots, throwing him against the walls, he feels the pain all over his body.
Striking and evil voices resonate from the walls and the radio.
He can no longer bear them, the voices that insult and offend him.
Henning T. pulls two cables from the stereo, ties them together to form a hanging knot, and attaches them to a hook on the ceiling.
He climbs into a horn and puts the knot around his neck.
Jump.
The rope is loose.
What a lesson to you!, shout the voices in a chorus that blows his tympanics, "Go to the clinic and have them cure you!"
Now, Henning T. is 40 years old and has experienced six acute psychoses, the last two years ago, the first almost 20 years ago.
The cause that produced it was LSD.
His diagnosis is schizo-affective-paranoid psychosis, he is also manic-depressive, takes medications, against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness, he has been married for three years.
In psychosis I have experienced the most terrible anguish and the deepest despair, he says.
Hallucinations are a cruel reality
Approximately one percent of the population falls ill at least once in the life of schizophrenia; in psychiatric clinics it is treated as the second most common disease after depression.
In an acute schizophrenic psychosis, most of the time those affected can no longer distinguish between the outside and the inside world, and fall into a state of overexcitement that can lead to hallucinations, delusions of grandeur, disorders in the relationship, or persecutory mania.
Especially widespread is hearing voices: voices that give orders, comment or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are also common.
The affected person is no longer able to distinguish what is important from what is not, the brain can no longer filter the disturbing signals, the consciousness is flooded with impressions.
Like sleep, psychosis also opens the doors to a torrent of ideas and fantasies that come from the deepest layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is centered on the subject, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, chief physician at the General Psychiatry Clinic at Heidelberg University Hospital.
The schizophrenic is at the center of events, everything has a meaning directed to him.
At the same time it enters a passive role, as in a dream, it feels overwhelmed by events and cannot actively organize them.
This is why schizophrenics often feel threatened, controlled, and manipulated.
In general, it is not possible to adjust reality to them, hallucinations are a cruel reality, waking up, impossible.
Having experienced a hallucination once in a lifetime
Unlike in a dream, Fuchs says, "the spatial and sensory structure of reality perceived in psychosis remains in principle as it is."
Paranoid thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, the distancing from experience takes place in reality.
For researchers still an unknown why our brain makes cabriolets.
According to Fuchs, states of emergency can cause anyone to temporarily lose contact with reality.
But not all people develop a psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic disposition for schizophrenia, but studies in twins have shown that in addition to genes, there are also other determining factors.
Researchers assume that those affected suffer minimal brain damage.
We suspect that the neuronal maturity of the brain is affected at an early stage of development, such as through a viral disease of the mother during pregnancy, Fuchs explains.
But it is still unknown how this alteration of the neuronal system occurs, which is also not manifested at all for many years.
The influence of the environment also plays an important role – stress or a traumatic experience can be the triggers of a psychosis when a previous disposition already exists.
Similarly, hallucinogenic drugs can cause psychosis, as they interfere with the brain’s transmitting system.
When the brain heats up
The illogical thing about all this is that psychotic people suffer with their hallucinations and take very expensive drugs to get rid of them, while others pay for drugs that allow them to experience some, says Lübeck psychology professor Erich Kasten.
Perceiving a hallucination as pleasant or not often depends on the point of view.
Kasten has been collecting reports on hallucinations and visions for ten years and has analyzed the results in the book Die unreale Welt in unserem Kopf (The unreal world in our heads), published last year.
Hallucinations are among the typical accompanying symptoms of psychoses, but also, surprisingly, of many other diseases.
Among them are, alongside mental disorders such as borderline personality disorder or depressions, often also diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer’s and cranial trauma.
surprisingly and under certain conditions, the brains of healthy people also suffer hallucinations.
Hallucinations, according to Kasten, are composed of memories that are normally suppressed.
They arise when the areas of the brain in which sensory perceptions are processed are hyperactive or little restricted; when our brain warms up, but also when stimuli are lacking.
Drugs can cause this condition in the same way as brain damage or psychosis.
But also the restriction of stimuli, stress, the evil of love or other brain states of exception.
In recent studies, up to a third of respondents reported having experienced a hallucination at least once in their lives.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. was 16 years old, living in a small town in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and attending a secondary school.
An ordinary girl.
If it weren't for those images and voices.
Sometimes, during recreation, it happens that a clumsy guy with long, dark hair directs the word to him.
When she answers, the other students look at her astonished; no one, apart from her, hears or sees the boy.
They think the shy girl is a bit strange dreamer, but Sarah K. knows she’s not dreaming.
She is awake and she sees and hears that boy, just as she sees and hears the girl sitting on the bench next door.
You may even feel their presence, at least for a few moments.
It's a nice feeling, he likes the guy.
Sometimes she wonders if she's crazy.
He also knows that the boy and the rest of the visions are not real and disappear.
At night, the apparitions are alarming.
Visions are often a burden.
When he is in class, sometimes he cannot follow the lesson because the teacher – in his eyes and ears – is introducing a new companion, while for the rest he explains the mathematical equations in a visible and audible way.
At night, the apparitions are alarming.
While waiting in the dark room for sleep, which often comes late and is scarce, he does not know how to distinguish whether he is awake or dreaming, whether the images he sees, the muzzles or the girl with bleeding cuts in his arms and legs, appear in front of his eyes open or closed.
Leave me alone, he yells at the figures.
She hasn't told her parents and friends anything, they'd think she's crazy.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is today20 years old.
She passed selectivity last year and lives with her boyfriend.
The hallucinations have been gone for a year.
Ever since she contacted psychologist Kasten over the Internet, she knows she’s not crazy.
Madness is also a work of art by despair.
According to Kasten, when a person finds himself socially isolated or suffers from a restriction of stimuli, it is very likely that after a while he will begin to have hallucinations.
I think the brain is unemployed and is in charge of looking for entertainment.
Sarah K., her only daughter, was a little scared of the other kids and often played alone.
His hallucinations began when, at the age of 13, he learned that the man he has been calling Dad since he has been using reason is not his biological father.
Since visual and acoustic hallucinations are active in the same areas of the brain that also process real impressions and noises, those affected, such as Sarah K., find it difficult to distinguish between visions and reality.
Hallucinations are equally images that the brain produces, which is why they seem so real.”
Kasten also classifies night fantasies as a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people do not differ fundamentally from those of acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenics, mentally healthy people are able to recognize their visions as unreal.
Kasten therefore recommends that her patients appreciate her hallucinations as a special skill.
Limit situation between sleep and hallucination
In this world too focused on the conscious, imaginary experiences usually pathologize, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor in Heidelberg and chief physician at the clinic for psychiatry and psychotherapy at the Florence-Nightingale-Krankenhauses hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a hard and painful disease but it also involves something positive and creative – madness is a work of art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard has investigated the so-called oneirism, a special form of consciousness, which is perceived as a dream.
Oniric hallucinations are almost very complex and detailed dreams that the person who experiences them considers real and that can not subsequently distinguish from being awake.
Onyrical conscious states arise in extreme situations associated with trauma or disease, such as in patients with polyradiculoneuropathy, who experience motor paralysis while being fully conscious.
According to Schmidt-Degenhardt, when a person is threatened by a loss of self or of the world due to a total and permanent motor disability, this replaces a very dangerous real situation with a self-conscious and imaginary world that is decoupled from reality.
A form of boundary situation between sleep and hallucination.
Since it is not possible to overcome a situation in reality, a world change occurs, although the real situation remains present in the imagination.
An intensive way of giving meaning and interpretation to an insurmountable situation in itself that our own capacity for creation allows us not to sink into nothingness of loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in memory
Art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen of Zurich also describes his dream experiences in his book Herzenwechsel as an action to save the soul.
He was 49 years old, when his conscience embarked on several days of travel after an operation of the heart valves with heart transplant included, while his body was doomed to immobility in the intensive care station.
Claussen plunged into a world created by him and visited strange places from other times: he was found lying in bed, an elderly man aboard a sanatorium on a train, a robot watched over his health.
It was seen in the High Middle Ages, surrounded by nobles who produced narcotics from blood.
A Greek on a motorcycle abducted him in his home country, surfed on his hospital bed in the Alps with snow firn and met a Korean mobster.
He gives everything in these imaginary facts, everything is real, even later in the memories.
For Claussen, these inner journeys are fundamentally different from any dream.
Dreaming is a different state, so describe your experience.
On the contrary, memories of mental journeys are, many years later, much clearer, even in irrelevant details.
Clearer and more intense even than real experiences.
The intensity of this experience dilutes the horizon of the rest of our daily experiences, adds psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Finally, oneirism, psychosis, hallucinations and narcotic use show how fragile the inner reproduction of the outer reality is, even when we are awake.
Each modification of the state of consciousness, summarizes psychologist Kasten, "can lead to a deformation of what we call reality."
An experience that, on the other hand, can be completely enriching.
The snow can come
Burda
The children will be in charge of the publishing house with 27 years
The new publisher Kallen has come to a provisional solution: Hubert Burda wants to leave his company in the future in the hands of his two sons, he told SPIEGEL.
100% of the holding will also be in the hands of the family.
Hamburg – Publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children in the future.
The two sons become heirs at the age of 27 and have the firm will to enter the company, Burda, 69, confirmed to SPIEGEL.
The details have been fixed as a precautionary measure.
The next question is whether they will actively participate in the company.
Also, if you are qualified to do so.
One cannot put 7,500 workers in front of one’s children if they are not sufficiently trained to do so.
That would end up with the kids and the company as well.
Burda announced on Thursday that he will step down from the chairmanship of the board from January and that Paul-Bernhard Kallen has been appointed his successor.
This member of the Kallen family, 52, has been a member of the management of Burda since 1999.
At first, he was responsible for technology.
After the departure of Jürgen Todenhöfer, he also took over direct marketing, abroad, printing and finance, and he was responsible for the company’s assets.
For the first time, no member of the family is at the top of the editorial board.
Burda’s children are 19 and 17 years old, and his son Felix, who would now be 42, died a few years ago.
Kallen's designation also serves to, "save the differences of 10, 15 years," according to Burda.
100% of the holding will also be in the hands of the family.
Looking at the Schickedanz and Schaeffle cases, Burda said family businesses are not safe from decay either: “This has always affected families who get caught up in the pursuit of capital, who have misjudged and thought they could rise as well as the biggest player.
That has never been my strategy.
I’ve never had “deliriums of greatness,” Burda says.
I don’t see myself as a political preceptor of this country, as Springer was, and I don’t want to play with “Time” in the world league either; those businesses have become too big.
Integral beauty
Everything – in terms of beauty and well-being – you can wish for, within reach of your hand.
This is what seems to have been proposed by El Corte Inglés, which has just opened in the shopping center of Callao (Madrid) a multidisciplinary space of more than 1000 m2 dedicated to the care and care of the body.
The spa, located on the eighth floor, has prestigious firms such as Hedonai -which takes care of laser hair removal-; Spaxión, with relaxation rooms and aesthetic treatments; Luis & Tachi hairdressers; Marina d'Or, which has a gym, or L'Occitane and its natural cosmetics, among others.
There is also a feeding section, where the teahouse stands out, with more than 130 different classes of this infusion.
Enjoy a relaxing massage with your partner while contemplating the unbeatable views of the capital, or rent for two hours the relaxation area to mount your own 'beauty party' with eight of your friends and relax with a jacuzzi session, massages and having a glass of champagne are some of the possibilities offered by Spaxion.
In total they are 250 m2 distributed in 12 rooms to perform the latest and most innovative facial, body and hydrotherapy treatments.
Such as, for example, cavitation to combat cellulite or vibratory platforms.
The gym also has these machines, in addition to some virtual 'coach' who guide the steps of the customers, offering them a completely personalized treatment.
It all starts with entering your personal key on a touch screen, located in front of the machine.
Then, several videos show us how to properly perform our exercise table.
His director assures that 15 minutes (including warm-up and stretching) are enough to exercise all the muscles of the body.
And, if after exercising our body, we want to go through the hairdresser, the firm Luis & Tachi has a room where hair recovery rituals, luminosity or nutrition are offered in a personalized way.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to have been the premises of this urban spa, which will be open every day of the year, from 10:00 in the morning to 22:00 in the evening.
Varied necklines
Christmas is approaching and it is never too late to review the looks of the stars to adapt them to our party costume.
The shape of the neckline, very important to enhance the silhouette, is one of the variables that we must take into account.
Here are a few suggestions.
Singer Fergie chose an exaggerated and very complicated neckline. It is not very advisable.
Endesa and Barcelona, with the electric car
The electric company Endesa, together with the City of Barcelona, have created the 'Office LIVE'.
It is a project to develop and promote the electric vehicle in the Catalan capital.
The 'LIVE Office' (Logistics for the Electric Vehicle Implementation) will define and coordinate the roadmap for the deployment of the electric car in the city and will achieve agreements around mobility, managing, coordinating, presenting subsidies, etc.
On the other hand, it will develop the MOVELE project, promote the electric car, collect the opinion and work of the sectors involved.
In short, it is intended to boost what will be the transport of the future.
3 "Electric cities"
But Barcelona is not the only city that will be involved in the implementation of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville join the project.
These are the three cities chosen by the Government, within the MOVELE Plan, to promote the implementation of the electric vehicle.
Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Generalitat of Catalonia.
It aims to promote research and technological development activities in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These would include activities related to energy, in particular energy efficiency.
It is not the only initiative in which Endesa participates in terms of the promotion of the electric vehicle.
The company participates in standardization groups at European level and has a number of complementary projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees 'a horizon of tranquility' for the motor sector
The President of the Government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, sees "a horizon of tranquility" for the Spanish automotive industry, which, he recalled, is the main export sector of the country.
In the presentation of the 2009 Economic Report of the President of the Government, Zapatero reviewed the measures taken by the Executive throughout the fiscal year to support the automotive sector.
"Without the Automotive Competitiveness Plan, today we would have a panorama of abandonment, of closure of some of our main production plants," the president said.
“Thanks to this plan and the availability of the brands to follow in Spain, in a very competitive sector, we can have a horizon of tranquility for the future of this industry, which is our main export sector,” he added.
In this regard, he recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, included in the Comprehensive Automotive Plan (PIA), allocated 800 million to projects of 19 manufacturers and 137 auxiliary companies, which mobilized an investment of more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3 billion.
The chief executive explained that this investment was committed both to the development of new models and to the modernization of existing products and processes.
Zapatero also emphasized government measures to support demand, in reference to Plan 2000E, implemented in collaboration with autonomous communities and automotive brands.
According to the president, this plan has allowed to reduce by 6% the average emissions of new vehicles marketed in the Spanish market and has provoked a "strong increase" in registrations, which grew "by 40 percent" in November.
20,000 square meters of classic vehicles
The first edition of the International Classic Vehicle Show will be held in Madrid, a meeting place for professionals and fans of the engine mount.
This initiative will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 in the Cristal Pavilion of the Casa de Campo in Madrid.
It is an exhibition area of 20,000 square meters in which there will be more than 200 national and international exhibitors.
Not only will you be able to find classic motorcycles and cars, but at ClassicAuto Madrid you will find items of all kinds related to the world of the engine.
Thus, among the exhibitors of the pavilion, you can find accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, accessories, publications, miniatures, etc.
Hundreds of articles related to the world of the classic engine that will delight collectors and curious.
Among the participating companies will be, among others, Classics of Mos and Good Old Times, sale of cars; Juan Lumbreras, restoration; Coupe-Francisco Pueche sale and restoration of cars; or Cochera Classics, specialist Mercedes Benz.
Skill Tests Abroad
In addition, the commercial activity of this Hall will be complemented by parallel activities: holding of concentrations, sports exhibitions, skill tests, presentations and competitions.
Skill tests with classic cars and motorcycles will also be carried out on an enabled circuit outside the fairgrounds.
Mazda3 i-Stop: sustainable sportiness
Mazda wants to show that sportiness is not bound up with respect for the environment.
For this reason, the Mazda3 has just incorporated the engine stop and start system – dubbed i-Stop – a device that is at least for the moment only available with the 150-horsepower 2.0 gasoline engine.
This second generation of the Mazda3 stands out for the good score achieved as a whole.
The finishes, the finishing of the vehicle, the habitability, the behavior, the mechanics, the i-Stop system...
All these aspects are outstanding in the new Mazda3.
Starting with the driver’s seat, we found that the front seats have excellent ergonomics and grip.
Also, the touch of the steering wheel is exquisite.
Following with the set formed by the dashboard and the console we see how Mazda has continued the Japanese trend of creating a futuristic interior design, with a lot of buttons and controls and striking colors in red and blue.
This style reminds us, in part, of what the Honda Civic also presents.
Therefore, we can say that both the Mazda3 and the Civic, both Japanese, contrast with the sobriety of German products, and more specifically the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to beat.
Continuing with the cabin, this compact Japanese features more than enough habitability for four adults to travel with a high level of comfort.
To all this is added a large suitcase with regular shapes.
The automatic engine stop and start system, at least for the moment, is only available with the two-liter, 150-horsepower gasoline engine and with the manual six-speed gearbox.
This engine is a real delight. It stands out for its finesse, for its reduced noise, for the performance and for achieving a low consumption.
Although the most demanded Mazda3 will be diesel versions, those who do not drive a high number of kilometers per year should not discard this gasoline-powered i-Stop, both for its high driving comfort and for its low fuel consumption.
Regarding the level of equipment, the version chosen for the test is the so-called Sportive, i.e. the one that incorporates a greater number of standard elements.
From the standard equipment stands out especially the Lane Change Assist (RVM) which eliminates dead angle, traction and stability controls, speed control, photosensitive interior mirror, on-board computer on a large screen, parking sensors, independent air conditioner, rain and audio sensor, bluetooth and bluetooth pulgadas and bluetooth lights.
In addition, if its equipment was not enough, this version had the Premium Pack, which adds for 1,500 euros: adaptive bixenon headlights and BOSE sound system with disc charger, among other elements.
Conclusions
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compacts in the category.
It stands out especially for the quality of the materials used, for their behavior and for the high level of equipment.
In addition, those who do not drive many kilometers a year will be able to opt for this i-Stop version, associated only with the 150-horsepower 2.0 gasoline engine.
The only drawback of this model is its high price, which is between 21,770 euros of the Luxury finish and 23,270 euros of the tested version -Sportive-.
In exchange for this high figure, the Mazda3 will offer us every day large doses of satisfaction.
Luxury 'Premiere'
L.A. covers the red carpet of sensuality by Penelope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars dazzled more than ever before wrapped in models as elegant as 'sexys' in the premiere of 'Nine'. (Photos: Gtresonline).
Our 'Pe', as sophisticated as usual, opted for a dark 'lady'.
The Promise of FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, a device that only serves to look at mail, with no possibility of even seeing certain types of attachments or browsing the network.
He enjoyed his five minutes of fame in the U.S. when Time magazine named him one of the products of the year.
Seeing it on the street is harder, the truth is, but the idea can be interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek has a very low price and a very low monthly fee, less than half of what is paid, for example, for the iPhone data plan.
Given the success, the company has released two new devices: one exclusively designed for Twitter, the other with a free lifetime data service in exchange for paying six times more for the Peek.
FonPeek, presented yesterday at the Le Web event, is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation.
It is as limited as its American counterpart, but comes with a surprise.
The monthly maintenance price, around 12 euros per month, includes roaming throughout Europe.
Those who travel with a smartphone already know what it’s like to have to give up data when crossing the border or desperately look for a cafe with WiFi (or a Fon connection) to be able to consult the mail.
The idea of a fixed-price roaming is incredibly attractive and long ago it would have to be in operation.
Yes, some operators have special deals and travel plans, but in my experience it takes a PhD in physics to understand them and good glasses to read the small letter.
The European Commission’s repeated earplugs to achieve affordable roaming rates across Europe have barely had a noticeable effect.
Outside the country of origin there is a fear of using the data, and rightly so.
That a device like FonPeek (it doesn’t stop being curious that it bears the name of Fon when it lacks Wifi) gets this kind of rates means that operators start thinking differently and study different proposals with which to amortize their data network.
Kindle is another good example, it includes book download traffic and other queries on the Internet.
No contracts and no gadgets.
It’s a connected device and you pay for it when you buy it, not month by month.
And that’s what I hope to see one day with FonPeek, a lifelong shopping option like the one Peek already has in the U.S.
Not because I'm going to buy it.
I look at my email on the phone, thank you.
I hope so because I think it’s a fairer model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
The Fetish of Michelle
Yellow is undoubtedly the favorite tone of the American First Lady.
If you have already attended the takeover of Barack Obama as President of the United States with a dress and a coat of this color, you have chosen the same to accompany you in, without a doubt, the second most important moment of his life: the collection in Oslo of the Nobel Peace Prize.
Michelle Obama has worn a very similar model on both occasions: in addition to being a similar color -greeny yellow with shiny reflections-, both times the outfit was composed of three pieces -dress, jacket and coat of the same fabric-, and adorned with a large embroidery or necklace.
So much so, that at first glance it seemed that the First Lady of the United States followed the trail of the Princess of Asturias and had chosen to repeat vestuary.
But the fabric in which the two suits are made makes them very different.
If for the taking of possession was about a fat lace, in Oslo is a velvet with a print.
The accessories have also varied: green mid-heeled shoes the other time, and a similar model, but in gold, now.
And equally different is the hairstyle: one picked up on this occasion, melena releases the previous one.
75% of working mothers have had work problems due to their motherhood
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially for women of the younger generation who want to be mothers.
This is revealed by the study 'Women's fertility and work trajectory in Spain', prepared by the CSIC in collaboration with the Women's Institute.
The survey of 9,737 women aged 15 to 75 leaves no doubt about this: 75 per cent of working mothers have seen limited employment opportunities due to motherhood.
The study notes that there are many differences in the beginning of cohabitation in couples and the number of children, depending on whether they work or not and the type of work they develop.
Those who do not have an out-of-home activity, work part-time, or have an unstable job, begin cohabitation earlier, advance first motherhood, and have more children.
In contrast, women with stable employment, mainly in the public sector, delay coexistence and motherhood, and have fewer descendants.
“Women between 35 and 49 years old with fixed jobs have their first child, on average 3.7 years after starting cohabitation, a figure that increases to 4.1 women with fixed jobs have needed more time from their life trajectory to achieve them, which has led them to postpone the union and arrival of their children.
In addition, the type of work performed exerts a lot of influence on maternity, albeit less on the mating schedule," explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that differentiates the age of women when getting married and having the first offspring.
According to the survey, the higher the educational level, the higher the age at which they marry and at which they have the first child.
The difference is also maintained between women of the same generation.
For example, in the 35-49-year-old group, those with elementary and higher education were mothers for the first time at an average of 25.1 and 32.1, respectively.
"A further division between women is established according to their level of education.
While those with elementary education get married and have their first child before they get a stable job, those with middle or higher levels reverse this sequence and prioritize getting a stable job as a precondition for marriage and the arrival of a child,” Delgado says.
Diane Kruger is worth it too.
L'Oréal Paris has just added a new name to its enviable list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
From next year, the German actress will become the image of different products of the brand, chanting the universal motto of 'Because I'm worth it'.
The protagonist of 'Joyeux No<0xC3><0xAB>l', one of the most elegant actresses on the international scene, joins other famous L'Oréal Paris casts, such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and Spanish Penélope Cruz.
Before her, the last to enter such a select club were actresses Evangeline Lilly ('Lost') and Freida Pinto ('Slumdog Millionaire').
In the men's section, the cosmetics brand also features luxury ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey ("Grey's Anatomy") and Matthew Fox (Evangeline's companion in "Lost").
Category: British Fashion Awards
The British have a lot to say in the fashion world.
His top representatives – designers and models, yesterday and today – met at the annual awards ceremony, held in London, at the Royal Court of Justice.
No one was missing at the meeting.
Former model Jerry Hall and her daughter, Georgia May Jagger, voted Best Model of the Year.
The Poker of Manuel Vicent
Manuel Vicent presents in 'Poker de ases' (Alfaguara, illustrations by Fernando Vicente) about thirty x-rays of writers who have gone through their literary life (and, in some cases, also through the other).
It does not do so in the predictable and dreadable genres (biographical resemblance, life and work), but seeking something similar to the ignition core of the creator character.
The journey has its excitements and Vicent does not spare fears or illuminations.
In addition to an exquisite pleasure, the book is a moving invitation to readings and re-readings.
Here are some snapshots.
Albert Camus: "In his pages I discovered that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but a spiritual impulse, almost physical, the same that I felt without giving it a name: pleasure against fate, morality without guilt and innocence without any god."
About Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, allegorical Christian, he wrote what he had in his blood, not in his intellect, between impotence and ignorance, with a dazzling, senseless poetic humor, like the blade of the knife that was about to kill him."
About Graham Greene: "Our man was abducted by this woman with a passion that lasted thirteen years, in whose flesh he combined the emotion of adultery with the pleasure of remorse, a spiritual privilege that consisted in reaching heaven through the path of perdition."
About James Joyce: "The 'Ulysses' was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the eight thousand-metre peaks of universal literature, which must be climbed on the north wall, from which the best climbers climb again and again."
About William Faulkner: "He was a weird guy.
Of himself, he sometimes said that he was an heir to a county landowner and others that he was the son of a black woman and a crocodile.
Both dreams were great.”
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer picked up the insane cry thrown from a bridge by that Munich character to bring his echo to the bottom of the twentieth century night under his literary form and did it on a journey fleeing from himself and invoking posterity with a violent speech to the worms."
Dorothy Parker: “One day she got down on her knees and prayed, ‘God, dear, I beg you to make me stop writing like a woman.’”
On Joseph Conrad: "On his grave were engraved these verses of Spenser: 'The sleep after the effort,/ after the storm the port,/ the rest after the war,/ after the life frankly pleases death.'
About Virginia Wolf: "In the baggage he also brought his depressions.
The husband normally accepted that she told him that Edward VII was spying on her among the azaleas or that the birds were singing in Greek.
There has never been a man so patient and in love with a neurotic whose literary talent was ahead of his madness.
About Pío Baroja: "What did Martin-Santos do but try to inoculate Joyce in Baroja?
What else did Benet try but to pass Baroja by Faulkner's weapons?
What did Cela do but abduct that man’s fame so that he could serve as his own pedestal?”
Cowardly aggression
Last week, my mother, about 70 years old, was strolling through our neighborhood in the municipality of Fuenlabrada when a group of young people between 15 and 18 years old passed by her and our dog, a specimen of mixed breed, rescued from the kennel and with no more than six kilos weight and, without a word, they gave him two kicks.
Our outrage is capitalized because we do not find the fun in a free aggression to a small, helpless animal, which by the way, was bound.
To this we must add the choke that provoked a lady who was walking quietly and who, when he rebuked these individuals, came to fear for their physical integrity, since an energetic attack on an animal, is able to do the same with a woman, a child, an old man or, in short, with anyone who is weaker than himself.
The event took place at five o’clock on a Tuesday afternoon by a traditionally quiet neighborhood.
The dog was crying all day.
By the way, we put a complaint in a nearby police station that we doubt will serve much and not generate susceptibility, only to clarify that the murderous cowards were Spaniards.
The indignation has led us to denounce this fact.
We don’t understand what’s happening among young people who find it fun to treat a helpless animal that gives us affection, companionship and friendship for free.
We do not know where good education and respect for animals and people have gone.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of the helmet
The tyre manufacturer Michelin, with the collaboration of the Spanish Foundation for Road Safety (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to encourage the use of the helmet, mainly among younger drivers, both entities reported today.
This initiative seeks to raise awareness about the importance of wearing a helmet, as it is the only protective element capable of preventing head injuries or even death in the event of an accident while riding a motorcycle.
Michelin said this campaign is part of its commitment to road safety, which "goes beyond designing and manufacturing safer products every day" and said it also contributes to this goal through other pedagogical and informational actions.
This new campaign to promote the use of the helmet in the motorcycle, under the motto 'To be or not to be', will have a first phase in which signs will be distributed in more than 500 motorcycle workshops, with the aim of achieving maximum diffusion.
In conclusion, Michelin stressed that road safety "is a constant concern" for the company, since being a manufacturer of tyres for two-wheeled vehicles, one of its main purposes is to develop increasingly safer products.
Increase the sale of light commercials
Almost two years later, the market for light commercial vehicles begins to see some light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9,425 units registered in November in Spain represent an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and, most importantly, represent the first increase after 22 consecutive months of declines, according to figures from the employers of the manufacturers Anfac and that of sellers Ganvam.
The good fact, not obstinating, should be quarantined since the reference with which the comparison is made - November 2008 - was particularly bad, with a 60% decrease compared to the previous year.
The consequence of this is that, despite the upturn of the last month, the enrollments accumulated in these 11 months are 40% below those of the previous year.
Since January, 95,853 units have been sold in total for all vehicles that make up the tailor’s drawer of light commercial vehicles: derived from cars, pick-up trucks, vans, light vans and light trucks/chassis.
Also, the clouds that most affect their demand have not disappeared, because although they are also purchased by individuals, most of the purchases are made by small and medium-sized companies, which pay in almost 100% of cases through external financing.
Thus, to the constraints of the closed tap of bank credits, other factors such as the increase in unemployment levels or the persistence of the bad economic situation must be added.
In the face of this panorama and unlike the cars, the aids to the purchase of the 2000E have little served.
In addition to private individuals, self-employed persons and small and medium-sized enterprises who are going to acquire a light commercial of up to 3.5 tons with a level of CO2 emissions that does not exceed 160 grams per kilometre can be accommodated, but the number of operations has been testimonial.
Yesterday, Ganvam recalled the need for the Administration to pay special attention to these vehicles and also to industrialists (trucks and buses).
The association of sellers forecasts a 2010 similar to the year ending, for which it calculates a drop in sales (of cars and 4x4) of 19%.
Emergency braking assistance is now compulsory
As with ABS anti-lock braking and will pass ESP stability control, emergency braking assistance systems will have to be a mandatory element in European cars.
In fact, they are already in all newly registered passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, while for the rest a period of absence is set until the end of February 2011.
The measure, imposed by the European Union, aims to increase the protection of pedestrians although, by its way of working, it can also help to avoid many collisions by range.
The emergency braking assistant does what it does is to increase the pressure on the brakes in case of an emergency, which the system detects by the pedestal that the driver gives.
But it doesn’t always keep that pressure to the end.
According to a study conducted by car components manufacturer Bosch, a third of the drivers involved in an accident had not stepped on the brakes before the collision and half of them did not take full advantage of the force.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The intervention of the aid, on the other hand, demands the maximum of the braking system, reducing the distance used by the car to stop.
According to a study by the EU itself, if all cars were equipped with this type of elements, up to 1,100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians could be avoided per year.
The reduction will be even greater – it is estimated that one in four accidents with human damage would be avoided – when the so-called intelligent emergency braking system is popularized.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system that (through a radar or camera) detects obstacles and warns the driver, in addition to acting slightly on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, it helps by increasing the pressure on the pedal, if necessary.
In case it does not react, and even if the collision is inevitable, the device exerts maximum effort on the brakes to minimize damage.
General Motors delays plan for Opel until January
While workers at the Opel plant in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) have already been warned by Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, that production of the new Meriva will begin in the first week of April - probably on the 8th - according to Javier Ortega, the US manufacturer warns that it will take more time to conclude the recovery plan.
What GM Europe’s new president, Nick Reilly, wants is that each of the points in the plan has been previously agreed upon by the affected party.
And this can cause the final document that will be submitted to the workers first and then to the governments of the countries where there are factories, to be delayed until the beginning of 2010.
Instead, GM is assured that a decision on the sale of Saab should be made in the coming days.
It is no wonder that the Swedish government has increased pressure on the American manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to having contact with some new potential buyers.
One of them could be Geely, which also aspires to acquire Volvo, but gains strength from the Dutch sports car maker Skyper, which is backed by the Russian group Converg.
In case there was no deal with either of them, GM could sell some of Saab’s assets to China’s Baic.
The decision remains to close Saab at the end of the year if it is not sold.
At the wheel of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
To develop its latest, and expensive jewel, Porsche engineers took the Boxster S as a base and managed to slim down no less than 80 kilograms, which has left the scale at only 1,275 kilograms.
This led them to do without, first of all, the automatic roof that has been supplied by one of canvas with manual drive, thus saving 21 kilos; using aluminum doors like those of the GT3, 'caen' another 15; removing the air conditioner, 13; reducing the fuel tank from 64 to 54 litres, they gained 19 kilos more and mounting 7 more.
Finally, giving up the CDR-30 audio system contributed another six kilograms and changing the door handles for one of fabric, the remaining kilogram.
Although it is also offered with the PDK double clutch gearbox, the test was performed on a six-speed manual gearbox unit, mainly on California highways, on mountain stretches with truly reversed paths.
Their behavior can only be described as immaculate.
Weight reduction does not mean that the car does not step on the asphalt with plunge.
Rather, the opposite: we haven’t tested a model so small and light that, at the same time, transmits so much safety in the corner step, even at high speeds.
He is a small athlete, able to heat his muscles in a short walk for the time necessary, until we order him to sprint, brake, recover and repress his motor...
What we ask of you. Thanks to your address, as communicative as it is precise, what we indicate with our hands on the steering wheel is what the car will do.
And it will do so with surgical precision.
Sound of the engine at will
The sound of your V6 boxer, with 320 horsepower (10 more than the Boxster S) is very accomplished and can be enhanced with the 'sport' option and through a system that modifies the engine noise, already released previously in the Panamera.
The acceleration ability is brutal, either from a standstill or in recovery.
Suspensions are firm, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt of the roads we crossed with the Boxster Spyder was quite punished, but the car did well.
The electronic aids barely made an act of presence throughout the journey; and that in some of the curves we find ice at dawn and gravel, well into the morning.
In short, an ultralight car, one of the most fun to drive that one can in the market and that is more than just a modification of the Boxster S.
The car will go on sale in February 2010, at a price of 70,831 euros.
"Bag Girl"
Intimate with Karl Lagerfeld, image of the Coco Cocoon line and occasional 'starlette' of the 'maison' parades, the singer prodigies her bag face with as much contumace as her Chanel bags.
More than 'Bad Girl' or 'It Girl', she's a 'Bag Girl'.
The Baskonia gives a victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral achieved a brilliant victory by 82-91 in its visit to the complicated court of the Maccabi Electra, despite the numerous losses that had the team of Dusko Ivanovic, and in this way he is in the lead of his group, after the great performance of Mirza Teletovic, who with eight triples of scores was the best (sweat team).
The Victorian team was able to meet the important absences of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with great doses of involvement and collective work although it had to suffer until the end to get the victory.
In addition, the great hit from the perimeter, with 16 triplets scored, had a lot to do with the final triumph.
The match began face-to-face for the bluegrans, who were placed from the start ahead on the scoreboard.
The fact that the first four baskets of the Victorians were from the perimeter already made it predict that they had jumped to the Israeli court with the hot dolls.
English and Teletovic were the main craftsmen of the 18-20 at the end of the first partial.
The second quarter was more of the same, but the Alaves team opted for Barak's indoor play and Eliyahu's work, which was greeted with cheers and applause on the return to his home, to continue extending his advantage to rest (34-43).
Teletovic was already starting to stand out as the best of his team with 13 points, although Splitter's 'less six' rating already made it predict that this would not be Brazil's best night.
But the game, despite being tracked to the break, was not decided much less and the Maccabees wanted to remind the Victorians that on their court no one wins, and with 'the hand of Elias' squeezing managed to get into the game.
Eidson and Pnini contributed decisively to the 'yellow' turning the bright (50-49).
More inconveniences
Those of Ivanovic, wounded but not much less dead, needed to spin a couple of strokes to catch air, and in those came the machine gun of Mirza Teletovic, who with three almost consecutive triplets and the help of English and Ribas returned the fourth scorer to a reassuring rent (54-67), who managed to make up the third (67-finals of the local).
The alavés left their skins in the last part and English and San Emetero (60-75) had already warned that they would not let anyone take away what they had earned during the first thirty minutes.
However, Pnini and Eidson, the best of their team did not resign and tried to keep their team alive from the three-point line (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter eliminated by fouls, Ivanovic's did not rush, defended well, and although the Israelis approached in the final minute (80-85), the match already owned and the victory escaped from Tel Aviv for the first time in the season.
Injuries prevent Unicaja from fighting
Unicaja lost strenuously in Greece to Olympiacos and gave him the lead of Group B of the Euroleague, in a game marked by the losses of the boxers, especially in the indoor game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated the Greek victory.
The Malaga team was not frightened by the atmosphere of the pavilion of Peace and Friendship, nor by the entity of the rival, perhaps the most powerful in Europe and with a great budget.
The game shown in the first quarter allowed the Andalusians to dream. An aggressive defense and three consecutive triples, two from the base Omar Cook and one from Guillem Rubio, dazzled the locals 12-18, minute 9.
The Olympiacos were surprised by the intensity of the Unicaja, although the locals' arsenal in the indoor game with Bourousis, Vujcic and Shortsanitis, turned the scoreboard 22–20, minute 13, at which point an action, coughing cough, between the two American base players Beverley and Williams, assumed the ambush.
The Greek team began to function by showing its superiority within both zones, where the injury loss of English midfielder Joel Freeland and the three personal shortcomings of Carlos Jiménez were weighing on the boxers.
Among the indoor players and Lithuanian forward Linas Kleizas, with their triples, increased the advantage 44-32, minute 19.
An Impossible Resurrection
The third period was very offensive with Olympiacos, which despite the 19 losses, proved superior and even even equalled the difference of the match played in Malaga 66-48, minute 27, which made the group leadership shake.
The Unicaja attempted to overcome the absences and the last downfall of Scottish tycoon Robert Archibald, who was injured during the encounter.
Despite all the drawbacks, the Unicaja for Cook's direction and triples, and Lewis' contribution, left some hope 66-57, minute 31.
But it was practically impossible because the Olympiacos when it squeezed and given its superiority in centimeters within the zone was unstoppable.
The Croatian Pivot Nikola Vujcic, managed to climb up the average basketball 81-62, minute 37, and the Unicaja turned off, giving the lead to the Olympiacos.
How much should you charge for your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can know the salary they deserve according to their profile, thanks to a new application from Trovit, the search engine with the highest number of classified ads for real estate, employment and engine in Spain.
The tool How much should you charge? calculates the salaries of users from the more than 140,000 job offers that Trovit has in Spain, from a form available on Facebook, where they must enter their profession, years of experience, age and city where they want to work.
In the week that the application is running, the search engine has detected that in general the Spanish worker "feels poorly paid", explained in a statement the product manager of Trovit, Albert Ribera.
According to the data available to Trovit from its search engines in the UK and France, Spaniards are the worst paid.
A British computer programmer charges 45,226 gross euros annually and a French one 31,059, compared to 24,000 received by a Spaniard.
Similarly, a driver charges 34,247 net euros per year in England, 25,751 in France and 16,420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the worst paid job in Spain is that of waiter, with 11,592 euros net annual; followed by that of dependent, with 14,725 euros; and that of operator, with 15,667 euros.
The most sought-after jobs on the network in the last three months are as a driver, part-time jobs and as a social worker.
Brazil sets date for Zelaya’s departure
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelaya’s stay at his embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The deposed president must leave the diplomatic legation no later than January 27, 2010, when he would officially end his term of office.
Francisco Catunda, in charge of business at the Brazilian embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knows he must leave before that date from the embassy, where he remains a refugee since September 21.
"He is aware that he has to leave on January 27, when his term ends, he has to look for another destination."
The broadcaster also quoted the former president, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the deadline: "My position is to leave as soon as possible, logically with the support of the Brazilian government," Zelaya said by phone.
After the November 29 elections (in which Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya assured that he would remain in the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, this same week he tried to seek refuge in Brazil.
The operation was ultimately frustrated by Zelaya's rejection of the status of political asylum that the "de facto" government presided over by Roberto Micheletti intended to impose on him.
Thank you very much.
After the days of wine and roses since last spring when asset inflation has been the dominant tonic in the markets, again uncertainty reappears in the markets, which should not be surprising since it is their natural state, in an environment in which agents make decisions about the future by nature uncertain.
The medicine used by central banks to stabilize markets was to monetize debt with the direct purchase of assets and indirectly giving liquidity free bar at near zero rates for financial institutions to buy assets to discount.
Central banks have already confirmed that direct asset purchases have virtually ended and, without questioning their heterodox liquidity policy, are starting to throw some sand in the gears as the ECB did with its auction next week.
Therefore, investors doubt the ability of the global economy to sustain economic recovery without such heterodox measures and we are witnessing a reversal of risk premium reduction.
Stock market volatility and corporate bond differentials have rebounded, although they remain far removed from the paranormal levels they reached earlier this year.
States were forced to socialize private risk and public debt is again affected.
Again there is a flight to quality and the US, Japan and Germany have been the refuge chosen by investors, causing an expansion of the differences of the eurozone countries with respect to Germany.
Spain had barely been affected by this episode of instability but in that came Standard & Poor's and threatened with a further revision to the downgrade of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, some uncertainty does not hurt to silence moral risk advocates who were trying to re-create awareness of those responsible for global economic policy for having curbed the destructive effects of credit restriction on job destruction, when what would have to be done is decree a new Thanksgiving Day.
However, Dubai paints a tribal struggle between the emirates to recompose power in the emirates and that of Greece we have seen before.
A government that hides public deficits, elections and a new government that pulls the blanket.
Prodi did it in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It makes no sense for the Ecofin to save Hungary from a breach of its foreign payments at the beginning of the year and to allow a euro member country to breach its commitments.
What makes sense is that the Ecofin has forced the Greek government to be transparent and to hold its citizens accountable for the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of their public finances.
If, as we expect, we are facing an episode of normalization of transitional risk premiums, after some excesses in leveraged positions, it would be within what was expected.
In the Spanish case, as long as our public debt differentials expanded like European corporate bonds, we should not worry.
If the European differentials decrease and ours continue to expand, then it would be an idiosyncratic Spanish risk.
Standard & Poor’s is an anecdote. When our advanced indicators are forcing most study services to anticipate their recovery scenarios and to revise upwards their scenario for 2011, including the OECD and the European Commission, that they return to the burden with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy does not august much life expectancy.
Again, he has all the sense that it will be an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish assets, although for the moment "prudence, friend driver".
Related Sectors
The president of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to speak yesterday before the subcommittee of the Congress of Deputies in which the energy strategy of Spain in the next two decades is discussed these days.
After his speech, followed by that of the president of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Galán gave the press a few brushstrokes of what he had raised in the closed-door subcommittee.
For the president of Iberdrola, Spain needs to invest <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>50 billion by 2020 and another <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>60 billion between that date and 2030, as long as the nuclear power plants remain open today.
If not, the necessary investments will not be 60 billion, but up to 95 billion.
Iberdrola believes that in the next decade, investments should not be aimed at increasing capacity in generation, but in distribution networks and international interconnections.
From 2020 onwards, the issue will change and the power will have to be increased.
Its focus is on both gas and coal plants with carbon capture mechanisms and, above all, renewable energies.
In this case, it considers that 18,000 new MW are needed, that is, with other "support energies".
Galán, who considers that the draft Law on Sustainable Economy that has just been approved by the Government is in line with what his company has been claiming, did not want to make blood with the real decree to encourage the consumption of national coal, which contradicts policies to combat climate change.
In his opinion, there is "a clear long-term bet" in this regard, despite the "punctual" measures, as the president of Iberdrola called them.
In any case, Galán believes that investment decisions, although they are long-term, should begin to be made as they take time to mature and a stable remuneration framework is needed to address them.
Ferrovial wins Aer Lingus 'handling' at 10 airports
Ferrovial’s subsidiary for ground-based airport services, Swissport, will play the role of preferred partner of Irish airline Aer Lingus for cargo services at ten European airports where it has a presence.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are some of the highlights.
The agreement, which has not transcended the economic terms, has a duration of five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Junta de Castilla-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed yesterday a collaboration protocol to create the Innovation Center for Intelligent Infrastructures
The alliance envisages an investment of 20 million until 2012, of which 50% belongs to Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the center will be to investigate energy efficiency on highways and airports.
Acciona disputes its first highway in Australia with Hochtief and Bouygues
Acciona fights for its first motorway in concession in Australia, a market in which it already works as an energy company and water manager.
The work at stake is that of a tunnel valued at 1.7 billion Australian dollars (about 1.047 million euros).
The French Bouygues and the German Hochtief are their rivals.
A five-kilometre tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane on the East Coast has become the closest option for Acciona to settle in the country as a highway builder and dealer.
The City Council wants to have it ready by the end of 2014
After opting for public-private collaboration (PPP) to take the project forward, in a business plan sponsored by Erns & Young, the Administration already has a final list of candidates to get the work done and exploit the toll.
Waiting for their bids to be submitted in May, the projected investment amounts to 1.7 billion Australian dollars (1.047 million euros) and in the last phase compete three consortia with a notable presence of European manufacturers.
The group named Transcity is led by Acciona, the only Spanish woman in the league, and their partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of the largest Australian construction companies, while the second, based in Italy, is one of the largest European specialists in underground works.
Against the Acciona team plays the Northern Direct consortium, with the presence of the British Laing O'Rourke, the Australian infrastructure manager Transfield and the French construction group Bouygues.
The third and last consortium that has passed the screening is the so-called LBRJV, where the capital shares the Australian Leighton (branch of the German construction company Hochtief, in turn participated by ACS), the local Baulderstone (owned by the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the gala firm specialized in civil works Razel.
The Australian infrastructure market promises major works and privatizations, but brings with it a clear difficulty of entry if not by way of the acquisition of a local construction firm.
A strategy that has been followed by the aforementioned Hochtief or Bilfinger, in addition to Asian references, and that continues to be a pending subject for the Spanish giants in the sector.
Only ACS has achieved a position in that market through its 30% stake in Hochtief, the owner of the aforementioned Leighton.
Assets millionaires
Acciona is committed to a geographical area of the utmost importance for the sector, in which it already has a prominent presence through its activity as an energy supplier and in the desalination business.
Among other assets, it has its largest wind farm, that of Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria, and leads the group of companies in charge of lifting and managing the Adelaide desalination plant, with a budget of 700 million.
Their intention now is to consolidate those two areas and take advantage of synergies to enter the fields of construction and infrastructure operation.
The subterranean toll road, promoted by the Brisbane City Infrastructure Office and called Northern Link, is called to connect the Toowong Western Highway with the bypass road at Kelvin Grove (see map) along 5 kilometers of tunnel. It is the largest performance in traffic to reduce conge.
The timetable set by the Administration sets the award for the summer of 2010 and the start of the works in December next year.
Although this payment step would open to traffic in the last months of 2014, the work is not expected to be completed until 2016.
The tunnel began to be designed in 2005.
It will include two lanes per direction, electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The Queensland government will contribute $500 million (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>308 million) to its funding.
Brisbane already offers business to Hochtief
Australia continues to yield remarkable results to Hochtief, who yesterday announced the acquisition of a contract with the government valued at 154 million.
The ACS-participated company will enable, through its local subsidiary Leighton, the infrastructure of the national broadband network with fiber optic cable.
This performance will provide fast internet access to 400,000 people and will give the German woman a job for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has transferred the construction project of the King George Tower, 27 storeys, in the Australian city of Brisbane. The works were still to begin and Hochtief has closed the sale by 129 million.
Already in the UK, specifically in Manchester, he will share with Laing O’Rourke the construction and operation of two schools for 25 years.
The initial investment will be 75 million euros.
FCC awarded a tunnel in Slovenia for $64 million
FCC, through its subsidiary Alpine, has been awarded the construction of a 2.1-kilometre-long tunnel for a Slovenian highway for an amount of 64.5 million euros.
The firm gets this contract days after the Bosruck Tunnel extension works (Austria) by 130 million.
In this way, Alpine reinforces its expertise in the construction of tunnels.
The start of the work is planned for early 2010 and its implementation period will be extended for 32 months.
Mrs. Rushmore is awarded the advertising of Renfe
Renfe has procured advertising and marketing services for the next two years to the agency Ms. Rushmore for an estimated amount of three million euros annually, the railway operator said.
Ms. Rushmore has been chosen from among the 16 agencies that submitted to the competition called by Renfe, of which four were finalists, among them TBWA, who was responsible for creativity in the last three years.
From now on, Mrs. Rushmore will be in charge of the design and production of the campaigns.
Fine of $63 million to France Télécom for stopping competition
The French competition regulator has imposed a fine of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>63 million on France Télécom for anticompetitive conduct in the Caribbean regions belonging to the country.
According to this institution, the operator limited the competition in fixed and mobile phones with the signing of exclusive agreements, pricing plans and consumer loyalty programs outside of the regulation.
With this sanction, the former French monopoly and still state-owned company has accumulated more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>560 million in fines since 1994 for obstructing its competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday, in fact, has been increased because the competition authority considers that France Télécom has committed similar offences in the past and is therefore reincident.
Store of applications
On the other hand, the mobile subsidiary of the French company has followed in the footsteps of other operators and has opened an online application store, with the aim of increasing revenues that do not come from voice transmission.
In principle, the Orange app store will be active in France and the UK.
It will have to wait until 2010 for it to reach other countries, such as Spain.
Playing the Champions League has reported 476.4 million to Madrid and Barça since its origins
The Champions League has become a source of income for clubs since it was born in 1992.
Both Real Madrid and Barcelona have earned $476.4 million since then, making them the third and fifth club to earn the most money in the competition.
The leader of the list is Manchester United.
The leader of the list is Manchester United.
Winning the UEFA Champions League not only brings glory, it is also one of the major sources of revenue for big clubs.
So much so, that the competition has distributed 5,362.5 million euros to the 105 teams (12 of them Spanish) that have participated in the event since the tournament was created in the 1992/1993 season, according to UEFA data.
Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona have come out well behind this cast.
The white club has been the third on the continent to have the most money in pocket for participating, and the only one, along with AC Milan, to have won the trophy three times.
The Catalan, the current champion and the last winner of the extinct European Cup in 1992, is the fifth in the classification.
The list is led by Manchester United and Bayern Munich, the two teams that, in addition, billed more money for participating in the last Champions League.
And that, despite losing both to Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country to achieve the most money through the Champions League, despite having achieved more titles than any other (five, by the four of Italy, the three of England and the two of Germany).
Distributed
This apparent paradox is explained by the complicated money-sharing procedure applied by UEFA.
For this exercise, the body presided over by Michel Platini plans to enter 1.090 million for the Champions League.
Of this money, UEFA will devote 413.1 million to fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that participated in the previous qualifying round (including Atlético de Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who managed to participate received 3.8 million just for being there, in addition to another 550,000 euros for each game they disputed.
There are also bonuses to win (800,000 euros) and to tie (400,000 for each team). The eight finalists will receive three million each; the eight quarter-finalists, 3.3 million.
The last four will pocket $4 million each.
The champion will win $9 million, compared to the finalist’s $5.2 million.
Thus, in terms of fixed payments, a club will earn at least 7.1 million, and a maximum of 31.2 million.
Barça, on the other hand, pocketed 2.5 million for winning the European Super Cup in August.
But there are also variable payments, to which 337.8 million are allocated.
This money is distributed according to the proportional value of each television market.
Spanish is one of the main ones, and has four seats allocated.
The champion of the previous year is left with 40% of the money allocated, 30% for the second, 20% for the third and 10% for the fourth.
The other part will be paid according to the number of games played in this year’s edition.
New Rumasa offers 61 million euros for 29.9% of Sos
The New Rumasa group unraveled the details of the offer to buy shares with which it seeks to acquire a cap of between 25% and 29.9% of the capital of Sos.
A percentage that does not force you to launch a public tender (OPA) for all securities.
Specifically, Nueva Rumasa offers 1.5025 euros per share that would be paid out in 10 years and that would be repaid with interest for such a 1% annual postponement.
Sos’ shares closed yesterday at 1.85 euros; therefore, the offer of Nueva Rumasa values the company 18% below the market.
According to Nueva Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the actual valuation of Sos.
The offer is conditional on the appointment of eight of the 15 advisors.
The Jerezan group gives a 15-day deadline for shareholders to communicate their interest in selling securities.
The CNMV said it had not been informed of the offer, even though the Ruiz Mateos company said it had contacted the regulator.
If carried out, the disbursement would reach 611.7 million when the capitalization of Sos is 254.27 million.
Meanwhile, Sos continues to restructure his address.
In an attempt to stay away from possible purchase offers and the judicial vagaries of her former managers, the brothers Jesus and Jaime Salazar, she announced the election of María Luisa Jordá as director of internal audit.
A decision that makes her the first woman to hold a senior position in the food company.
This is a newly created position that will directly depend on the group president.
And it is not exempt from controversy, as the company remains immersed in the legal battle for the alleged diversion of more than 230 million from Sos to Salazar societies.
In fact, it cannot be ruled out that over the next few months Sos will unveil new diversions of funds
Regarding the credit to the Salazars, yesterday the former councillors Ildefonso Ortega and <0xC3><0x81>ngel Fernández Noriega (representatives of CCM and Unicaja) declared at the National Audience and claimed that they approved the diversion of 212 million without knowing their fate.
The CNMV approves the exclusion opa of Paternina that presented Inversora Mer
The National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) yesterday authorized the exclusion order filed by Inversora Mer over Federico Paternina on October 9.
The supervisory body has explained that it authorizes this operation on the understanding that its terms comply with current rules and considers "sufficient" the content of the explanatory leaflet submitted following the amendments introduced on December 2.
The CNMV has specified that the offer is aimed at the acquisition of 550.008 shares of Federico Paternina at a price of 7.65 euros per share, which represents 8.95% of its share capital, which is composed of 6,142,786 shares admitted to trading on the Madrid and Bilbao Stock Exchanges.
It has also explained that 5,592,778 million shares have been immobilized, which cannot be transmitted in any way until the end of the offer, of which it has specified that the price has been fixed by Federico Paternina, in accordance with the provisions of the current regulations.
New Tools for Perishing Cars
In these days of storms and accidents, not only do car workshops win.
Every day thousands of cars that have suffered a crash are towed to a workshop, where an expert must assess the damage suffered and what the cost of repair will be.
No accident is the same, and calculating the cost of parts and labor time can be a long and complicated task.
Manually calculating the cost of a repair of between 20,000 and 30,000 euros, including parts and workmanship, can take two or three hours.
Instead, with the support of the latest computer tools, it would be a matter of minutes.
That’s why nearly 100% of experts use this type of system.
Service providers and solutions for accident assessment and maintenance are dedicated to collecting the information provided by the manufacturers, then elaborating it and offering it to their customers in the form of a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex, of the American group Solera, is the leading company; 80% of the evaluations are made with its products.
The other companies competing in the field of assessment and information processing tools are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data provided by manufacturers is far from simple.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, commercial director of Audatex, in Spain they work with 63 manufacturers and importers, and each of them provides them with information in different formats.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed continues to increase, to the point that in the last five years more versions, variants and motorizations have been released than in the previous fifteen years.
As soon as a new car comes on the market, these companies get to work.
It is a very difficult job, because you have to catalog each of the thousands of parts of the vehicle and enter its price.
In addition, from each model is made a "smart" graphic image where you can "pinch" different parts of tourism.
If it’s a massive sales model, the job can be ready in a week if the process goes very fast.
If it is a minority car, it can take three or four months. Currently, Audatex has complete information about 99.2% of the cars sold in Spain.
Among the most exclusive models they have information about Porsche, but not Ferrari or Lamborghini, for example.
As for the mobile park that circulates, they exceed 99%.
To carry out the work of documentation and the development of the databases, Audatex has eight centers spread around the world (Spain, France, Germany, USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan), and each of them is specialized in specific brands.
The national headquarters is in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than a hundred technicians (usually mechanics experts) work simultaneously with three computer screens.
Audatex invests <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>90 million annually in developing these databases.
Every month, 2.5 million data are included, and customers receive updates every two days.
The elaboration of this huge flow of information allows these companies to give them different uses and offer a variety of products.
The most frequent use focuses on repair and maintenance, but depending on which countries there are also tools for scrapping parts management or for calculating the venal or residual value of a car.
The only company that has a guide that informs about the value of used ones in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not offer it in our country, but in the United States.
In view of the products offered by Audatex, it is easy to get an idea of the type of support that can be provided to professionals in the sector.
This company offers ten different tools, being the star product AudaPlus, the standard solution for accident assessment, intended for experts.
Includes cars, motorcycles and light or heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it includes the estimated repair times by the manufacturer or the paint bars.
This tool is paid according to use, for each valuation.
The highest cost is 5.75 euros, for customers who use it little, a maximum of ten times a month.
Then each insurance company, which carries out thousands of reviews, negotiates its price with Audatex.
Other products, such as AudaVIN, allow the total identification of a vehicle and the equipment with which it exited the assembly line only with its frame number.
AudaGlass focuses on the moons of vehicles, and AudaSubastas is a service open to the professional sector on the internet that allows bidding for vehicles declared total disaster.
Its statistics service is very useful for identifying trends, performing geodemographic analyses or knowing the deviations by brands.
It can be studied, for example, how many models of a given brand have gone through the workshop due to breakdowns or how many have suffered serious accidents in a given period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of tools.
It markets, among other things, Gt Estimate, which is also intended for experts and also provides digital images, access to parts or official manufacturer prices and times.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa group founded in 1971 as a provider of services and solutions for the assessment of damage, breakdown or maintenance of the automobile.
The Gt Rating Guide is your historical benchmark product in the market.
They work with 24,000 users in workshops, 3,100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
Their turnover has grown at a rate of 20% annually in the last three years, and in 2008 they accounted for 10.8 million euros.
At the beginning of last year they began their process of internationalization, with the installation of an office in Paris.
Audatex was born in Germany in 1966 and established in Spain in 1979.

In our country, the company will earn 19.1 million euros, 7.2% more than the previous year.
In 2005, the Solera group was worth $1 billion on the stock market, and now its shares are listed for a total value of $2.4 billion.
Since 2007 it is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and is included in the Standard & Poor's benchmark index.
Internet Auction of Accidented Cars
Last October, the Solera group bought Autoonline, an online platform for the sale of cars, motorcycles and special vehicles.
The transaction involved a disbursement of 59.5 million euros for 85% of the company’s capital, which could be extended next year to the remaining 15%.
The objective of the acquisition was to offer more value-added services to its customers, with the possibility of accessing an immense international market.
This valuation and purchase sales service is aimed exclusively at professionals in the sector, such as insurance companies, experts, renting companies, workshops, scrapshops and professional sellers who must register before starting operations.
This platform was created in 1996 in Germany and manages more than 650,000 operations across Europe, 500,000 of them in Germany.
Among its main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
The website currently has more than 1,500 registered sellers and 4,000 experts.
3,000 ads are managed daily and about 100 new ads are included in the Spanish market each day.
According to Spanish law, a car whose chassis number has been dropped cannot be re-circulated, but certain parts that are not damaged can be used as spare parts.
Cars with historical value can be given up even if they have been given up after a far-fetched effort.
Workshop budget in four steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, the company Audatex guarantees that the user gets a budget in just four steps: identifying the vehicle, looking for the spare part, creating a budget and generating a budget.
Ease of use is an essential condition for these systems, especially to convince older professionals, who to a greater or lesser extent tend to be more reluctant to use new management techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, which are 666 passenger cars, 109 SUVs, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Of course, to use it you need a computer with an internet connection.
Once the model to be repaired is identified by its frame number, a real graphic image of the model in question appears and then the necessary replacement is selected.
The user can include variables such as labor price, surcharges or discounts, and then can print the quote to deliver to the customer.
AudaTaller is not an evaluation tool like AudaPlus, but rather a reference catalog.
The main difference between the two systems is that the workshop-oriented does not include estimated labor times.
The cost of using this tool for the workshop is 350 euros per year, which the customer can finance.
The company Audatex is currently working to make these images three-dimensional.
This is an innovation that mechanics see with very good eyes, as it will allow, for example, to select a door and turn it around to see the inside face.
