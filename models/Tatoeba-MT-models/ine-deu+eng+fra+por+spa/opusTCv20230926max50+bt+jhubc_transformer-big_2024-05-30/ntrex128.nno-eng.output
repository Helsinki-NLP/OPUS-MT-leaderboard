Welsh members of the National Assembly are afraid not to be taken seriously
Several members of the National Assembly were recently horrified by a proposal to change the name from assembly member or AM (member of the Assembly) to member of the Welsh Parliament or MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The reaction came due to plans to change the name of the National Assembly of the Welsh Parliament.
Members from several political parties are concerned that they may be ridiculed.
A Labour member said his group is concerned about your "MWP rhymes on Twp and Pwp"
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, "twp" means silly and "pwp" means bullshit.
A member of the Plaid party said the group "is not satisfied" and has proposed alternatives.
A Welsh Conservative member said his group has an "open mind" when it comes to the name change, but added that the MWP is not far from the word "muppet".
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced not unlike the English Yorkshire dialect's pronunciation of the letter u.
The National Assembly's delegation, now writing bills to introduce the name change, said: "The final decision on which members of the National Assembly will be named will, of course, be up to the members themselves."
A Welsh official decision from 2017 empowered the National Assembly to change its name.
In June, the delegation published the results of a public hearing on name proposals demonstrating great support for calling the Assembly the Welsh Parliament.
As for the title of National Assembly Members, the delegation prefers Welsh Member of Parliament or WMP, while the MWP election received the most support during the public hearing.
The National Assembly members have reportedly made other proposals, but the struggle to unite has given the head of the delegation, Elin Jones, the task of delivering the bill in a couple of weeks.
The legislative enactment of the reforms contains other changes to how the delegation should also function, including rules on disqualification of Assembly members and the design of a committee system.
Assembly members will be able to vote on what to name when debating the bill.
Macedonian donors vote in referendum to change the name of the country
Voters will vote on Sunday to change the name of their country to "Republic of North Macedonia."
The referendum was decided to resolve a conflict that has been going on for decades with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of the neighboring country in the north represents a claim on the territory and has had many objections to Macedonia's membership applications to the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the referendum on the name change, said he will look away from the result.
Those who support the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price to become a member of the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's Clocks Silent as Harlem, New York Churches Strive
"The old I have spoken with said that in old days there was a bar and a church on every corner," said Adams.
"Today none of the parts are found."
He said he understands why the bars disappeared.
"People are socializing in other ways nowadays," he said.
"Bars are no longer the stoves in the neighborhood that people visit normally."
As for the churches, he is concerned that the money from selling the properties will not last as long as the tenants believe, "and sooner or later they are back where they started."
He added that churches can be replaced by condominiums filled with the kind of people who don't care about helping the historic sites of the neighborhood.
"The vast majority who buy condominiums in these buildings are white," he said. "and so the day comes when all the churches will be closed, because it is unlikely that these people who move into the condominiums will become members of these churches."
Both churches were built of white parish before Harlem became a black neighborhood - Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin's Church a decade later.
The original White Methodist Congregation moved out in the 1930s.
A black parish that had preached nearby, moved into the building.
St. Martin was taken over by a black parish led by Pastor John Howard Johnson, who also led the boycott of the stores on 125th Street, a main store in Harlem where the owners were opposed to employing or promoting blacks.
The building suffered major damage in a fire in 1939, but when Pastor Johnson's followers planned to rebuild it, they also ordered a new clock game.
Pastor David Johnson, son of Johnson senior and successor in St. Martin, was proud and called the bell game "the bells of the poor."
The expert who played the bell in July called it something else: "A cultural treasure" and "a historical instrument that cannot be replaced."
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also commented that it was the first clock game in the world to be played on by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who left the church to play on the larger clock game in the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said that Saint Martin did not find a replacement for him.
What has happened in St. Martin in recent months has become a complicated story about architects and construction workers, some of them added by the leaders of the lay people of the church, and others of the episcopal diocese.
The sacristy, who heads the parish and consists of the leaders of the laity, wrote to the diocese in July with concerns that the diocese "would ask the sacristy to pay," although the sacristy was not involved in the diocese's appointment of architects and construction workers.
Some of the members of the parish have complained of the lack of openness from the diocese.
13-Year-Old Injured by Shark During Hummingbird Dive in California
Authorities report that a 13-year-old was attacked by a shark on Saturday while diving for hummingbirds in California on the opening day of the hummingbird season.
The attack on her just before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel commented to KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour Saturday morning when he heard the boy crying for help. He paddled to the boy with a group and pulled him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought only the boy was thrilled to have caught a hummer, before realizing that the boy was yelling "something bit me!
Something hit me!"
"His whole collarbone was torn off," Hammel said that he observed when he reached the boy.
"I screamed that everyone had to get out of the water: there's a shark in the water!" added Hammel.
The boy was picked up by an air ambulance and taken to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, and his condition is critical.
It is unclear what kind of shark it was that attacked the boy.
Bathing guard Captain Larry Giles said in a press conference that a shark was observed in the area a couple of weeks earlier, but that shark was not a dangerous black shark.
Giles added that the boy suffered serious injuries to the upper body.
Authorities closed access to the water from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours to investigate and secure the area.
Giles commented that there are more than 135 different species of sharks in the area, but most are not believed to be dangerous.
Shop chain Sainsbury's bets on beauty products
The British store chain Sainsbury's will compete with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams' beauty products and offer grocery services in the store.
As part of an investment in the UK's beauty market, worth <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion and continuing to grow as fashion and interior stores decline, Sainsbury's is set to test out their beauty products in 11 stores next year, and more stores if it becomes a success.
The investment in beauty products comes at a time when the shelves that used to be filled with TVs, microwaves and interiors are now empty.
Sainbury's said they will double the number of beauty products to 3000 products and offer the brands Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
They should provide the L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees brands with more space and have separate areas for each brand such as in the Boots stores.
The store will also relaunch its own makeup series Boutique and make most products vegan, which will attract more young customers.
In addition, the perfume dealer Fragrance Shop will test the sale of its perfumes in two of Sainsbury's stores, the first opened in Croydon, London, last week, and the second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Action online and a shift towards buying small amounts of food every day from local small stores, means that large store chains need to find new ways to reach customers.
Mike Coupe, managing director of Sainsbury's, has commented that the stores will look more and more like a department store, while the store chains try to fight the low-cost stores Aldi and Lidl with more services and goods that are not food.
Sainsbury's has merged with the interior chain Argos in hundreds of stores and introduced several Habitat stores, since they purchased both chains two years ago. Sainsbury's claims that this has increased the grocery store and thus defended the acquisition.
The store chain's previous attempt to renew the beauty and pharmacy departments was not a success.
Sainsbury's collaborated with Boots in the early 2000s, but this ended when the parties disagreed on how to share the profits from the pharmacies in the stores.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold the Celesio pharmacy chain, which had 281 pharmacies and owned the Lloyds pharmacy chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
They added that Lloyds still has a role to play and is to offer an expanded luxury range of skin products, including the La Roche-Posay and Vichy brands, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial director, commented: "We have changed how beauty shelves will look and be experienced to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also recruited colleagues with special expertise to offer beauty services.
Our brands are designed to suit all needs, while the attractive environment and practical locations mean that we are now an attractive beauty destination that challenges the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones "race" after Holly Willoghby withdraws from deal worth <0xC2><0xA3>11 million
The star of the television program Dragons The, Peter Jones, is "racial" after TV host Holly Willoughby withdrew from an agreement with his lifestyle brand worth <0xC2><0xA3>11 million to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby does not have time to promote their Truly interior and affiliation label.
The couple's collaboration has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The host of the program This Morning, 37, made the news known on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has left the star of Dragons Den, Peter Jones, amid the development of their new collaboration on a lifestyle brand to focus on their own contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources report that Jones was "racial" when the golden Holly confessed during a stressful meeting on Tuesday in the headquarters of Jones' business in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that Holly's new contracts - worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million - mean she no longer has time to cooperate on the interior and accessories brand Tru.
The collaboration has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was thought to double Willoughby's estimated fortune of <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
Willoughby, 37, used Instagram to announce that she would not work with Truly, while Jones fled Britain to settle down in one of her holiday homes.
A source said, "Truly was definitely at the top of Holly's priorities.
That would be her long-term plan for the future, and would last for many decades.
Her decision to withdraw has surprised everyone involved.
Nobody believed their own ears on Tuesday, Truly was so close to the launch.
There's a department store in Marlow filled with goods ready for sale."
Experts believe that the decision of the This Morning host, which is one of the richest stars in the UK, can cost the company millions due to hefty investments in products, from pillows to candles to clothing and interiors, and can cause delays with the launch.
And that may mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been close friends of Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Willoughby created the Truly brand with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined the board in March.
The couple are vacationing together and Jones owns 40 percent of Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin hosting ITV's program I'm A Celebrity.
A source near Jones said last night, "We are not commenting on his business."
Tough conversations "and then we fell in love"
He joked about the criticism he was getting from the media to make a comment some might experience as "unpresidential" and to be so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Said Trump with his bullshit voice as "news reader".
"I have not given up anything."
He commented that Kim is interested in a new meeting after their first meeting in Singapore in June, which Trump called a major step towards the disarmament of North Korea's nuclear weapons program.
But negotiations on the nuclear weapons program have stopped.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea has not received a "correspondent response" from the United States regarding North Korea's early disarmament.
Instead, he added, the United States continued with sanctions to pressure North Korea.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech.
“It’s going great between us and North Korea,” he said.
"We were going to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
Now we have a great relationship."
He added that his work to improve relations with Kim has brought positive results - the end of rocket testing, aid in the release of hostages and the return of the remains to American soldiers.
He defended his unusual approach when it comes to relations with Kim.
"It's so easy to be presidential, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get in, we had about 200 people standing right there," Trump said, pointing to the group standing in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquakes in Indonesia destroy island and kill hundreds
After the Lombok earthquake, foreign aid organizations were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the residents of Lombok had to flee, no one declared a national state of emergency, which is necessary to obtain international emergency aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they have been very clear that they do not want international help, so it's a bit challenging," Sumbung said.
While the Rescue Children assemble a team to travel to Palu, it is still not certain whether employees with foreign passports will be allowed to work in the field.
Sutopo, the spokesman for the National Crisis Agency of Indonesia, said that authorities are evaluating the situation in Palu to see if international organizations are allowed to offer emergency assistance.
Although Indonesia is subject to earthquakes often, the country is not particularly prepared for the forces of nature.
In the Aceh area, they have built shelters for tsunamis, but they are not common in the rest of the country.
Despite tsunami warnings in Palu, there was no alarm, most likely resulting in more casualties.
Traveling between the Indonesian islands is usually quite challenging.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship which was docked in Lombok to treat those injured in the earthquake is now on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo focused on improving Indonesia's infrastructure during the presidential election, and has spent a lot of money on new roads and railways.
But lack of funding has made it difficult for President Joko's administration, and next year there are elections again.
President Joko is also being pressured when it comes to sectarian tensions in Indonesia, while members of the Muslim majority have welcomed his conservative belief.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands had to flee as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets and used machetes, arrows and bows, and other primitive weapons.
See: Daniel Sturridge saves Liverpool vs. Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League loss to Chelsea by scoring in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge got the ball from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 metres from Chelsea's goal while the position was 1-0.
He pushed the ball to the left before kicking him up and towards the goal.
The attempt sealed high above the penalty area and faucet towards the right upper corner of the goal.
Finally, the ball fell over a bouncing Kepa Arrizabalaga and into the goal.
"I was just trying to get into that position to take the ball, and I knew players like Shaq are trying to get as far ahead as possible, so I was just trying to give myself as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante come and dropped the ball once without thinking about it, and then I shot the ball."
Chelsea led 1-0 after the break after scoring in the 25th minute by Belgian star Eden Hazard.
Before the goal, Hazard gave the ball to Mateo Kovacic before scoring off near the midfield and into Liverpool's half.
Kovacic quickly took the ball to the midfield.
Then he shot it in a pleasurable way and hired Hazard into the penalty area.
Hazard ran faster than Liverpool's defense and scored with his left foot right past goalkeeper Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will play against Naples in the group stage of the Champions League at 15 o'clock on Wednesday at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will play against Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 15 o'clock on Thursday in London.
The number of victims of the Indonesian tsunami increases to 832
The number of victims of the Indonesia earthquake and tsunami has increased to 832, the country's emergency agency reported early Sunday.
Many people were trapped in the ruins of buildings that collapsed in the earthquake, which occurred on Friday and had a strength of 7.5 followed by 6-meter high waves, the agency's spokesman, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, reported in a press conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, is now covered with collapsed buildings.

I also encourage everyone, including taxi drivers, as he may catch anything on the dashboard camera, to contact us in case they have important information."
A police spokesman has confirmed that the woman who was found is from Birkenhead, and that she was found in a home.
This afternoon, friends who think they know the woman have come to the area to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation continued and police have stated that they are in the process of informing the victim's family.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews has tried to get into his own apartment, but has been told by police that no one is allowed to enter or exit the building.
He did not know what to say when he found out what had happened.
Residents have been told that they are not allowed to enter their apartments for many hours.
Someone overheard a police officer say to a man that the entire area is an event.
A woman came to the scene crying.
She says again and again "it's so terrible".
At 2 p.m., two police cars could be seen inside the police gang and even a police car outside the gang.
A crowd of policemen stood within the police gang and observed a block of apartments.

Parliament statue of Cromwell becomes last victim of "rewriting history"
The removal of the statue would be karma for Cromwell and the Taliban-like destruction of several cultural and religious artefacts in England as his Puritan followers did during the 17th-century Civil War.
However, the Cromwell Association described Crick's proposal to remove the statue as "stuff" and "an attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, the chairman of the Cromwell Association, said, "It was inevitable in the current debate about the removal of statues, that the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside the Westminster Palace would become a target.
The iconoclasm during the English Civil War was not ordered or executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps mistaken Cromwell would have been sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor, Thomas, in the century before.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's excellent representation of Cromwell is evidence of public opinion in the 19th century, and is part of the historiography of a figure that many still think is worth celebrating."
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell was in the 19th century, and is still today, seen as a defender of Parliament against external pressure, and in his case, of course, it was against the monarchy.
Whether this representation is correct or not is still a topic of discussion in historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict in the mid-17th century has shaped the development of our nation, and Cromwell was an individual as we know represented one side of that divide.
What he achieved as Lord Protector is also worth celebrating and remembering."
Killer Pig Attacks and Kills Chinese Farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig at a market in southwest China, according to local media reports.
The man, surnamed Yuan, was found dead, with his artery cut off and covered with blood, near a pig binge at the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou Province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer is preparing to give pigs vaccines on a farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He had recently travelled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning he found his cousin dead, and discovered that the gate of one of the pig farms was open.
He said that in the bin there was a large male pig with blood around its mouth.
The autopsy showed that a 250 kilogram pig had killed the farmer, according to the report.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and destroyed," the cousin, named Wu, told Guiyang Evening News.
Surveillance cameras show that Yuan came to the market at 04:40 on Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed him did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The market leader told Evening News that the pig had been locked in to prevent him from attacking others, while police gathered evidence of the crime scene.
Yuan's family is now negotiating compensation with the market leader.
Although it is rare, such attacks from pigs have occurred before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband in Massachusetts, causing the man serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 295-pound pig kept a Welsh farmer trapped between him and a tractor, until his wife frightened the pig away.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba reported to CBC News that pigs are not aggressive to usual, but that the taste of blood can trigger the animals.
"They just want to play.
They like to bite a little, they're curious ... they won't hurt you.
You just have to have enough respect for them," he said.
Remains of Hurricane Rosa bring rain to southwestern U.S.
As predicted in the weather report, Hurricane Rosa becomes weaker over the cool waters along the northern coast of Mexico.
Nevertheless, Rosa will bring rainfall to northern Mexico and southwestern United States in the coming days.
Rosa had wind speeds of up to 136 km/h and was a Category 1 hurricane until 5:00 a.m. in the eastern time zone of the United States on Sunday, and the hurricane center was 620 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is moving north on Sunday.
In the meantime, a low pressure is formed over the Pacific Ocean moving eastward towards the west coast of the United States. Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday in the form of a tropical storm, and will move tropical humidity northward to the southwestern United States.
Rosa will bring up to 25 centimeters of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
The tropical humidity will react with the low pressure and cause thick rain in the southwest for the next few days.
Locally, between 3 and 10 centimeters of rain can create dangerous floods and possible landslides in the desert.
Tropical humidity will cause rainfall of between 5 and 7 centimeters per hour in some parts of the southwestern United States, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Between 5 and 10 centimeters of rain is expected in parts of the southwestern United States; especially over large parts of Arizona.
Dangerous floods can occur due to scattered terrain and tropical rain.
It is cautioned against hiking in the desert on foot due to the danger of tropical rain.
The rain can turn canyons into flooding rivers and lightning and storms will bring strong winds and dust.
The coming low pressure will also bring rain to parts of the southern California coast.
Total rainfall of over 1 centimeter is possible, which can create small streams and smooth roads.
This will be the first rain town for the season in the region.
Spreading tropical rainy towns will start in Arizona late Sunday evening and early Monday morning, before rain increases late Monday and Tuesday.
The Four Corners region can expect a lot of rain on Tuesday and Wednesday.
October may witness intense temperature fluctuations throughout the United States while the Arctic becomes colder, but tropical regions will still be quite hot.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic differences in temperatures, even between small areas.
Sunday was an example of dramatic temperature differences in central parts of the United States.
There is almost 20 degrees difference in temperature between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, late summer heat will try to build up and spread again.
Much of the central and eastern United States is expected to experience a hot start in October, with 25 degrees and up from the southern part of the Great Plains to parts of the northeastern United States.
New York City can reach 25 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees above average.
The long-term forecast indicates that there are high chances of above-average temperatures in the eastern U.S. through the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watch Brett Kavanaugh hearing
On Thursday, more than 20 million people watched the testimony of Brett Kavanaugh in the U.S. Supreme Court and the woman who accused him of sexual assault in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six different television channels.
At the same time, the political discussion around the case continued, with interruptions in the regular television programs of various broadcasters to reveal the latest news on Friday: an agreement reached by Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake that the FBI will investigate the allegations during the next week.
Ford told the Supreme Court committee that she is 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh felt her when he was drunk and tried to take off her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh said, during an emotional interrogation, that he is 100 percent sure that it did not happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people saw the interception on Friday, according to Nielsen.
The company reached this figure by finding the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News and MSNBC.
The numbers were not clear from other channels that showed offline, including PBS, C-SPAN, and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen also has trouble counting viewers watching from the office.
To put this in perspective, there is a similar number of viewers watching an American football final or the Oscars.
Fox News' hosts have supported Kavanaugh, and the channel was also the one with the most viewers during the day with 5.69 million viewers, Nielsen said.
ABC was in second place with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
People are still interested in hearing.
Flake was in the spotlight during the drama on Friday.
After Flake, who is a moderate Republican, declared he is on Kavanaugh's side, he was filmed by CNN and CBS while protesters shouted after him on his way to a hearing with a judgement committee on Friday.
He stood and watched on the ground for several minutes while the Protestants mumbled at him on CNN live.
"I stand here right in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to our country?"
Some said to him, "You have power, while so many women are powerless."
Flake said his office has spoken out, and before entering the elevator he said he would have more to say during the committee hearing.
The broadcasting agency showed the hearing on television when the Judiciary Committee would vote for or against the nomination of Kavanaugh to the full Senate and further voting.
But Flake said he could only do so if the FBI investigates the allegations against Kavanaugh over the next week, which the Democrats have also demanded.
Flake was partly convinced after talking to his friend, Democrat and Senator Chris Coons.
After speaking with Coons and several other senators afterwards, Flake made a decision.
Flake's decision proved to have power, because it became clear that the Republicans could not vote for Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the complaints against Kavanaugh.
Theresa May accuses critics of "playing politics" when it comes to Brexit
Britain's Prime Minister, Theresa May, blames critics of her plans to leave the EU for "playing politics" with Britain's future without regard to national interests, in an interview with The Sunday Times newspaper.
Theresa May is in Birmingham, England, to attend the Conservative Party's conference on September 29, 2018.
Alongside the interview with May on the front page of the Sunday Times stands an interview with former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson, in which he goes on to attack the so-called Chequers Brexit plan and says that the proposal that Britain and the EU should collect each other's fees is "absolutely absurd."
Wayde Sims shooting in the U.S.: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson for the Sims shooting
Police have arrested a man suspected of the fatal shooting where Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player from Louisiana State University (LSU), was killed.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and imprisoned for intentional murder, police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.
An official video shows the confrontation between the Sims and Simpson, and police said the Sims lost their glasses during the fight.
Police found the glasses at the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, according to a report from the WAFB channel, which is linked to CBS.
After interviewing Simpson, police said he admitted to having shot Wayde.
Simpson's bail was set at $350,000, reports local newspaper The Advocate.
The East Baton Rouge coroner released an early autopsy report on Friday showing that the cause of death was a shot in the head that went into the neck.
Police in Baton Rouge thank Louisiana State Police Special Forces, State Police Crime Lab, Southern University Police and local residents for helping them find Simpson.
The athletic director at the LSU, Joe Alleva, thanked the local police for being "awakened in achieving justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
The 2 meter high basketball player grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for the LSU.
On average, he scored 5.6 points with 2.6 setbacks per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team is "comfortless" after Wayde was killed.
"This is something we are always afraid of," Wade said.
Volcano spills ash over Mexico City
Ash from the volcano Popocatepetl has reached southern parts of the capital of Mexico.
The National Center for Crisis Prevention is urging Mexicans to stay away from the volcano on Sunday after activity increased in the crater and the center recorded 183 gas and ash emissions within 24 hours.
The centre had observed several rumblings and tremors.
Images on social media show thin layers of ash on cars in different neighborhoods of Mexico City, including Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noted an increase in activity in the volcano, located 72 kilometers southeast of the capital, since a 7.1-magnitude earthquake hit central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano is known as "Don Goyo" and has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists within the anniversary of the independence vote
Six protesters were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after protesters for self-mutilation clashed with police forces, and thousands of other protesters protested for self-mutilation one year after the vote on possible eviction from Spain.
A group of masked separatists were held back by police forces as they threw eggs and powder coatings that created dark clouds of dust in streets usually filled with tourists.
Collisions also erupted later in the day, and police used batons to prevent escalation.
For several hours the separatists shouted "Don't forget, don't forgive" while the Protestants against self-determination shouted, "Long live Spain."
Local news channels reported that fourteen people were being treated for minor injuries after the protests.
The mood is still pressed in the region and many will still have independence one year after the 1 October referendum, which was called illegal by Madrid but was celebrated by separatists in Catalonia.
Most voters voted for independence, but there was also low voter turnout among those who were against independence and boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to prevent the riots and violent clashes occurred in the region.
Groups who were too self-reliant slept in tents on Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of state police.
However, the demonstration went off the pile, but it was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who took part in the separatist protests along with his wife, said he no longer has hopes of independence in Catalonia.
"Last year we experienced one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying of joy to be able to vote for independence, but now we are stuck again," he said.
Although they won the regional elections last December, the Catalan parties who are too independent are struggling to hold power this year, while many of their leaders are in exile or arrest while awaiting trial for their role in the organization of the referendum and the subsequent independence declaration.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who filmed the protests in support of the police on her phone, said the conflict was hoisted up by police officers on both sides.
"The tension is increasing more and more," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who has been part of ongoing trials since last year, declared that he will run for European Parliament elections next year.
"To run as a candidate in the European elections is the best way to condemn the regression of democratic values and the repression we have experienced from the Spanish state," he said.
Londonderry, Northern Ireland: Men Arrested for Crashing Car Into Houses
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 have been arrested after crashing into a house deliberately several times in Londonderry, Northern Ireland.
The event took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 7:30 p.m. local time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the car caused damage to the entrance gate and the building itself.
An armrest may have been used to shoot the car.
Menga shot gives Livingston 1-0 win over Rangers in Scottish football
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secures says
Excited Livingston surprises the Rangers and Steven Gerrard experiences his second win after 18 games coaching for the Ibrox club in Glasgow.
Dolly Menga's shot proved to make the difference while Gary Holt's side matched the Hibernian in second.
Gerrard's side has no away players in the Scottish Premiership league this season, and will play against the Hearts, who are eight points behind, next Sunday.
Before that, the Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the European League on Thursday.
Livingston has six consecutive wins, and head coach Holt has still not lost since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses chances against the away team
Holt's team would have led long before they scored, creating more problems for the Rangers with their direct play.
Scott Robinson broke through, but had little effort towards the goal, which caused Alan Lithgow to have to work hard after meeting with Craig Halkett's heading over the goal.
The home team was pleased to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could cause trouble for the away team.
And that's how the decisive goal was scored.
The Rangers agreed to a free kick and Livingston made an opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson went against Menge, who took a touch and scored from the middle of the penalty area.
Until then, the Rangers dominated the ball, but saw that the home defense was solid and keeper Liam Kelly was focused.
This pattern continues into the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to save a goal.
Scott Pittman tried to score, but was stopped by Rangers keeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgow tabbed wide after the ball was returned from Livingston.
Passes were sent back and forth in the Livingston penalty field, while two penalties—after Halkett's challenge to Glenn Middleton, and one by hand—were blown away.
'Fenomenal' from Livingston - analysis
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont and Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal match and a phenomenal result for Livingston.
Each player played fantastically and still impresses on the upward curve.
Their playing and playing style has barely changed since they returned to the top class, but much of the thanks go to Holt for the way he has shocked the team since he became a coach.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was intense, organizing a defense at the military level, while Menga distracted Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall throughout the match.
The Rangers, on the other hand, were not motivated.
As good as they have been under Gerrard, however, they were not good enough this time.
They didn't play well enough, only cutting up the home half once, which should make the Rangers realize they won't reach up anymore.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an to be welcomed in Cologne
The leaders of Turkey and Germany smiled under blue skies as they met to eat breakfast on Saturday, September 29, in Berlin.
It is the last day of Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - as it is hoped to repair relations between the two NATO countries.
Countries have been at odds in terms of human rights, press freedom and Turkey's role in the EU.
Erdogan went to Cologne to open a large, new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Police prevented a crowd of over 25,000 from gathering in front of the mosque for "security reasons," but many of Erdogan's supporters showed up to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan - many of the Kurds - also appeared to condemn Erdogan's policies and the German state's decision to welcome him into the country.
The dueling Protestants reflected the distinction between German Turks, who see Erdogan as a hero, and others, who see him as an autocrat.
Car Accident in Deptford, London: Cyclist Killed in Car Collision
A cyclist has lost his life in a collision with a car London.
The collision occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, southeast London, at 10:15 local time.
The driver stopped and ambulance personnel arrived quickly, but the man died at the scene.
The collision occurred just a few months after another cyclist died when the driver ran off in Childers Street, about 1.6 miles from today's accident.
London police reported that they are in the process of identifying the man and informing his family.
Roads have been closed and buses have to run around the area, while other drivers have been urged to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison in England: Six guards injured in riot
Six prison guards have been injured in a riot in a high-security men's prison, the prison office in England says.
The ongoing disorder erupted in the HMP Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire around 09:30 local time on Sunday.
Special "Tornado" forces have been recruited to calm the rebellion, involving eight prisoners in a secluded part of the prison.
The guards have been treated for minor facial injuries.
A prison spokesman said: "Specially trained guards are to calm down the ongoing uprising in the HMP Long Lartin.
Six guards have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and we are clear that those responsible will be reported to the police and may have to sit in jail longer."
It seats more than 500 people in HMP Long Lartin, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the UK.
In June, it was reported that the prison director was being treated for injuries, after a prisoner was attacked.
And in October last year, special forces had to come to the prison to calm down a serious riot, where prisoners threw billiards balls at the guards.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with flooding (for drought relief)
Tropical low pressures are rare in Arizona, but it is precisely such a weather phenomenon that is heading towards Arizona early next week, in that the remnants of Hurricane Rosa move southwest across the desert creating fear of flooding.
The National Weather Service has issued flood warnings on Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona and south and east Nevada, southeastern California, and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to move directly over Phoenix on Tuesday, and could rain as early as late Monday.
The Phoenix National Weather Service tweeted that "only ten tropical cyclones have had tropical storm or low pressure status within 300 km of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that reached 60 miles within the Arizona border."
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center report between 5 and 10 centimeters of rain, with isolated amounts up to 15 centimeters in the Mogollon Rim area of Arizona.
It can rain between 2 and 5 centimeters in other areas of the southwest desert, including central parts of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, with isolated totals up to 10 centimeters.
For areas outside flood risk, the rain from Rosa can be a blessing in the drought.
Although flooding is a serious concern, this rainfall is likely to benefit areas in the southwestern United States exposed to drought.
According to drought monitors in the United States, there is extreme drought in over 40 percent of Arizona, which is the second highest drought category, weather.com reports.
First, Hurricane Rosa will move across the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
With winds of over 135 kilometers per hour, Rosa on Sunday morning is 619 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving north at a speed of 19 kilometers per hour.
The storm meets cooler waters in the Pacific Ocean and calms down.
It is expected to reach the coast of Mexico with tropical storm force, Monday afternoon or evening.
There will be heavy rainfall in parts of Mexico, which may increase the risk of flooding.
"Rain between 7 and 15 centimeters is expected from Baja California to northwestern Sonora, with a possibility of up to 25 centimeters," weather.com reported.
Rosa will pull north along Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the border of Arizona early Tuesday morning as a tropical low pressure, which will pull further up through Arizona and into southern Utah on Tuesday evening.
"The biggest danger of Rosa or the remnants of this, is much rain in Baja California, northwest Sonora, and the American Southwest Desert," said the National Hurricane Center.
This rain is expected to create life-threatening floods in desert areas and landslides in mountain areas.
Attack in Midsomer Norton, England: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested, suspected of murder after a 16-year-old was found stabbed in Somerset, England.
The teenage boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton around 4:00 a.m. on Saturday.
He was transported to hospital, and his condition is stable.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested last night in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset police report.
Police have urged people who may have mobile recordings of what happened, to contact.
Trump says Kavanaugh "suffered" under how "bad and angry" Democrats were against him
"A voice for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice against the ruthless and unreasonable tactics of the Democrats," Trump said during a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh has "suffered" during how "bad and angry" Democrats were through the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, emotionally denying the accusation from Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually assaulted her decades ago, when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified about her allegations during the hearing.
The President said on Saturday that "the American people saw how brilliant and brave" Kavanaugh was on that day.
"A voice to Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to one of the most skilled lawyers of our time, a lawyer with flawless public service," he told a crowd of followers in West Virginia.
The president also referred to Kavanaugh's nomination when he talked about how important it is for Republicans to vote in the midterm elections in the United States.
"Five weeks to one of the most important choices in our lives.
I'm not asking, but I'm really asking," he said.
"That's why I travel around to fight for good candidates."
Trump argued that Democrats are looking to "resist and block."
The first important vote in the Senate on the nomination of Kavanaugh is expected to take place no later than Friday, a Republican representative told CNN.
Hundreds killed in earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, the number of killed increases
At least 384 people have been killed, many of them taken by huge waves on beaches, while a powerful earthquake and a tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities reported on Sunday.
Hundreds of people were gathered to participate in a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday when the waves, which were six meters high, struck the beach at sunset, taking many people while destroying everything they came across.
The tsunami came after an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5.
"When the warning of the tsunami came yesterday, there were still people on the beach who did not leave at once and so they became victims," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for the Indonesia BNPB crisis relief agency, in Jakarta.
"As if the tsunami were not enough in itself, he carried cars, wooden trunks, houses; he hit everything on land," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had travelled over the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before reaching the coast.
Some climbed trees to avoid the tsunami and survived in that way.
Around 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Photos from the air published by the emergency agency show many destroyed buildings and shops, distorted and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
Earthquakes continued to hit the coastal town on Saturday.
The earthquake could be marked in the surrounding area, which has a population of 2.4 million.
Indonesia's Agency for Testing and Testing Technology (BPPT) stated that the energy from the earthquake on Friday, was about 200 times stronger than the energy from the atomic bomb over Hiroshima during World War II.
The geography of the city, located at the end of a long, narrow wave, may have increased the size of the tsunami, the agency said.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels have collapsed.
The bodies of the dead have been found under the remains of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and that 29 are still missing.
Nugroho said the number of deaths and the size of the destructions could be greater along the coast 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicentre of the quake.
"We have not heard anything from Donggala, communication is cut," Nugroho said.
"More than 300,000 people live there," said the Red Cross, adding that their employees and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse," said the Red Cross.
The emergency agency was criticized on Saturday for not informing that a tsunami had hit Palu, although authorities said waves were coming within the timeframe that was warned.
An amateur video shared on social media shows a man on the top floor of a building crying desperately to people down the streets to warn them of the coming wave.
A few minutes later, a wall of water hits the coast, taking buildings and cars with it.
Reuters could not verify the video at first.
The earthquake and tsunami caused power outages and cut off communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate emergency aid.
The military has started the process of sending in cargo planes with emergency assistance from Jakarta and other cities, authorities report, but the refugees still need food and have other basic needs.
The city's airport was reopened to receive emergency aid, but will continue to be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll in Indonesia exceeds 800.
It's very bad.
The staff of World Vision from Donggala have arrived safely to Palu city, and have set up tents in the backyard of their office. On their way to the city, they passed totally destroyed areas, said Doseba.
"They told me they saw many destroyed houses," he said.
It's very bad.
As emergency aid organizations begin work to help those affected by the tsunami, some have complained that foreign emergency aid workers with expertise in crisis management have been denied entry to Palu.
According to Indonesian law, foreign aid organizations and their employees cannot start work until Indonesia has declared the area a national crisis zone.
It has not happened yet.
"It's a provincial-level crisis," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Red Cross in Indonesia.
"When the state says 'OK, this is a national crisis,' we can open up for international emergency aid, but they have not updated their status yet."
There is evening left in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, and friends and family of those still missing still hope for a miracle, but know that such natural disasters do not plague the end well.
On Saturday, a little boy was rescued from the sewer.
On Sunday, a woman was rescued from the remains of a collapsed building, where she had doctors trapped next to her dead mother for two days.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian paragliding team, coached two of the missing paragliders from the Asian Games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
A man named Monday said that some of those trapped in the Roa Roa hotel were his students.
"As a person with a lot of experience in paragliding, I have my own emotional burden to bear," he said.
Gendon said he was desperate to send WhatsApp messages to the paragliders from Palu, who had taken part in the local beach festival, after hearing that the Roa Roa hotel had collapsed.
However, his messages showed only one gray jaw, instead of two blue jaws.
"I think that means the messages didn't arrive," he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 from ATM in Newport, Levee, United States
On Friday, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's company worker in what he was filling up a ATM in Newport, Levee, United States, according to a press release from Newport police.
The worker had just emptied a ATM in the entertainment area and was about to deliver more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy stated in the press release.
While the worker was busy, "a man jumped up behind the worker" and stole a bag of money to be delivered.
Witnesses observed several suspects as they fled the scene, according to the press release, but police could not determine the number of people involved in the robbery.
If anyone has information about who was involved, they should call Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changes name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes name - to Ye.
He declared the name change on Twitter on Saturday, writing: "The creation formerly known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has had Ye as a nickname for a while, using the name as the title of his eighth album, which he released in June.
The name change came just before he was scheduled to perform on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande on the show after she cancelled due to "emotional reasons," the host said.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current artist name, West has previously stated that the word has a religious meaning for him.
"I think the word 'ye' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you,'" West said earlier this year when discussing the album title with radio host Big Boy.
"So I am you, I am us, it is us.
The name has changed from Kanye, meaning the only one, to just Ye - to reflect the good we do, the bad we do, our confusion, everything.
The album reflects who we are.”
Kanye is one of several famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs is formerly known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy, or Diddy, but this year he declared that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who has collaborated with West in the past, has also changed the spelling of the name with and without hyphens and capital letters.
Future president of Mexico vows not to send military against civilians
The future president of Mexico, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has promised never to send military forces against civilians. The country is soon to mark the 50th anniversary of the bloody treatment of students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he "will never use the military to oppress the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, the military shot at peaceful protesters and killed about 300 people, at a time when left-wing student movements were spreading in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by providing monthly support to students and opening more free universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of access to education have led young people to join criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double its investment in artificial intelligence
Since China is working more actively with artificial intelligence, the United States should double its investments in research on the subject, says the investor and user of artificial intelligence, Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
His comments came after various parts of the U.S. government expressed their views on artificial intelligence, although the United States lacks a formal strategy for the use of artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, China introduced its plan last year, aiming to be number 1 in artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
"A doubling of the research budget on artificial intelligence would be a good start, since all other countries are so far behind the United States, and we are looking for the next breakthrough in artificial intelligence," Lee said.
A doubling in funding could double the chances that the next major breakthrough in artificial intelligence will happen in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, who published the book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" this month via publisher Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the Managing Director (CEO) of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's largest artificial intelligence companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University with a system of artificial intelligence that beat the highest ranked player of the game Othello, and later worked as a leader in Microsoft Research and was president of Google in China.
Lee recognized past technology competitions organized by the U.S. state, such as "Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge" and asked what time the next competition should be, so that he would be with and identify the next visionaries.
Researchers in the United States usually have to work hard to get support from the state, Lee said.
"It's not China that takes the academic leaders, it's the big companies," Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired excellent university students to work with artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy can also help the United States strengthen research on artificial intelligence.
"I think doctoral students in artificial intelligence should be granted automatic residence permits," he said.
The Chinese government announced its plan for the next generation of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
China's National Science Federation funds students at academic institutions, not unlike the U.S. National Science Federation and other state organizations' way of distributing money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, which is intended to involve partners from industry and academia, and the White House declared the formation of a Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI (Artificial Intelligence) Next.
The National Science Federation invests more than $100 million a year in research on artificial intelligence.
At the same time, no one has been working on national security and artificial intelligence bills for several months.
Macedonian donors vote in referendum to change the name of the country
The Macedonian people voted on Sunday in a referendum on whether they should change the name of the Republic of North Macedonia to resolve a decades-old conflict with Greece, which has tried to prevent Macedonia from joining the EU and NATO.
Greece, which has a province named Macedonia, insists that the name of the neighboring country in the north represents a claim to their territory, and has vetoed voting against Macedonia's membership in NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the new proposed name, but nationalist opponents argue that the name change could undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority of the population of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he should not vote in the referendum, and a boycott has sown doubts as to how far the referendum will reach the at least 50 percent of the population it needs to be valid.
The question on the referendum seat is: "Are you for NATO and EU membership and agree on the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the price of the name change is worthy of membership in the EU and NATO. Macedonia is one of the countries that achieved independence after the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I am here today to vote for the future of this country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the EU, because it means a safer life for us all," said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the vote is not binding under the law, a sufficient number of Members of Parliament have said they will follow the result of the vote to make her decisive.
In order for the name change to take place, Parliament needs two-thirds resolution.
The State Election Committee reported that nothing unusual had happened by 13:00.
Only 16 percent had voted, as opposed to 34 percent in the previous parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 of all registered voters voted.
"I vote for my children, we belong in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, an elector in the capital, Skopje.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted in Strumika in the Macedonian referendum for whether to change their name and open to join NATO and the EU on September 30, 2018.
Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, organized a boycott of the referendum in front of the parliament in Skopje, by setting up tents and chairs.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we are not for changing the name of our country," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want us under the name Macedonia, we can go to others, like China and Russia, and become part of Eurasian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev has stated that NATO membership will draw investors to Macedonia, which has over 20 percent unemployment.
"I think the majority will vote for the change, of which 80 percent of our citizens will become members of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after voting.
He said that a "yes" result can be interpreted as a "confirmation of our future."
A poll last Monday by Macedonia's Institute of Policy Research showed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters are going to take part in the referendum – which is below the required number.
Another poll by the Telma TV channel in Macedonia, showed that 57 percent of voters plan to vote on Sunday.
Of these, the channel said that 70 percent would vote yes.
In order for the referendum to be closed, at least 50 percent must vote, plus one vote.
If the referendum is not closed, it could harm the policies of the left-wing government that took over in May.
See: Manchester City player Sergio Aguero navigates through Brighton defense and scores
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling wrecked the Brighton defense leading to a 2-0 win for Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy, scoring in the 65th minute.
The Argentine leader received a pass on the midfield at the beginning of the sequence.
He crashed past three Brighton defenders and reached open court.
Suddenly, Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He recovered around one defender, before running past several others on the edge of the Brighton penalty area.
He got past a pass on the left and found Sterling.
The English leader used his first kick in the field to give the ball back to Aguero, who used his right foot to beat Brighton keeper Mathew Ryan with a shot straight into the right end of the goal.
"Aguero is still struggling with his feet," City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about he could play 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored when he did."
But it was Sterling who gave them the sky blue the first advantage in the Premier League match.
That goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball deep inside the Brighton Territory.
He kicked the ball beautifully along the left end of the lane to Leroy Sane.
Sane held the ball as he led Sterling towards the goal.
The sky blue tip kicked the ball into the goal just before sliding out of the track.
City will play against Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage at 12:55 on Tuesday in the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play spoilers against the Rockies in baseball
With the Nationals eliminated from "playoff contention", there was not much reason to force a new start.
Scherzer has a high competitive instinct, hoping to take the "mound" on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if it can lead to a "playoff" for the Rockies, who lead with one game over the Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West.
Rockies won at least 5-2 against Nationals on Friday night, but look forward to locking down the first division title.
"Although we're not playing for anything, it's worth playing because of the atmosphere here in Denver, with the audience and the second team most likely playing at the highest level so far this year.
Who wouldn't want to play with such conditions?"
It is still unclear who will start in the Nationals on Sunday, but it may be Scherzer to "pitche".
Scherzer, who in that case starts for the 34th time, will throw a "bullpen session" on Thursday and will "pitche" normally on Sunday.
Scherzer, coming from Washington, is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 "innings" this season.
Trump Gathers Voters in West Virginia
The president obscurely referred to his first election to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while talking about how important it was for Republicans to vote in the midterm elections in the United States.
“Everything we’ve done so far is at stake in November.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important choices in our lives.
This is one of the big, big -- I don't run, but I run around everywhere to fight for the best candidates," he said.
Trump continued, "You can see this terrible, terrible group of Democrats, you see it happening right now.
And they are convinced that they will definitely take back power, you see how ugly they are, how ugly they are.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over to take power and control, that's what they want, power and control, we're not going to give it to them."
Democrats, he said, are on a mission to "oppose and block."
"And you can see it based on the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "sinful and mean and ugly and dishonest."
He referred to Senator and Democrat Dianne Feinstein, who made his audience bow.
"Do you remember her answer?
Was it you who leaked documents?
Hey, hey, what?
No, eh no, I expect—it was really bad body language—the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer tolerant.
They are intolerant of those who say what they mean
When the Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, it was not surprising.
After all, I'm the last in a number of Labour MPs who have been told that I'm not welcome - just to say what I mean.
My colleague in parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated the same way because she protested anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
In terms of how important it is to run responsible economy, national security, Europe, and other similar themes on which Jeremy ironically disagreed with previous leaders.
In the call for the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday, it said "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
In my last eight years as Labour MP, Friday's meeting has been just like this.
Unfortunately, today's meeting was not so, and the promise of "snaller" politics has long been forgotten, if at all it was followed.
It has become more and more evident that different views are not tolerated in Labour, and that each opinion is judged by the leaders of the party.
This happened shortly after Jeremy became party leader, when colleagues I used to agree politically with suddenly expecting me to change my mind and agree on things I would never agree on - whether it was then national security or the EU's internal market.
When I speak in public it doesn't matter what I say, I'm always being silenced on social media and people want me to step down while they criticize center politics and say I shouldn't be a member of the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
I know I'm luckier than some of my colleagues, because the comments against me are at least political.
I admire my colleagues who get the gender-discriminatory and racist bullying directed at them every day, and who are still professional and don't quit.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this period of time, is how normalized it has become to harass police officers.
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour Party should become more tolerant.
In fact, we are no longer a tolerant party that has something for everyone. With each motion of no confidence and with each change in the rules of the party, the party becomes narrower and narrower.
I've received a lot of advice in the last two years from people who have said I need to take it easy and not be so loud, so maybe people will "like me better."
But that's not why I chose to join politics.
When I joined Labour, when I was still in school 32 years ago, it was because I was angry at Thatcher and how the government failed the country. My classroom was about to collapse, so I wanted better public services for those who need them most - whether it was as a municipal councilor or minister of government.
I have never hid my political opinions, even in the previous election.
No one in Nottingham East may have been in doubt about what I stand for and who of the current leaders I disagree with.
To those who voted for the proposal on Friday, I can only say that when the country crashes into a Brexit that will hurt private, local businesses and public services, I don't understand why people care about wasting energy on questioning my loyalty to the Labour Party leader.
But in fact, then the only message I have addressed to the Nottingham Momentum, but to the voters in the polls, whether they are Labour voters or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no one can make me step down or change my policy and prevent me from serving you in the way I think is best for all of you.

Ayr 38–17 Melrose: Invincible Ayr goes to the top in Scottish rugby
Two late "tries" may have changed the result a bit, but there is no doubt that Ayr pretended to win in this very entertaining Tennent's Premiership match today.
They are now at the top of the podium as the only invincible team out of a total of ten.
It was their sovereign defense and ability to take chances that gave their home team and coach, Peter Murchie, good reason to be happy.
"We've been put to the test in the last few games, and we're still invincible, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, "Ayr deserves praise, they were better than us at taking chances."
Grant Anderson had a "try" in the 14th minute, where Frazier Climo tried a "conversion," which put Ayr in front, but a yellow card from Scotland captain Rory Hughes of the Warriors let Melrose collect, and Jason Baggot took an "unconverted try."
Climo got a penalty just before the break, he scored and "converted" a "solo try" to give Ayr 17-5 before the break.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's "try," which became "converted" by Baggot, reduced the slingshot by five points.
There was a long pause when Ruaridh Knott became seriously injured and put on a stretcher, and from the restart, Ayr got forward through a "try" from Stafford McDowall, which Climo "converted."
The acting captain of Ayr, Blair MacPherson, received a yellow card, and again Melrose attempted an "unconverted Bruce Colvine try," at the end of a series of aggressive games.
The home team played back, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card to deal with Climo without the ball from the penalty line-up, MacPherson scored a "try."
Climo "converted" again after Kyle Rowe took David Armstrong's "box kick" and sent "flanker" Gregor Henry away from the home team's fifth "try."
The star of the Scottish series, Still Game, starts a new career in the restaurant industry
The Scottish Still Game star, Ford Kieran, seems ready for a new career in the restaurant industry, after it was discovered that he is the director of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC program, which he writes and plays alongside partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo have announced that the upcoming ninth season is going to be the last, and it seems Kiernan is planning life after Craiglang.
According to official lists, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor will not comment on the case, but a source from the Scottish Sun newspaper has hinted that Kiernan would be involved in the "successful restaurant industry" in Glasgow.
"The sea is ours": Bolivia hopes court will open waterway to the Pacific
Sailors patrol naval headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings flags with sea blue flags.
Marine bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are covered with the motto: "The sea is ours. We are right
and duty to return to it.”
In landlocked Bolivia, the people can still remember a coastline lost to Chile, in a bloody conflict over resources in the 19th century. They long to sail in the Pacific again.
These hopes may be stronger than in many decades while Bolivia awaits the judgment of the International Court of Justice due on October 1, after five years of deliberation.
"Bolivia has drive, peace of mind and is united, and of course expects a positive result," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will look at the verdict of the International Court of Justice, in hopes that the Hague Court will support Bolivia's claim, and that Chile - after decades of negotiations - will give Bolivia an independent exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic native president of Bolivia - who is struggling to be re-elected next year - has good reason to hope for a positive result.
"Now we will soon be returning to the Pacific," he promised in late August.
However, some analysts do not believe the court will allow Bolivia to access the sea - and that little would have changed even if they were allowed access.
The Netherlands-based UN court has no power to transfer Chilean territory to Bolivia, and has stipulated that they will not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
That the court's verdict comes just six months after the last negotiations, indicates that the case "was not complicated," said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
The last four years have far from promoted Bolivia's cause, they have done the opposite.
"The issue of access to the sea has been taken over by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
Morales, with his belligerent rhetoric, has killed what was left of Chile's goodwill, Zárate said.
Bolivia and Chile will continue negotiations at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to discuss the issue after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
The former president, Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, who is Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was unusually swift.
On Monday, Bolivia will have "an extraordinary opportunity to open new relations with Chile" and a chance to "set a bar at 139 years of disagreement and rather benefit both," he said.
Calzadilla also rejected that Morales, who is still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America, used this maritime issue to win votes.
"Bolivia will never give up the right of access to the Pacific," he added.
"Judgment is an opportunity to see what we need to do to forget the past."
North Korea says they won't abolish nuclear weapons if they can't trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister, Ri Yong Ho, says his nation cannot be the first to abolish, if they cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to follow up on the lift they gave during the meeting in Singapore between the U.S. and North Korean leaders.
Ri's comments come at a time when U.S. Secretary of State, Mike Pomepo, seems to want to restart his locked nuclear diplomacy, more than three months after the Singapore meeting with North Korean leader, Kim Jong Un.
Ri says the United States has a false hope that North Korea will submit if the United States continues to impose sanctions and opposes any declaration of the end of the Korean War.
Washington refuses to agree to any declaration of the end of the war, without Pyongyang abolishing it first.
Both Kim and U.S. President, Donald Trump, will hold a new meeting.
But many are critical of Pyongyang's seriousness with regard to demolition and that the country most likely sees its weapons as a guarantee of security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump meeting.
Paris shows that massive headwear is the latest fashion on the way to a shopping street near you
If you want to upgrade your hat collection or block the sun completely, then you don't need to search anymore.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne have revealed a number of large and special headwear in their SS19 collection. The headwear stunned the audience during the fashion week in Paris.
Most impractical hats can be seen on Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their shocking creations right on the catwalk.
The most magnificent garment was a sumptuous, beige Valentino hat with a feather-like, at the brake covering the models' heads.
There were also other oversized belongings during the fashion show, including a jeweled watermelon, a wizard's hat, and even a pineapple - but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a collection of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had lips sewn together and resembled Hannibal Lecter more than haute couture.
One of the creations resembled diving gear, complete with snorkel and mask, while another looked like a melted ice in biscuits.
If you like this enormously dramatic fashion, you can just enjoy it.
Fashion experts predict that the huge hats will come for sale in a shopping street near you.
The oversized hats come right after "La Bomba", the straw hat with the 60 centimeter wide brake that has been seen on celebrities from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind the highly impractical hat, which was everywhere on social media, has now sent out a new creation on the catwalk - a straw beach bag of the same size as the bikini-dressed model who wore it.
The beach bag, with the color of burnt orange and fringes topped with a white leather handle, was the most eye-catching part of Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection during the Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage commented to FEMAIL: "I expect to see big hats and beach bags in the fashion stores next summer - the designer has made such a big impression that I doubt it is possible to ignore the demand for oversized accessories."
John Edward: Global citizens need language skills
Private schools in Scotland are known to be at a high academic level, and this continued in 2018 with excellent exam results, which are only reinforced by individual and joint success in sports, arts, music, and other community activities.
With over 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council for Independent Schools (SCIS), work to offer the best services to the students and their parents.
Self-employed schools aim to prepare their students for advanced and higher education, career paths, and the role of global citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement a tailor-made curriculum, we see that modern languages are popular electives in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, the message goes to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, the message goes to his heart."
This is an important reminder that we can't just lean on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
By looking at the exam results from this year, we can see that languages are at the top of the league tables with the highest scores for independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who took foreign languages received A.
The data, collected from SCIS' 74 member schools, shows that 72 percent of students received A in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who took German, 69 percent of those who took French, and 63 percent of those who took Spanish also received A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital attributes, which children and young people will absolutely need in the future.
Languages as electives are seen as equivalent to STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering studies, and mathematics) in the curriculum of independent schools and elsewhere.
A survey conducted by the UK Employment and Properties Committee in 2014 found that 17 percent of employers struggled to fill positions due to lack of language skills in the applicants.
Therefore, language at school is more and more important in preparing young people for work.
With more job opportunities for linguists, these characteristics are essential in a globalized world.
No matter what kind of career a youth chooses, if they have learned a second language, they have a decent advantage in the future with such a trait.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically give a multilingual person advantages in a competitive world.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adult Britons in 2013, 75 percent could not speak any language other than English well enough to keep a conversation going, and French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage, 15 percent.
This is why it is so important to invest in language education for our children.
Knowing more languages, especially the languages used in developing countries, can give children a better chance of finding good jobs in the future.
In Scotland, each school is different in terms of what languages they teach.
Many schools focus on the classic modern languages, while others teach languages that are classified as important in the UK when we look forward to 2020, such as Mandarin and Japanese.
No matter what your child is interested in, there will always be a lot of languages to choose from in independent schools, and teachers who are specialists in this area.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated and want to create a learning environment that will prepare children and provide the attributes they need to close, no matter what the future brings.
It cannot be denied that in this global, business-oriented environment, languages are vital to the future of the country, so this must be reflected in the education sector.
Modern languages should be called "international communication properties."
Self-employed schools will continue to offer this choice, thus offering diversity and high competence for Scotland's youth.
We have to do it.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Council for Independent Schools
LeBron debuts in the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The wait is soon over for fans who are eager to see LeBron James debut at the Los Angeles Lakers basketball team.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the pre-season game on Sunday, against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But how long he will play has not been decided yet.
"It's going to be more than one minute and less than 49," Walton announced on the Lakers' official website.
The Lakers reporter, Mike Trudell, doubts that James will most likely play for a limited time.
After training this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' schedule for the pre-season.
"I don't need pre-season games at this stage of my career to get ready," he said.
Trumps West Virginia Rally Time, YouTube
President Donald Trump begins a whirlwind of campaigns tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of Trump's five scheduled stops next week, including stops at friendly locations such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With confirmation votes pending to choose to fill the vacant Supreme Court position, Trump aims to build support for upcoming midterm elections as Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress when votes are given in November.
What time will Trump be in West Virginia tonight, and how can you watch it online?
Trump's meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 19:00. tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's West Virginia collection online below, via live stream on YouTube.
Trump will likely record this week's hearings of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who was excited over allegations of sexual abuse, with an expected affirmative vote from the Senate on hold for up to a week while the FBI investigates.
But the primary goal of this cave of gatherings is to help the Republicans meet the November elections and get some momentum (drive).
Thus, President Trump's campaign says these five meetings next week are aimed at "encouraging volunteers and supporters whom Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"Control by Congress is so critical of his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we enter the busy campaign season," said a Trump campaign spokesman who refused to be informed to Reuters.
Scheduled for the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, the evening's collection may bring supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and draw coverage from Pittsburgh media", according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is in demand in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president must come and try to give him a boost in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows stomach for fight to keep hope alive on the singles on Sunday
After three one-sided sessions, Saturday afternoon's foursomes could only be what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging pendulum of moment is a completely invented sporting feat, but one that players really believe in, and never more than in competitions like these.
So where should they say that moment is now?
"They had a six-point lead, and now it's four, so we're taking it as a small moment , I guess," Jordan Spieth said as he walked off for the day.
Europe has the advantage, of course, four points ahead with twelve more in play.
The Americans, as Spieth says, know they have a little wind in their sails, and they have a lot to encourage from, not least the shape of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day, and each has three points out of four.
Spieth has been deadly from tee to green and leases by example.
The boytural screams of the celebration became louder as his round continued, seeking an important putt to take match four all-squao.re as he and Thomas had been down two by two.
His putt who won them the match at 15, was met with a similar scream, the kind that tells you that he thinks the American team is not out of this.
"You've actually only gotten to dig deep and worry about your own fight," Spieh said.
That's all each of these players have left now.
18 holes to make a mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the invincible story of the Ryder Cup.
Europe's strange but cute couples are four out of four and can do nothing wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple not to shoot a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back nine (the last nine holes on an 18-hole course) on Friday morning.
That race, and the way their energy seems to flow both to and from this noisy, engaged audience, cements that they are the players to be beaten on Sunday, and there would be no more popular players to seal a potential European say when the sun sets over Le Golf National, than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both at the same time in different holes.
Talk of European honor becoming even premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson did brief work by Sergio Garcia, the morning's four-ball hero, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles in the first nine, the Spaniard and the Swede rushed into a hole they never came close to climbing out of.
But on Sunday, no one can help you out of your hole.
The fourballs and foursomes are so fascinating to look at closely because of the interaction between opponents, advice they give, and advice they don't give and the way that a strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team so far and takes a significant lead in the last day, but this foursome session also showed that Team USA has the belly of the match that anyone, especially Stateside, had doubted.
Europe takes 10-6 lead in Ryder Cup final
Europe will have a healthy advantage into the last day of the Ryder Cup after coming out of Saturday's four-ball and foursome matches with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
Inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the charge with two wins over a struggling Tiger Woods to take their game so far at Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European side bid to retain the trophy they lost on Hazeltine two years ago, dominating a flawed American side in the morning fourballs, taking the series 3–1.
The United States offered more resistance in the foursomes and won two games, but they could not bring in the deficit.
Jim Furyk's side needs eight points from the 12 singles matches on Sunday to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row while he and Molinari, called "Molliwood" after a stunning weekend, are only the second pair to win four points from their opening in four games in Ryder Cup history.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in fourballs, they turned out so great to beat an outcast Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with an even more coveted 5 and 4.
Woods, who struggled through two games on Saturday, showed sporadic brilliance, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 games in fourballs and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who rested for the morning fourballs, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes to a 2 and 1 defeat by Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - ranked one and three in the world.
Europe did not yet get everything they wanted on a pleasant, blown day southwest of Paris.
Three times big winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas put the reference to the Americans by two points on Saturday.
They won a brave 2 & 1 say over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourballs and came back later to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4 & 3 in the foursomes as they had lost the two holes in the opening.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history, a team has returned from a four-point base and entered singles, although as holders, Furyk's side only needs to draw to retain the trophy.
However, having been the second best for two days, it looks like a Sunday counterattack will be outside them.
North Korea says there is no talk of rushing down unilaterally without confidence
North Korea's Foreign Minister told the United Nations Saturday that if sanctions continue, the distrust of the United States will increase and that the country would in no way give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Government's Annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "significant measures" to improve conditions in the past year, for example, they have stopped nuclear and missile tests, dismantled the nuclear test site and promise not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we will not get anything equivalent back from the United States," he said.
"Without confidence in the United States there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances it is not possible for us to unilaterally disarm ourselves first."
While Ri, a well-known North Korean, has made several complaints about Washington's opposition to a "phased" approach to the abolition of nuclear weapons, in which North Korea would be rewarded for taking gradual steps, his statement proved significant in not rejecting unilateral nuclear demolition, such as Pyong has done.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at a first summit ever between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim vowed to work for "downsizing nuclear power on the Korean peninsula" while Trump vowed guarantees for North Korea's security.
North Korea has wanted a formal end to the 1950–53 Korean War, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted talks to ease tough international sanctions in North Korea.
"The United States insists on 'downgrading nuclear power first' and increases the pressure with sanctions to achieve its purpose of coercion, and they even opposed the 'declaration of ceasing peace'," Ri said.
"The belief that sanctions can break us is a false hope among those who are not interested in us.
But the problem is that when the sanctions continue, our mistrust only increases."
Ri did not mention anything about the plans for a new summit between Kim and Trump, which the US president highlighted at the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the minister stressed three meetings between Kim and South Korea's leader, Moon Jae-in, over the past five months and added: "If the party in this call for the downgrading of nuclear weapons were South Korea, and not the United States, the downgrading on the Korean peninsula would not have stopped as it has now done"
Nonetheless, the tone of Ri's speech was dramatically different from last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that it was not possible to stop North Korean missiles towards the U.S. mainland, after evil President Trump called Kim a missile man on suicide mission.
Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage to take steps to disarm, but said a lot of work still needed to be done and that sanctions needed to remain in place until North Korea dismantled its nuclear weapon.
On Wednesday, Trump said he did not have a time frame for this, saying, "If it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia claim that the UN Security Council should pay Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that: "The sanctions of the Security Council must still be maintained vigorously and without fail until we get the complete, final, verified dismantling of the nuclear weapons."
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to throttle Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and subsequently said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a new summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times already this year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said progress had been made, but a few hours later North Korea condemned him for making "gangster-like demands."
North Korea promised in a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle a missile site and also a nuclear complex if the United States took "equivalent action."
He said Kim had told him that the "equivalent measures" he sought were security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore, and steps toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard Students Take Courses in Getting Enough Rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has helped all students get more sleep, in an attempt to fight the growing macho culture of studying in caffeine rush all night long. That is, one uses caffeine to stay awake all night to study.
One academic found that students at top universities often recklessly when it comes to the most basic - how to take care of yourself.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, developed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after talking about the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
"At the end of it, a girl came up to me and said, 'Why am I being told this now, in adulthood?'
She said no one had ever told her about the importance of sleeping - something that surprised me, he told The Telegraph.
The course, rolled out for the first time this year, explains to students what is important for how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, as well as improving their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and managing director of the university's health services, said that the university decided to introduce the course after students got seriously poorer sleep during the week.
The hour-long course involves a number of interactive tasks.
In one section there is a picture of a dormitory, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, trainers, and books to be told about the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is affected by lack of sleep, as well as how important it is with evening routines.
In another section, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A campus map, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
'We know it won't change the behavior of students right away.
But we believe they have the right to know - just as you have the right to know, the health effects of choosing to smoke cigarettes, added Prof. Czeisler.
The culture of pride over daytime still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and ever-increasing pressure on students means sleep deprivation is a growing problem.
Ensuring that you get enough sleep, of good quality, should be the student's secret weapon against stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said - even avoiding gaining weight, since lack of sleep puts the brain in starvation mode and makes them constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old from California studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler develop the course, having been a student with him the previous year, his first year at Harvard.
He said the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to push for a course for the entire campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all doctoral students to complete a similar study program before starting at the prestigious institution.
Prof Czeisler recommended that students should consider setting an alarm for when to go to bed, and also for when to wake up, and be aware of the damaging effects of "blue light" coming from electronic monitors and LED lighting, and which can reset the internal clock overall, leading to problems with falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga goals give Gerrards men down
The Rangers went on a new defeat on the away side when Dolly Menga's post sent Steven Gerrard's undefeated side to a 1–0 loss at Livingston.
The Ibrox side was looking to take their first win on the away side since the 4–1 triumph at St Johnstone in February, but the team of Gary Holt caused only Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as leader, giving eight points, a round under Ladbrokes leader of the Premier League , Hearts.
Menga hit to seven minutes before halftime, and a Ranger line-up with lack of inspiration never seemed to make up for it.
As the Rangers now fall to sixth place, Livingston climbs to third and is only behind Hibernian on goal difference.
And there may be additional problems in stock for the Rangers after lineman Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury, after an object was apparently thrown from the outside.
Gerrard made eight changes on the team that swept Ayr into the Betfred Cup semifinals.
Holt , on the other hand, went with Livy 11 who took a point with a dream shot last week, and he would have been thrilled at the way his well drilled outfit took the choke on his opponents on each shift.
The Rangers may have had the ball most , but Livingston did more with the ball they had.
They should have scored after only two minutes when Menga's first post sent Scott Pittman over to Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder failed in his giant chance.
A long free kick from Keaghan Jacobs then found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner, Alan Lithgow, could only shoot far on the return post.
The Rangers took control, but there seemed to be more hope than belief in their game in the final third round.
Alfredo Morellos determined that he should have had a penalty at the 20-metre mark when he and Steven Lawless collided, but Judge Steven Thomson waved away the Colombian's wish.
Rangers managed only two shots on goal in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was hardly worried by Lassana Coulibaly's header and a tame shot from Ovie Ejaria.
While Livi's opening in the 34th minute may have been against the rules of the game, no one can deny that they felt it just because of the "shot".
Again, the Rangers fail to handle a deep dead ball from the Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher hit the ball to Scott Robinson, who stayed cool to pick out Menge for a simple finish.
Gerrard left in the break as if he was swapping Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and the swap caused an immediate effect when the winger made a hatch for Morelos, but the impressive Kelly raced out to block.
But Livingstone continues to list the guest team to play exactly the game they liked, with Lithgow and Halkett sending out longshots on longshots.
Holt's team could have increased their lead at the end, but McGregor succeeded well in preventing Jacobs from it, until Lithgrow left a long post from the corner mark.
Ranger's reserve, Glenn Middleton, had a new claim to punishment when he supported along with Jacobs, but again Thomson overlooked it.
Almanach: The Inventor of the Geiger Counter
And now a page from our "Sunday Morning" Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and WE RECOGNIZE ... the day when he who was to become the physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the apparatus known as the Geiger counter.
As a scientific carrier ever since, the Geiger counter also became a carrier in pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", with the seemingly unlikely lazy cowboy researchers Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, it can be used to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put these earphones on, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms that come from the radioactivity of the minerals."
Evans: "Yes, now it populates!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name, lives on.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" red cells.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" red cells and kill them
Vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize red cells, as part of treatment

A trial vaccine shows promising results in patients with a variety of cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize red cells, experienced that ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, altering them in the laboratory, so that they can "see" a protein common to many cancers, called HER2, and then reinjecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said, "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "drives the growth of several types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancers, Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach to extracting immune cells from patients and "learning" them how they target cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West ordered a Pro-Trump diatribe, wearing a MAGA hat, after attending the Saturday Night Live TV show. .
It didn't go so well.
Kanye West was picked up in the studio during Saturday Night Live after an incredible performance in which he praised United States President, Donald Trump, and said he would run for election in 2020.
After taking his third song for the evening, called Ghost Town, in which he wore a Make America Great-caps, he gave the Democrats a tirade and repeated his support for Trump.
"So many times I talk to a white person, and they say, 'How could you like Trump, he's racist?'
Well, if I was concerned about racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago, he said.
The SNL started the show with a number along with comedian Matt Damon, where the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony in the Senate Judiciary Committee on the allegations of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not broadcast, the recording of West's tirade was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is unclear if Rock tried to mock West with the post.
Vest had also complained to the public that he had the difficult backstage due to his headgear.
"They bullied me behind the scenes.
They said, "Don't go out there with that hat on."
They bullied me!
And then they say I'm in a sinking place," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see the sunken space?" he says that he would "put on the superman cap, because this means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try to love."
His comments led to peeping out of the audience at least twice, and SNL cast members seemed embarrassingly affected, Variety reported, with one person there telling the publication: "The whole studio was put to death."
West was brought in as a late replacement for singer Ariana Grande, when her former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days ago.
West confused many with a performance of the song I Love it, dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West received support from the head of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner who tweeted: "To one of the most courageous spirits: THANK YOU FOR standing up against the crowd."
But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West "simply was just as he is and it's absolutely amazing."
"But I did NOT choose to pay anyone (by buying his music or dressing or supporting his 'art') who I believe embraces and spits out ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
We are too," she added.
Prior to the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and said he was now "formally known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy, and P Diddy.
Snoop Dogg has been named Snoop Lion and, of course, the last musical legend Prince, changing the name to a symbol and then the artist who was formerly known as Prince.

Game of Thrones star Kit Harington faces toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his sword-swinging role as Jon Snow in HBO's powerful medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the actor, 31, has gone out against the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that such roles on the screen often cause young boys to feel that they have to be tough to be respected.
In conversation with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believes something has gone wrong and asked how to tackle the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo age.
Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he knows "quite strongly" to address the problem.
"Personally, I am convinced that something has gone wrong with masculinity." he said.
"What have we taught men when they grow up, when it comes to the problem we see now?"
Kit believes that TV is partially responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to very male characters.
He continues: 'What is congenital and what is being taught?
What is taught on TV and in the streets, what makes young boys feel like they have to be this particular side of being a man?
I think it's really one of the big questions of our time - how do we change it?
For it is clear that something has gone wrong for young men.'
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not make Game of Thrones predecessors or sequels when the series ends this summer, saying he is "finished with battlefields and horses".
From November, Kit will play in a re-recording of Sam Shepard's True West, which is the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he is watching the meeting with his wife Rose to be the best that came out of Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife in this show, so that way it gave me my future family and my life further," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the nominee for Kit's character Jon Snow, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family property in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, health officials say.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new cases were transmitted through sex, marking a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly through some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who contracted HIV in this way was reduced to almost zero, Chinese health professionals said at a conference in Yunnan Province.
However, from year to year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people.
HIV transmission through sex is an acute problem in China’s LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT/HBTQ people is claimed to be widespread.
Due to the conservative values of the country, studies have quantified that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of the diseases come from inadequate sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medication as part of an attempt to tackle the problem.
Maxine Waters denies adding lacquer information from GOP senator, it explodes into 'dangerous lies' and 'conspiracy theories'.
U.S. Rep. Maxine Waers condemned on Saturday allegations that a member of her staff had posted personal information about three Republican U.S. senators on the Wikipedia pages of the legislators.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that the allegations were pedaled by "extreme-right" investigations and websites.
"Lies, lies and more despicable lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The released information included informative home addresses and telephone numbers of Americans Sens. Lindsey Graham, South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared on Thursday, was sent by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate panel hearing on the allegations of sexual assault against Supreme Court elector Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came sometime after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was associated with Waters' office and released the information to a member of Waters' staff, Hill reported.
"This unfounded claim is completely false and an absolute lie," Waters continues.
"One of my employees - whose identity, personal information and security has been compromised as a result of these untrue and false allegations - was in no way responsible for the leak of this information.
This baseless claim is completely false and an absolute lie."
Water's testimony quickly received online criticism, including from former White House press secretary, Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is angry," wrote Fleischer.
"This suggests she has no temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn't do, they shouldn't be angry.
They must not be tough.
They must not question the motive of the debtor.
They must be calm and peaceful."
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters' reaction to the criticism of the Democrats by Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of appearing too angry during the hearing on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate trying to take over Water's place in the midterm elections, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"Great if that's true," he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said her office had warned "the right government and law enforcement entities of these false allegations.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed," she continues, "and that they will be held legally responsible for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to each of my associates."
Johnny English strikes again - spy duty by weak Rowan Atkinson
It is traditional to look for Brexit curiosities in any new film with a British angle, and it seems applicable to this revival of Johnny England's action comedy spoof franchise - which started back in 2003 with Johnny English and which was revived in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will self-vironic satire that deals with how openly nasty we are, become the new export possibility in the country?
In any case, the big-eyed, incompetent Johnny English with the rubber face has for the second time renewed his permission to fuck things up - his name signals more than anything else that he is a broad comic maker for kinovits in non-English-speaking countries.
Of course, he is the silly, secret agent who despite his bizarre desires to spread some glamour has received a small piece of Clouseau, a dash of Mr Bean and a portion of that guy contributing a simple melody to The Fire Trucks, theme during the 2012 London Olympic Opening Ceremony.
He is also originally based on the traveling and international mystery man Atkinson once played in the now-forgotten Barclaycard TV ads, leaving chaos in the aftermath.
There are one or two nice moments in this last JE excursion.
I loved Johnny English approaching a helicopter while dressed in a medieval armor suit while the rotor blades hit his helmet.
Atkinson's gift to physical comedy is on the screen, but the humor feels quite weak and strangely redundant, especially since "serious" movie brands like 007 and Mission Impossible even now safely offer comedy as an ingredient.
The humor feels like it's aimed at children instead of adults, and for me, Johnny England's noisy accident is not as inventive and focused as Atkinson's replica claus in the person of Bean.
The permanent current assumption now is that the United Kingdom is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated Britain's super-secret web network of spies, uncovering the identities of all agents Britain has on the field, to the horror of the agent at work - a unfortunately small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last straw for a prime minister who is a pompous and warlike figure, who already has a complete collapse of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing her very best with this quasi-Theresa-May character, but there is not so much in the script to work with.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that when every single active spy has been charged, she must bring in someone who is retired.
And that means the incompetent Johnny English himself, who works as a teacher at a somewhat elegant establishment , but gives unofficial lessons on how to work undercover: a couple of fine jokes here, since English offers a School of Rock-type academy for espionage.
English is sent back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunited with his former understanding assistant Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, moved on to a submarine driver job, an overenthusiastic role where Vicki Pepperdine is a little wasted.
So Batman and Robin's ability to make things go terribly wrong in Her Majesty's Secret Services is back for full in the meeting with Olga Kurylenko's beautiful femme fatale, Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister dangerously falls under the charismatic technology's enchantment of the billionaire, claiming he can solve Britain's computer problems: the creepy Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their journey of farce-like wild games: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a fine French restaurant; they create chaos and smuggle themselves aboard Volta's pleasure boat; and English triggers pure anarchy as he tries to use a Virtual Reality headset to get acquainted with the inside of the house.
All the stops are certainly pulled out to the last sequence, but as lovable and undisciplined as it is, there is quite a lot of children's TV all over it.
Pretty moderate things.
And as with the other Johnny English films, I couldn't help but think: Can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really does justice to his talents?
Labour denies that they continue to draft a plan for the English to work a four-day week but be paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour party is now considering a radical plan that wants the British to work a four-day week - but gets paid for five.
According to the report, the party wants corporate executives to pass on savings made through the Artificial Intelligence (AI) revolution to employees, by giving them an extra day off.
Then employees would be able to enjoy a three-day weekend – but still get the same salary.
Sources said the idea would "fit" with the party's economic agenda and plans to increase benefits for employees.
The change to a four-day week has been approved by the Trades Union Congress as a way for employees to take advantage of the changed economy.
An older Labour source told The Sunday Times: A policy announcement is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
'It doesn't happen overnight, but a four-day working week is a wish that fits into the approach the party has to balance the economy in favor of the worker, as well as the party's overseer's industrial strategy.'
The Labour Party would not be the first to approve such an idea, when the Green Party promised a four-day working week in its 2017 campaign.
However, for the moment, the ambition is not approved by the entire Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said, 'A four-day working week is not party politics and it is not considered by the party.'
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's working conference to reinforce his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from "faceless directors" and "profitors" in wealthy businesses.
The shadow chancellor's plans also mean that current shareholders in the water undertakings cannot get back their entire efforts when a Labour government could make "outsiders" due to perceived misconduct.
He has also confirmed plans to place employees on corporate boards and created Inclusive Ownership Funds (including equity funds) to provide 10 percent of the equity in private sector enterprises to employees, who would receive annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500, approximately $5,000.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy, tells in the TV show "60 Minutes" if FBI s in investigation of Kavanaugh could make them change their minds
The FBI investigation into complaints against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least a week, and it raises the question of to what extent findings to the agency could affect some Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview sent on Sunday, correspondent Scott Pelley in "60 Minutes" asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham, if the FBI could uncover anything that would cause them to change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open than his South Carolina counterpart.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
"I said on the way into the hearing, I said, I've spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, the claim came out and said, 'Have you done it?'
He was determined, determined, undecided."
Graham's voice, however, appears to be in stone.
"I've made up my mind about Brett Kavanaugh, and it would take a dynamite charge to change me," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And everyone she names couldn't confirm it.
That's 36 years.
I don't see anything new changing."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York hosts the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that has an enormously impressive array of stars performing and an equally impressive mission; ending poverty in the world.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people flock to Central Park's large lawn, not only to enjoy watching Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes perform, but also to raise awareness of the true goal of the event to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international support group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless you were willing to pay for a VIP ticket), concert witnesses had to complete a number of tasks, or "acts" such as volunteering; sending email to a world leader, calling a phone call or other meaningful ways to help raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how much success has Global Citizen been with 12 years left to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a real way to persuade people to demand a call for action, or just another case of so-called "clickivism" - people feel they are making a real difference by signing an online appeal or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says it has registered more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, and participated and pushed for a variety of goals.
It states that these actions have helped to enable world leaders to announce commitments and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group showed 390 commitments and announcements as a result of their actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid or collected.
The group estimates that the safe means so far have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the most important commitments are The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and entrepreneurs committed to "helping children reach their full potential"; promising to give Rwanda $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from global citizens.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens, just like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history," - said The Power of Nutrition Ambassador, Tracey Ullman, to the public during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after taking more than 5,000 actions to demand that the UK become better at nutrition for mothers and children, the UK government announced funding for a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutritional treatment.
In response to one of the common questions on their website, they ask, "What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global citizen replied, "It will be a long and difficult road - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But as the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements lead us, we will succeed, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among some of the actors performing at this year's New York event, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use the Navy as "blocked" to prevent Russian energy exports - Interior Secretary
Washington may "if necessary" resort to its fleet to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including in the Middle East, International Secretary Ryan Zinke has revealed, as quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's involvement in Syria - especially where they operate at the invitation of the legitimate government - is a prelude to exploring new energy markets.
"I think the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to convey energy, just like they do in Eastern Europe, the southern part of Europe," he said.
And according to the official, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"The United States has this ability, with our Navy, to ensure that sea routes are open and, if necessary, blocked to ensure that their energy does not go to market," he said.
Zinke spoke to participants at the event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that presents itself as the "voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they are actually the same.
"The economic solution to Iran and Russia is more or less to exploit and replace fuel," he said, while referring to Russia as a "one-trick pony" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The declarations come as the Trump administration has been commissioned to increase exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, the far cheaper option for European consumers.
In connection with this, officials in the Trump administration, including U.S. President Donald Trump, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, made Berlin a "prisoner" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is set to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington's keen opposition to the project is driven solely by economic reasons, and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the position that energy cannot be a tool to exert pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The American attitude has withdrawn backlash from Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industrial organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has urged the United States to stay away from EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state disrupts our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, leader of the German Industry Association (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "run hard" to run as presidential candidate in 2020, says Massachusetts Senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would take a "deep look" at running for president after the midterm elections.
During a council meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider running as a candidate.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our bad government, and that includes a woman on top," she said according to The Hill.
"After November 6, I will consider thoroughly running as a presidential candidate."
Warren responded to President Donald Trump at the town hall meeting, saying he is “leading this country in the wrong direction.”
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren has been crippled in his criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court-elect Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said "Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote."
However, a poll released on Thursday showed that the majority of Warren's own voters do not believe she should run as a candidate in 2020.
51 percent of "probable" Massachusetts voters said the senator should not run as a candidate, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/ Boston Globe survey.
Thirty-two percent supported such a candidacy.
The survey showed more support for a round of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent supporting a potential candidacy and 48 percent against.
Other high-profile democratic names discussed with regard to a potential 2020 candidacy, include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would decide officially in January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin argues for Track Palin's PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder) at Donald Trump collection
Track Palin, 26, was a year in Iraq after being recruited in September.
He was arrested and charged with a violent incident at his home on Monday night
"What my own son is going through, what he is going through when he comes back, allows me to relate to other families that are characterized by PTSD and some of the wounds that our soldiers return with," she said to the public at a gathering for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in space" and said of his son and other war veterans that "they come back a little changed, they come back hardened, they come back and wonder about the respect for what they and fellow soldiers and pilots and all other military, have done for the country, exists".
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and was charged with physical violence at home against a woman, for interfering with a report of domestic violence and the possession of a weapon while he was intoxicated, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 States, D.C. Support Challenge to New Asylum Policy
Eighteen states and districts of Columbia support a legal challenge to a new American policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and the district filed a friend-of-right brief Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker who challenged the policy, NBC News reported.
The plaintiff's full name in Grace v. Sessions matches the fact that the American Civil Liberties Union (American Civil Liberties Union) filed in August against federal policy has not been disclosed.
She said her partner "and the powerful gang member sons" abused her, but U.S. officials denied her application for asylum on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
The lawyers of the States supporting Grace describe El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, which produce a large number of U.S. asylum seekers, as nations face widespread problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a 2014 decision from the Immigration Act, which allowed illegal immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District of Columbia Justice Minister Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores many decades of state, federal and international law."
"Federal law requires that all asylum cases be judged for the special facts and circumstances of the claim, and such an obstacle conflicts with this principle," said friend-of-the court briefly.
Lawyers further argued in the summary that the policies that deny immigrants access are damaging the U.S. economy, saying they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "offer the necessary work".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing abuse and genocide in June.
"Asylum is available to those who leave their homeland due to persecution or fear due to race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political opinion," Sessions said in his June 11 announcement of the policy.
Asylum was never meant to alleviate all the problems - even all the serious problems - that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue work in Palu as death toll doubles in race to find survivors
For survivors, the situation became increasingly serious.
"It feels very tense," said 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, who comforted her feverish baby son at an evacuation center in the devastated city, Palu.
"Every minute ambulances come with bodies.
Clean water is hard to find."
Residents are observed on their way back to their destroyed homes, searching through water damaged properties and trying to save everything they can find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals destroyed by the earthquake, which had a strength of 7.5, were overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who had broken his back and shoulders, rested outside Palu's Military Hospital, where patients were being treated outdoors due to still strong aftershocks.
Tears filled his eyes as he told him that he knew the powerful earthquake shook the hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter on the fifth floor.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I was pushed into the ruins of the wall, I think," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife crying for help, but then it was quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they are safe."
U.S. ambassador blames China for "mobbing" with "propaganda ads"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper ran a 4-page ad in a U.S. daily and highlighted the mutual advantages of trade with the United States and China, the U.S. ambassador against China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday referred to China Daily's paid allowances in the Des Moines Register - the state of Iowa's largest salsa newspaper - after accusing China of trying to interfere in the U.S. congressional elections on November 6, a accusation China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in U.S. elections, marked what U.S. officials told Reuters was a new phase in a escalating campaign by Washington to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place advertisements to support trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in an increasing trade war that has seen them in turn increase taxes on each other's imports.
China's retaliatory tariffs early in the trade war were designed to hit exporters in states like Iowa that supported Trump's Republican party, Chinese and American experts have said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and the former longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had damaged U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
"China," Branstad wrote in an opinion piece in Sunday's Des Moines Register, "now doubles the bullying by running propaganda ads in our own free press."
"In its dissemination of propaganda, the Chinese government uses America's beloved tradition of freedom of expression and a free press by placing a paid ad in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, at the newspaper kiosk down the street here in Beijing, you will find limited deviant voices and will not see any true reflection of the various opinions that the Chinese people may have on China's problematic economic trajectory, given that the media is under the firm thumb of the Chinese Communist Party "he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers declined the offer to publish" his article, although he did not say what a newspaper.
Republicans advance female voters ahead of midterm with Kavanaugh Debacle, warns Analysts.
As many top Republicans are stand-by and defend Supreme Court elected Brett Kavanaugh in the face of multiple allegations of sexual assault, the analyst has warned that they will likely see a setback, especially from women, in the upcoming midterm elections.
The senses around this have been extremely high, and most Republicans are on have registered that they already wanted to move on with a vote.
These things cannot be undone, says Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, to The Hill for an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) last-minute pressure for an FBI investigation will be enough to reassure angry voters.
"Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday - they are not going to forget it tomorrow, and not in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn on Friday. Washington, DC newspaper.
On Friday morning, Protestants sang "November is Coming!" while demonstrating in the hall of the Senate when the Republicans, who run the Court Committee, chose to go ahead with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be out of the chart," said Stu Rothenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst, to the news page.
"People say it's already been high, it's true.
But it can get higher, especially among women voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18 to 29-year-olds, who, while not liking the president, often don't vote."
Even before Ford's public testimony detailing the allegations of sexual assault directed at the nominated Supreme Court, analysts suggested a setback could follow if Republicans pushed forward with the confirmation.
"This has become a confused root for GOP," said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, early last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the vote of the committee or final vote or whether Kavanaugh has been put on the bench, it's also about how Republicans have handled this and how they have treated her," Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats, pointed to the news channel.
But Americans seem to be a bit divided over who they should believe in the wake of Ford's and Kavanaugh's testimony, with a little more sideways with the latter.
A new poll from YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believed Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they definitely or probably believed Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they believed Kavanaugh likely or definitely lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford, and also at least one other complainant, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh completely abused her at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee showed her the genitals while attending a party during the time they were studying at Yale University in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet to meet Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a startup seeking to compete with Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company building on Berners-Lee's open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where data is stored and what people have access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the meaning of Inrupt is "world domination".
"We have to do it now," he said about the startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solids technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data warehouse" or a POD.
It may contain contact lists, memory lists, calendar, music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive; Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify are all available in one browser and all at the same time.
What is unique about the personal online store is that it is entirely up to the user who can access all kinds of information.
The company calls it "personal authority through data."
Inrupt's idea, according to the company's Managing Director John Bruce, is that the company should include resources, processes, and appropriate capabilities to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM and some employee developers with contracts to work on the project, as well as a community of volunteer encoders.
From this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking to "Facebook and Google about not introducing a complete change where all their business models are completely turned on their heads overnight.
"We don't ask for their permission."
In a medium post published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new grid collection built on Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he established the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been a voice with great influence in the debate about net neutrality.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation, and Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic for this next era on the web," added Berners-Lee ti l.
Bernard Vann: WW1 Victoria Cross Divine Fair
The only English church divine who won a Victoria Cross during World War I as a fighter, has been celebrated in his hometown 100 years later.
Lt. Col. Pastor Bernard Vann won the prize on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never knew he had won the highest British military honor.
A memorial stone was unveiled by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "brilliantly symbolic", that the stone would be unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather's award-winning achievement.
According to the London Gazette, Lt Col Water led his battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quentin on September 29, 1918 "through a very thick shell and under heavy fire from fields and machine guns."
He later ran up to the front line, and with the "greatest gallantry" the line led forward before rushing alone with a field rifle and knocking out three of the group.
Lt Col Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 – just over a month before the war was over.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "something I know I could never live up to, but something I'm humbled for."
He and his brother Dr James Vann also placed a wreath after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he felt very honored to play a role in the parade, adding that "the value of a real hero is shown by the support given by many people."
MMA fans were up all night to see Bellator 206, they got Peppa Pig instead
Imagine this, you've been up all night to see a packed Bellator 206but then you won't see the main event.
The San Jose bill contained 13 matches, including six on the main card and was shown live throughout the night in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to meet, viewers in Britain were again stunned when the coverage changed to Peppa Pigs.
Some were little impressed after they had stayed awake until the early hours especially for the match.
A Twitter fan described byte to the children's cartoon as "some kind of sick joke."
"It is public regulation that at 6 o'clock if the contents were not so owned, then they had to switch to the children's program," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the transfer.
"The Peppa Pig, "yes."
Bellator company president Scott Coker said they will work on planning to include British viewers in the future.
"I think when I think of replay, I think we can probably figure it out," Coker said.
"But it's six o'clock in the morning on a Sunday, and we don't find out about this until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when it passed, there were many texts going back and forth, and not all were friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical error.
But that wasn't it; it was a public problem.
I can promise you, next time it won't happen.
We keep it to five games instead of six - as we usually do - and we tried to hand it over to the fans, and we just went over.
It’s an unfortunate situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "inferior" due to sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says that in his upbringing he felt worse than everyone because of his sexuality - but that gave him the motivation to become a success.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize until he went to high school that "not everyone is like me."
Speaking on the first Radio 4 Desert Island discs presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke out about gay rights to give others "hope".
He also said becoming a parent made him less concerned about winning the Olympics.
The regular reporter in the cross-country show, Kirsty Young, has taken several months off due to illness.
What might look like a lost in Laverne's first program, Daly said he knew himself "less than" everyone else growing up because "it was not socially acceptable to equalize boys and girls."
He said, "From today, the feeling of feeling less than and feeling different, have been the real things that have given me the strength and strength to succeed."
He would prove that he was "something," he said, so he didn't disappoint everyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The two-time bronze Olympic medalist has become a professional LGBT campaigner and used his appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to several countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke out because he felt lucky that he could live openly without branching and wanted to give others "hope".
The three-time world champion said that falling in love with a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "surprised me."
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him, last year, but he said the age difference had never been a problem.
"When you go through so much at such a young age" - he went to his first Olympics at age 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was difficult to find anyone of the same age who had experienced similar heights and descents.
The couple became parents in June to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that his entire "his" perspective had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, then everything was about I need to win a gold medal," he said.
"You know what, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that his father did not accept him to die and one of the last things he had asked for was whether they had tickets to London 2012 – when he wanted to be in the first row.
"I couldn't tell him you're not going to be on the front row," he said.
"I held my hand when he stopped breathing, and it wasn't until he had actually stopped breathing and he was dead that I finally recognized that he wasn't invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I just knew this was what I had dreamed of my whole life - diving in front of a home audience at an Olympic game, where fans didn't feel any better," he said.
It also inspired his first song selection - Proud of Heather Small - which had vibrated with him in the build-up to the Olympics and still gave him goose skin.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Out of shape Mickelson sits on the bench at Ryder Cup Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he must turn his shape to avoid it being an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who played in the two-year event for a record 12th time, was put on the bench by Captain Jim Furyk in front of Saturday's golf game in fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being in the middle of the action, as he has often been for the United States, the five-time big winner split his day between being a cheerleader and working on his game within the reach of the hope of correcting what is bothering him.
Never the most competent longshoes. Not even at the top of his career, the 48-year-old is best at hitting with the longshoes on the narrow, French main court, where balls hit outside if the golfer is not accurate with the stroke.
And if the track itself isn't scary enough, Mickelson will face in the ninth game Sunday, the exact British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their games this week.
If the Americans, four points down by starting the 12 singles matches, reach a warm start, Mickelson's match could be entirely decisive.
Furyk expressed confidence in her husband, not that he could say much else.
"He fully understood the role he had today, gave me a slap on my back and put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He has great confidence in himself.
He is a Hall of Famer, and he has added so much to these teams in the past and this week.
I probably didn't think he was playing two games.
I imagined more, but that's how it was, and that's how we thought we had to do it.
He will be out there, just like everyone else."
Mickelson will break Nick Faldo's record in most Ryder Cup matches played on Sunday.
It may mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never quite matched the heights of his individual record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, although Furyk said his proximity added some intangible properties to the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, entertaining, likes to have fun with people and he's a nice guy to have in the storage room," he explained.
"I think the younger players had fun having a game with him too, this week, which was fun to watch.
He contributes much more than just playing."
Europe Captain Thomas Bjorn Knows Big Lead May Soon Disappear
Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn, the European captain, knows from experience that a significant lead on the way into the final days of Ryder Cup singles can easily be turned into an unpleasant trip.
The Dane made his debut in the 1997 game at Valderrama, where a side captain of Seve Ballesteros held a five-point advantage over the Americans, but only came across the finish line with the nose leading with the narrowest margins, winning 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"You continued to remind you that we had a big lead at Valderrama; we had a big lead at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won, but only barely," said Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn, after seeing the Class of 2018 win 5-3 both Friday and yesterday to lead 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So history will show me and everyone on that team that this is not over.
You're going to the full opening tomorrow.
Go out there and do all the right things.
This is not over until you have scored on the board.
We have a goal, and it's to try to win this trophy, and that's where the focus stays.
I've been saying all the time, I'm focusing on the 12 players that are on our side, but we're so well aware of what's left on the other side - the biggest players in the world."
Delighted with how his players have performed on a tough golf course, Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn added: "I would never take the victory on the lead.
Tomorrow is another day.
Tomorrow it's the individual achievements that come out, and there's another thing to do.
It’s great to be out there with a partner when things are going well, but when you’re out there individually, you’re being tested to the fullest of your capacity as a golfer.
That's the message you need to convey to players; get the best of yourself tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner, and he must go and get the best of himself too."
In contrast to Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn, opposite number Jim Furyk will be looking for his players to perform better individually than they did as partners, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who picked up three points out of four.
Furyk himself has been at both ends of the turnaround operations in the last few days, having been part of the winning team in Brookline before quitting as a loser when Europe pulled off the "Miracle of Medina."
"I remember every fucking word of it," he said in response to being asked how Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 captain, had gathered his players en route into the last day.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you want to get started with the quick start that you saw on Brookline, that you saw on Medinah.
When that moment gets to go a way, it puts a lot of pressure on the middle games.
We set up our line-up correspondingly and put the guys in motion in a way that feels good, you know, we're trying to do something magical tomorrow" .
Thomas has been assigned the task of trying to lead the game and meets Rory McIlroy in the top game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter the other Europeans in the top half of the scheme.
"I went with this group of guys in this order because I think it covers all the way through," Bjorn said of his choice of singles.
Germany's new warship postponed once again
The newest frigate of the German Navy was supposed to have been ordered in 2014 to replace aging Cold War warships, but it will not be there until at least next year due to faulty systems and disgraceful costs, local media reported.
The launch of Rheinland-Pfalz, the leader ship of the brand new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to The Zeit newspaper, citing a military spokesman.
The vessel was supposed to have joined the fleet in 2014, but the worrying problems after delivery plagued the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships ordered back in 2007, come as a replacement for the aging Bremen-class frigates.
It is understood that they will contain a powerful cannon, a number of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some hidden technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to deploy the newest frigates for up to two years away from the ports at home.
Yet continuous delays mean that the groundbreaking warships, which apparently allow Germany to exercise power abroad, will already become obsolete as they enter service, notes Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125 frigate made headlines last year, when the German fleet officially refused to accept the vessel and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the German fleet has returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but German media cited a number of important "software and hardware failures" that made the warship useless if they were deployed on a combat mission.
Software failures were particularly important as the ships in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors - only half of the workforce of older Bremen frigates.
It also turned out that the ship is dramatically overweight, reducing performance and limiting the ability of the fleet to lay down for future upgrades.
The 7000-ton "Rheinland-Pfalz" is believed to be twice as heavy as similar ships used by the Germans in World War II.
Apart from faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project - including training of the crew - will also become a problem.
It is said to have reached a staggering <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) – up from initial <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion (EURO)
Problems related to the latest frigates become particularly important in light of the recent warnings that Germany's naval power is decreasing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the defence committee of the German parliament, acknowledged that the fleet has in fact "almost ended on distribution-competent ships".
The officer said the problem has built on over time, because old ships were dismantled, but no replacement vessels were delivered.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class frigates were able to join the fleet.
National Trust listens to secret lives of bats
New research being conducted on a property in the Scottish Highlands aims to reveal how bats use the landscape in hunting for food.
It is hoped that the findings will shed new light on the behavior of the unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study by researchers at the National Trust for Scotland will follow common and soprano pipistreles and also brown longhorn and Daubenton bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at important locations around the property to track bat activities throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of bat conversations and what species do what.
A habitat map and report will then be produced to create a detailed landscape scale picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, natural science advisor for NTS, hopes the results will reveal what areas of habitat, natural homes, are most important to bats and how they are used by each of the species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work such as meadow acquisitions and how it is best to maintain equal forest areas for bats and other associated species.
Flag mice populations in Scotland and across the United Kingdom have declined significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work affecting rest areas and loss of habitat/bubble areas.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, such as flying paper and some chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks by pet cats.
Bats are not actually blind.
However, due to their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are still more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echolocation technique to find errors and obstacles in their flight routes.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 acres of land around the country, takes bats very seriously.
It has ten trained experts, who regularly conduct surveys, resting place inspections and sometimes save lives.
The organization has even created Scotland's first and only dedicated flagella reserve at Threave Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten flagella species.
Property manager David Thompson says the property is the ideal territory for them.
"Here at Threave we have a great area for bats," he said.
"We have old buildings, many veteran trees and all the good habitats.
But there is a lot about bats that are still unknown, so the work we do here and on other properties will help us understand more about what they need to thrive."
He emphasizes the importance of checking for bats before performing maintenance within properties, since it is possible that the endless destruction of a single buplas can kill up to 400 female bats and young, and perhaps annihilate an entire local population.
Flag mice are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass or disturb them or destroy their resting places.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer of the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to come in and help.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species we don't know how their populations are doing."
Ronaldo rejects rape allegations in lawyers sue German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has branded the rape allegations against him as "fake news", saying people "want to stand out" by using his name.
His lawyers are set to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
Portugal and Juventus forward have been accused of selecting an American woman, called Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
He is claimed to have paid her $375,000 to remain silent about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
In a live instagram video, Ronaldo, 33, to his 142 million followers just hours after the accusations, says the accusations are "fake news."
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today, fake news, five times the Gold Ball winner says into the camera.
"They want to market themselves by using my name.
That's normal.
They will be known to say my name, but that's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and all is well," the player added and smiled.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they have called "an unacceptable reporting of suspicions within the area of privacy", according to Reuters
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for "moral damage in an amount equal to the seriousness of the rule violation , which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident is said to have taken place in June 2009 at a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the player's room, where he is claimed to have kidnapped her anally, according to documents filed at Clark County District Court, Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and told him that he was "99 percent" a "good guy" and failed by "one percent".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that there was consent.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and had photographs taken of her injuries at a hospital, but was later agreed on a compensation because she felt "scared of retaliation" and was worried about "being publicly humiliated."
The 34-year-old says she is now trying to change residence as she continues to be traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and this summer he moved to Italian giant Juve in a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million deal.
Brexit: UK 'would forever regret' losing car manufacturers
Britain "would regret it forever" if it lost its status as world leader in car production after Brexit, Business Secretary Greg Clark has said.
He added that it was "if" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if the UK left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily stop production at the factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," Clark said.
The Japanese car manufacturer said the effect of border delays in case a non-deal Brexit could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant—which makes Toyota's Auris and Avensis—produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, with 90% being exported to the rest of the EU.
"My perception is that if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, we are seeing production stoppages at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's Managing Director in Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers have raised fears of leaving the EU with no agreement on how cross-border trade will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW says it will close its Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns surrounding what car manufacturers say are supply chain risks in the event of a non-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line is operated on a "just-in-time" basis, with parts coming every 37th minute from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for cars ordered.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there may be disruptions at the border that the industry says can lead to delays and shortages of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to hold more than a day's worth of inventory at its Derbyshire factory, the company said, and thus production would be stopped.
Mr Clark said that Theresa May's Checker's plan for future relations with the EU is "just calibrated to avoid border checks."
"We need to have a deal. We want to have the best deal that will allow, as I say, not only to enjoy the success today, but for us to seize this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's daily program.
"The evidence from not only Toyota, but other manufacturers is that we absolutely need to be able to continue what has been a very successful set of supply chains."
Toyota could not say how long production would be stopped, but in the longer term they warned that additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years, and is the Unite Union union at the plant, said that his members are more concerned about: "After my experience, when these jobs go, they will never come back.
A government spokesman said, "We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, says White House
Donald Trump's high-profile meeting with deputy attorney Rod Rosenstein could be "pressed back a week" as the fight against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian election interference, connections between Trump aides and Russia and potential obstruction of justice by the president.
Corrupt Trump will dismiss the general to the prosecution or not, thus endangering Mueller's independence, has fueled Washington gossip for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed a drive to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president using the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But earlier Monday he went to the White House, and it was reported that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the UN in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he would "prefer" not to fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid crashing with the Senate Commission hearing where both Kavanaugh and one of the women who have accused him of sexual harassment, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, witnessed.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh, which delayed full voting by the Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said: "There has been no date set. It may be this week, but I can and see that it will be delayed another week due to everything else happening in the Supreme Court.
But we get to see, and I always like to keep the press updated."
Some reporters will probably disagree: Sanders has not held a press briefing for the White House since September 10.
The host, Chris Wallace, asked why.
Sanders said the lack of information was not due to a dissatisfaction with TV reporters' game for the gallery, although she said, "I don't disagree that they do."
She also mentioned that direct contact between Trump and the press is going to increase.
"The president holds more press conferences than any president has done before," she said - right enough without providing evidence for the allegation. "We have looked at the speeches."
Sanders says updates will still happen, but "if the press gets the chance to ask the President of the United States directly, it's much better than talking to me.
We've tried to do it like that part, and you've seen us do it often in recent weeks, and it's going to take over instead of a press orientation if you can talk directly to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly accepts questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press conferences with visitors.
It is unusual for the president to hold press conferences alone.
In New York this week, perhaps the president demonstrated why, where he acted leading the reporters shamelessly, and almost bizarrely.
Health secretary writes about Brexit fears to EU workers at NHS in Scotland
The health secretary has written to EU workers working at the NHS in Scotland to express gratitude and a wish for them to continue after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter although less than six months are left before the United Kingdom withdraws from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to bear the costs of applications having status as settled for EU residents working in delegated public services.
In the letter, Freeman wrote the following: "During the summer, negotiations regarding withdrawal between the UK and the EU have continued, and it is approaching its expected conclusion this fall.
However, the British government has stepped up preparations in case there is no deal.
I understand that this must be a difficult time for all of you.
Therefore, I now want to repeat how much I appreciate the contributions of all employees, no matter what a nationality they have.
Colleagues from the EU, and outside, bring with them valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the healthcare sector and are beneficial to patients and communities.
Scotland is clearly your home, and we would like you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes acute surgery after head injury
Linebacker Christion Abercrombie, who plays at the Tennessee State Tigers, underwent an acute operation after sustaining a head injury when the team lost 31-27 against the Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, reports The Tennessean newspaper.
Tennessee State head coach, Rod Reed, told reporters that the injury occurred just before the break.
"He came to the sidelines and collapsed, in a way," Reed said.
Coaches and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sidelines before placing him on a stretcher and taking him back for further evaluation.
An official spokesman from Tennessee State, told WSMV that Abercrombie had finished operating at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
There are no details on the extent of the damage yet, Harris said, adding that Tennessee State is still trying to figure out when the damage occurred.
Abercrombie goes to university for the second year, and is in his first season after being transferred from Illinois.
He had a total of five tackles before being injured in Saturday's game, and is now up for 18 overall this season.
Foreign buyers must pay a higher document fee when buying property in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher document fee when buying property in the UK. The extra income will be used to help the homeless, according to the new plans of the Conservatives
The decision will neutralize Corbyn's success in attracting young voters
Increases in document fees will be added for those who do not pay tax in the UK
The Treasury expects an increase of up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year - to help the homeless
Theresa May will announce today that foreign buyers will have to pay a higher document fee when buying property in the UK. The extra income will be used to help the homeless.
This decision will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success Jeremy Corbyn has had in attracting young voters who earn a lot, promising to offer reasonable housing.
The increase in the document fee will be added for individuals and firms who do not pay taxes in the UK, and the additional money will strengthen the government's desire to reduce the number of turnovers.
The fees, which come in addition to the current document fee, include the higher levels that were introduced two years ago at the number two residence and rental residences, may be as much as three percent.
The Treasury expects the decision will receive up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
Approximately 13 percent of new buildings in London are purchased by residents outside the UK, which increases prices and makes it harder for first-time buyers to enter the housing market.
Many prosperous areas of the country - especially in the capital - have become "ghost towns" due to the large number of foreign buyers who most of the time reside in other countries.
This new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson would cut the document fee to help more young people buy their first home.
He indicted major construction companies for keeping prices up by acquiring properties but not using them, and asked Theresa May to give up the quotas on reasonable dwellings to fix Britain's "residential shame".
Corbyn has announced a series of eye-catching proposals for residential reforms, including controlled rent and the termination of expulsions for no reason.
He will and will give the council greater power to build new settlements.
May said, "Last year I said I would dedicate my position to bringing back the British dream - that life should be better for each new generation.
That means fixing the ruined housing market.
The UK will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it may not be right that it should be as easy for individuals not residing in the UK, or foreign firms, to buy housing as it is for hard-working, British residents.
For many people, the dream of owning a home has ended too far away, and the humiliation of being a stray is real.
Jack Ross: 'My ultimate ambition is to lead Scotland'
Sunderland's boss, Jack Ross, says his "ultimate ambition" is to become a manager for Scotland at some point.
The Scots (42) rejoice over the challenge of reviving the club from the north-east. Currently, they are in third place in League One, only three points from the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer, after leading St Mirren back to the Scottish elite series last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I won a B-team match, and that was it," Ross told Scotland's BBC Sportssound.
"But I grew up watching Scotland on Hamden with my father, and there has always been something that has pulled me back.
That opportunity can only come if I have success as a club manager."
Ross's predecessors as Sunderland manager include Dick Advocaat, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet, and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of Alloa Athletic says he has not been anxious to come after so many established names in such a large club, since he has previously declined approaches from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"For the moment, success for me will be measured in whether I can 'get this club back in the Premier League.'
Given the structure and facilities of this club, there is no doubt that they belong in the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to get them there, but I can probably only see myself as successful if I manage to get the club back there".
Ross is only three years into his career as a manager, after a period as an assistant manager at Dumbarton and a 15-month period in the coaching apparatus of the Hearts.
He then helped Alloa recover from depression to third level, transforming St Mirren, who was about to move down, into the title winner in the championship series the following season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now, than he ever did while playing in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"There was probably a road difference," he says about leading Alloa.
"I genuinely believed that being a manager suits me much better than being a player.
It sounded bizarre, because I did it well, lit well and liked it relatively well.
But playing can be tough.
There are many things you are required to get through each week.
I still notice that when it comes to the stress and pressure of the job, but it feels right to be a manager.
I've always wanted to be a manager, and now I am. It's the most comfortable thing I've felt in my own body in my entire adult life."
On Sunday, September 30, you can hear the entire interview on Sportssound, Radio Scotland, between 12 and 13.
Survey shows that the perfect time for a half-liter is at 5.30 p.m. on a Saturday
The summer heatwave has led to an increase in the income of struggling pubs in the UK, but also increased the pressure on restaurant chains.
In July, sales increased by 2.7 percent in the children's industry - but for the restaurant industry, it decreased by 4.8 percent, statistics show.
Business advisor Peter Martin, who is behind the statistics, said: "Keeping the sun, and the fact that England was in the World Cup longer than planned, means that July followed the June trend where pubs rose 2.8 percent, only that restaurants became even harder framed.
The decline of 1.8 percent in the restaurant industry only worsened in July.
Pubs and bars selling drinks made it significantly better and went up more than restaurants went down.
Pubs selling food received and noticed the decline in the sun, although it was not as dramatic as for restaurant owners.
It may seem like people just want to go out for a drink.
Among pubs and bars, the drinking hall had increased by 6.6 percent this month, while food had declined by three percent.
Paul Newman, travel and leisure analyst at RSM, said: "These results are the continuation of the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather, and the impact of a huge social or sporting event, will still be the biggest factors when it comes to sales in the nightlife industry.
It is no surprise that the restaurant industry will still struggle. A fall in sales of 4.8 percent annually will be painful to get on top of a running cost pressure.
The long, hot summer couldn't come at a worse time for food operators. Time will show whether the more moderate temperatures that have been in August can provide a long-awaited respite."
The total sales decline across pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the downturn in the release of brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker industry sales monitor for the UK pub, bar and restaurant industry collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups that have a combined turnover of over <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion, and is the established industry benchmark index.
One in five children have secret social media profiles that they hide from their parents
One in five children - some as young as 11 - have secret social media profiles that they hide from parents and teachers, a survey shows
Survey of 20,000 pupils on pass-through reveals an increase in "fake Insta" profiles
This news has increased fears that sexual content will be posted
Twenty percent of students say they have a "head" profile they show their parents
One in five children - some as young as 11 - create profiles on social media that they keep secret from adults.
A survey among 20,000 students at secondary school revealed a sharp increase in "fake Insta" profiles – a reference to the Instagram image sharing platform.
The news has increased fears that sexual content will be posted.
Twenty percent of students say they have a sterile "head" profile they refer to parents, while they and have private profiles.
A mother stumbling over the secret side of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager urging others to "choose me".
The research, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters' and Headmasters' Conference (HMC) at various schools, found that 40 percent of those between the ages of 11 and 18 had two profiles, and half of these admitted to having private users.
The head of HMC, Mike Buchanan, said, "It is disturbing that so many teenagers are being tempted to create places online where parents and teachers can't find them."
Eilidh Doyle becomes "the voice of athletes" in the Scottish Athletics Board
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the Board of Scottish Athletics as the non-executive director of the Board's annual general meeting.
Doyle is the most decorated athlete in Scotland, and chairman Ian Beattie describes the event as a great opportunity for those who lead the sport to benefit from her extensive experience at the international level over the past decade.
"Eilidh has a lot of respect across Scotland, the UK and the world's athletic community, and we are confident that athletics in Scotland can benefit from getting her into the board," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I am eager to serve as a voice for athletes, and I hope I can be contributing and helping the sport in Scotland."
The American, who has gold from both 200m and 400m in Atlanta in 1996 among his total of four Olympic golds and is now a regular guest with the BBC, was unable to go after a drop.
On Twitter, he wrote: "Today is a month since I got a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The teams said that it was only time that could tell me if I was going to get well again, or to what extent.
It's been exhausting work, but I've been completely fine again, learned to walk again, and today I do flexibility shoes!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
Split opinions on the Internet about breast pump advertising comparing mothers to dairy cows
A breast pump company has split publicity on the Internet with an advertisement comparing breastfeeding mothers to dairy cows.
To mark what is described as "the world's first silent, sedentary breast pump", tech company Elvie released a petty advertisement inspired by music videos to demonstrate the freedom the new pump gives mothers who extract milk.
Four real mothers dance in a high-filled barn of cows, to a song that includes lyrics like, "Yes, I milk myself, but you don't see any tail" and "If you didn't notice it, this is not spiders, it's my tits."
The refrain continues, "Pump it out, pump it out, I feed these kids, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my ladies".
The advertisement, published on the company's Facebook page, on the other hand, has created controversy online.
With 77,000 views and several hundred comments, the video has received mixed reactions from viewers, and many say it illuminates the "horror" of the dairy industry.
“Very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they need to get pregnant and feed to produce milk, only that the calves are beheaded from them just days after birth," writes one.

Another commented: "Understandably traumatic for both mother and child
But yes, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their young?"
Another added, "For an electricity-removal advertisement."
Others defended the advertisement, and a lady admitted that she thinks the song is "festive."
"I think this is a brilliant idea.
I would have one if I was still grandmother.
Pumping made me feel net like a cow.
This ad is a little crazy, but I took him for what he is.
This is a brilliant product," wrote one.
Another commented: "This is a fun advertisement aimed at mothers who pump (often at work or in the toilet) and feel like cows.
This is not an advertisement that boasts or condemns the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, the group of women reveal that they have all danced with the discreet pump wrapped in their bra.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women who pump, say they feel like cows.
The Elvie pump, on the other hand, is completely silent, has no wires or tubes, and its discreet inside a breastfeeding bra, giving women freedom to move, hold their young, and even go out while they pump.
Ana Balardin, partner and creative director of Mother, commented: "The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product, it deserves a daring and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between mothers who extract milk and dairy cows, we wanted to highlight breast pumping and the challenges associated with it, while demonstrating the incredible feeling of freedom the new pump will bring, in an entertaining and recognizable way.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump has created headlines.
During a fashion show in London, a mother of two appeared on the podium for designer Marta Jakubowski, while using the product.
Hundreds of immigrant children quietly moved to tent camp on Texas border
The number of imprisoned immigrant children has peaked although monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, partly due to the stringent policy introduced by the Trump administration making it harder to place the children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors have been undocumented immigrants themselves, and they fear that standing up and welcoming a child may threaten their own opportunity to stay in the country.
The risk of it increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult family members will be required to submit fingerprints, and that this data will be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement witnessed for Congress and said the agency has arrested dozens of people who have applied to be sponsors of single minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had nothing on their record already.
"Nearly 80 percent of those who are either sponsors or family members of sponsors are illegal in the country, and a large part of these are criminal aliens.
So we're going to continue to pursue these people," Albence said.
According to employees in the camp, new rules have now been introduced to deal with the children. The rules require that some of them now have to be in court before a month has passed, against the previous 60 days.
Many will attend via video calls and not at a personal appearance, to have their case tried before an immigration judge.
Those who are not eligible for freedom will be deported quickly.
The longer the children are in custody, the more likely they are to develop anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent outbreaks or escape attempts, the staff at the camp say. Reports that have appeared in recent months say the same.
Proponents say that these concerns are greater in large facilities such as Tornillo. Due to the size of the facility, it is more likely to overlook signs of children's wear and tear.
They added that moving children to the tent camp without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally, or saying hatred to friends, can amplify trauma that many already struggle with.
Syria urges U.S., French and Turkish occupation forces to withdraw immediately
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also asked for Syrian refugees to return home, although the country is now at war for the eighth year.
Moualem, who and serves as deputy prime minister, said that emerging forces are staying illegally on Syrian soil under the guise of defeating terrorism, and "will be treated accordingly".
"They must withdraw immediately and without presumptions," he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that "the war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have lost their lives since 2011, and millions have been removed from their homes.
He said Damascus will continue to "fight a holy battle until all Syrian territory has been cleansed" for both terrorist groups and "illegal presence of aliens."
The United States has approximately 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly for training and advising both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground in that war-torn country.
When talking about the refugee problems, Moualem said it was safe for them to come back, and he blamed "some Western countries" for having "spread irrational fears" about the environment that caused the refugees to stay away.
"We have asked the international community and the humanitarian organizations to facilitate the return," he said.
"They are making policies out of something that would be a purely humanitarian problem."
The United States and the EU have warned that there will be no help for reconstruction in Syria until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war is in place.
UN diplomats say a recently created agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in Idlib, which is the last major rebel fortress, has created an opportunity to continue pushing forward with political talks.
The Russo-Turkish agreement deterred a major attack by Russian-backed, Syrian forces on the province where three million people live.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed hopes that military action will be directed against jihadists, including fighters from the Nusra front, who are linked to Al-Qaeda, who "will be exterminated."
The UN envoy, Staffan de Mistura, hopes to soon gather the first meetings of a new committee consisting of government and opposition members to draft a post-war law for Syria, and pave the way for the elections.
Moualem set the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying that the panel's work should be limited "to review the articles of the current constitution", and warned against interference.
Why Trump is going to win another term
With that logic, Trump will win the re-election in 2020 if not, as many liberal viewers probably hope, the presidency gets an early end due to scandals and federal courts.
It would undoubtedly be "the most dramatic ending of a presidency ever!"
At the time of writing, there is no sign that the viewers are bored.
Since 2014, CNN has doubled its rating in best broadcast time to 1.05 million, while MSNBC has nearly tripled its to 1.6 million.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in best broadcast time, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen. MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has doctors on top of the cable ratings with as many as 3.5 million viewers on evenings with great news.
"This is a fire that people are lured by, because it's something we don't understand," Neal Baer said in the ABC drama "Designated Survivor", which is about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the Congressional building.
Nell Scovell, former comedian and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has another theory.
She remembers a cab ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver said he was going to vote for Trump.
Why that? she asked.
"Because he makes me laugh," he replied according to Scovell.
That's entertainment value in the chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the history coming from Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families will be reunited and healthy for the global economy.
Turning off is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet it goes further beyond being an informed citizen when you find yourself at the sixth hour to see a panel of experts debating Bob Woodward's use of sources with "deep background" for the book "Fear," Paul Manafort's bomber jacket of ostrich leather to $15,000 ("a garment of ostrich leather", "a garment of Trump's density of arrogance").
Personally, I will never look at Super Mario the same way again.
"Part of what he does that makes it feel like a reality show is that he gives you something every night," said Brent Montgomery, daily leader at Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars", about that show going ahead with Trump's employees and daily disputes (going into a game with the NFL, rose Kim Jong-un).
You can't afford to miss a single episode, otherwise you don't hang in there anymore.
When I met Fleiss this week, it was over 25 degrees and sun outside his home on the north coast of Kauai, but he sat in and watched MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not turn away, not when Brett Kavanaugh stood before the Senate Commission and the future of the Supreme Court hung in a thin thread.
"I remember when we did all these crazy shows earlier in the day and people said, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization'," Fleiss said.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right."

Money from the outside flows into the closest mid-term election match
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th district sees an abundance of money, thanks to a reshuffle of the districts in Congress that led to two sitting members fighting for the same seat.
The recently converted suburban district of Pittsburg promotes Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district through a special election in the spring of last year.
Lamb is fighting another sitting member, Republican Keith Rothfus, today representative in the former 12th District of Pennsylvania, which largely overlaps with the new 17th District.
The map was redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January ruled that the old districts were illegally designed to benefit the Republicans.
The competition for the 17th District has launched an arms draw on funding the campaigns, between the major parties' money arsenals, the Democratic Congressional Committee and the Republican Congressional Committee.
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a button says in a closely followed special election in Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
The seat had belonged to a Republican for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by over 20 points.
Political experts have given Democrats a scarce advantage.
U.S. Considers Punishing El Salvador for Support to China, But Withdraws
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing without negative reactions from Washington.
Trump had a hot meeting with the President of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela, in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until partners kicked out the Trump organization's leadership group.
The secretaries of state decided to bring back the U.S. heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over the "last decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, a ministry spokeswoman, in a statement earlier this month.
However, penalties were only considered against El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including for drug control, development and financial support.
The proposed penalties, which contained cuts to financial support and targeted restrictions with regard to visas, would have been painful for the Central American country and their high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings evolved, North American and Central American officials postponed a conference on security and economic prosperity to follow up a similar meeting last year that was seen as a step forward to prevent immigrants from coming to the United States.
However, in mid-September, the top administrators announced that they wanted the conference to continue, thus putting a stop to the assessment of the penalty for El Salvador.
It has now been said that Vice President Mike Pence will meet the conference, which has been scheduled for mid-October, as a signal on the relevance the administration puts on the meeting, the diplomats said.
And the three U.S. envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without new harsh messages or penalties from Washington.
A spokesman for Bolton would not comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal considerations on the grounds of anonymity.
Their description was confirmed by an outspoken analyst who works closely with the administration and also spoke under the pretext of anonymity.
The History Students
Special counsel Robert Mueller's report on Trump's possible obstacles to justice is awaited, for which there is now significant evidence in the public protocols.
According to the reports, Mueller is reported to have turned the focus of the investigation against whether Trump's campaign conspired with Russia's idea of attacking our election.
If Congress were to swap governors, Trump would have to stand trial in this body, in preparing to convince voters and possibly a jury of his peers.
There's a lot of "what ifs", and I don't mean to imply that Trump's fall is inevitable—nor for his counterpart in Europe.
There are choices to take for us all on both sides of the pond, which will affect how prolonged the match can be.
In 1938, German officers were ready for a coup d'état against Hitler, only the West had stood against him and helped the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed, and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of bloodshed this entailed.
The course of history revolves around such turning points, and democracy's inexorable march is accelerated or delayed.
Americans are facing several of these turning points now.
What will we do if Trump fires Deputy Justice Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been on deep water ever since this newspaper revealed that last year he proposed to intercept the president in hiding, speculating on whether he is unfit for his role.
Rosenstein says The Times' description is inaccurate.
"How will we react if the recently requested FBI investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair – or he is accepted by the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault, and dishonest testimony?
And above all, will we in mid-term elections vote for a Congress that holds Trump accountable?
Failing these tests, democracy will face a long winter.
But I don't think we're mistaken, because of what I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied the country I have my embassy in.
She survived, immigrated to the United States, and 60 years later she sent me off guard to light Sabbath lights on the table asking for the swastika.
When this is my legacy, how can I not be optimistic about the future?

Rangers Graham Dorrans is optimistic ahead of Rapid Vienna
Rangers welcome Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that saying over the Austrians, after an impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will give them a good starting point to qualify from Group G in the European League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance this season before the 2–2 result against Villarreal, but he believes Rangers can use this result as a springboard to bigger things.
"That was a good point for us, because Villarreal is a good team," the 31-year-old said.
"We went into the fight believing we could get something, and came out again with a point.
Maybe we could have taken it to the end, but all in all, the draw is probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half, and then we came out in the second half and was the better team.
On Thursday there will be another great European evening.
Hopefully we can get three points, but it's going to be a tough game. They got a good result in their previous game, but with the audience behind us, I'm sure we can run on and get a positive result.
The last year has definitely been tough, with everything that has happened to my injuries and the changes in the club, but now everything feels good.
The stable is good and the boys thrive; the training is good.
Hopefully we can run on now, put the previous season behind us and be successful."
Women lose sleep over this fear of retirement savings
Despite the fact that participants in a survey had clear thoughts about how they would be cared for, few spoke to family members about it.
About half of those who participated in a Nationwide survey said they talked to their spouses about the costs of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their kids about it.
"People want a family member to take care of themselves, but they don't take the necessary steps to have that conversation," says Vice President of Nationwide, Holly Snyder.
Here's where you start.
Talk to your spouse and your children: You cannot prepare your family to take care of you if you do not make your wish known good time in advance.
Collaborate with a counselor and your family to discuss where and how to receive care, since these choices can be a big part of determining costs.
Get a financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you figure out how to pay for these expenses.
The funding options for long-term care may include a traditional long-term care insurance, a life insurance with cash value to help pay the expenses, or that you insure yourself with your own wealth - as long as you have the money.
Make legal documents: Avoid legal fights before they start.
Get a health authority in place, so that you appoint a person you trust to oversee your medical treatment and to ensure that professionals act in accordance with your wishes in cases you cannot communicate.
You can also consider an authorization for your finances.
You should choose a person you trust to make financial decisions and make sure your bills are paid if you don't have the option yourself.
Don't forget the small details: Imagine that your old parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Could you answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Write down all of these details in a written plan, so you're ready.
"It's not just the finances it's all about, but who are the lags?" asked Martin.
"What kind of medicines are they?
Who will take care of the dog?
Have the plan ready."
Man shot multiple times with air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man has been shot several times with an air rifle in what he was on his way home after a walk in the city.
The 40-year-old victim was in the area around Oxford Grove in Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen, and hand.
Policy figures describe the shooting, which occurred around 02:30 local time, as a "random act".
The victim did not see the attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and police are requesting witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by a powerful earthquake and a tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, public officials say. The number of dead is expected to increase.
Without the ability to communicate, relief workers have not received any information from Donggala, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the quake that had a magnitude of 7.5.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster was a fact.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, located on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central Sulawesi province, and is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island. Estimated population in 2017 was 379,800.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala is an area stretching over more than 300 km of coastline northwest of the island.
The area, which is an administrative region lower than a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming is the beam of the economy of the central Sulawesi province, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the other side of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years, according to the Disaster Reduction Office in Indonesia.
In 1938, more than 200 people were killed and hundreds of houses destroyed by a tsunami in Donggala.
In 1996, the west side of Donggala was hit by a tsunami that killed nine people.
Indonesia is located in the seismic Pacific Firering and is regularly affected by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A major quake on the west coast of Aceh province in northern Sumatra on 26 December, triggered a tsunami that hit 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of these in Aceh.
2005: A series of major earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 quake struck southern Java, the most populous island of Indonesia, triggering a tsunami that crashed into the south coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck near the city of Padang, capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people lost their lives.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 quake struck one of the Mentawai islands outside Sumatra and triggered a 10-metre tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A small quake struck the Pidie Jaya area of Aceh and caused destruction and panic when people were reminded of the quake and tsunami in 2004.
No tsunami was triggered this time, but more than 100 lost their lives due to buildings crashing.
2018: Large earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok and kill more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The quake destroyed several thousand buildings and left several thousand tourists temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested and charged with domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former governor of Alaska and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested, charged with assault.
According to a report released by Alaska State Police, Palin (29) was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interference in reporting domestic violence and opposing arrest.
According to the police report, he took the phone from a female acquaintance as she tried to call the police to report the offences.
Palin will be detained in Mat-Su prison, and will be held on bail of $500, KTUU reported.
He appeared in court Saturday and declared himself "not guilty" when asked, citing the network.
Palin faces three Class A miscarriages, meaning he can be jailed for up to one year and get $250,000 in fines.
He has also been charged with a Class B misconduct, which can be punished with a day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
It is not the first time Palin has been charged with anything criminal.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
My mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack.
The case is up in the Alaska Veteran's Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic assault, interference in a reporting of domestic violence and possession of a weapon while intoxicated in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend had claimed that he hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after linking her son's elective behavior to PTSD that stemmed from when he served in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds lost their lives
At least 384 people have lost their lives after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The quake, with a magnitude of 7.5, triggered a tsunami and has destroyed several thousand homes.
Electricity and communications networks are down, and the number of dead is expected to rise in the next few days.
The earthquake struck just outside the central part of Sulawesi, located northeast of the capital Jakarta.
Videos showing the dramatic moment where the quake hits, flourish on social media.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the town of Palu when the tsunami hit the shore.
Federal prosecutors want rare death penalty for suspect in New York terror
Federal prosecutors in New York want the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, suspect in the terrorist attack that killed eight people -- a rare punishment that has not been executed for a federal offence in the state since 1953.
Saipov (30) is said to have used a rental car from the Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bike path along the West Side Highway on lower Manhattan in October, where he drove down pedestrians and cyclists on the road.
In order to justify a death penalty, prosecutors must be able to prove that Saipov killed the eight victims "intentionally" and that he "intentionally" inflicted them serious, bodily harm, according to a note filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both of these incidents may be the basis for a possible death penalty, the court document states.
Weeks after the attack, a federal jury handed over a list of 22 charges, including eight counts of murder with the aim of extortion, commonly used by federal prosecutors in connection with organized crime, and a count of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "substantial planning and deliberation," the prosecutors said, describing the way Saipov carried out the attack as "disgusting, cruel and depraved".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injury and loss to family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," the note reads.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been ten years since the last time the Southern District of New York has condemned the death penalty in a case.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of killing two drug suppliers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time a death penalty was carried out in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
On June 19, 1953, both were executed in the electric chair.
Saipov, originally from Uzbekistan, showed a lack of repentance in the days and months that followed, according to court documents.
He told the detectives that what he had done best, the police said.
Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching videos from ISIS on the phone, the indictment states.
He also asked to have the ISIS flag in the hospital room, police said.
He has not pleaded guilty on all charges.
David Patton, one of the federal, public defenders representing Saipov, says they are "significantly disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to go after the death penalty, rather than accepting a statement of guilt for life in prison without the possibility of release, will only prolong the trauma of the incident for all involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defenders had previously asked prosecutors not to go after the death penalty.
Tory MP says Nigel Farage should hire Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the People's Army" today, during a protest at the Tory National Assembly.
The former leader of the British Independence Party said politicians had to "feel the pressure" of the Eurosceptics – as one of Theresa May's MPs suggested that he should lead the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative, presumptive Member of Parliament Peter Bone told the protesters in Birmingham that Britain "had been out" now, if Farage was Brexit minister.
With the challenge May faces of reconciling her deeply divided ranks has been underlined by a separate protest in the city, held by Tories wishing to remain in the EU.
The Prime Minister struggled to keep the Chequers compromise plan on track following attacks from Brexiteers, Remainers as well as the EU.
Allies insist that she will push for a deal with Brussels, despite the backlash – forcing the Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to choose between her package and "chaos".
Bone told the Leave Means Leave grouping in Solihull that he wanted to "reject Chequers"
He suggested that Farage should be given a decent rank and given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had ruled, we would be out now," he said.
The Wellingborough MP, added, "I want to fight for Brexit, but we have to reject Chequers".
To mark his opposition to the EU, he said: "We did not fight world wars to be subordinate.
We will make our own laws in our own country".
Bone rejects the claim that the opinion of the people has changed since the 2016 election: "The idea that the British people have changed their opinion and wish to remain is completely untrue".
Tory Brexit advocate Andrea Jenkyns also took part in the march, telling reporters: "I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people!"
"Chequers are not popular in the population, the opposition is not going to vote for it, it is not popular in our party or our activists who frequent the streets and get us elected in the first place.
“Please drop the Chequers and listen.”
In a message addressed to May, she adds: "Ministers of State keep their jobs when they keep what they promise".
Farage said that police officers must be allowed to "feel the heat" if they were to betray the decisions made in the 2016 referendum.
"Now it's about trust between us - the people - and the political class," he said.
"They are trying to betray Brexit, and we are here today to tell them that 'we are not going to let them get away with it'."
In a message to the enthusiastic audience, he added: "I want you to make the political class, which is about to betray Brexit, feel the heat.
"We are mobilizing the people's army in this country that gave us say in Brexit and will not rest until we have become an independent, self-governing, proud Britain.
At the same time, Remainers marched through the streets of Birmingham before holding a two-hour meeting in downtown.
A handful of activists waved "Tories Against Brexit" banners after launching the group this weekend.
Labour colleague Lord Adonis made fun of the Conservatives for security issues they had with a party app during the opening of the conference.
"This is the people who tell us that they can have all computer systems in place and all the technology for Canada plus plus, for a frictionless border, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's a total farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit," he added.
Warren plans to take a "close look" at running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will take "a close look at running for president" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat talked about his future during a city meeting west of Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a regular critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who was but a board member of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
She has been the center of much speculation that she may want to try herself against Trump in 2020.
The incident in Holyoke on Saturday, was her 36th meeting with voters in a town hall since Trump joined.
One participant asked if she had plans to run for president.
Warren replied that it is time "that women take the trip to Washington to fix our ruined government, and that includes a woman on top."
Arrest made in shooting of Louisiana State University player Sims
Police in Baton Rouge announced Saturday that a suspect has been arrested in the case where basketball player from Louisiana State University (LSU), Wayde Sims, was shot and killed Friday.
At 11:00 local time, police announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson (20), in a press conference for ET.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help identifying a man seen on the video clip.
Sims (20) were shot and killed early Friday in the southern area of the university.
"Wayde Sims got a gunshot wound to the head and eventually died as a result," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media Saturday, writing 247sports.
Wayde stepped in to defend a friend and was shot by Simpson.
In interception, Simpson has admitted that he was at the scene, with weapons, and admitted that he shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without drama and placed in custody at the Baton Rouge Eastern Police Department.
A third-year student of almost two metres, raised in Baton Rouge, the Sims played 32 games, ten of them from the start of the previous season, where he averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds in each game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world title after team orders give victory over Sebastian Vettel
It became clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the team orders from Mercedes were going to have a big role in the race.
Bottas got a good start in the race, letting Hamilton take care of himself in defending his position for the first two rounds and inviting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was first into the depot and allowed Hamilton to get into traffic at the back of the track, which should be decisive.
The Mercedes drove into the depot a round later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton port forwarded after some action side-on-side which meant that the Ferrari driver had to accidentally leave the inside in danger of not being able to defend at the third corner.
Max Verstappen started, on his 21st birthday, on the back row and was in seventh place at the end of the first round.
After that, he led much of the race as he went for a quick finish with the goal of running past Kimi Raikkonen who was in fourth place.
He entered the depot in the 44th round, but failed to increase speed in the last eight rounds while Raikkonen took fourth place.
It's a difficult day, because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend, and was a real gentleman who let me by.
The team has done an exceptional job that has both first and second," Hamilton said.
It was really bad body language
President Donald Trump made fun of Senator Dianne Feinstein at an election meeting Saturday because of her insistence that she did not paint the letter from Christine Blasey Ford in which she accuses Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
During a speech at an election rally in West Virginia, the president did not mention the testimony Ford had given to the Senate Commission directly, but rather commented that what was going on in the Senate showed that people were "ugly and ugly and spoke falsely".
"The only thing that can happen, and the beautiful thing that has happened in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and mean and unpleasant and talking untrue," he said.
"When you look at publications and leaks and then say, 'Oh, I didn't.
I didn't."
Remember you?
Dianne Feinstein, did you fix it?
Do you remember her answer... did you make the document - "oh, eh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't make it."
Wait a moment.
Let's... No, we didn't paint it," he added, mimicking the senator.
Feinstein received the letter detailing Ford's indictment of Kavanaugh in July, and it became playful earlier in September - but Feinstein denied the leak came from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I didn't make her story," Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
"She asked me to keep it confidential, and I kept it confidential, as she asked."
But her denial did not fall to the President, who commented on it at Saturday's election meeting: "I tell you, it was really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen."
While continuing to defend the Supreme Court nominee, who has been charged with sexual misconduct by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats use the charges for their own gain.
"They are determined to regain power in all ways they see necessary.
You see the badness, the cowardice, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to run over to get power and control," the president said, according to Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars - Belfast Giants (5-3)
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The stars from Dundee compensated for the loss to the Belfast Giants on Friday by winning the return match 5-3 on Saturday.
The Giants received a two-goal lead early due to attacks by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie offset before Dwyer once again sent the Giants into hiring.
Francois Bouchard offset for Dundee before two goals by Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory.
It was the third loss in the league this season for the boys of Adam Keefe, who beat Dundee 2–1 in Belfast on Friday.
This was the fourth meeting between the teams this season, where the Giants have won the last three games.
Dwyer's opening came in the fourth minute after an assist from Kendall McFaull, and David Rutherford served an assist to Beauvillier who doubled the lead four minutes later.
In what was a busy opening period, Sullivan re-entered the home team in the game in the 14th minute, before Matt Marquardt ensured Cownie's equalization in the 16th minute.
Dwyer ensured that the Giants took the lead into pause as he scored his second goal for the evening on the first-round tamper.
The home team regrouped, and Bouchard once again sought a tie with a brilliant goal after 27 played minutes.
Late in the second half, Cownie and Charles Corcoran collaborated to help Nielsen secure the lead for the first time in the match. He, in turn, secured the victory with the team's fifth goal halfway through the final half.
The Giants, who have now lost four of the last five games, face Milton Keynes at home in the next game, which is on Friday.
Air traffic controller loses his life to ensure hundreds of planes escape from earthquakes
A flight attendant in Indonesia is hailed as a hero after he lost his life in what he continues to ensure that a plane with several hundred passengers got safely into the air.
More than 800 people have lost their lives and many are missing after a large earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi and triggered a tsunami on Friday.
Strong aftershocks continue to disrupt the area, and many are trapped in debris in the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues fleeing for life, Anthonius Gunawan Agung (21) refused to leave his post in the control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu, although it swung wildly.
He stayed back to make sure the plane standing on the runway, Batik Air Flight 6321, took off safely.
He then jumped down from the control tower when he thought it collapsed.
He later died in the hospital.
The spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, ABC News Australia reported.
We sent a helicopter from Balikpapan, Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in a larger city.
Unfortunately, he passed away this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"This is heartbreaking," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities are afraid that the number of deaths will increase to thousands, while the country's crisis relief agency says access to the small towns of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The number of deaths is increasing while we find bodies trapped under buildings. Many of them we can't reach," said agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves of up to six meters have destroyed Palu, which is scheduled to hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Emergency aid comes in with military and commercial aircraft.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance comes with several bodies.
It is difficult to find clean water.
The small shops have been robbed."
Jan Gelfand, the leader of the Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN, "The Indonesian Red Cross is struggling to help the survivors, but we don't know what they will find when they arrive.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse."
The President of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, came to Palu on Sunday and told the military in the country: "I ask all of you to work around the clock to do everything you can to help with the evacuation.
Are they ready?” reported CNN.
Indonesia was hit by an earthquake earlier this year in Lombok, killing 550 people.
Flight crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now reports man missing after lagoon plane crash
The airline operating a plane that crashed into a lagoon in Micronesia in the Pacific reports that a man is missing, having previously stated that all 47 of the passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the plane before it sank.
Air Niugini stated that as of Saturday afternoon they do not know where the male passenger is.
The airline said they are working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not provide more details about the passenger, and his age and nationality are unknown.
Local boat owners helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water as it attempted to land at the airport on Chuuk Island.
Authorities said on Friday that seven people had been sent to hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday, and all were in stable condition.
It is still unknown what caused the crash and what actually happened.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon not far from the runway.
Some witnesses believed the plane flew past the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was very low.
"It was extremely good," Jaynes said.
Jaynes added that he and other passengers managed to water through the water, which reached them to life, to the emergency exits of the plane before it sank.
He said the flight crew were panicking and screaming, and he suffered a head injury that was not serious.
The U.S. Navy said nearby sailors, working to improve a dock, also rescued passengers with a rubber boat that they used to carry passengers to land before the plane sank about 30 meters.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network website shows that 111 people have died in crashes of PNG-registered airlines' aircraft in the last 20 years, but none of them flew with Air Niugini.
Analysts create timeline overnight when woman was burned alive
The prosecution presented all evidence on Saturday during the appeal trial for a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for several hours as an expert witness in intelligence analysis.
He presented to the jury how he puzzled recordings from mobile phones to find out what happened the night when Jessica Chambers (19) was killed by the defendant, Quinton Tellis (29).
According to The Clarion Ledger newspaper, Rowlett told that he used location data from several mobile phones showing that Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, in contrast to what Tellis explained earlier.
When the location data showed that Tellis' mobile phone was with Chambers' mobile at the same time as he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and said he was out of town that day.
When the plaintiff asked Tellis if he was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford said he "lied, because my car was in Nashville."
Another contradiction was that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
But their cell phone bills showed that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that a while after Chambers died, Tellis deleted messages, calls, and Chambers' contact information from his mobile phone.
"He erased her from her life," Hale said.
The defense is expected to close the case on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the trial will go to the jury later that day.
The High Avla What is conscious hip hop?
A hip hop trio will challenge the music genre's negative reputation by filling their music with positive thoughts.
The High Breed of Bristol, England, says hip hop has moved away from the original political thought of tackling problems in society.
They will go back to hip hop's roots and make the conscious version of the genre popular again.
Artists The Fugees of Common have become more popular again in the UK through artists Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
New York babysitter sues couple for being fired after "racist" text message
A New York babysitter sues a couple for firing her based on discrimination after she received an erroneous text message from her mother complaining that she was "another black person."
The couple has denied that they are racist, and compared the lawsuit to "extortion."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two, was dissatisfied when she saw that the babysitter she had appointed, Giselle Maurice, was black when she got to work for the first time in 2016.
"NEEEEEEEEEEEEEEI, ENDA A BLACK PERSON," Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a text message to her husband.
But instead of sending the message to her husband, she sent it to babysitter Maurice, twice.
After realizing her mistake, the inappropriate Plasco-Flaxman fired babysitter Maurice, saying that the former babysitter, who was African-American, had done a bad job, so now she wanted someone from the Philippines, according to The New York Post.
Maurice was paid for one day's work before sending her home in an Uber.
Now, Maurice sues the couple for compensation for having fired her, and she wants $350 a day for six months for the job she would have had, even if it was without a contract, where she would live with her family.
"I want to show them that it's not okay to do that," she told The New York Post on Friday, adding, "I know there's discrimination."
The couple have denied that they are racists, saying that firing Maurice was the only thing they could do after insulting her, because they were afraid she would take revenge.
"My wife had sent something to her that she didn't mean to say.
She is not a racist.
We are not racists," husband Joel Plasco told The New York Post.
"But would you let someone you have offended take care of your children, even if you didn't mean to offend them?
Your newborn baby?
Think about it.”
Plasco compared the lawsuit to "extortion," saying that his wife was seven months pregnant and was in a "very difficult situation."
"Are you really going to attack a person in such a situation?
It's not a nice thing to do," said investor Plasco.
As the case progresses, the public has been quick to judge the couple on social media, criticizing them for their behavior and logic.
The publisher behind the Paddington books was afraid that people would not like a talking bear, reveals new letter
The daughter of author Michael Bond, who was born shortly after the approval of the first book, commented: "It's hard to imagine what it was like to read the book for the first time, before it was published.
It's very fun to know now how successful Paddington became."
Jankel said her father, who worked as a cameraman for the BBC before being inspired to write the children's book about the little teddy bear, would be optimistic even if the book had been rejected. She added that she had mixed feelings during the book's 60th anniversary, because her father died last year.
As for Paddington, whom she described as "a very important member of the family," she added that her father was confident in the inside of how great success he made.
"He was a pretty quiet man, and he never screamed," she said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having children who achieved something: you'll be proud of them even if it's not really you who's behind it.
I think he looked at Paddington's success that way.
Although it was his creation and imagination, he always gave all praise to Paddington himself."
My daughter was going to die and I had to say goodbye on the phone
When she landed, her daughter was taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice in a hurry, where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"Nad called regularly to say it was really bad, that they didn't think she was going to make it," said Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then Nad called to say that she was going to die within the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, dear.
I will come soon to be with you.
I'm coming soon.
The medications the doctors had given her to keep her heart pumping were slowly coming out of her system.
She had already died and now the body was turning off.
I just sat there, knowing this happened.
I couldn't sit or scream, because I was in a room surrounded by families and people.
I really had to keep everything inside."
Eventually, Ednan-Laperouse, now grieving over the loss of her daughter, had to board the plane along with other passengers who had no idea what she had just been through.
"No one knew anything," she said.
"I sat with my head bent while the tears fell."
It's hard to explain, but it was on the plane that I knew how much sympathy I had for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Grieving women hang patches on bridge to prevent suicide
Two women who lost their loved ones who committed suicide try to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have attached patches on a bridge in Wales to inspire and get people thinking of committing suicide to change their minds and call the numbers on the patches.
Davis' son Tyler was 13 years old when he began struggling with depression and took his life when he was 18.
"I don't want any parents to feel the way I feel every day."
Davis, who is 45 years old and lives in Lydney, said her son was a talented cook with a smile that infected.
"Everyone knew him because of his smile.
They said his smile illuminated every room."
But before he died, he quit work, for he was in a "really dark place."
In 2014, Tyler’s 11-year-old brother was the first to find Tyler after he took his own life.
Davis said, "I'm still concerned that my little brother may have been affected by Tyler's death."
Davis wrote the notes "to let people know that there are other people out there who care and with whom they can talk, even if it's a friend.
Don’t sit there alone – you need to talk to someone.”
Humphreys, who has been Davis' friend for many years, lost her partner Mark after they had been together for 15 years and he had recently lost his mother.
"He never told me he was sad or depressed or anything," she said.
"A few days before Christmas we noticed that he started behaving differently.
He was in the basement emotionally on Christmas Day 1, when the children opened their gifts he didn't even look at them."
She said that his death was very traumatic for the children, and they continued to work through the trauma: "There is a big gap in our family now.
We are completely destroyed.
But we all have to fight to live on."

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in a thin thread while FBI starts investigation
"I thought that if we actually got something similar to what he's asking for - a limited investigation - then maybe we could achieve some loneliness," Flake said on Saturday, adding that he is afraid the committee "collapses" amid a partisan backlash.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
They hesitate because of the timing.
The midterm elections in the United States are only five weeks away, on November 6, and if Republicans do not do it well, this will make it difficult for them to elect Kavanaugh to the U.S. Supreme Court.
George W. Bush has called senators to get them to support Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Bush and was introduced to his wife Ashley in that way, then having been Bush's secretary.
What happens when the FBI presents its report?
They are going to vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats sit.
It is still unclear if Kavanaugh is able to gather at least 50 votes in the Senate. With 50 votes, Mike Pensa, the vice president of the United States, can give him the last vote and confirm him in the Supreme Court.
The number of jumpers in North Korea "goes down" under Kim
The number of North Korean jumpers to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, reports a South Korean lawmaker
Park Byeong-seug referred to data from the South Korean Ministry of Unity, saying there were 1,127 jumpers last year – compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park said that stricter borders between North Korea and China and more expensive smuggling charges are the main reasons why the number has fallen.
Pyongyang has not spoken publicly.
The vast majority of North Korean renegades receive South Korean citizenship.
Seoul reports that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most fled via China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the strictly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Korean countries.
China views repatriates as illegal immigrants and not as refugees, often sending them back by force.
Relations between North and South Korea – which are purely technically still at war – have improved in recent months.
This month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to negotiate the disarmament of nuclear weapons.
These conversations come after the historic June meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed to work for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the United States of not achieving anything since then.
"Without being able to trust the United States, we cannot trust that our country is safe, and in such a situation we cannot disarm our weapons first," Ri said in a speech to the UN's General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical," saying he can't serve in Supreme Court
Minority leader Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh, who is nominated for the Supreme Court, "hysterical" and said he has too much temperament to serve in the U.S. Supreme Court.
Pelosi called Kavanaugh "hysterical" in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas, on Saturday.
"I know that if a woman had behaved that way, she would have been called 'hysterical,'" Pelosi said of Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate court on Thursday.
Kavanaugh was emotional and denied all charges that he sexually harassed Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
In Kavanaugh's opening speech, he was very emotional and sometimes shouted with lumps in his throat while telling about his family and the years onwards.
He criticized the Democrats on the committee, calling the charges against him "grotesque and a planned assassination of his reputation," organized by liberal policemen angry that Hillary Clinton did not win the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi added that she believes Kavanaugh's testimony proves that he cannot serve in the Supreme Court, because it shows that he is prejudiced against Democrats.
"I think the way he behaved disqualifies him, and what he said about the Clinton family and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi made an objection when asked if she would try to get Kavanaugh to resign if he is elected to the Supreme Court, and if the Democrats achieve a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I can say this – if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he can't serve in the Supreme Court, nor in the court he serves now," Pelosi added.
Kavanaugh is a judge in Washington D.C.'s Federal Court of Appeals.
Pelosi also said that as a Democrat, she is concerned about potential judges from Kavanaugh against the law known as Obamacare and the case of Roe vs. Wade, because Kavanaugh is known to be a conservative judge.
In the hearings to confirm Kavanaugh, he avoided answering questions about whether he would reverse certain decisions in the Supreme Court.
"It's not the right time for a hysterical, prejudiced person in the Supreme Court to expect us to say he's great," Pelosi said.
And women must swing the sword
It is a just, bitter criticism, after months and years of rage, and she does not get it out without crying.
“We cried when we were angry,” Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's unusual, do you?"
She continues, "I got a lot of help from a woman in a high company position, who said she branched when she was angry, but developed a technique where she said to the person who made her so angry that she branched, "You might think I'm sorry because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then she just keeps going.
I think it was brilliant.
Tears serve as a way to get your mind out, but that's what many misunderstand.
In one of my strongest memories from a previous job, where most of my colleagues were men, I was in a situation where I branched out of anger, and a woman who was older than me took me in the neck – she was a cold leader that I had always been afraid of – and pulled me out at the same time.
"Never let them see you cry," she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sorry and that they watered because they made you cry."
Patricia Schroeder, who at the time was a congresswoman, a Democrat from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, Hart was caught cheating on a boat called Monkey Business, and withdrew from the campaign. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, thought she could as well stand for election as the president himself.
"I hadn't really thought through it well enough," she told me while laughing, 30 years later.
"Already there were seven other candidates running for office, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called the situation "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.""
Since the campaign had already been going on for a while, she hadn't raised enough money, so she promised that she would only shut down if she could raise $2 million.
It was impossible.
She discovered that her supporters who gave $1000 to men only gave her $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" she asked.
When she declared that she was not going to run for office anyway, she was so emotional and full of gratitude to those who had supported her, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to raise money and target the voters instead of the delegates, and anger at gender discrimination, that she began to cry.
"You should have thought I had a nervous breakdown," Schroeder said of how the press reacted when she branched.
"You should have thought that Kleenex was my main sponsor.
I remember thinking, what are they going to write on my gravestone?
"What branch?"
How the U.S.-China trade war could be good for Beijing
The opening ointments of the U.S.-China trade war were eerie, and while the battle continued, a rift between the two countries could be an advantage for Beijing in the long run, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump fired his first shot this year taxing important Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The battle escalated this week, with tariffs on items worth over $200 billion, which in effect means half of all goods from China to the United States being taxed.
Beijing has retaliated and imposed tariffs of between five and ten percent on US goods worth $60 billion.
China has promised to answer the United States for every shot they fire, and the second-largest economy in the world is most likely not going down with the first.
To get Washington to quit, China must do as the United States wants, but bowing to the United States is too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the President of China.
Nonetheless, experts say that if Beijing keeps its head cold, American pressure can have a positive effect on the Chinese economy in the long term, by reducing the degree of dependence between the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing can cause both economies to collapse is more dangerous than people have dared to admit in the past," said Abigail Grace, a researcher who focuses on Asia at the Center for American Security, a think tank.
Syria 'ready' for return of refugees, says Foreign Minister
Syria says they are ready to accept refugees who will return voluntarily, asking for help to rebuild the country that has been destroyed after more than seven years of war.
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that conditions in the country are making progress.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and safe, thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists to regain normal areas.
All preconditions are now in place for refugees to be able to voluntarily return to the country they had to travel to due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures that went beyond daily life and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
An additional six million people in the country need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian government is happy to accept help to rebuild the destroyed country.
But he emphasized that they will not accept assistance or assistance with terms from countries that sponsored the uprising.
Europe secures at Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup as they defeated the American team with a final score of 16.5 vs 10.5 in Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost on European soil six times in a row, and they have not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe took back the crown in that team of the Danish captain, Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn, reaching the 14.5 points they needed to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who fought most of the tournament, defeated the ball in the water from the tee at hole 16, pair 3, thus giving the victory to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari did well in all his rounds and became one of four players who have ever won 5-0-0 since the tournament began its current format in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was knocked out 5&4 by the player with the lowest ranking on the European team, Danish Thorbj<0xC3><0xB8>rn Olesen.
Dustin Johnson, with the world's highest rank, became 2 and 1 after English Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
Spanish veteran Sergio Garcia, who has participated in eight Ryder Cupars, became the most successful European with 25.5 points in his career.
"Usually I don't cry, but today I can't help it.
It has been a tough year.
So grateful that Thomas chose me and believes in me.
I'm so, so happy to get the trophy back.
It's about the team, and I'm glad I could help," said an emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He passes the relay stick on to fellow countryman John Ram, who defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in singles games on Sunday.
"I feel a tremendous pride in beating Tiger Woods, I grew up looking at him," said Rahm (23).
Woods lost all four of his games in France, and now has a 13-21-3 standings in the Ryder Cup up through his career.
A remarkable statistic from one of the world's best players, who has won 14 major titles and has only been beaten by Jack Nicklaus.
The American team struggled to find the fairway all weekend, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who impressed with high-level golf throughout the tournament.
Jim Furyk, the American captain, commented after a disappointing performance from his team. "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
There were periods this morning where we made it hot for Europe.
Slaughter me.
Hat off to Thomas.
He is a unique captain
All of his 12 players played very well.
We're going to regroup, I'm going to work with the PGA in America and our committee for the Ryder Cup and move on.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be a captain.
You have to take off your hat.
We got rounded up."
