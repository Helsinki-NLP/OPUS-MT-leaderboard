Inflation in Europe jumps because of food
Accelerating inflation measured in the euro area is mainly due to steady increases in food prices.
Price growth in November in 13 eurozone countries was higher than expected, up from 2.6 per cent in October with an annual inflation rate of 3.1 per cent, the Luxembourg Statistical Office of the Union said.
The official forecast was only 3 percent, Bloomberg said.
Unlike the U.S., British and Canadian issuing banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not lowered the basic interest rate, with the fall along with rising commodity prices and falling unemployment leading to an inflation spiral.
The ECB would like to keep the inflation rate below 2%, but close to them.
According to one of the analysts, the ECB is in an absurd situation: it has to "advertise" inflation so that it does not have to do anything about it later.
In Germany, November inflation represents a record 3.3 per cent for 15 years, while in Spain it rose from 3.6 per cent to 4.1 per cent.
Inflation in the euro area has erupted upwards due to sharply rising food and energy prices.
The futures prices of wheat rose by 88 percent, and the price of soybeans reached its highest value since 1973.
Similarly, in 2007 it was necessary to pay significantly more for edible oil and dairy products.
The price of oil in the world markets this year rose by 52 percent and last month already cost one barrel of black gold nearly $ 100.
According to the ECB, inflation will jump in 2008 from 2.1 percent this year to 2.5, but in 2009 it will already fall to 1.9.
According to analysts, the level of 12-month inflation in the next 3-4 months will remain at approximately 3%, but its average annual rate will be 2.1%.
At the same time, they expect the ECB to cut interest rates twice as soon as possible during 2008.
Gallup sees a government crisis
After a prolonged stagnation at the beginning of December, Fidesz’s support group has grown considerably and now has the largest camp since 2002, while in the case of the Socialists, the Gallup Institute has never measured such low - 13% support.
In the case of certain party voters, the difference - due to the greater determination of the opposition voters - would represent more than two-thirds (71 percent) of the support compared to the five-percent support of the MSZP.
The MDF and SZDSZ are below the threshold for entry into parliament: their support within the entire population is 2%.
Among certain party voters, supporters of both camps are one percent more.
The public's view of the economy has deteriorated even in view of the previous low - the ratio of those who consider the country's economic situation to be very bad has never been so high - 41 percent, while according to the other 46 percent, the situation is quite bad.
Families now assess the change in their material situation more pessimistically after the spring and summer hopeful prospects.
As for next year, the majority of the population expects further deterioration and only a tenth to improve.
In December, 71 percent of respondents, the most of all Gallup’s surveys to date, said the prime minister was doing his job badly rather than well.
Ferenci believes Gyurcsány or very much believes 13 percent of respondents, while Viktor Orbán has a share of supporters of 38 percent.
54% do not trust the prime minister, 27% do not trust the president of the Fidesz movement.
One of the indicators of the development of the political situation is how much of the public believes that dissatisfaction with the prime minister can be addressed without a change of government.
While after last October’s riots, the government and prime minister’s retention was considered desirable by 35 percent, today this share is only 20 percent, with a relative majority (33 percent) seeing solutions only in the running for new elections.
It is typical for the interest in the referendum that 60 percent of respondents responded to a question about their possible participation that the referendum would certainly take place, and another 20 percent reported that it would likely take place.
In comparison, only 55 percent would take part in the "parliamentary elections held this Sunday" and another 15 percent would consider their participation to be probable. The success of the referendum would be undoubtedly based on current intentions.
He would say no to 74, doctor fees 79, and hospital stay fees 84 percent.
If we look at the same shares only in the circle of people who certainly promise their participation, then the introduction of school fees, doctor fees and hospital stay fees would be rejected by 81, 84 and 89 percent.
The most expensive is Auchan, nearly a fifth of Tesco
Hypermarkets in the Budaörs trading triangle maintained last year’s, an average 16% increase in the price level, with the difference that there was no VAT increase this year.
Article from Napi Gazdaság
The usual Christmas shopping basket of Napi Gazdaság in the Budaörs trading triangle rose on average by 16 percent this year, but in all hypermarkets, the price showed an increase of just over a thousand forints.
Since prices in supermarkets "flyed off" in December last year, the percentage did not show such a drastic upswing due to the previous high base.
But it is certainly a pity for consumers that what they could safely buy last year at a price of less than nine thousand forints, they will not order now for ten thousand.
The daily consumption basket in the surveyed hypermarkets exceeded the psychological limit of ten thousand forints by at least 91 forints.
The highest price of the basket was 10,573 forints.
(In 2003, the consumer basket cost 6,800 forints.)
The price of Unica and live fish remained almost at last year's level, but it was very expensive for cruel breasts, nuts and also poppy.
The prices of bread and flour corresponded to the data of the Central Statistical Office, although in Auchan we found a kilogram of bread for 139 forints.
The competition did not go with the price of the product under 200 forints.
It was also surprising in this store that the price of a two-liter Coca-Cola in a return bottle was below 200 forints, so even with an advance, the product cost only 257 forints.
However, this year, according to Napi Gazdaság Auchan’s consumer basket, it was the most expensive, while Cora was the cheapest.
According to our calculations, prices in the Napi Gazdaság consumer basket raised Cora by 15 per cent compared to Christmas last year, while Tesco and Auchan raised them by about 18 per cent.
When comparing last year’s highest and this year’s lowest consumer basket values, the difference was 12 percent, while growth between last year’s lowest and this year’s highest is 21 percent.
In forints, there was an average increase of 1,480.
The average increase in prices last year was 1,206 forints, with prices on Christmas last year being influenced by the rise in VAT.
It was this process that disrupted the trade, the merchants were obviously unable to decide how large the price range to determine for each product, since they could not predict the impact of the change in prices on consumption.
(If the trader misplanes the speed of circulation of a given product, a significant profit may be lost due to the price range adjusted to the intensity of circulation.)
Due to VAT, Napi Gazdaság’s consumer basket price rise last year was so extreme that the price of the most expensive basket was 1,720 forints higher than in 2006, while the cheapest was the price difference of 844 forints worldwide.
This year there was no extreme difference, the most expensive basket now cost 1,630 forints more than last year, and the cheapest also increased by 1,284 forints.
When comparing the two Christmas seasons, a disastrous rise in prices has emerged, with daily consumer goods in hypermarkets rising by more than 30 percent in less than 20 months.
(This, among other things, is not completely confirmed by the data of the Central Statistical Office: it measured a price increase of more than 30 percent over 12 months in the case of several basic foods.
In addition to flour, for example, in the case of eggs.)
In the latter case, however, according to the Consumer Basket of the Daily Economy, this seems almost impossible, since the price level of the product, which was already quite expensive last year, showed a price increase of barely more than 10 percent due to the basis, even in the worst case.
Meal suppliers seem to be in a stronger position than egg suppliers, with drastic price increases even in international chains.
Hypermarkets in the trading gold triangle are not complaining, they are still talking about a good year.
In our experience, most customers are no longer interested in prices in the three stores they visit.
They buy everything by the quantum, durable food takes after wages.
On Wednesday morning, all three supermarkets were lined up at the cash registers, as the number of visitors grew sharply.
However, as we know, turnover is lower in rural areas, several international chains are complaining to research firms that sales are lagging behind their plans, not only in the case of food, but also in the case of durable consumer goods.
In many places, it saves on disinfectants
This year, more than a thousand cases of infection have been registered in hospitals, mainly due to the inappropriate use of antibiotics.
The hygienic conditions of hospitals, overcrowding of beds, overload of staff stopping diseases do not help, says the Mayor of the National Epidemiological Center.
In many places, disinfectants are also saved.
Recently, MRSA infection was diagnosed in the trauma department of St. John’s Hospital.
Bacteria resistant to antibiotics were found in a man who was hospitalized after a serious car accident.
The patient was isolated.
A similar infection occurred in the same place at the beginning of the year.
A patient injured in a serious car accident was released home, but not long afterwards he had to return with MRSA infection and because of the bacteria in his body, one important operation could not be performed.
As of December 10, 1,094 hospital infections caused by multidrug-resistant pathogens have been reported to the National Nesocomialis Surveillance System, said Karolina Böröczová, Mayor of the National Epidemiological Center.
This means that so many infections caused by multidrug-resistant pathogens have been registered in hospitals with certainty, others are not known.
Nearly two-thirds (683) of infections were caused by MRSA, or methicillin-oxacillin resistant gold staphylococcus.
Staphylococcus aureus (SA) is carried by one-third of people in the nose without causing the disease.
Infections caused by SA (e.g. throat inflammation, tonsillitis, skin infections, morning infections) respond well to antibiotics and can be treated well.
However, if the antibiotic is given excessively or inappropriately, it develops from a bacterium that responds well to antibiotics, a bacterium that is very resistant to antibiotics and that spreads rapidly in inappropriate hospital conditions.
Especially in the case of temporary or permanent malfunction of the immune system in patients with a weakened body, low body weight or in patients in years can cause serious hospital infections, for example, morning infection or blood poisoning - sepsis.
According to St. John’s Hospital’s top doctor, there is nothing special about MRSA infection, similar infections are part of daily practice in hospitals.
"Infection should not be confused with epidemic, MRSA is not just there," said Tibor Nyulasi, "where the presence of the disease is not being investigated."
Resistant to antibiotics
“We are isolating these patients, treating them in rubber gloves and masks, and we have the necessary antibiotics to treat them,” said Tibor Nyulasi.
Patients admitted to the hospital are first examined to see if MRSA is present in their body, but infection cannot always be avoided.
Sampling is not in fashion
The vast majority of hospital infections caused by MRSA could be prevented, but current conditions and conditions in home hospitals are not favorable for preventing the emergence and spread of multidrug-resistant pathogens, says Karolina Böröczová.
Because this infection occurs typically in hospitals and nursing homes, hospitals should monitor patients admitted and isolate MRSA carriers immediately.
However, the collection of microbiological samples in Hungarian hospitals is not in fashion.
It also plays a role in the fact that the National Health Insurance Fund does not fund these examinations.
The majority of cases are detected if the patient suffers from a perceptible MRSA infection, said the mayor of the epidemiological center.
The European Union has strict recommendations for the appropriate treatment of antibiotics in the field of human medicine and there are also domestic directives for the treatment of individual infections, diseases.
Efforts should be made to ensure that antibiotic therapy is targeted, or microbiological testing should be carried out to prevent the development of drug resistance, but even hospitals do not comply with this in all cases.
Microbiological sampling is even rarer in primary and outpatient treatment of patients, Karolina Böröczová said.
Savings on disinfectants
According to scientific evidence, MRSA spreads among patients most often through healthcare professionals.
Therefore, hand washing and the use of gloves and masks play a very important role, but even in this there are serious shortcomings in hospitals.
MRSA is transmitted by droplet infection and touch, but it is not always possible to isolate infected patients in the conditions of home hospitals.
On the contrary, the rooms are often crowded, the beds are often very close to each other, although from an epidemiological point of view, patients should be at least 1.5 meters away from each other.
As Karolina Böröczová pointed out, unfortunately, we can also see that in hospitals in a materially disadvantaged situation, disinfectants are saved, there are few nurses and many patients, which increases the chance of infection.
According to Karolina Böröcz, where the necessary protective measures are observed, similar infections are demonstrably less or the further spread of the cause of the disease can be stopped.
Government Program Against MRSA
Treatment of MRSA is a huge expense for health insurance companies and is being fought against everywhere.
For example, in England, the government has written a program to prevent MRSA, or to reduce its incidence.
The program appears to be successful, according to published data, MRSA infections in England are showing a decreasing trend.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) ranks prevention of multi-resistance pathogens (including MRSA) and hospital infections caused by these pathogens among its priorities.
The police captain who caused the fatal accident was not drunk.
The official expert opinion on the case of the police captain of the XXII district who caused the fatal accident is complete.
It can be ruled out that the police captain of the XXII district, who executed a pedestrian on Tuesday and who in the meantime resigned from his position, would be driving under the influence of alcohol or narcotic drugs, a spokesman for the Attila Morvai High Prosecutor's Office said on Friday after the incident was completed.
The expert opinion confirmed the result of the initial investigation, which had already found that the former police captain had not drunk any alcohol before driving.
The then head of the XXII district police department collided on Tuesday in Lajose Kossuth Street in the XXII district with his own passenger car while turning a fifty-year-old man who stepped in front of him while crossing the highway outside a marked crossing.
(The fact that the pedestrian was walking outside the zebra, by the way, according to the rules of road traffic is not an alleviating circumstance, the turning car must still give preference.)
After being taken to the hospital, the pedestrian died.
Due to these incidents, the district police director resigned and requested a transfer, according to police reports, because he was so shaken by the case.
The case is being investigated by the Budapest State Prosecutor’s Office.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former police captain had been cooperating with state prosecutors conducting investigations from the outset.
Another <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>400 million for infrastructure
On Friday, Finance Minister János Veres and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB), signed an agreement on three loan frameworks worth a total of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>400 million to support education, transport and environmental infrastructure as well as energy.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) approved a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>300 million framework for the Hungarian budgetary financing of transport and environmental projects implemented through the Cohesion Fund, with the parties already concluding a loan agreement for the amount of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million, now signed from the <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>200 million used.
A <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>150 million loan agreement is also used to budget projects related to education.
The EIB has approved a total of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>300 million for Hungary for this purpose, the remaining <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>150 million may be used later, with the extension of the loan agreement.
In the area of innovation, the parties have signed a contract of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>50 million, which the budget will mainly use for the research and development project of the University of Debrecen.
There was also talk of the 4th subway route.
The parties agreed that once Hungary agrees with the EU on the details of the financing of the subway, they will return to whether and how the original contract should be modified.
According to János Veres, this could happen in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed a total of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>8.4 billion for 113 projects in Hungary.
The interest on loans granted by the EIB with an eight-year waiting period and without a commission obligation shall be linked to the EURIBOR rate.
Bulgaria is an EU real estate paradise
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is astounding - the attention of the whole of Europe is turned to the previously somewhat neglected Balkan country.
What, where and who buys on the yet-to-be-cheapest, but fast-growing EU market?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
The most sought-after Eastern European real estate purchase destination is now undoubtedly Bulgaria with its cheap ski apartments and houses on the seashore.
The mountains are most in the course of the area of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosha, on the sea coast Albena, Golden Sands, Sunny Coast, the ancient cities of Sozopol and Nesebar, but more and more people are also looking for properties near Kavarna and Balchik.
According to analysts from Re/Max Bulgaria, sooner or later the central part of the country - for example Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna - will arouse the interest of investors, and more and more interested buyers will also be in the vicinity of the low-cost city of Ruse.
Also, the capital city of Sofia is a promise of attractive opportunities, business and office space promise the highest return.
Bulgaria is on its way to becoming one of the most attractive golf paradises in Europe, becoming, alongside the summer and winter seasons, a sought-after destination for the next two seasons.
Foreseeable investors are already buying in large quantities, for example in the vicinity of Banska.
According to analysts, real estate buyers in Bulgaria are trying to change their lives and lifestyles at the same time.
Most customers come from England, but also from France, Belgium, Spain and more often also from Romania.
There are also Maltese and Cypriot investors, and there are traditionally many Russian customers in the Black Sea and ski paradises.
Foreign buyers are divided into three groups, says Georgiy Jankov, regional director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
The settlers buy either renovated properties worth 50-100 thousand euros or decayed old houses for 5-15 thousand euros, which they then renovate.
They require good accessibility and communication options, the proximity of a large city, shops and, as a rule, a local doctor is important for them.
The second category is chat shoppers (Bulgaria ranked among the top 10 German holiday destinations in December).
The third group is made up of commercial investors who buy in the hope of an increase in value in the medium- to long-term.
The auction of real estate in the capital is continuous, as demand is growing stronger.
Bulgaria has the lowest real estate prices in the European Union, but has grown by 21% annually over the past five years.
The increase in real estate prices far exceeds wage growth.
Fodor and Hungarian 6%
According to the Minister of Environment and Water, Gábor Fodor, the meeting of experts will be concluded on Tuesday and after the official opening of the international conference on the climate regime after 2012, the negotiations will continue with the ministers.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries are negotiating the Bali Roadmap, which addresses the efforts following the Kyoto Protocol’s 2012 emission reduction period.
At the moment, there is a tumultuous debate between developing and developed countries about them.
The United States has also announced that it is now reluctant to negotiate exact figures, although it is inclined to agree to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40 percent by 2020 compared to 1990.
Another big question at the conference is whether, in addition to reducing emissions, developed countries will also agree to provide both material and technological assistance to countries that rely on it.
The agreement also gave rise to subsidies for developing countries.
The subsidy fund, set out in the Kyoto Protocol, will be managed by a 16-member governing board, most likely within the framework of the World Environment Programme (GEF) at the UN - we can read in the journal Piac és Profit.
6% of Hungarians
On behalf of Hungary, the Minister of Environment and Water, Gábor Fodor, supports the EU's efforts to maintain its leadership in the global climate protection efforts and to contribute to the creation of a new international agreement by 2009.
The minister said the EU is committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent from 1990 levels by 2020, regardless of the success of the "post-2012 agreement", and is ready to commit to up to 30 percent reductions if other developed regions of the world, respectively, are to respond.
Gábor Fodor pointed out that the countries that acceded to the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 were aiming for a 5.2 per cent reduction, with the then 15 EU Member States committing to 8 per cent.
Hungary's commitment is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6% compared to 1985-87, which our country will fulfill. - recalls the press release of the Ministry of the Environment.
In Bali, it is a lot, because within two years, the UN needs to adopt an international agreement on a long-term climate change policy, otherwise its entry into force would certainly be postponed until 2012. In this case, the UN would not immediately commit to the reduction commitments set by the Kyoto Protocol to the new system of reduction of emissions.
This would lead to a delay in reducing emissions and an inevitable increase in the average temperature on Earth by more than 2 degrees Celsius, which, according to scientists, would have extremely serious and irreversible consequences.
The British Army is recruiting on YouTube
British military units are publishing on a video-sharing server footage of events in Iraq and Afghanistan that they are popularizing themselves with.
YouTube was first favored by the British Air Force (RAF): special forces operating in Afghanistan have been recording videos of actions against the Taliban since March 2006.
The footage, taken by a miniature camera attached to a helmet, is checked by the Air Force Command controlling combat operations in the Kandahar area and then sent on to London, where it is transmitted to the Internet.
The political message is unavoidable.
This form has already received 139 recordings of British Air Force soldiers on the Internet and their "channel" has already been viewed by more than 75,000 people.
The British Department of Defense registered in the spring of 2007 as "defenceheadquarters" and is publishing footage from events in Iraq and Afghanistan, while the British Department of Foreign Affairs (Commonwealth Office) and the International Peace Corps in Iraq (MNFI) have their own YouTube channels.
Deployment in Afghanistan
The Air Force released the videos according to their original purpose for recruitment and according to the Ministry of Defense, they are also good to familiarize the general public with the real purpose of the presence of the army abroad.
"Promotion published in this form is almost worthless compared to traditional television recruitment ads," said Gordon Mackenzie, a defense expert at the BBC, "but it necessarily also carries a certain political message, as it confirms in a special form the legitimacy of the military actions decided by the government."
The Americans made the game.
The Army is concerned that, in addition to carefully edited, censored recordings, amateur videos are also sent to the server, capturing, for example, the death of soldiers: in a little hypocritical, "official" promotional films, the officers at most talk about losses, but not blood.
The Internet has already received many videos from the battlefields in Iraq and Afghanistan, which was created during the sharp deployment, but the British army has only come up with them now.
Americans recruit a little differently - using a free-to-download shooting game called America's Army, in which the player can get straight into the soldiers' skins through a more or less faithful simulation.
At the ministries will be Christmas with tombola and pagans
Labour Minister Mónica Lamperth is apparently not sentimental: instead of a Christmas party, she will organize a final working meeting for her colleagues, at which they will say goodbye to pagans and coffee in 2007.
In some ministries there will be a celebration with live music, elsewhere it will enchant the officials with a Christmas atmosphere with a tomboy and a toast.
Party, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and a Swedish table - that's how the powerful have fun.
Government agencies are also preparing for Christmas.
The most expensive ministerial Christmas celebration will be organized by the Ministry of Defense this year, but it is not waiting for its employees.
On Christmas Day, children of fallen soldiers will receive gifts, family members of soldiers currently serving on foreign missions at Mission Christmas guests, but they will also arrange a reception for journalists.
The resort spends $25 million on the atmosphere at the end of the year.
The National Development Agency (NFÜ) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (GKM) throw themselves out of the loop compared to other resorts.
The GKM party is held in the center of Jöv<0xC5><0x91> Háza, for a total of 4,320,000 forints and about three hundred and fifty guests are expected from the six hundred employees of the Ministry.
The resort will stick to its Christmas traditions at its celebration, but there will also be various performances and there will also be a lottery draw.
Christmas NFÜ cost 4,700,000 forints and took place on Wednesday in the State Judiciary Council (OIT) building - concerts and dinner were on the agenda.
The rent of the hall cost a million forints, the rest was spent on more than four hundred guests.
It seems that one department of the NFÜ is invited to another Christmas celebration: here the company that ensures the course of tenders, the Hungarian Centre for Economic Development (MAG) from EU money, organizes.
For this purpose they rented the building of the Vígszínház Theatre.
MAG a. s. has not confirmed this information because we have not been able to reach the relevant person.
There is no need for a suit
The ILO building not only hosted the NFÜ, but also the Ministry of Justice and Security, which organized the St. Lucia Ball on December 7 instead of Christmas.
However, the ILO did not ask for money from him for his use of the halls.
Five hundred people took part in the dance.
The party began with the minister of health, after dinner it was possible to dance with live music.
According to the answer to the question of the portal [origo] at the ball, there were no mandatory evening dresses or suits at all.
The Puritan party is being organised by health, labour and local authorities.
The Ministry of Health is organizing a program and celebration for employees for 400,000 forints in its own building.
Minister of Labour Mónica Lamperth does not even officially invite employees to a Christmas party, but to the final working meeting.
There are one hundred and eighty guests who, according to the press department, will only get coffee and toasts, so the party will only be enough for 350,000 forints.
The Minister of Local Government Gordon Bajnai and his colleagues will simply have a drink in the hall of the Ministry of Local Government and Regional Development.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) is organizing a Christmas meeting, which it expects 436 workers, in its own large hall.
At the Christmas party, he spends 2,500 forints per guest - the total amount includes a reception with Swedish tables and toast.
Since János Veres became Minister, the PM’s staff celebrate Christmas in a similar way every year.
However, the atmosphere of the party will be missing, the officiality is amplified not only by the ministerial speech, but also by the afternoon time of the event.
The farming resort holds a New Year's reception on January 20, ministerial Christmas is not held.
The reception will take place in Vajdahunyadvár Castle in the Municipal Gardens and, according to the Ministry, 1,000 forints per person are allocated for one hundred guests.
According to the press department, this will be a very simple reception, to which only relevant foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary are invited.
These annual receptions start with a short greeting from the minister and end with a small reception.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Culture do not organize a Christmas party at all, the respective press departments told the portal.
The price of the Christmas celebrations of the Department of the Environment in the press department could not be announced.
In any case, four hundred people were invited to the party held at the Museum of Art and Industry.
He is on a giant strike.
The League of Trade Unions (Liga) and the National Union of Workers’ Councils (MOSZ) will form their strike committee on Friday to coordinate Monday’s unlimited strike.
On Saturday, a protest public meeting will be held, on Monday - the day of the final vote on the law on health insurance - work will be stopped.
The action will certainly cause a serious disruption of transport, as railway transport will almost completely stop and employees of the Budapest Transport Company (BKV) will also strike by 1 p.m.
On Friday afternoon, the League Association will brief the National Union of Workers’ Councils on the details of the jointly organized Monday strike.
There will also be a LIGA-MOSZ strike committee, which will coordinate the event on Monday.
A public protest assembly is held on Saturday, and unions joining the strike will stop working indefinitely from Monday unless a deal is reached with the government.
This means that no deadline has been set for the end of the strike, which will start on the day of the parliamentary vote on the Health Insurance Act.
If the parliament does not pass the health insurance law, the unions will immediately withdraw the call for a strike.
However, if the legislation is voted on, the strike committees will meet and decide on the next procedure.
According to the agenda of Monday's meeting, it is also possible that the health insurance law will not be voted on until late in the evening or at night.
Due to the start of the strike on Monday, it is possible to count on serious traffic interruptions: work on the railway will be stopped indefinitely, in the morning part of Budapest's public transport and more than half of the companies Volán can be stopped.
At the same time, in many parts of the country, half of the road will be closed.
Numerous trade unions and civil society organisations have joined the call for strikes, the list of which is constantly updated on the League’s website.
Some organizations announced the strike for an indefinite period, while others announced the temporary suspension of work.
Until Thursday afternoon, the Hungarian State Railways (M<0xC3><0x81>V) and the Independent Trade Union of Railway Employees (VDSZSZ) were unable to agree on sufficient services, with more and more people traveling on the railway at the beginning of the Christmas holidays.
According to the previous announcements, from the start of the operation until 1 p.m., there will be a strike at the BKV, from 7 a.m. to 9 a.m. at the Budapest Airport, a four-hour strike will be organized by the Trade Unions of Workers in the Energy Industry LIGA, to a 2-, and 2-8-hour stop of work, respectively.
The union of Hungarian doctors will strike alternately across the country, the Democratic Union of Health and Social Workers (EDDSZ), belonging to the Cooperation Forum of Trade Unions (SZEF), is organizing a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four demands formulated by the League is that the government withdraw the health insurance reform proposal and submit a new concept for public discussion.
The second requirement is that the new method of counting pensions, effective from next year, be introduced gradually.
Thirdly, in the case of early retirement for the relevant occupations, the possibility of inclusion in the scheme should be ensured before 2010.
The fourth reason for the action is that the Independent Union of Railway Employees (VDSZSZ), which belongs to the League of Trade Unions, does not accept the offer of the Ministry of Economy and Transport relating to the railway branches, and expects a different offer.
Political Capital: The Hungarian Guard increased the risk of the country
The activity of the Hungarian Guard, founded with the support of the Jobbik Magyarországért movement in August this year, according to the Risk Analysis Division of the Political Capital Institute, increased the political risk of Hungary and the entire region in several respects.
The company's "risk alert" states that the greatest political risk in connection with the activities of the Hungarian Guard is that "the concentration of already existing ethnic tensions between the Roma and non-Roma populations of Hungary can occur in a short time, even with violent ethnicity".
The main reason is that the political strategy of the Hungarian Guard is probably aimed at provoking such an action - adds the research institute.
As he writes, all this can be explained by one of the biggest negligence of Hungarian political officials: "The public debate on the Roma issue was left by representatives of public life to representatives of radical and extremist political groups, who could build a political strategy on the Roma-Hungarian contradiction."
This deepens the problem, makes normal dialogue impossible, strengthens extremists and increases the likelihood of violent conflicts - the institute judges.
In addition, the activity of the Hungarian Guard, according to the research institute, due to the great attention of domestic and foreign media, "has greatly distorted the image of Hungary abroad, especially in terms of the belief in the stability of the country and its democratic development".
The Institute recalls: as part of the reorganization of Hungarian radical and ultra-rightist groups, which has been gaining more and more publicity and vehemence since the fall of 2006, it is the fact that in Hungary since the summer of 2007 several organizations have been created, which they call themselves associations of "national defense".
"The common feature of these groups is that they define themselves as civil associations, while openly declaring - even armed - the readiness of their members to perform defensive tasks (in the case of natural disasters, attacks on the homeland, disturbances of the order), in addition to the state, with a reference to the incompetence of the police.
It also notes: all this is done in a way that tries to wrap various political efforts built on the resistance of society to politics and parties in civilian clothes.
The emphasis on civility and the form of the association in the case of these groups therefore serves not only to avoid legal obstacles to judicial registration, but is also a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the activity of the Hungarian Guard is also a risk-increasing factor in terms of neighbourly relations.
“In recent months, they have pointed to the Hungarian Guard as a potential source of danger in several neighbouring countries, and ultra-nationalist political leaders of some neighbouring countries want to apologize for their own counter-Hungarian policy by referring to the creation of the Hungarian Guard.
All this can have an impact on the political stability of the region,” he adds.
According to the research institute, the creation of the Hungarian Guard in Central and Eastern Europe is not a unique phenomenon, so the political risks for the region as a whole have increased.
The activity of the Hungarian Guard is similar, for example, to the activity of the Bulgarian National Guard, whose creation was announced in August 2007 by the ultra-right Bulgarian National Union (BNU).
On the background of the creation of the Bulgarian Guard, there are mass Roma riots that broke out in one of the Sofia neighborhoods (Krasna Poljana).
This was used by the BNU to establish the Guard, with the organization's goal being "national defense".
In the past 17 years, according to her, there has been "Gypsy terror" in Bulgaria, but the state has remained idle and indifferent, according to the Institute of Political Capital.
He adds that the initiative has sparked a tumultuous debate in the Bulgarian public.
The increase in the risk of ethnic clashes signals the announcement by some Bulgarian Roma organizations that they will create their own guard in protest.
Since the current activity of the Hungarian Guard shows similarities with the activity of the Bulgarian National Guard, it is not excluded that the Hungarian Roma react to the threat in a similar way, by establishing their own homeland defense, we can read in the risk warning developed by the Institute of Political Capital.
Attila Juhász, Research Director of the Political Capital Institute: Risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, they issue a risk analysis every year and if they discover anything that could have an impact on the change in risk, they inform public opinion, as in this case by issuing a risk alert.
The holidays are not free everywhere.
In Hungary, the holidays are precisely set by law and it has become a common practice that working days are moved around the holidays, which is expected to happen less often next year.
The holidays are not uniform in the European Union or in the United States.
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes national and national holidays and days of rest.
The days of quiet work are mostly related to church holidays or important historical events.
We also celebrate the New Year: the last day of the old year and the first day of the new year is work holiday - on New Year's Day so that people can rest after New Year's Eve.
There are eleven free holidays throughout the year.
The national holiday is March 15, celebrating the Revolution of 1848 and October 23, commemorating the Revolution of 1956.
On the 20th of August we celebrate the founding of the state, on the 1st of May work, on the 1st and 2nd of November we commemorate the deceased relatives and friends.
In addition, we have two-day holidays of Easter, Anniversary and Christmas.
Since our national, national or religious holidays rarely coincide with the weekend, it has become a practice to move the working day in cases where we would only work one day before or after the holiday.
The price for extended weekends, however, is that we stay in the workplace and at school on the previous Saturdays.
The day immediately preceding or following the holiday, which we work on, has been regulated by the Minister of Labour in a special decree for many years.
The legislation applies equally to all employers and employees employed by them, to public servants and to persons in the public service.
However, it does not apply to companies and institutions that are in operation without interruption or with regard to their destination, even on working days of rest.
This year, there will be a change in the working order only around the end of the year: from December 24, life in the country will almost stop, because according to previous experience, most people will "work" in advance of the days between Christmas and New Year's Eve or will thus take advantage of the saved holidays.
Next year, a few of our holidays fall in the middle, respectively at the end of the week, so the shifts of the working day will be less than this year.
For the first time, the calendar is changed around the holiday of work, so that the workers can then stay at home for four days of taste.
Saturday 26 April will be a working day, so that Friday 2 May can be a day of rest.
The next move is related to the holiday of October 23: on Saturday, October 18, work will be done instead of Friday, October 24.
At the end of the year, however, next year will be able to take place completely in the sign of the holidays, because from December 24, they will have nonstop holidays almost everywhere, even though New Year’s Eve falls on Wednesday.
Six terrifying little things you can do to annoy your colleagues
Emails that we forget to send, voice messages that we never get, innocent lies that we hardly notice anymore: all this “diversifies” our everyday lives in the workplace.
The question is whether you get used to these minor inconveniences, or put on gloves, and in unclear situations that may make others angry, you will deliberately avoid them.
Tips.
"Sorry, I forgot to tell you that you were wanted by the marketing department," a colleague will announce.
That's why you missed the rally?
At best, he regrets it and will try to fix it, or he will call the marketing department and say that he forgot to pass the message (this is a less common solution).
Most often, a matter is solved with an apology.
Before there is an embarrassing apology, it is good to think about what you can do to prepare unpleasant moments for your colleagues, and consciously try to avoid it.
Do you borrow something that is not yours?
There’s nothing more awkward than stretching yourself for some writing, office necessities or for your phone, and they’re not there.
Do you remember putting the stapler on the table yesterday, but it's gone by morning?
Or have you found on the desk of one of your colleagues your pen, which you thought was lost?
Do not take anything from your colleagues without permission, otherwise they will be rightly angry at you for taking their things.
Do not take out envelopes or adhesive papers from the office, as they can be uncomfortable if you run out of them prematurely and you will need them immediately.
Rumors about the private life of colleagues?
There is no good solution to stop the spread of gossip.
Who, who, what did he do?
Where and why?
Don’t let everyone get their news (supposedly) about their colleagues’ private lives!
When one of them shares with you his innermost secrets, do not abuse his trust!
Lock in yourself what you have heard, and in his absence do not discuss it with your colleagues, even when others know about his things.
Are you unreasonably reporting your absence?
If you call the office and refer to a severe headache and report your absence because you’re not feeling well, or you say you’d rather rest today, think about the fact that your work, urgent tasks, and work that they have a certain deadline, someone else will have to do for you.
Take care of your colleagues!
If you know ahead of time that you are not going to work the next day or that something may happen that makes you have to stay at home, report it so that your colleagues and managers are not confronted with your absence until the next day.
Sniffing, sneezing, telephoneing
Have you been immersed in a job from which you will be roughly ripped off by the hiccups of your colleagues?
Did you inadvertently witness a telephone conversation that would be better off not being heard at all?
Do not disturb your co-workers by slandering, singing, talking loudly (over their heads), or beating, constant kneeling, loud dissatisfaction.
All this can be disturbing even when they are not involved in any project (writing, planning, organization).
Are you blaming others for their mistakes?
If something is not in time or you have forgotten to send an important letter or message, do not blame the other for your forgetfulness!
Do not appeal to the potential chaos in the office and noisy colleagues!
Admit if you made a mistake and someone paid extra for it, and fix the damage!
Ask how you could fix the thing, fix the negligence!
Do you feel at home in the office?
Slippers and slippers: comfortable clothes at home, but not suitable for the office!
Don’t wear clothes for your free time, even if your profession allows it!
Don’t be negligent, honor your colleagues and yourself by coming to the office in ordinary clothes – and if your profession requires it, nice and elegant!
When you want to be happy, you stop being interesting.
Driving in the usual morning constipation.
A special melody is heard from the radio: the sound of a violin, to which electronic effects are attached.
Adding volume.
The music changes the tempo and the bass is added to the previous tone coloring, then a female choir is added as a real jewel.
On the mr2 station is a song by Zagar called Wings of Love.
For a long time, home music has not spoiled us with a high-quality electronic pop.
Suddenly, the congestion looks quite different, because you're listening to Zagara's new album.
The emergence of Yonderboy, a pair of new and interesting productions originating from the home digital underground, slowly changes the overall picture, and although garage rock is back in fashion with its banging on the guitar, even the home electropop proves that there is something new under the sun.
Balazs Zságer started in Pentecost and he also played in the Yonderboi band, until eventually - perhaps because the two ducks do not fit in the same row - he went his own way.
However, with his project (Zagar) and music, which combines elements of jazz, electronic dance styles and pop, he began to break through only when he was invited to compose film soundtracks (e.g.
film Ference Turka "Szezon").
His formation, playing early in smaller clubs, recognized a wider audience after Wan2 magazine ranked their first album from 2002 among the fifty most important home albums and declared Zagar at Yonderboye as almost the only home actors determining the development that could be on sale.
Zagar and his band are undoubtedly "in the course", although of course no one asked them if they are satisfied with this sticker.
The band responded as they should: they made a new, better album.
The now-released album Cannot Walk Fly Instead may open up new paths for them, though the title itself tries to create a continuation with the early Pentecostal flights.
This is a verse from the composition of the old band of Balázs Zságer.
The reference to etheric, flying would have been in place, but alongside the etheric breath of this music has now emerged - in keeping with the spirit, trend of the time - a louder guitar, the influence of rock and roll.
In these songs, singer György Ligeti, currently working in England with The Puzzle, performed at the premiere of the album in Millenáris Park.
The album also produced one real radio hit, thanks to mr2 Pet<0xC5><0x91>fi, playing popular music lately from morning to evening, we started to hear the melodies of the song Wings of Love, recorded with six domestic singers ("Underground Divas").
So all is well (?).
The portal hvg.hu confessed Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: In connection with this new hit, the question arises, how much of what you play remains, edge music?
Balázs Zságer: The definition of edge music does not mean much to me.
In my opinion, there are two different castes of light music; not mainstream and underground, not alternative and pop, but commercial and honest.
Even so-called alternative, underground music can be flat, say nothing, and just like that it can only be made for sale, making it commercial.
However, even a good pop song can come from a sincere inner need.
In this spirit, the attitude as it is adopted works, regardless of language and state borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see any difference in the openness of the Hungarian and foreign audience to your music?
B. Zs.: In foreign countries, especially from us to the West, light music has a greater tradition.
There are not only teenagers and people in their twenties, but also the elderly.
Much more are they watching the transformations of light music taking place around them, because they also consider it a part of contemporary culture.
Q. What is the role of the audience in your work?
Do you care who, where, and how many people listen to your music?
B. Zs.: Of course, it’s a good feeling that more and more people are going to our concerts.
But we never made music for the market.
Music is not born for a purpose, but for a reason.
The role of the audience can be perceived more in concerts, where there is already a mutual influence, but it is hidden only in the incomprehensible transformations of the moment.
However, I have noticed that if you want to please the audience, from that moment on, it ceases to be interesting.
hvg.hu: How much are you going to follow the example of Yonderboy?
He works solo and has built his career from us to the west.
B. Zs.: We don’t actually go his way, regardless of the way our music is sometimes tried to explain.
We are more like team players who rely on the musical presence of the other and let it develop.
At first, of course, it was impossible to avoid comparing our work to the tracks of Yonderboye, after all, a few of us separated from his band and went a different way.
hvg.hu: Wings of Love came first in the heat of mr2 Pet<0xC5><0x91>fi.
Many have heard the name Zagar for the first time in connection with this song.
In a more popular style, did you consciously open yourself to wider layers?
B.Zs.: We weren’t planning on writing a hit to sell the record.
There's more to that song.
We intended it as the finale of the album, which we tried to release the previous sound orgy and more complex themes.
HVG: How did you choose the six singers?
Why is it - what was the main principle?
B.Zs.: The idea was to create such a gospel choir.
Then came the idea to assemble this choir of soloists of the home music scene with a good voice.
So this six-member choir - Sena, Edin Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enik<0xC5><0x91> Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh - came together, which we then crossed over to Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: Is this how you thought of the song, or did the girls make something about it?
B.Zs.: The song has long existed in the instrumental version, when the material on the record came together, we thought that there would be something else needed for this song.
A string of chords led him to join a singing party.
That night I sang a melody to him, which the girls later learned.
It all came out almost spontaneously for the first time.
I remember how it came back to life, but of course it needed Divya.
With my voice, it wouldn't work so vigorously.
hvg.hu: Both on the plate and at the concert it seemed that there were girls in the background.
They don’t have solos (except for Judy Jay), they don’t have their own roles, they sing completely together, and they’re not louder than the music, so the music just doesn’t accompany their singing.
They were also in the back of the stage.
That's intentional?
B.Zs.: The fact that they were standing behind was only due to technical problems.
The fact that we didn’t want to split solo roles is intentional.
The song is also about forgetting a little bit about our ego, where it comes from, where it belongs, and just letting those wings, the wings of love, rise.
I wished that this euphoric state that we felt when the song was born would be felt by others.
HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
B.Zs.: During the composition of the music, in fact, not once, the heavier pieces occurred more during mixing.
For example, Dorian Gray's Dilemma, in which I play the concert wing, or Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where he didn't want to run a groove for a long time, then everything pretty slowly found its place as in a puzzle.
hvg.hu: Which song from the new album is your favorite?
B.Zs.: This is always changing with the concert and the fact that I have already "released" the album.
Now it's Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never The Same.
A treacherous broker risked billions for inferiority
Betrayal defrauding.
This is what the French banking giant Société Générale, the owner of the domestic Commercial Bank, describes as Jerome Kerviel.
He lost nearly five billion euros because of it.
But it seems that Kerviel was just a great player, who wanted to make up for his colleagues and, moreover, definitely not incompetent.
Unlike all major banking houses, he recognized the crisis in the U.S. mortgage market early on.
"He's mentally weaker," his superiors said, sending police to see him.
But according to Kerviel’s statement by French media outlets, such as Le Monde, he was a man who at the end of last year had a profit of 1.6 billion euros from his trades.
Crisis not only in America
"All I wanted was to make money for my bank," he said in a statement.
In the summer, he managed to make half a billion euros from the US crisis.
The opportunity was already felt at the beginning of the year.
In February, reports began to emerge that so-called sub-prime mortgages, provided to low-income clients or those who had problems with repayment in the past, will have problems.
The entire economy was not affected by the crisis.
Kerviel didn't believe it and bet right.
At the end of the year, its profit rose to 1.6 billion euros.
"When I made the first half-billion, I didn't know how to announce it," Kerviel admits, adding that he definitely didn't keep anything for himself.
Throughout the interrogation, he confessed to forging records so that he could not be reached.
He even managed to fool the bosses, even though the Eurex stock exchange became interested in his trades.
Risk was profit.
Was he afraid he would be found?
I don't think so.
“I thought the simple fact that I made $1.6 billion for the bank would satisfy them.”
Where did he get the will to take so much risk?
He had to develop his position gradually.
He joined the Société Générale in 2000 just after graduating from the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was around $51,000.
Two years later he was an assistant broker and in 2005 he became a freelance broker with an annual salary of $90,000.
He knew he would never make as much money as anyone else.
“When I first interviewed in 2005, I knew they were looking at me.
Because of my education and also because of my professional and personal development," Kerviel told investigators.
But shortly after the start came the first big success.
Thanks to the shares, Allianz made a bet of half a billion euros on the drop of this title in the bombings of London.
And that was the trigger mechanism - he wanted more.
As long as you make money, we'll leave you
"It's like a snowball," he told the police.
But the bosses said they knew it all, or rather they knew it.
"As long as I made money, they closed their eyes."
But then came the morning at the beginning of this year.
He lost a billion euros in one day.
After the weekend in mid-January, he wanted to finish it.
When he got to work on Monday, he no longer worked at the bank.
And the bank reported a few days later that it had lost five billion euros because of him.
And how did they find him?
He became a suspect because of his vacation.
“I’ve only chosen four days in the past year.
A broker who doesn’t have a vacation is a broker who doesn’t want anyone to look at his records,” Kerviel concluded.
Czech Republic has a chance to win $365 billion
Ministers of the Czech Government and representatives of the European Commission signed a total of nine operational programmes, of which the Czech Republic can receive 14 billion euros (approximately 365 billion kronor) in the coming years.
This is about half of the total amount that the Czech Republic can receive from Brussels between 2007 and 2013.
Approximately CZK 125 billion will go from seven operational programmes to regions.
Czech companies will be able to get around 100 billion kronor from the program Entrepreneurship and Innovation.
Most of the money, up to 150 billion, will go to transport.
Transport is the largest operational programme and represents up to 22% of the funds that the Czech Republic can receive from the funds.
This money will increase the budget of the State Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will manage next year with an amount of 90.8 billion crowns.
The Entrepreneurship and Innovation programme is designed to help entrepreneurs and companies raise funds for innovative entrepreneurship.
Firms should receive funding for the introduction of new technologies, for industrial research, but also for the introduction of more effective organizational methods.
So far, the Czech Republic has been among the least successful in drawing money from EU funds within the newly admitted countries.
Twenty-year sentence for ex-president of Nicaragua confirmed by court
Nicaragua's appeals court on Thursday upheld a 20-year sentence for former President Arnold Alemán, who was sentenced in 2003 to $100 million in financial fraud.
Later, however, he was released from prison and lived in a home prison on his hacienda near the Nicaraguan metropolis.
Whether the former head of this Central American state from 1997 to 2002 will return behind bars is unclear at this time, according to the AP.
According to the President of the Court of Appeal Ileana Pérez, it will now be up to the prison officials whether they let the German serve his sentence at home or go to prison.
A court four years ago proved to Aleman that he was regularly transferring government money to accounts of foreign companies in Panama.
These companies were fictitious and the accounts actually belonged to his relatives and closest followers.
Some of this money then ended up in a fund that Alemán founded to fund his 2001 election campaign.
So they approved the budget.
That's right.
The state budget was adopted.
What makes this budget special?
It is the first budget drawn up by this government and adopted by a coalition majority without the support of the opposition.
This year last year, the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD passed with support, because Minister Sobotka prepared it and the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD could not afford not to accept it.
Unlike the hectic debate before the vote on mistrust of the government, nothing dramatic happened this time.
The House of Representatives passed this traditionally overlooked, although the most influential, law quietly.
It is a certain paradox.
Each government begins and ends with individual chapters and budget items, whether one likes it or not.
The budget is an essential part of politics, but it is hidden behind the powerful competition of the government with the opposition.
This is more appreciated by the media and therefore much more attention is paid to it in the media.
Politicians’ guesses are far more interesting to the public than stringent numbers.
State budgets in past social democratic governments have suffered from three ailments, which he is unable to solve at once for 2008:
The first of these is a high proportion of mandatory, so-called mandatory expenses, which are not only pensions, but also social benefits, which were approved last year before the elections by the silent "coalition" of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD and KS<0xC4><0x8C>M.
The second is the deficit management as a result of the illness of the first.
The third limit is the deficit of public finances, i.e. the budget deficit of cities and municipalities.
The biggest risk, however, is not the deficit of the state budget.
It is public and relatively under control.
The time bomb, however, is the budget deficit of cities and municipalities.
Many mayors, in addition to obtaining money from taxes, fees, and loans from banks, were often headlessly issuing bonds to indebted their town halls.
In recent years, they have managed to repay these debts by mass selling shares of energy and other distribution networks, which they received from the state from in privatization.
They no longer have this resource.
If we stick to only official and verifiable facts, we will find that:
Our economy has been going through a growth phase for several years, as well as the rest of the world, thus constantly bragging about the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD.
It was a unique opportunity for its governments to put public finances in order.
Instead, the government is increasingly indebted.
Other countries, with a few exceptions, such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have managed much wiser than our republic.
This is a disgrace, especially to previous governments.
We are among the countries that are the least threatened by poverty on a global scale.
Therefore, there is no need for massive social programs, which, unfortunately, have, in recent years, become completely unnecessary in gigantic proportions.
Although it has succeeded in repealing some of the nonsensical populist spending approved this year before the elections, if there is no postponement of the retirement limit and pension reform in the near future, then in fact any policy in this country will end and whoever governs it will be mere government.
With a small surplus, it can be said that the ruling politicians will become officials, mechanically distributing most of the taxed money to pensions and social benefits.
Therefore, this year’s budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can only suspend the extortion of normal expenditure by mandate spending.
The planned deficit of $70 billion for 2008 would be completely unnecessary if past governments had not spent what they could in the last ten years.
If we don’t really want to make government politicians useful officials, then we have to be patient and allow this not-so-strong coalition government to realize that the state can only spend as much as it can get on taxes and fees, calmly prepare for further reforms.
Only these will allow for the gradual achievement of a balanced state budget.

Banks want to solve the crisis
The U.S. Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the central banks of Britain, Switzerland and Canada have decided to jointly fight the crisis in the financial markets.
More than a hundred billion dollars will go to the foreign exchange markets through auctions.
In these auctions, banks auction at an interest rate at which they are willing to borrow money.
For example, the U.S. Fed will auction $40 billion, while the other $24 billion will be made available to the European and Swiss central banks.
It is the first time since the September 11 attacks that the central banks of each country have agreed on such a coordinated approach to prevent or mitigate the consequences of the financial crisis.
“This step is intended to address the economy’s biggest challenges, the growing shortage of free capital that banks could lend,” Bernard Baumohl of the Economic Outlook Group, said in a report to clients.
“Coordinated action by central banks has reduced the likelihood of a recession in the United States from 65 percent to 50 percent,” Baumohl said in a statement.
Banks have already lost $60 billion due to unpaid loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts are expecting billions more.
"Central banks must be really afraid of what else can follow when they decide to do this," said ABN chief economist Amro Kieran Davies.
"It looks like the situation is really bad," he added.
Central banks are worried that if banks themselves have difficult access to loans, they will also be reluctant to lend to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and send the U.S. economy into a recession with potential impacts on global economic growth.
The central banks decided to do so after failing to reduce the so-called LIBOR rate, the London interbank rate used to lend money on the interbank market.
This meant that banks were still worried about lending money to each other, even though the central banks of the US, Canada and the UK had cut their interest rates several times during the fall.
“It will have the same effect as another drop in interest rates,” Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting told Reuters.
Some analysts do not believe that the move of central banks will contribute to curbing the crisis because it does not solve the underlying problem, and this is the fall of the US real estate market.
Klaus: Ecologists' debates are incredible
Global climate change is the most damaging to developing countries.
President Václav Klaus once again commented on the issue of global warming.
Criticism has now been raised at the closing United Nations conference on climate change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book The Blue Planet, not the Green Planet, he said the debates of ecologists are incredible.
According to Klaus, it is unacceptable not only the structure of the conference, which is a strange mixture of representatives of governments and NGOs, but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric that accompanies it and reality.
"The debate there is completely unstructured, it is just a fireworks of words that are a substitute for solving the current problems," Klaus said.
When presenting his book, the Czech President stressed that the topic is very important for him and that is why he is so committed to them.
He also expressed satisfaction with the fact that the book also appears in the German translation, because, as he said, "often I only meet cartoons of my own opinions".
Now, therefore, the interested parties can read his undistorted attitudes.
Klaus recalled that although he is not a climatologist, in his opinion he has enough prerequisites to write such a book.
He is an academic, able to monitor and assess professional treatises, has experience in statistics and is also an economist.
The main conclusions of the book are that the climate is constantly changing and its changes are therefore normal, that there is no consensus on the warming of the planet, that the consequences of the current changes are not too large and serious, and therefore do not pose a threat, and that efforts to influence climate change are not effective and do not affect climate development.
Moreover, as a person with experience of totality, he considers it unacceptable to impose unproven opinions on others, which he feels to be a dangerous restriction of freedom.
When asked by attendees, he repeatedly explained that he was not against "reasonable environmental protection, but against militant environmentalism, which does not take into account the relationship between costs and their benefits".
Klaus spoke on the same topic in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
Driver's license has not been able to replace 600,000 people
Six hundred thousand drivers have missed the deadline and have not been able to replace the old driver's license, which expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day people can apply for an exchange so that the authorities can issue a new ID before the end of the year.
However, the ministry is not afraid that after the New Year, hundreds of thousands of drivers will go on the road without a valid license.
According to the authorities, the license was not exchanged mainly by those who do not want to drive anymore.
While the municipalities report a sharp drop in interest in exchanging the driver's license, the authorities in the metropolis are overwhelmed by requests and interest in exchanging the license has increased this week.
The magistrate handles about 2,000 clients per day.
Waiting in line for about half an hour.
In Prague, about 140,000 drivers have not yet exchanged their driver's licenses.
The issuance of a new passport takes 20 days.
However, it is possible to apply for a shortened period of five days.
In this case, the driver will pay five hundred crowns.
Drivers who do not get a mandatory change of license by the end of the year and drive on the road without a valid driver's license will be fined from January.
The culprit will pay a maximum of two thousand crowns.
However, the policeman can also deal with the offense by agreement.
In the event of an administrative offence, the fine will rise to 2500 crowns.
According to earlier information, he could receive a fine from the city hall and a person who does not go anywhere.
He could have paid as much as 30,000 crowns.
The ministry has previously urged authorities to be mild and impose a maximum fine of a thousand crowns.
According to a spokesman for the Ministry of Transport Karl Hanzelka, no one is threatened with a fine of ten thousand.
The driver’s license is a document where people can decide whether they want it or not.
It is not a national identity card that every person must have.
People who no longer want to drive should give up their driver’s license.
It is enough to take it away or send it recommended by post to the relevant municipal office.
By the end of the year, passports issued between 1964 and 1993 will cease to be valid.
However, drivers need to gradually change other types of driver's licenses.
People with documents from 1994 to 2000 have three more years to exchange.
The validity of licences issued between 2001 and 2004 expires in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, there are about 2.6 million other documents.
Court Reduces Punishment for Detectives Associated with Berdych
Former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Ko<0xC5><0x88>a<0xC5><0x99>ík, who are charged with a criminal association with the gang of David Berdych, will go to prison for thirteen and ten years.
The Supreme Court in Prague decided to reduce their sentences by one year and the other by two years.
Initially, it threatened the detectives of the Prague Department for the fight against organized crime for 14 and 12 years.
The present decision can no longer be appealed, only appeal to the Supreme Court is possible.
Berdych is also charged in this case, but he is still waiting for the verdict.
In other cases, however, he has already been sentenced to a total of more than 16 years.
He can't get more.
In January, the district court ruled that 19 people were responsible for the robbery, and the supreme court decided to appeal 16 of them.
Most of the defendants have denied the indictment since the start of the investigation, claiming it was a fabricated case.
According to the Central Bohemian Senate, police officers, in agreement with Berdych, provided criminals with information from police sources, covered up individual robberies and helped gang members avoid criminal responsibility.
The gang gave 30 percent for Opava and Konja<0xC5><0x99>ík out of the magnifying glass.
The indictment is a criminal offence committed by a gang from 1999 to 2001.
In particular, robberies, the victims of which have often suffered serious health damage, but also abuses of public authority and unauthorised weapons.
During home inspections, police found illegally held pistols, steel core shells, laser sightings, or machine guns.
The gang is accused of robbery of tens of millions of crowns.
In addition to nearly twenty men in the process, the courts have already found Berdych and a number of other people guilty of other robberies.
Other men from the Berdych area are still confessing before the court in another trial, some cases have not yet arrived before the court.
The main case has so far been avoided by Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> P<0xC5><0xAF>t and Maro<0xC5><0xA1> <0xC5><0xA0>ulej, who remain in Irish custody, where they are waiting for a final decision on their extradition to the Czech Republic.
Child Exchange Account: $12 million
In exchange for the children in the maternity ward, the lawyer of the injured families, Igor Veleba, wants compensation of 12 million crowns, plus court expenses.
For each of the mothers three million, for the father two million, and for the children one million.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each parent.
Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Dostál, the legal representative of the hospital, therefore disagrees with Veleba’s proposal in principle.
"We reject such a request, it is very, very high," Dostál said after today's talks.
"But in order to make an opinion on the counter-proposal, we need an expert opinion that the counter-party has prepared.
Let's see if it has any telling value.
But we insist that it will be in the hundreds of thousands for everyone," Dostal stressed.
According to him, the amount should range from 100,000 to 200,000 CZK for each of the four parents.
At the beginning of the case, the Jablo<0xC5><0x88> family wanted a million crowns for every month they did not raise their biological daughter.
Veleb served as the basis for negotiating a compensation expert opinion, which was prepared for him by the Faculty Hospital in Prague-Motole.
Parents of children, according to experts from the field of psychology and psychiatry, suffered psychological harm and stress at different degrees and depths.
The stressful situation was better tolerated by men, even though they faced regrets that they did not prevent the confusion of newborns.
Women are worse off with the actuality of the trauma experienced and with what is happening right now, the content of Veleb summarized.
Veronica and Nikola were replaced by nurses at T<0xC5><0x99>ebí<0xC4><0x8D> obstetrics last December 9.
Last week, the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to <0xC4><0x8C>ermák to P<0xC5><0x99>íbyslavic and Veronika to Libor Bro<0xC5><0xBE> and Jaroslav Trojan to Jablo<0xC5><0x88>.
Hejtman Vyso<0xC4><0x8D>ina Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Vy<0xC5><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>il handed over 100,000 crowns to each of the families at the end of October to reimburse them for the expenses incurred by the error of the T<0xC5><0x99>ebí<0xC4><0x8D> hospital, which the region establishes.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are legally insured for damages.
In case of failure, they must reach out to the reserve fund, exceptionally they can ask for the help of the founder.
The courts have so far granted people relatively low compensation, the amounts were calculated according to tables in the order of hundreds of thousands, exceptionally millions of crowns.
The Soup Lost in the Kingdom of Wallachia
Bolek Soup lost a dispute over the brand of the Kingdom of Wallachia.
According to the judge of the Ostrava Regional Court, although the designation was first used by the King of Wallachia, the project built a long-term work team around Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>, who collaborated with the actor.
Soup was not in the meeting today.
But according to his lawyer, the case is not likely to end and the client will appeal.
"The dispute is that Mr. Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his team are parasitizing on the popularity of Bolka Soup," Polívkov's lawyer said after the trial.
According to him, in the words of the Kingdom of Wallachia, everyone will remember actors and comedians.
Harabi has the same opinion.
“We have almost a decade of work.
The pursuit of money and the inventing of actions," he said.
According to him, they are the cause of the money dispute.
"After years, they realized that the project was successful and could have had some of it.
They want to parasitize our work,” he added.
The lucrative business
According to the court, the king of Wallachia used Soup for the first time in his television show.
In 1993, he was crowned by actor Radoslav Brzobohaty.
At that time, however, it was not related to the intention of building a fictional kingdom.
A few years later, Harabish came up with the idea of issuing Wallachian passports.
From the original recessive event, trade and lucrative entrepreneurial activity emerged, to which Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> then established the company of the Kingdom of Wallachia.
In 1997, Polívka agreed to include his name and signature in the passports and even offered their holders a discount when visiting his farm and theatre performances.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge also said today that Harabish only used the bare idea that Soupka had published in a maneuver for his business intention.
"The popularity of Boleslav Soup project of the Kingdom of Wallachia certainly helped," the judge said.
But she added that the soul of the project was Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his team, who devoted themselves intensively to him.
The cooperation of the dismembered parties today continued until 2000, when Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> organized an official coronation for Soup in Vsetín.
Since then, however, disputes have begun to pile up between Polivka and Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>, culminating in the demise of "King Boleslav I, elected to the throne".
The leading role in the kingdom was then assumed by the singer Jarmila <0xC5><0xA0>uláková as queen mother at the prompting of Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>.
In 2002, Polívka filed a lawsuit against Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his company, which the court rejected today.
Clearly, Harabish's bid for a throne and half a princess could bring into dispute.
A new king should come out of it.
The details and the date were not yet disclosed.
“We don’t want to rush anything.
It should be something like a ride of kings in Slovakia.
The king should be elected for a certain period of time.
Mr. Soup is also welcome to sign up," Harabish added.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: disappearing prejudices
Honestly, I've never been too fan of the Peugeot 206.
Its driving characteristics were not much, the quality of gearing, steering and also production could be labeled as under-average.
But there is now a successor to the Peugeot 207 on the market, and this one is much better.
And a van called SW goes a little further and I don't have to think about it.
When I tested the classic Peugeot 207 hatchback, I complained, for example, about the headspace in the rear seats.
This is the end of the complaints here, because the body of the combi means that they will not suffer in this direction even two-meter long.
Flying around the world
The interior will move very quickly so that I do not repeat myself too much.
This is a very successful design, where I have only one thing to say about the poor central tunnel.
Here I would appreciate a little more design invention, when the car already looks so elegant.
The seats are comfortable and there are times when we could complain about short seats or backrests.
The side guidance has also improved significantly against the 206 model.
As for the space, there is also a sense of an increase in the dimensions of the body.
In the van, the already mentioned lack of space above the head disappears.
The disbelievers
The main thing about this car is its luggage compartment.
I have to evaluate it as very easily accessible (including thanks to the tilting rear window) and as decently folded.
Deaf places are equipped with retention rubbers, which are an ideal compromise.
It does not obstruct, it can be stretched while retaining even heavier objects.
But let's stay together over the volume.
According to the tables, it is 428 l in the basic arrangement, which is rather an average value against the competition.
However, not against the best-selling car of this class in the Czech Republic - the <0xC5><0xA0>KODA Fabia Combi.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the young Boleslav product, then we find that Peugeot is lagging behind a lot of noticeable 52 liters.
For holidays abroad or when loading a stroller, this value is critical.
But if I have to pick up the positives, I still have to mention a completely straight floor after folding the second row of backrests or a very low threshold.
120 horses in four rows
Our tested car was equipped with a 1.6-litre four-cylinder diesel engine with an output of 88 kW.
And to be honest, this is what a 1600 should look like to drive a family hatchback.
It is quiet, has little consumption and above all it pulls.
If I compare it to a damaging period, which sometimes seems like a stuffed cloth in the exhaust, then I can only be excited about it.
The price list indicates
The price of the car is not popular.
However, we must remember that we have tested a decently equipped car with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of a car with a fourteen-dollar fuel for 329,900 CZK will still go.
Our unit costs from 410 900 CZK, which is quite enough.
Tested Premium equipment will then bring the equipment for another 80,000 CZK.
But we still had head airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic wiper start, electric control of the rear windows...
Just the car costs everything everywhere 531 900 CZK.
It's a lot, but count the extras at Fabia and you'll get a lot of similar numbers.
All you have to do is decide on the brand.
Integration of Slovak pupils in British schools fails
In British schools, children from Eastern European countries are increasing, which raises concerns among local settlers about the further development of local education.
The integration of Eastern Europeans so far faces a number of obstacles.
British schools even register cases where disputes between immigrants and the children of indigenous peoples grow into violence.
The problem with the integration of children from Eastern Europe in British schools is well illustrated by the case in North Kent, where disputes between local settlers and Slovak immigrants are beginning to escalate.
Disputes, bullying and quarrels between pupils have also spread into relationships between parents.
The situation went so far that in Chatham, police detained a Slovak woman who beat a 10-year-old student with an iron rod.
The accused defends herself that the boy insulted her with racist insults.
The police had to intervene even after the attack of two teenage girls on a Slovak immigrant.
The girls allegedly honored the man with racist remarks and threw stones at him.
"When we were going home, a boy climbed up to the bus stop and started spitting on us.
When I told him to stop, he turned on us with apples and pears, and then he revealed his ass," another unpleasant event for the Times, the mother of Slovak pupils, described.
Complaints are on both sides.
One of the local settlers even called disputes with immigrants from Eastern Europe a struggle for survival.
The above-mentioned cases suggest that the atmosphere in British schools between locals and immigrants is starting to become tense.
70,000 Slovaks are registered in the UK who have come here for work.
Approximately 30,000 Slovak students then attend British schools.
Cuba's most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors, it is truly an island of freedom.
Whatever you expect from your vacation, it can be fulfilled for you if you make the right choice.
Golden and white beaches, high waves, or the sea, calm as a pond.
Palms and all inclusive with waiters offering pizza, ice cream and intoxicating cocktails on the beach.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the islands in the Caribbean Sea you will find it in a complete and even richer list.
But you will find much more on one island and that island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of the Great Antilles.
For the Spaniards, Cuba was a bastion of their conquest of America.
Columbus described it as the most beautiful place the human eye has ever looked at.
Havana has become a warehouse and repository of the treasures that the Spaniards plundered in America and transported to Europe.
Then came the American era.
The National Hotel grew up in the late 1920s.
It was built by one of the heads of the American mafia Lucky Luciano, because everything that was a crime in the United States (especially prohibition) was welcomed and promoted in Cuba by drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his guests were MJ.
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana, high-rise houses grew, cars that were among the iconic symbols of the 1950s drove across the wide boulevards.
Ernest Hemingway bought a mansion in San Francisco de Paula, a short distance from Havana, and had his own yacht in Cojimar.
On the walls of the Bodeguy del Medio, the stars of the show business and politicians from all over America left their signatures.
What about today?
You can also leave your autograph on the walls of Havana’s Bodeguita.
At the bar of the expensive Nacional hotel, they will mix cocktails to your liking.
And the iconic cars of the 1950s are still driving through Havana, because the once-imported giggles and fiats in that salty and damp air have rotted long ago.
Although Havana, especially its oldest part, is considerably ruined, there are no more beautiful colonial monuments in the area than right there.
Other places are also transformed into beauty, such as Trinidad.
Given that tourism brings so much needed money, its development is green.
Over the past fifteen years, new hotels have grown not only in Havana, but especially in Varadero, on the coast of Holguin province and on islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba offers one more meal, which is unique in the world and appreciated especially by trainers.
The cane from the large plantations was transported to the sugar mills along the narrow tracks of steam and motor trains.
Their fleet has not been renewed for many decades, so there are machines that work, the peers of which are elsewhere only in museums.
Where to go?
The most famous places most visitors of Cuba do not miss.
So there's no need to talk much about Varadero or Havana.
Perhaps just to remind you that in the already mentioned Hemingway estate there is a museum and those who like this writer should not miss a visit.
Viñales Valley One of the most picturesque corners of Cuba is the Viñales Valley in the west of the island.
The lush vegetation grows from the limestone substrate.
Mogots, limestone homologs and rocks rise steeply from the bottom of the valley, and in their cavities there is a fertile soil, thanks to which the aerated rocks are covered with dense growth.
The valley is a place where perhaps the best quality Cuban tobacco is grown.
You can meet its final form by visiting one of Havana’s cigar-making factories.
Some may find it interesting that Major Zeman's Chilean part was filmed there.
Trinidad and Tobago
An ancient city that was founded shortly after the Spanish colonized the island.
The slave trade and the sugar trade brought him fame and wealth.
Wealth has transformed into the beauty and showiness of a small city.
Colonial Spanish architecture, greatly influenced by later French settlers, has hardly changed in four centuries.
Trinidad, between the sea and the Escambray Mountains, is a place so remote that even in the 1950s there was no road that would connect that region with the rest of the country.
That isolation helped him stay away.
Nothing happened there, and therefore nothing was afraid, everyone was glad that he had a roof over his head.
If you have more time in Trinidad than one afternoon, then it is worth taking a look at the nearby places of interest, such as the Playa Ancón beach or the Sugar Valley.
The evening is then to go to the Casa de la Música, which comes to life after dark and the music in it calms down in the morning.
Baracoa
The town in the east of Cuba is considered by some to be the most beautiful on the island.
Surely such an opinion is influenced by the road itself.
The two roads that lead there from Guantanamo have to overcome the high and fragmented mountains and pass through nature that human activity has hardly noticed.
The eastern island of Cuba has been listed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO thanks to its pristine nature.
They make the best chocolate there, they have the Columbus Cross in the church (in fact it was built about a hundred years after Columbus's voyage) and from the hill where stands the former castle and today's Hotel El Castillo, you can see several tabletop mountains, the most famous of which is El Yunque.
About coffee, rum, cigars, the Sierra Maestra Mountains, the Bay of Pigs and the Island of Pinos, the Tropicana Cabaret, the sanctuary of the Cuban patron Caridad del Cobre, the santeria, the African religions, which the descendants of former slaves profess, all of this could be described.
But, as they say, it’s better to see.
Allies in Afghanistan are passive, Americans say
Few troops and a lack of necessary equipment affect the course of the mission in Afghanistan, according to the United States.
According to Defense Minister Robert Gates, NATO should draw up a concrete plan for the coming years.
The mission in Afghanistan is not going according to expectations, agreed in Edinburgh, Scotland, the representatives of countries that have units in the southern part of the country.
In addition to growing opposition from the Taliban, the eight participating states are also discussing other plans and coordination of allies.
While the United States this week, through Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, called for NATO troops to be more active, the UK sees a priority in strengthening the Afghan government’s authority and strengthening development aid.
“The development in Afghanistan is tangible, but the military force can only be one part of the solution.
Another is to allow the people to start further economic and security development themselves," British Defence Secretary Des Browne told BBC.
Ninety percent
According to the U.S. military, the insurgency in Afghanistan has been at its highest level in five years.
The number of violent actions increased by 27% compared to last year, in the southern province of Helmand even by 60%.
NATO countries have about 40,000 troops in Afghanistan, about a quarter of them in the southern territory.
According to the United States, however, the allies have reached the very limit in the organization and equipment of the units.
Specifically, they are asking for additional helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan troops.
“We will have to seriously think about the specific goals for the next time and how to achieve them,” Gates said.
In a similar sense, NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop also spoke today.
“I am not happy with what we have on the ground and in the air in Afghanistan.
We have about 90 percent of the troops and equipment we would need, and that’s not enough,” De Hoop told Reuters at the end of three-day talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is Passive
There has also been controversy among the countries involved over recent months over whether all allies are doing their best in Afghanistan.
Germany, for example, has been criticized for its passivity.
"The Germans have a relatively large presence in Afghanistan.
But they are deployed in areas where there is a minimum of violence and combat demands on them are not as high as on us in the southern and eastern parts of the country," Gates said.
The British newspaper Sun called German soldiers lazy this week.
"Afghan offenders revealed: The Germans are playing while our boys are fighting," Sun wrote in the material, supplemented by pictures of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German Bild went on to counterattack and printed a picture of the British unit during a rugby match in southern Afghanistan.
The government's debt will be trillions in 2009.
The Czech Republic owes more than 84,000 kronor to the government.
Total debt rose at the end of September to CZK 842.7 billion.
The government had planned to lend 159.2 billion crowns this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion crowns due to better developments in the management of the state budget.
The government debt of the Czech Republic rose to 842.7 billion kronor at the end of September.
In the nine months of this year, it increased by 40.2 billion crowns.
Since June, however, it has fallen by 13.4 billion kronor.
The Ministry of Finance today confirmed its data on the government debt from the beginning of October.
Each Czech has a debt of over 84,000 kronor.
Over the past year, the country has owed more than 111 billion crowns.
"At the moment, it seems that due to the lower deficit for next year, we could not exceed the trillion crown limit until 2009.
Next year, the debt should range between 900 billion and trillion kronor," Patria Finance analyst David Marek told iHNed.cz.
Next Finance analyst Vladimír Pikora says: “We could reach a trillion in 2009.
When exactly will it depend on the next budget, which we do not yet know.
If it turns out that the situation on the political scene would change, politicians would be willing to save more, it could move on to 2010.
But I do not anticipate this change," he said.
Debts are Growing
State debt is the central government’s debt and arises primarily from the accumulation of state budget deficits.
The government debt is financed by cash receipts, government bonds, direct loans or, for example, loans from the European Investment Bank.
Domestic debt so far this year has risen by 38.5 billion to 719.4 billion kronor.
So far this year, the foreign debt of the state has increased by 1.7 billion kronor to 123.3 billion kronor.
The so-called negotiable sovereign debt reached 803.3 billion kronor at the end of September and has fallen by 13.7 billion kronor since June.
The average government debt maturity has increased to 6.5 years.
“All-yearly debt for the first to third quarter grew by 13 percent, which is really a lot on how the economy is doing.
Interestingly, the increase is mainly generated in bonds, where the increase is 20 percent.
It’s bad that the debt is rising, but on the other hand it shows that he will be doing business with when the pension reform comes,” Pikora said.
Better Than Expected
The 2007 State Debt Financing and Management Strategy indicates that the government planned to lend 159.2 billion kronor this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion crowns due to better developments in the management of the state budget.
The figure is mainly due to the state budget deficit, which is likely to reach 76 billion kronor this year instead of the projected 91.3 billion kronor.
Furthermore, the planned maximum resources for the Czech Consolidation Agency are 13.3 billion kronor, a ten-billion-dollar pension reserve, financing of 43 billion kronor government bonds and repayment of loans from the European Investment Bank in the amount of 1.8 billion kronor.
A woman is due to appear in court in Khartoum today for giving a name to a teddy bear
A British teacher, convicted of insulting Islam in Sudan, was sentenced to 15 days in prison by a Khartoum tribunal on Thursday night and expelled, her lawyer said.
A British woman has been accused of letting six to seven-year-old pupils give a teddy bear the name Mohammed, despite the fact that any depiction of the prophet of Islam is prohibited.
She was beaten with a whip.
The 44-year-old British teacher, who works at Unity High School in Sudan’s Khartoum, was arrested at her home on Sunday and charged with insulting Islam and rebellion, in accordance with Article 125 of the Sudanese Criminal Code, after the parents of several pupils were sued.
Our story actually begins as early as September, when the teacher in question asks her six- to seven-year-old pupils to choose a name for a class stuffed bear.
“Eight names will be heard from the mouths of the children, including Hasan, Abdullah and Mohamed,” said Robert Boulos, the school’s headmaster.
After the voting is held in the classroom, 20 of the 23 children will eventually choose the most popular name Mohamed.
Sure, Muhammad is the name of a Muslim prophet, but above all, it is a very common baptismal name in Sudan.
The children then created a book for their class with a photo of the bear accompanied by a tag: "My name is Mohammed".
The bear itself did not have a label with this name on it, but the difficulty is in depicting the prophet himself as an insult to Islam.
A Muslim colleague, Gillian Gibbons, who teaches at the same school in Sudan, said she knew her well and that she would never do anything that could be offensive to any religious belief: "I only regret that she asked children to "vote only for a name".
This view is shared by many students of the teacher, who describe it as “very attentive to their students” and add that “they never talk about religion in class.”
Recall that the surname Mohammed is also the second most commonly given surname in the United Kingdom, in English it is written in fourteen different ways.
This surname, often chosen by Muslim families, is a way of worshipping the Prophet (often given to the firstborn).
But what are the rules regarding the use of this surname?
Is it possible to give them a toy?
Of course, it's a matter of interpretation.
At the last round of negotiations this Wednesday in Vienna, they failed to reach an agreement on the future status of the province.
In the end, failure.
Serbian and Kosovo Albanians ended the sixth and final round of talks on Wednesday morning in Baden, Austria, without being able to overcome divergent views on the future status of the separatist province.
"It is regrettable that both sides have not been able to reach a status agreement," European negotiator Wolfgang Ischinger said at a press conference in Vienna.
His American counterpart, Frank Wisner, stressed that peace in the area is "at stake" and called on Belgrade and Pristina to take care of their commitments to maintain peace and be ready for dialogue even after the negotiations are over.
"We do not expect violence in the near future, but we are entering a difficult period," he added, adding that "it is obvious that the situation is tense."
Negotiations end on December 10
Negotiators of the Troika, made up of representatives of the European Union, the United States and Russia, will last travel to Kosovo on Monday.
The future of the province, with 90 percent of the Albanian-speaking population, could emerge in a brighter light on Dec. 10, when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian negotiator Alexander Bocan-Charchenko are due to submit their report to the UN Security Council.
The talks in Baden, near Vienna, represent the sixth and final round of negotiations since the UN, in August this year, mandated the Troika to renegotiate.
Americans and Europeans expect the talks to end on December 10.
On the other hand, the Russians, who previously blocked Kosovo’s independence in the UN Security Council, insist that the talks continue beyond this deadline.
"Russia has been and remains in favour of a negotiated, compromised solution," Bocan-Charchenko said.
A unilateral declaration of independence?
After eight years of administration by the international community, the West sees Kosovo’s independence under EU supervision as the only viable solution.
Pristina declares that if the Security Council does not decide in its favour, it is ready to declare independence unilaterally.
Belgrade insists on expanded autonomy.
"Unfortunately, we have not reached any agreement," Kosovo's President Fatmir Sejdiu said at a hotel in Baden, where the "last chance of negotiations" had been held since Monday.
Hashim Thaçi, a former rebel commander of Kosovo Albanians and future prime minister of the province, expressed regret.
However, he added that the autonomy plan presented by Belgrade "belongs to the past, which has led to murders and deportations".
"Dominant effect"
Serbian President Boris Tadic, on the other hand, believes that the compromise is still being considered and warned the Albanian majority in Kosovo of the consequences of the province's unilaterally declared independence.
Belgrade is particularly concerned about the "dominance effect" in the area, which is still unstable as a result of the wars of independence in the 1990s.
"But that does not mean for Serbia," he said, "that a compromise is impossible."
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation insisted that all decisions should belong exclusively to the Security Council, in which its Russian ally has the right to veto.
"Kosovo Parliament will have the last word"
"For Serbia, the only solution acceptable is that of the Security Council," Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said.
“This conversation took two years.
It must end as it began: on the ground of the Security Council.”
Fatmir Sedjiu told reporters that "the last word on the status will be the Kosovo parliament" and added that if there was a unilateral declaration of independence by Albanian-speaking people, it would take place "after an agreement" with the West.
Bush demands a deal between Israelis and Palestinians
At the opening of an international peace conference in Annapolis, Maryland, called for by his leadership, US President George W. Bush announced that Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint declaration.
He said Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to immediately start talks with the intention of resolving the 60-year-old dispute between the two nations once and for all.
In the presence of both men, Bush promised he would do anything to help them conclude a “peace treaty” before the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, the Palestinians must destroy "terrorist infrastructure" and Israel must end colonial activities, Bush said, recalling the obligations that come from the "road map" for both sides to the peace they adopted in 2003.
The White House chief stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority led by Abbas were aimed at “concluding a peace treaty that would resolve all outstanding issues without exception, including central issues.”
This statement includes three issues that are at the heart of the dispute between Israelis and Palestinians: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem, and the fate of Arab refugees evicted from their homes in the present-day state of Israel during the 1948 conflict.
Abbas spoke after the US president, stressing that the follow-up talks should be "total and thorough" and touch on all aspects of the solution, mentioning "Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water, security, among others".
Olmert said that the subsequent negotiations should be "direct and continuous" and that it is necessary to "prepare for it to be concluded in the course of 2008".
Bush set the end of 2008 as the date for the realization of his “vision of two states,” the Palestinian and Israeli, existing alongside each other.
Saudi Arabia said it had made a commitment from Bush in this regard before deciding to participate in the conference.
Saudi Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, initiated a proposal adopted by all Arab countries that offers Israel peace in exchange for leaving all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 wars, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis means "a crossroads in the history of the Middle East, especially because it fights against the roots of the conflict and its central aspects," Prince Saoud said in an interview with an Arabic-speaking newspaper protected by Saudi capital.
According to the prosecutor, the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As is always the case with such small reports from the Black Chronicle, the official versions do not agree with what is being said among people.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first results of the investigation by the Inspection générale de la police nationale (IGPN), the police car passed through Louise-Michel Street in the village of Villiers-le-Bel shortly after 17:00 on Sunday.
"The vehicle was not in the mode of intervention, but was on patrol and was traveling at a speed of 40 to 50 km/h, while not having the side lights on," the police source explains.
Kawasaki's green motorcycle, "unregistered, and therefore unauthorized to drive on public roads" (read below), driven by two young men without helmets, passed "at a very high speed".
"A motorcycle crashed into a police car from the left side after not giving preference to the right," one police officer said.
The blood alcohol promile test performed on the crew of the vehicle turned out to be negative.
The condition of the car (perforated front, broken windshield, broken bumpers) indicates the sharpness of the impact.
The Prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérèse de Givry, reacted very quickly and announced yesterday morning that the IGPN had commissioned an investigation into "acts of involuntary killing and failure to provide assistance to persons at risk" of the district's police department, which is also responsible for the management of the department.
On the occasion of the afternoon press conference, the prosecutor said that the investigation conducted by the IGPN excludes, at this stage, the responsibility of the police officers for the accident.
The three witnesses, who were questioned on Sunday night, confirmed "the version of the police officers, namely that the mini-motorcycle approached them relatively quickly from the left".
A scree, undoubtedly caused by rubbing clips on the ground, showed yesterday that both vehicles remained clogged until the police car was able to brake.
The vehicles have been secured and will undergo technical expertise.
An autopsy was conducted on the bodies of both victims yesterday.
What happened right after that?
Yesterday, in Villiers-le-Bel, there was a rapid spread among the people about the fact that the police should leave the scene quickly without providing the first aid to the two young men.
The IGPN should, with all due care, also rule out “any serious wrongdoing” at this point.
"It is a more demanding aspect of the investigation, which requires more investigation and with which one needs to be very careful," the police source said.
The newspaper "Libération" met with an eyewitness of the few moments that followed the accident.
One of his windows leads directly to where the accident took place.
"We immediately ran downstairs with our cousin, who is a nurse in the hospital, to try to resurrect them," the witness said.
There was nothing we could do."
Then he saw "a floating, terrified policeman.
Two others were trying to resurrect one of the young men, and the fourth was on the phone."
In the face of rapidly growing tensions and the certainty that the situation of the young people is hopeless, police officers were driven by a car of colleagues who arrived at the site in the meantime.
According to the same witness, the ambulance arrived "about twenty minutes after the police left".
They also performed a heart massage, but in vain.
“Let no one say that the police did not rush to the aid of the youth.
First aid was given to these young people.
The firefighters arrived immediately.
Everything has been done to save them,” the prosecutor said.
Tensions in Pakistan Rise
Pakistani police on Monday suppressed the first demonstration since General Musharraf declared a state of emergency two days earlier.
In the city of Lahore, in the east of the country, about 2,000 lawyers protesting against measures taken as part of the state of emergency were wounded by tear gas shells that, according to witnesses, used law enforcement.
The latter responded with stones, injuring several police officers.
At least 350 lawyers were summoned.
Scenarios similar to those in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police assaulted and injured lawyers.
Several of them should have been summoned.
In Islamabad, Supreme Court lawyers called for a general strike and announced demonstrations, following a wave of about five hundred arrests of opponents, human rights fighters and lawyers over the weekend.
Access streets to the Supreme Court were blocked on Monday morning in order to prevent rallies.
Further demonstrations were to take place in Multan (center) and Peshawar (northwest).
On Monday, the lawyers' movement gained support from religious parties grouped in the politically strong Muttahid Majlis-e-Amal alliance, whose president "encouraged the population to send flowers to judges who opposed the state of emergency and garbage to those who were before Musharraf."
"Musharraf's promises don't work"
Pakistan's Supreme Court is the direct target of an emergency measure announced on Saturday night.
In the coming days, he was to speak out on the legality of re-election of President Musharraf in the indirect presidential election that took place on October 6.
President of the Court Iftikhar Mohammad Chaudhry was removed and replaced.
“Everything we witness is illegal, unconstitutional and against the Supreme Court’s judgments,” the official told The News.
Parviz Musharraf's promise to give up military leadership and become a civilian president "does not pay" after a state of emergency is imposed, Deputy Information Minister Tariq Azeem said on Monday.
He was expected to give up military uniforms by November 15, when his first presidential term ended.
The Deputy Minister of Information also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
The Pakistani government has also refuted ongoing speculation in the country that a deputy army chief was to order Musharraf to be house-prisoned.
More than a third of pregnancies still make up unexpected pregnancies
This calculation includes unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as ill-planned or unexpected pregnancies.
More than one in three pregnancies (36%) is still unexpected today, according to a study conducted by the French Institut national d'études démographiques (Ined) - the State Institute for Demographic Studies, forty years after the adoption of the so-called Neuwirth Act, which enacted contraception in France.
This calculation includes unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as ill-planned or unexpected pregnancies.
Various methods of contraception, such as hormonal contraception or sterilization, still show a 5% to 6% failure rate, estimates Ined.
The contraceptive legislation has only allowed better "fertility control," the institute says, noting that the rate of use of hormonal contraception in women between the ages of 20 and 44 has risen from 5% in 1970 to 60% today.
Eight out of ten births are now well-planned.
One in five even have births calculated per month accurately and, if possible, in the spring, which is considered the most pleasant time of the year for the birth of a child.
Remarkable Repair of Space Station
More than seven hours of space work was needed by astronaut Scott Parazynski and his crew from the International Space Station (ISS) to make a remarkable repair of the torn solar panel necessary for the station’s further scientific activity.
It was a risky trip into space, which collected records for the duration, distance from the residential modules, the speed at which it was planned, and the amount of "cavity" the astronauts spent on repairing.
Problems surfaced Tuesday as astronauts from the Discovery unloaded the Harmony module, a large cylindrical unit designed to install a European and Japanese scientific laboratory (see box).
This module is some kind of landing moor for lab modules.
However, they need to be able to supply electricity.
The second task of the crew was therefore to move the seventeen-and-a-half-tonne generating module using solar panels already on the ISS to anchor at its final station.
After relocating it, the crew began deploying the module’s seventy-six-metre solar panels.
And in it, one of the panels, decomposing like a pulling harmonic,due to the tightening of the cable, was damaged on the surface of almost one meter.
Decomposition was suspended to prevent further damage to the panel.
Astronauts, who were originally supposed to make a check-out on the Discovery, and then go to repair another solar panel whose rotation system had a malfunction, were forced to devote themselves to the damaged panel.
And it was Scott Parazynski who was chosen to fly to the end of the robotic arm of the ship,added to the arm of the station, and made repairs.
He is one of the best spacewalkers of the U.S. Air and Space Administration (NASA).
Tall, robust, very agile, has a very elaborate chest and long arms.
At the age of 46, this original profession was commissioned by the doctor to "operate" the "injured" solar panel.
After thoroughly examining the damage, he cut off the defective cable and attached some "floor" to the damaged places.
He was assisted by a second spacewalker, who remained close to the alignment chamber, and also from within, by other astronauts, including Peggy Witson, the crew commander.
The tools he used, namely a mini-hockey padded with insulation to prevent an electric shock on solar panels producing several hundred volts, were invented and "after the windshield" made by astronauts on board the station.
After the operation, Scott Parazynski waited for the panel to be completely decomposed and then inventarized his tools and returned to the inside of the station.
Yesterday afternoon, astronauts were enjoying a half-day break before today, when seven astronauts return to the Discovery ship to return to Earth on Wednesday as planned.
EADS shares weaken
EADS’s shares on the Paris Stock Exchange are losing significantly after the airline and defense industry announced that it would have to spend <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.2 to 1.4 billion to cope with the A400M delay.
EADS has lost 4% and is now on the Paris Stock Exchange at 21.96 euros.
The financial group was forced to re-evaluate its expected production results for 2007 as a result of delays resulting from the slow progress in the development of the A400M engine, which is a prerequisite for the launch flight.
The price for mitigating delays in deliveries of military cargo aircraft, announced in October, was estimated at "1.2 to 1.4 billion euros, of which more than one billion for Airbus", the parent company of the European designer EADS announced.
Due to these costs, EADS will be forced to report a new profit-before-tax (EBIT) outlook next Thursday when it presents its quarterly results.
The group also disclosed that the new cost estimate corresponds to a six-month delay.
It should be recalled that EADS production results in 2006 decreased by 86 % mainly due to the costs associated with the delay of another programme, namely the giant A380.
The group originally anticipated that the first delivery of the A400M would be provided to the French army in October 2009.
Decisions for the status quo
Sunday’s election will take place without any tense expectations: The Russians will mostly elect the side of President Putin, the United Russia.
Confirming thus, after the end of the free pre-election campaign, very little of its inclination to stability, and even to authoritarianism.
Today, three days before the elections to the House of Representatives, Russian President Vladimir Putin will give voters on public-law stations a televised message, but the content of which is kept secret.
It does so from the position of the leader of the United Russia, the pro-Kremlin party, which seems to celebrate a crushing victory.
When he received foreign ambassadors yesterday, the president left nothing unsaid and contented himself with another attack on the West accused of interfering - his favorite topic during the campaign.
“We know the price of true democracy and we want to have the most transparent and open choices possible, choices without the slightest flaws in beauty,” he said.
In the eyes of the opposition, this is far from the case.
They condemn a campaign marked by various pressures.
Communist leader Gennady Zhuganov says that “never before did such a dirty election take place, not even for Yeltsin.”
Following the crackdown on last weekend’s demonstrations, former chess world champion Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for an illegal demonstration, said his lawyers continued to ban visits.
“Russians have a homo sovietica mentality.”
Against the backdrop of these parliamentary elections, which are free of tension, there are two more open questions:
"Who will be Putin's successor in the presidential office?
The Official Gazette yesterday published the date of the first round of the presidential election, 2 March 2008; candidates can present themselves to the public until 23 December.
Vladimir Putin, elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, cannot seek a third term in a row.
However, no follower appears.
"What role will Putin play after March?"
Will he be Prime Minister?
Or the head of the parliamentary majority and the all-powerful party of United Russia, which chooses a government and a president?
Either way, the outgoing ruling power will win the whole line in parliamentary elections as well as in the presidential elections.
It's a tradition.
“The Russians have a homo sovietica mentality, they don’t feel like they are masters of their destiny,” says sociologist Lev Gudkov, director of the independent center Levada.
The historian Nikolai Kopossov of the State University of St. Petersburg notices more distant contexts: civil society, Christianized five centuries after Europe in this country, has become delayed; that famous common spirit has delayed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, "Putin adhered to the paternalistic model of the state, perfectly accepted by the population, the more so that this new paternalism was accompanied not by terror, but by a certain economic well-being," says Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, the Russians "voluntarily give up personal responsibility", which they demonstrated shortly after the dissolution of the USSR.
"Why to think?"
This phenomenon affects all social strata, including the business world.
Even the official elite intends to maintain the status quo: 65 governors (out of a total of 85 heads of Russian regions) are run by local candidates of United Russia.
The new freedoms taken over from the West are often, as in the 1990s, synonymous with chaos.
Public opinion prefers stability.
Also in the name of stability, the Russians will not vote for extremists.
Conclusion of Tamara Cherednichenko, a fifty-year-old professor: "Why think?
Those in power are not so bad, so why change them?”
Loaded Memory (Memory)
After more than sixty years under a confidential regime, the Nazi archives from Bad Arolsen, which depict the fate of 17.5 million victims of Hitler’s regime, are open to the public.
To date, 47 million archive documents stored at 27 km in Bad Arolsen (Hesse) have been accessible only for "humanitarian" purposes, i.e. individually and nominally, at the request of the former victim or its authorized persons.
Eleven states in charge of managing archives – including Germany, France, Israel and the United States – agreed in May to open them to scientists and historians.
Given that the process of ratification of this agreement by all states is over, yesterday's opening came into effect.
Sensitive information
The free access of historians to Bad Arolsen will allow them to examine "especially the movement of prisoners, the population of camps and the health of forced labourers", explains Reto Meistern, director of these archives managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).
Until recently, several states, including Germany, were against making these nominal documents available to the public because of the sensitive nature of some information.
What is the alleged homosexuality or mental disability of some victims of deportation?
The registers of concentration camps or arrest warrants compiled by the Gestapo were collected after the war for the practical purpose of finding deported or forced labour by civilians, bringing them proof of their incarceration in order to open the way for their compensation.
Even today, more than 300 permanent employees in Bad Arolsen deal with tens of thousands of individual applications.
However, for part of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen represents only a limited benefit.
“Nothing fundamentally new can be expected from these documents,” said Prof. Wolfgang Benz, director of the Center for the Study of Anti-Semitism at Berlin’s Technische Universität in 2006.
EU and India aim to reach free trade agreements in 2008
Bilateral trade between Europe and India is now at nearly <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>60 billion a year.
The EU is India’s first trading partner, accounting for 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India are expecting the signing of a free trade agreement in 2008, European Commissioner for Trade Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart Kamal Nath announced.
In April last year, EU foreign ministers gave the green light to the European Commission to start negotiations with the aim of signing free trade agreements (ALE) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian States (ASEAN).
The EU is India’s first trading partner, accounting for 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but India is, according to the European Commission, the EU’s ninth trading partner.
"The free trade agreement will tremendously boost both economies" and "India will gain better market access for 450 million prosperous Europeans," Mandelson said.
Europe represents the first or second market for each of the first ten products of the European Union exported by the country's diplomat José Diálogo, the European Commissioner clarified. The Asian and European giants trade together each year for "47 billion euros in goods" and "ten billion euros in services", said this week the President of the European Commission, Danièle Diálogo, the head of the European delegation.

The Bank of England took note of the concerns and offered <0xC2><0xA3>10 billion in a five-week auction
The Bank of England said on Thursday it intends to alleviate current fears that the credit market will deteriorate again and announced a <0xC2><0xA3>10 billion bid at a five-week auction at a base interest rate of 5.75%, an offer that is unusually long.
"In an effort to alleviate concerns that financial market conditions will be very unfavourable at the end of the year and to give banks greater certainty in how to secure their cash position for this period, the Bank intends to offer a significant part of its planned reserves during the maintenance period," he said.
The bank clarifies that <0xC2><0xA3>10 billion (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>14 billion) will thus be placed on the financial market on December 6 at 12.15 GMT until January 10, at the basic interest rate.
This seems to be the first time BOE has pumped cash into the financial market in a five-week open market operation.
Normally it takes a week.
The BOE added in its statement that it “remains ready to take further measures to keep interest rates on interim interest rates” of interbank loans at the same level as its base rate.
The interim interbank interest rate was 5.829% on Wednesday.
The three-month interest rate was set at 6.6%, the highest since September 18.
Since the beginning of the summer financial crisis, the amounts placed on the financial market by the Bank of England have been linked to the fee rates that discouraged banks from using this offer.
According to some speculation reinforced by the development of the exchange rate of the pound against the euro, many prefer to opt for the amounts placed on the financial market by the European Central Bank with lower rates and more guaranteed discretion.
The UMP (Union pour un mouvement populaire) and the NC (Nouveau Centre, Nov<0xC3><0xBD> centrum) refuse to deal with the proposals of the Socialists (PS) on purchasing power
The UMP and Nouveau Centre clubs on Thursday refused to discuss the individual paragraphs of the socialist draft law on purchasing power, which is equal to the rejection of the text.
On the agenda, the text of the bill came as part of the so-called socialist "nest" (meeting initiated by the individual parliamentary group) and contained a dozen measures adopted on Tuesday by the Presidency of the PS, among which was an increase in the employment premium by 50%, the renewal of fluctuating Regulations or amendments to the TIPP.
Since the UMP and the NC voted against the discussion of individual paragraphs (180 votes to 115), the meeting was closed after a general debate, which became an opportunity for an exchange of views, sometimes more lively, between the majority and the opposition, a few hours before the televised appearance of Nicoscharpas.
PS leader Jean-Marc Ayrault has announced that his club will re-submit these proposals in their entirety in the form of amendments to the Finance Bill, which will be debated by the House next week.
A new festival is born
As a result of many speculations that C3 Presents is setting up a new festival in Philadelphia, this promoter/producer announced the Vineland Festival in New Jersey in collaboration with the Festival of the Republic of British organizer Melvin Benn.
“It’s an honor for our company to work with the person who inspired the current festival movement in America without exaggeration,” said Charlie Jones of C3 on Billboard.com.
C3 produces Chicago Lollapalooza and Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey is the summer destination for campers.
The festival is scheduled to take place from August 8 to 10 on a private farm of 500 acres, about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
The director of the Republic Festival, formerly known as Mean Fiddler, makes him one of the world's most respected festival organizers.
In 1989, he took the helm of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts 80,000 people each year.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio, and in 2006 the Festival Republic founded the Latitude Festival in Henham Park, Suffolk.
Starting in 2002, Melvin Benn, as co-owner, has also been in charge of production, licensing and organizing tasks at the Glastonbury Festival, which now has a capacity of up to 177,500 people.
Charlie Jones of C3 calls Glastonbury the “most inspiring event” he’s ever experienced and says his firm and Melvin Benn firm are working together to give the region a European-style festival event.
“Originally, we chose Philadelphia as our marketplace, and together with the Fairmount Parks Commission, we worked hard to establish a festival in downtown Philadelphia,” says Charlie Jones.
"I worked with the city and the Commission was motivated and enthusiastic about the project.
Unfortunately, however, because of the current leadership of the city, we have become involved in politics, adds Charlie Jones.
“Fortunately, we had the opportunity to discuss with Melvin Benn and we are going to establish a great festival in an exceptional place that will ultimately serve the people of Philadelphia.”
C3 Presents resurrected the Lollapalooza Festival in Chicago's Grant Park in 2005 after the Austin City Limits Music Festival in 2002.
Gross sales of both events for 2007 amounted to $9.8M and $11.3M.
Both of these festivals take place in the urban environment.
“The European model of the Melvin Benn Festival takes place in the countryside, while our festivals take place in green spaces in cities,” says Charlie Jones.
Our goal is to combine both concepts in a way to create an impression of both the countryside festival in European and the city festival in American."
Vineland is located about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
“The Vineland community, including the mayor, is enthusiastic about supporting this event,” says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to disclose the terms of the agreement, but claims "that they are advantageous enough to allow them to invest in such an event and welcome a festival that will, hopefully, have a long duration".
Charlie Jones says the capacity of this festival is “very high,” similar to the capacity of the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee, which can accommodate 80,000 people.
He says that invitations have already been sent to the groups, but nothing can yet be confirmed when the program is just being printed.
“While Vineland will have a rocky feel, the music there will be varied to attract a wide range of viewers as much as possible,” says Carlie Jones.
C3’s partners, who received the Top Independent Promoter award at the last year’s Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal faces the Terminator
It’s not easy to attract Hollywood movie studios to Montreal when Terminator himself opposes it.
This persuasion mission is one of the tasks of the delegate.
But his mandate is “politically demanding” because California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger condemns “runaway productions.”
Is it difficult for the Governor to fall into claws?
“You have to be careful, it’s the industry that decides where to go.
If he finds the conditions in Montreal favorable, he'll go there.
Our job is to offer the ones that they will consider the best,” he said.
Hunting for festivals
For now, however, Denise Turcotte’s priority is the promotion of the local film.
The Oscars hunt has already begun.
At all West Coast festivals, whether in Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, it’s about introducing Quebec films, highlighting them, and ensuring that directors provide interviews.
The Dark Ages had good publicity a few weeks ago at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake hands with the Devil is on offer in Santa Monica and will be unveiled in November at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival.
This month, Quebec also presented four short films and four full-length films at the American Film Institute Fest.
Will there be a marathon at the end of the year on the stock exchange? Experts divided 'subprime' crisis
There are less than five weeks left until the end of the administrative year and investors are already holding hands with me expecting a traditional marathon to take place at the end of the year.
This year, however, experts are not so sure that it will happen.
Banif Bank believes that "from a statistical point of view, the month of December has a positive course on the stock exchange".
However, it is not appropriate to make predictions solely on the basis of statistics, especially because, in the current context, markets are giving rise to certain doubts, at least in the short term."
These experts do not anticipate that the stock market will fluctuate in recent weeks of the year, and state that "the stock market is sustained by the existence of liquidity that is ready to invest due to the lack of alternatives with guarantees, especially a solid income influenced by the effect of turnover on the quality of the values".
Therefore, they believe that the stock market will run rather quietly, rather than without volatility, “primarily because the impact of the likely fall in Fed (Federal Reserve System) rates is not known, given the high level of oil prices and the danger of incentives to inflationary pressures.”
Javier Barrio, the head of BPI’s sales in Spain, agrees that this is not the right time for bold statements that a marathon will take place.
"There's not much reason to be happy," the expert assures.
Ibex lost nearly 4% of the maximum values recorded on November 8, when the index closed at 15,945.7 points.
However, not all experts have such a negative opinion.
Juan Solana, an analyst at Intermoney, believes that the Ibex 35 could end the year by slightly closer to 16,000 points thanks to portfolio regrouping and traditional pension supplement deposits that occur annually at this time.
However, this expert suggests that this year everything will be a little different, because he believes that the marathon will take place earlier, in the second week of December after the extended weekend on the occasion of Constitution Day.
The analyst does not believe that volatility would affect the direction of the market.
Federico Olucha, an analyst at Inversis Banco, also estimates that we are approaching the technical level and "therefore we could observe a reflection of the index triggered by reports from the US on the consequences of the credit market crisis".
Analysts believe that these consequences will be positive.
Analysts agree in selecting the titles that will make sure to bring Ibex to the new maximum odds.
Solana from Intermoney confirms that "this year is a series on strong titles".
This expert would include both large banks and some construction companies in the portfolio, "because when this period comes, the energy sector will be very expensive."
Federico Olucha of Inversis Banco, on the other hand, assures that the increases will go hand in hand with the banking and industrial sector.
Construction companies will also be able to enrich themselves in this marathon if it happens.
“ACS has been gaining new positions for several months and we hope that other construction companies, such as Ferrovial and the FCC, will follow the same path,” the expert explains.
Cyclic consumption will be at the forefront in the latter part of the year due to an increase in sales during the Christmas sales period.
This expert, on the other hand, believes that the technology will also do very well, although in this field they are not very represented in the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, December has only been a month of decline in two cases.
The real marathon at the end of the year took place in 2003, in the administrative year when the stock markets ended the crisis caused by the bursting of the tech bubble.
This year, when Ibex 35 regained 28.17 percent, December saw an increase of 6.68 percent.
We’ll see if 2007 will be the fifth consecutive profit year (Ibex has increased by 8.36 percent since January) and whether it will be able to have its marathon at the end of the year.
Two hundred branches of Popular Bank will be open 12 hours from Friday to Saturday
Popular Bank has decided to modernize most of its branches.
A total of two hundred, located in the most commercial parts of Spain.
These branches operated under the Popular Max brand are a big change for the bank.
Likewise for other Spanish entities, as it is the first group to decide to make such a leap and bet on the continuous opening hours of its branches until 20.30 hours and open on Saturday from 10 to 20.30 hours.
BBVA, another group that has also repeatedly assured that it wants to extend the opening hours of its branches, has not yet decided on this step.
In the meantime, it intends to conclude an agreement with the trade unions to cancel the opening hours of 75% of its branches on Saturday in exchange for extending the opening hours by one afternoon, although not for the public.
The results of this experience of Popular Bank will be crucial in order for other entities to join this initiative, which supports the opening hours of trades, whether or not.
This is exactly the aim of the project set up by the Popular Bank.
Gain individual clients who go to these places for their purchases, small and medium-sized companies, tradesmen and shops from selected streets, where there will be the opening of branches.
The bank wants to open 200 of these branches throughout Spain in about 18 months, as it is not about opening new branches, but only about adjusting existing ones.
For this reason, the bank modernizes the branches it already has in the business zones by adapting them to the profile of the clients in the individual streets.
Thus, the extension of the opening hours is complemented by a different concept of the branch space and a new, more current design in lighter colors.
<0xC3><0x81>ngel Rivera, the bank’s chief commercial officer, assures that this restructuring will not mean a large investment, but a larger recruitment as it moves from six employees to a branch of eight to nine.
Branch offices will even be equipped with meeting rooms for small and medium-sized enterprises and will also sell non-financial products.
Positive experience for the group.
Popular Bank has already tested this initiative in three Madrid branches.
And it was a positive experience, as <0xC3><0x81>ngel Rivera explains.
Bravo Murillo, O’Donnell and Gran Vía were chosen, and according to Rivera, it seemed to be a lucky choice.
Popular Bank currently has 2,500 branches.
And another 60 specializing in immigrants, which are operated under the Mundocredit brand, also has very long opening hours and is open even on Sundays and holidays.
PopularMax will not follow the BBVA model, when a number of its branches offer a wide range of non-financial products for sale.
“We don’t want to compete with our clients,” Rivera said.
They have just agreed with Telefónica to sell mobile phones through external staff.
Telecinco for the first time on the stock market doubled the value of its rival Antenna 3
We've done it.
Paolo Vasile, CEO of Telecinco, expressed his satisfaction at the end of the trade when he stated that the television he runs doubled the value of his rival Antena 3.
Only one thing made him happy: ‘What I am sorry about is that it didn’t happen because we grew more, but because we fell less,’ he said.
And he stressed that due to the weak market, 'we have fallen less'.
Telecinco ended trading yesterday with a shift of 2.54%.
This profit shifted their loss over the past part of the year to 15.66%.
The share value of the company controlled by Mediaset (with 52% capital) with the participation of Vocenta (an additional 13%), according to Bloomberg data, reaches <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>4,488.88 million.
Its competitor Antena 3, which fell by 1.52% yesterday and has fallen by 40.5% since January, has a half-value of 2,193.46 million.
The value of the other telecommunications companies that were assessed is 3.571 billion in the case of Sogecable, 2.518.53 million Prisa (Publisher Cinco Días) and 1.779 billion Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antenna 3 is offered because 'we are talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact is how much we are able to do in the same market, at what price and how we will evaluate it in tracking.
Telecinco announced last week that it expects to become the first television channel to exceed a billion gross advertising revenues this year, according to Giuseppe Tringali, CEO of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the group’s advertising subsidiary.
If the predicted figure had actually been achieved, this TV channel would have seen an increase in advertising turnover of 3.6% this year compared to 965.4 million in 2006.
At the same time, the net turnover of Antenna 3 increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the year (to reach 734.4 million), while the net revenue of this television increased by 0.7% (630.4 million).
One of the factors that analysts are focusing on for the best relative development of Telecinco on the stock market is the increased payout that it has retained so far: in 2006, this company, chaired by Alejandro Echevarría, shared 100% of its profits among its shareholders.
Vasile assures that although decision-making is early, this ratio could change after the purchase of 33% of Endemol together with its parent company Mediaset.
"We have an official commitment to give at least 50%, although we have always announced much more.
This year, I hope that we will be able to satisfy our shareholders, to whom we have already increased the value of Endemol by 33%.
According to analysts, the market is showing some fatigue at the moment.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its estimates of Telecinco’s profits by 4% in 2008 and 7% in 2009.
This is because, they explain, the projected revenue growth stopped from 0.5% to 8.4% in 2008 and from 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
The same company reduced the expected profit of Antenna 3 by 4.5% in 2008 and 7.5% in 2009.
3 opinions
Article 3
Ibersecurities: recommends buying both securities primarily on the basis of increased dividend yield and long-term sustainable potential.
Article 2
Caja Madrid: rated Telecinco (accumulate) better than Antena 3 (maintain) due to its 'many advantages' and trade growth.
Article 3
JPMorgan: In both cases, he recommends not overestimating them, as they face "like threats" (a saturated market and a deteriorating economic environment).
Congress Approves Transposition of MiFID Effective November 1
Along with parliamentary negotiations, which ended today with a vote by Congress on the novels incorporated by the Senate into the bill, the government has submitted a public hearing of the decree that develops the new law, with the aim that both enter into force before the end of the year.
The representatives of each party have consistently highlighted the efforts of MEPs and senators to negotiate and agree on the best standard to ensure the protection of investors and the detailed regulation of the activities of entities necessary for the effective functioning of markets.
The MiFID Directive, which regulates the Securities Trading Act, provides for the modernization of financial markets while strengthening investor protection, improves the supervisory powers of the State Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and supports cooperation between the individual supervisory authorities of the European Union.
This new regulation will enable the provision of financial advisory services to both specialized firms and natural or legal persons, and creates a new type of financial services firms (ESIS), financial advisory firms (AFIs), which join companies with securities, brokerage firms with portfolios and securities firms.
In addition, the number of systems for the execution of transactions with financial instruments is being expanded by joining regulated secondary markets with multilateral trading systems and order internalisation systems that will compete with current exchange brokers.
The law also requires investment services companies to disseminate information on the market on key aspects of their business profile, risk exposure and ways to cope with risk, and requires that they keep a record of all operations performed to simplify supervision by the CNMV.
During a hearing in the Congressional Trade Commission, several adjustments were included, among which stands out that securitised receivables were considered to be a "complex" financial instrument given the high risk to the investor, which was demonstrated by what occurred in the U.S. with high-risk mortgages.
In addition, the transposition of the Directive was used to legally outline the functions that bachelors in economics and business management can hold for 30 years after a Royal Decree was approved in 1977, which outlines professional functions reserved for economists.
At the same time, the Senate has included the creation of new professions in the financial sector, such as an intermediary who will work externally, will not require permission from the CNMV and will be able to provide product trading and client acquisition services for various investment firms at the same time.
Harmonized ISC increased by five-tenths to 4.1% in November
This indicator, which is later used by Eurostat to calculate the inflation index of the European Union, provides preliminary information on how prices have evolved in Spain during the month of November.
Its publication complies with the policy of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB) to provide data in a time and quality comparable to those achieved in the United States.
This preliminary indicator shall be calculated using the same process as used for the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices, but using different statistical modelling methods for estimating information not yet available at the time of publication.
The Spanish INE (State Statistical Institute) recalled that the information provided by this preliminary indicator is only indicative and therefore may not necessarily coincide with the final figure to be published on 14 December of this year.
"The ISC will continue to maintain a relatively high level"
Second Deputy Prime Minister and Economy Minister Pedro Solbes said that the November increase in the ISC to 4.1% is a "temporary figure", but at the same time predicted that the price index will continue to be at a relatively "high level" in the coming months.
In any case, Solbes clarified in the rounds of Congress that "although it will not be a favorable number", Spain's inflation differential to the monetary union is still "more or less" the same in the last two years.
He also explained that November "was less surprising" than the previous month, when the government did not expect such a high increase.
"We expected a value of around 4%," the Minister of Economy said on the data submitted today.
Virgin Plans to Earn 42 Billion Euros With Northern Rock in Three Years
Since Northern Rock went into crisis in mid-September and had to resort to an emergency loan from the Bank of England, its deposits have fallen by more than 50% to <0xC2><0xA3>12 billion (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>16.8 billion).
The bank then managed record deposits of more than <0xC2><0xA3>25 billion, which gradually declined over two and a half months due to client distrust, despite the government offering a 100% guarantee for the money and extending it until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, which will replace the entity’s name with its commercial financial brand Virgin Money, needs to earn about a quarter of the revenue invested in British banks over the next three years to earn the remaining <0xC2><0xA3>18 billion and reach the target of <0xC2><0xA3>30 billion.
The group of tycoon Richard Branson, known in the UK for his striking advertising campaigns, plans to spend <0xC2><0xA3>50 million (about <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>70 million) a year on advertising and marketing to achieve its goal.
The Northern Rock Bank has labeled this week’s offer by the Virgin consortium, which consists of three other companies, as the one that prefers to save them from bankruptcy.
Mayor Totany arrested for alleged corruption practices in construction
The Civil Guard detained the current mayor of the Murcia city of Totana (from the People's Party) in the early hours of today for his alleged involvement in corruption practices in construction, which were revealed this week.
One of the mayor's secretaries and the head of the local police were also arrested.
José Martínez Andreo replaced in May this year Juan Morales, the current People's MP and then mayor of the municipality, who, according to investigative sources contacted by Cadena SER TV, could be the "head" of the entire enterprise.
Police continue to monitor the buildings of the town hall and the construction commission, and no further arrests are ruled out in the coming hours.
In addition, lawyer Juan Morales, the main suspect in the corruption of construction practices, was charged earlier this week.
As Cadena SER, the lawyer of the 'human' MP Juan Morales, who was examined, was arrested on leaving Morales' residence with important documents related to corruption.
According to investigative sources, Morales is also being investigated for allegedly collecting commissions for his signing of a construction agreement with a Galician construction company, which requalified 200 hectares of land.
Eight people are currently detained.
Bono accepted the offer of the state to lead the Toledo candidate PSOE and, if they win, preside over Congress
Former Minister of Defense José Bono accepted the offer of Prime Minister and General Secretary of the Socialists José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero to lead the PSOE (Spanish Workers' Socialist Party) candidate charter in Toledo in the next general election and if the Socialists are elected, the Congress will be elected.
This was announced at a press conference by the PSOE secretary for the organization José Blanco and Bono himself, after a meeting with Zapatero, which took place today at noon at the party’s federal headquarters.
The chief executive justifies the offer to the former minister by saying that in political life "it is important to count on the best" and Bono "is among the best".
He further noted that "yes, it seems" that this politician from La Manche will be a candidate of the Socialist Party for the presidency of Congress if the Socialists win in the next election.
Bono would replace Manuel Marín, who announced on November 15 his decision not to run in the next general election and to quit his active political career in order to engage in the fight against climate change within university education.
The former minister admitted that the prime minister constantly urged him to return to the top policy he left two years ago.
He added that just as citizens know who will be deputy minister of the economy, if the PSOE wins the election, his party wanted to announce in a "transparent form" who will preside over Congress.
If Bono wins this function, he hopes to turn the House into a "house of respect and not of insult or shouting" and to achieve that "it will become more and more like citizens".
“Sometimes it seems that the only place in Madrid that cannot be spoken in peace is Congress, the Prime Minister in the Senate on one occasion has been interrupted 26 times.”
Likewise, he gave praise to the current President Manuel Marín and "his good work" and did not want to imagine himself in his place so as not to be reduced to what his opponents might consider "greatness".
Climate Propaganda
Given that the climate change movement is subjected to relentless persecution, both those who are skeptical of its predictions and those who prefer other political and social struggles must demonstrate firm cohesion.
In addition, to have a leader of the movement who is the prime minister like Zapatero and believes that this fight is more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism and even intends to sign a "new treaty with the planet."
This proposal forces him to explain why the actions or inaction of his government have contributed significantly to Spain's leadership in the European Union in non-compliance with the Kyoto Protocol.
Who is responsible for this failure, in which sectors it happens, and why his government, the government of the treaty, has not prevented it.
In addition, it forces him to explain to the Spaniards as clearly as possible what measures he intends to take to curb climate change.
Which companies will be damaged, which habits of the population will have to be changed, what energy savings, individual and collective, we will have to accept and what economic consequences it will have.
In other words, who sacrifices and who pays to save the planet.
But we did not expect such explanations, nor will we.
It’s because you have to sacrifice and pay.
Measures against climate change, real measures, are unpopular.
Expensive, uncomfortable and threatening corporate and private accounts.
Even one cent of the price of gasoline, proposed by the PSOE (Spanish Workers’ Socialist Party), seemed to Zapatero so risky in terms of elections that he hurried to reject it.
In other words, it’s about saving the planet so that it doesn’t cost anything, pure propaganda, passwords lacking any real meaning.
With impressive phrases, commissions, committees, protocols and new posts.
And contracts with the planet; this gentleman so useful for election campaigns that he does not even speak, does not accuse, does not demand anything, but is an ornament of rallies and incites tenderness.
If it is limited to being a virtual contracting party and does not require us to ride a bike and cool down with a fan.
Mayor and local police chief Totany detained on suspicion of corruption practices during construction
According to investigative sources, the Civil Guard arrested the mayor of the Murcia city of Totana, the "people's man" José Martínez Andreo, the head of the local police, the secretary of the town hall and one hospitality businessman, on suspicion of committing crimes during construction.
The mayor was arrested at his residence and taken to the town hall, where he is now housed, along with a number of police officers who also went to the Construction Commission and the Municipal Enterprise for the Management of Industrial Lands and Flats.
These three arrests came to six, which occurred last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in an operation related to the requalification of more than 2 million hectares of agricultural land into land suitable for construction, so that the Galician company Nuaria, after the payment of 4,000 illegal commissions, could build there.
In addition, two other people have not been arrested, but are accused in a short trial in the Totana court of first instance.
The first six detainees were taken to court today.
According to information sources, former mayor of Totana and a member of the autonomous parliament for the People's Party (PP), Juan Morales, is being investigated.
In addition, his former wife, the owner of a real estate agency, registered today in Totaná, and his current girlfriend, who lives in Murcia, the capital of the autonomous region, were charged.
Manuel N. A., director and owner of the Nuaria group, a lawyer and businessman from Viga, was arrested in Nigrán (province of Pontevedra), as well as Pablo José M. G., director of the company Suelo de Inmonuar, which belongs to the group and through which bribes were passed.
The investigation is being carried out by a crime group in the construction of the Central Operations Unit of the Civil Guard, whose members, in addition to the arrest, also conducted eleven searches, mostly in companies related to the arrested, based in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid province) and Toledo.
Only one person was imprisoned in Tutankhamun at the time, a well-known poultry-meat company owner in the area who could serve as an intermediary.
The Nuaria Group was commissioned to construct the largest residential complex in the Murcian town of Totany, which would represent the construction of more than 5,000 houses, a golf course and two hotels with a "spa".
The company acquired 2.2 million square meters of land in Totana, which was requalified and its project was to double the settlement of the village, which has 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group consists of companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, which are dedicated to supporting the real estate market, Conycase, which manages parking on the streets of Coruña, Venezuela and on the Fernando el Católico square in Vigo, Hogartel, which is dedicated to direct marketing, and Preconiza, which is focused on selling and promoting buildings.
That's what happens.
Article 3
If you don’t mind, we’ll leave the Book of the Month aside and maybe in the meantime we’ll have other awards and competitions.
I already have something in my head.
People, life is a change.
Of course, you can come up with ideas.
Article 2
Our Finnish correspondent sends us this comment from yesterday’s edition of the most important Finnish newspaper Helsingin Sanomat (by the way, at the beginning of the PISA report on the level of education in the world), which refers to what the newspapers printed on November 18th: on the same day when the Blackburths coincided with the criticism
"The content of the subject of philosophy has penetrated into public discussion in connection with the tragedy at a school in the city of Jokela.
The killer of the victims, a high school student, quoted in his messages the works of Plato and Nietzsche.
Pekka Elo, the councillor for education responsible for the subject of philosophy, demanded on the Helsingin Sanomat website that professors take a critical view of Plato and argued that it is not necessary to discuss Nietzsche in the compulsory basic course of philosophy in high schools.
Article 3
One colleague informs about the introduction of the criminal offence of downloading from the Internet into the Criminal Code:
A. The withdrawal of one song would be a criminal offence with a rate ranging from six months to one year.
On the other hand, when you sell a plate for less than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>400 in a store, it is considered a mere offense (<0xC2><0xA7> 623.1).
B. If you steal up to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1,000 in a store, theft is already a criminal offence, but the criminal rate is lower than for a withdrawal (<0xC2><0xA7> 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it after 40 hours, the penalty rate is still lower than for downloading (<0xC2><0xA7> 244.1)
D. It is less serious to participate in a fight than to switch compacts.
To participate in the riots has a rate from three months to one year (<0xC2><0xA7> 154 of the Criminal Code) and for the exchange of compacts would be a rate from six months to two years
(Section 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. Sexual harassment in the workplace is considered less serious under section 184.2 of the Criminal Code than downloading a film on DVD.
F. Unauthorized distribution of copyrighted films is punishable by penalties other than the provision of pornographic material by a minor (<0xC2><0xA7> 186).
So if my colleague isn't mistaken, someone's got a hand, and that's right.
Article 4
My attending physician squeezes one of his articles on strange research titled "Money causes brain activation, especially if others get less."
The feelings caused by the monthly salary of employees did not depend on how much colleagues earn.
The research was conducted at the University of Bonn using magnetic resonance imaging on a tomography scanner and the results are published in the latest issue of the journal Science.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and leader of the group "Life&Brain Neurocognic Imaging" in Germany: "The greatest activation occurred when the research participant responded correctly and his colleague was wrong."
The researchers observed that if they both succeeded, they received the same salary, the activation was mild, but when one received double, the activation was higher.
I really don't know if this conclusion required so much science.
Applicant of the Balkans
For eight years, Carla del Ponte has been relentlessly pursuing Balkan war criminals from the State Prosecutor’s Office of the Court of Justice in The Hague.
Her mandate will expire at the end of the year and Carla will leave with mixed feelings as the main culprits of the Srebrenica massacre, which killed 8,000 Bosnian Muslims, former General Ratko Mladic and former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, are still at large.
Their names are on the list, from which he took the title of the documentary film of the Swiss director Marcel Schüpbach "Karlin list" (2006, not mentioned in Spain), which follows the pace of the detective thriller from Belgrade to New York to follow the work of the Swiss prosecutor in the persecution of the prosecution.
What insurance is suitable for me?
Insurance of a car that protects the driver in the event of an accident. represents a significant expense, which depends on various factors such as age, condition, sex, length of possession of the driver's license, the type of vehicle to be insured or its use, etc.
Having a car is just the beginning.
Choosing the right car insurance is even more difficult than choosing a car model.
First of all, we need to clarify what we are talking about.
Car insurance is an agreement between the insurance company and the insurer.
This obligation takes the form of an insurance contract, which provides that the insurance company will receive the agreed amount of insurance in a certain amount for taking care of the payment of damages in the event of an insurance event.
Insurance is the price of insurance, which is determined taking into account various factors such as age, condition, sex, length of possession of the driver's license, type of vehicle insured or its use, etc.
Insurance companies determine their prices on the basis of statistics, so the higher the probability of an accident, the higher the insurance rate.
For this reason, both individuals over the age of 25 and women need to pay lower insurance, as statistics show that they have a lower risk index due to their caution.
Similarly, on the basis of inspections, insurance companies have concluded that married persons have fewer accidents than self-employed drivers.
The way the vehicle is used will affect the frequency of driving, and thus the likelihood that it will have an accident.
With increasing frequency of rides, the likelihood increases.
There are many variables that insurance companies consider when determining the price of insurance.
Therefore, the driver must carefully study the situation in order to choose the insurance that best matches his insured profile.
We will show here the most important variables for choosing this or that type of insurance, which in addition to being suitable for the type of insurer, will also be at a reasonable price.
People under the age of twenty-five face a variety of disadvantages such as little driving experience and short possession of a driver’s license when they want to negotiate insurance at an affordable price.
Although insurance against all risks is ideal for good coverage, there are also cheaper options.
The most cautious drivers can choose insurance against all risks with an insurance discount so that they get insurance coverage for all risks, but at a more affordable price.
This type of contract would involve the participation of the client in the payment of the insurance event.
"The part of the insurance event reimbursement provided by the client will be predetermined in determining the price of the insurance, which will be the higher, the lower the participation," explains Luis Noguera, chief executive of First Europe in Spain, an Internet insurance broker.
Another option is insurance extended to other participants in the operation so that the client insures against damage caused to other people, but not against damage to his own car.
In addition, it would be insured against theft, fire and loss of the vehicle.
Recommendations.
If you are under the age of twenty-five, try to be careful and avoid accidents as much as possible, as this will affect your bonus and allow you to reduce your insurance in the future.
A bonus is a reduction in the basic rate that the insurance company has.
On the other hand, malus is an increase in the above-mentioned basic rate.
"Bonus and malus will depend on the insurance company and its profits.
If the insurance company had a good year, it will be able to afford to increase the bonus," Noguera explains.
After crossing the 25-year limit, drivers find it easier to take out insurance, as the client’s risk index decreases, thanks to the experience they have gained.
For this reason, it is most recommended to take out insurance against all risks with a discount.
"Young people are usually not able to take advantage of the pre-acquired experience at the time of the accident, not even while driving," assures the director of the European company in Spain, adding that most accidents occur in the second year of the procedure, when the "fear of a newcomer" has already been overcome.
However, if the client is married but does not yet have children, it is better to take out insurance against all risks, if, of course, his economic situation allows.
Families with children are considered to be clients with the lowest risk index and therefore their premiums will be lower.
In this case, the best insurance would be insurance against all risks with an insurance discount (which could be 300 euros) or with a high bonus, insurance extended to other participants in the operation, starting the third year after the purchase of the vehicle.
"Their driving is quieter and their purchasing power is higher, so they can afford to get the highest discount," notes Luis Noguera.
Pensioners are advised to take out insurance against all risks with an insurance discount (which is 150 euros) or insurance extended to other participants in the operation, if a high bonus has been achieved.
It must be said that car insurance is something important not only because it protects the driver in the event of an accident, but also because it represents a considerable expense, which is a good reason to properly study the insurance options that would be most suitable for us in view of our personal situation.
Celtic is trying to get a point on AC Milan, which means the eight-finals
AC Milan and Celtic will measure their strength this Tuesday at San Siro in an effort to score the point they lack to reach their respective goals in the Champions League final, as it would mean for Italy to be first and for the Scots to decide on the placement.
The Italians have ten points and have already secured progress in the fifth match by scoring in Portugal, while Celtic has nine points, but need another to make sure he does not get ahead of the six-point chessboard, which will play with Benfica, which has four.
These two Group D matches will be played a week before the end of the sixth round, as AC Milan must play in the Intercontinental Cup in Japan, where it will enter the thirteenth in the semi-finals for the first time, in an attempt to advance to the final, which is played in the sixteenth.
So this group will be closed earlier than the others and the indecisive result at the Giuseppe Meazzy stadium seems to be the most likely, even if both teams try to fight for victory, because the Italians will not want to tactic on home soil and Celtic knows that after winning the ace would be the first to win.
Gordon Strachan's team could even be defeated if Shakhtar doesn't win, but he can't count on it, because at the same number of nine points, the Ukrainians who lost in Glasgow last week (2:1), but won in the first straight game (2:0).
So AC Milan players will try to spoil the evening for the Scots, who believe they will reach the semi-finals in the reorganised Champions League for the second time just as they beat them in the same match last year with Kaká's goal in the extension (1:0) after a 0:0 status in the base game time.
The hope that the Rossoneri will win will be the Schacht, for which it is worth winning, only if Celtic loses, both for progress to the eighth final and for staying in UEFA.
Benfica, although it is the last and has no chance to continue in the highest European competition, could reach third place with one win, so it would play in UEFA.
The first Spice Girls concert in Vancouver was attended by 20,000 people.
The Spice Girls began their first tour in Vancouver, Canada, in front of 20,000 viewers since breaking up in 2000.
"Posh Spice" (Victoria Beckham), "Scary Spice" (Melanie Brown), "Baby Spice" (Emma Bunton), "Sporty Spice" (Melanie Chisholm) and "Ginger Spice" (Geri Halliwell) shortly before they started their concert at the GM Place Stadium, announced the band's "Vancouver
About 20,000 people bought tickets to attend the concert, which also included a video that chronicles the history of the band, which sparked a sensation in the late 1990s.
The return and world tours take place at the same time as the release of the new album, which is released in Spain by EMI, and which brings a selection of their main successful tracks, as well as two new songs, "Headlines" and "Voodoo".
The five Spice Girls appeared on stage adorned with bracelets given to them by husband "Posh Spice", British footballer David Beckham.
This athlete was in an audience that flooded GM Place, despite nervous Victoria banning him a few days ago.
Before the show began, Victoria Beckham said of the British star that "he hasn't seen our costumes at all, so I'm nervous about what he thinks about the show."
"Sports Spice", whose departure from the group in 1998 "due to differences between us" caused the dissolution of the five-member group two years later, also showed its nervousness at a meeting with journalists two hours before the show began.
"I was scared.
I was nervous, but I saw that the world’s public opinion had changed, the opinion of the Spice Girls had changed.
And I thought why not, so I’m glad I made the decision,” Chisholm said of the group’s reunification, which she dissolved nine years ago.
The singer also noted that over time, "things got settled and we all love each other very much".
However, many things have changed since the Spice Girls last performed together in 1998.
So at first, according to CTV, the group flew to Vancouver with the special Virgin Airlines.
A nanny was waiting for her at the airport.
Five has a total of 7 children.
After the concert in Vancouver, the band will perform in California (USA), San José (December 4th) and Los Angeles (December 5th and 7th).
He will perform in Madrid on December 23.
Fears over new gas dispute between Russia and Ukraine
There is currently a dispute over the price of natural gas between Russia and Ukraine, which increases the risk that Russian supplies of this fuel to Western Europe may be affected.
Most of the Russian fuel exported to the European Union (EU) is pipelined across Ukraine and any dispute between the two countries is closely monitored.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow raises gas prices to Ukraine, Russia will charge higher transit fees.
A previous dispute between the two last year reduced deliveries to EU countries.
The latest dispute between Kiev and Moscow comes at a time when the Ukrainian government and the Russian state-owned gas monopoly, Gazprom, are trying to agree on how much Ukraine will have to pay for Russian gas in 2008.
Gazprom says it will have to charge Ukraine more because it has agreed to pay up to 50% more for the gas it is getting from neighboring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say this could mean that Ukraine will have to pay 40% more for its supplies from Gazprom.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transit states during the negotiations," Ukrainian Economy Minister Anatoly Kinach told Reuters.
“Change in gas prices should undoubtedly be linked to our arguments regarding the amount of transit fees (to Western Europe) through Ukraine.”
The last major dispute between Moscow and Kiev caused a decrease in supplies from Gazprom to Ukraine in January 2006.
This caused a crushing decline in exports to Western Europe, which dramatically increased prices.
Russian gas accounts for a quarter of supplies to the European Union.
Russia has the largest gas reserves in the world, but much of it remains underutilized.
As a result, Gazprom is replenishing its own gas supplies from Turkmenistan and other former Soviet Central Asian republics.
NHS "must check foreign employees"
The inspector said the Scottish NHS must improve criminal records checks on non-European employees.
The recommendation from the president of the Supreme Audit Office, Robert Black, came after a foreign doctor working in Scotland was linked to the June attacks on Glasgow Airport.
Mr. Black also fears that the Scottish NHS has no accurate idea of the amount of foreign personnel it employs.
But his report stressed that the other key checks were done in order on a sample of five health authorities.
The president of the Supreme Audit Office was immediately interested in staff recruited from countries outside the European Economic Area following the June attacks at Glasgow Airport.
Twenty-eight-year-old Bilal Abdullah, an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was detained at the airport after someone rented a Jeep into the door of the main terminal building.
He was one of three doctors who appeared at the Central Criminal Court using a video bridge accused of being linked to attempted bombings in the UK.
The NHS Chambers are expected to check foreign personnel for qualifications, experience and authorization to work in the UK prior to his employment.
Although the Scottish Health Commission uses Disclosure Scotland for criminal record checks, this agency has no authority to obtain such information outside the UK.
The report of the President of the Supreme Audit Office says, among other recommendations, that the commission should be guided by the Criminal Records Bureau directives, which assist employers with controls in several countries.
"While we found that some of the personnel records contained evidence of these checks, they were not carried out on a regular basis," the report said.
Mr. Black said the Scottish NHS agrees in much with its own policy of pre-employment checks, but also added: “Our report points out areas where the system could be improved to ensure accurate information about the amount of foreign personnel.”
BMA Scotland chairman Dr. Peter Terry said it was "very unlikely" that pre-employment checks would identify potential NHS employees who could commit a terrorist act in the future.
“The report suggests that the current pre-employment checks at the Scottish NHS are working well and it is unclear what additional value these comments will bring,” he said.
The Scottish health authorities have reported that they currently have 1,161 foreign workers, the vast majority of whom are doctors and nurses.
However, the president of the Supreme Audit Office pointed out that these numbers would probably be higher also because the commissions had a problem identifying staff with a residence permit.
The survey also found that NHS inspection procedures in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian are largely implemented.
They included passport checks, work permits and qualifications.
The Scottish government is currently reworking the NHS’s policy and directive on pre-employment controls for foreign workers.
Health Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: “I wanted to do this work immediately after the terrorist attack at Glasgow Airport.”
She also added that the Scottish government, in agreement with the health committees, will consider the recommendations of this report and ensure that best practices appear in the updated Pre-Employment Controls Directives for all staff - including foreign ones - which it plans to issue next month.
Joy Division wins film awards
Control, a biographical film about the late Joy Division singer Ian Curtis, has won five awards at the British Independent Film Awards, including the award for best film.
The awards were also given to star Sam Riley, who worked in the warehouse until Curtis, director Anton Corbijn, and in the supporting role of Toby Kebell.
Lady Judi Dench was nominated for Best Actress in the Thriller Scandal Notes.
Bond star Daniel Craig won a Variety Award for bringing a British film to the world stage.
The awards were presented at the London Roundhouse.
Control describes Curtis's journey to fame with Joy Division until his suicide in 1980 at the age of 23.
This black-and-white film – whose soundtrack includes The Killers, David Bowie and New Order – cost just <0xC2><0xA3>3 million.
But he won Dutch photographer Corbijn, formerly known for the iconic U2 album Joshua Tree, two awards – for best director and for best debutant director.
Rock music was the focus of another award-winning film - as Julien Temple's Clash singer Joe Strummer won the award for best documentary.
Viggo Mortensen won the Best Actor award for his role as the driver of the Russian Mafia boss in the London-based thriller The East Promise by David Cronenberg.
Ray Winstone, who has a reputation based on the roles of hard guys, won the Richard Harris Award for his extraordinary contribution to British cinema.
This 50-year-old, whose films include Scum, Nil By Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming another part of Indiana Jones - The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.
Winstone said he is proud of this award, which is named after the movie star Camelot and Harry Potter Harris, who died in 2002.
“People like Richard Harris and Albert Finney have opened the door for people like me,” he said.
"I was lucky enough to meet Richard Harris several times.
He's my man, a great actor of his time, I'm very honored."
The independent film awards, known as Bify, are awarded by a jury of filmmakers, actors and festival organizers.
Advocates and patrons of Bif include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
Saudi Arabia arrests 208 people over terrorist plot
Saudi Arabia said on Thursday it had arrested 208 militants for membership in cells preparing an immediate attack on oil facilities as well as spiritual and security components.
State TV’s largest oil exporter said one of the cells wanted to smuggle rockets into the country.
Al-Qaeda sympathizers have been campaigning against the United States, an ally of the United States, since 2003, when it invaded Iraq.
A television report reported that a cell of eight militants led by an alien was planning an attack on an oil facility in the province of Ash-Sharqiyah.
Saudi Arabia is building a rapid response unit with a strength of 35,000 members to defend the facility from an unsuccessful al-Qaeda attack on the world's largest oil refinery in Abqaiqu in 2006.
The report quoted an internal statement from the ministry: 18 detainees belonged to a cell led by a “missile launcher expert” that slipped into the country.
She also said the militants planned to smuggle eight rounds into the kingdom.
Twenty-two detainees were expected to prepare for the murders of clergy and security personnel.
The government has urged clerics to do more to prevent the Saudis from leaving for Iraq in order to join al-Qaeda militants fighting Allied forces and a U.S.-backed Shiite government that conservative Sunni Saudis consider a heresy.
Al-Qaeda militants believe the authorities have co-opted many clerics in Saudi Arabia to support the royal family that controls the government.
The militants - backed by calls by al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden to focus on the pro-Western Saudi government - focused on foreign residential complexes, government buildings and energy facilities.
"This war has been a huge effort by the security forces in the past five months," the interior ministry spokesman told state television.
A 16-member “media cell” in Medina was also arrested, aiming to promote “takfirist thinking” – an ideology of Sunni Muslim radicals that promotes violence against Muslims labeled as infidels and apostates.
Among the detainees were 32 people accused of providing financial support to the militants.
Climate on Venus may be a look into the future of Earth
Scientists announced yesterday that Venus may have once been a pleasant place to live.
Data from the orbiting European station show that the planet is even more similar to Earth’s head twin than previously thought.
Venus is the closest planetary neighbor to Earth.
These two worlds are about the same size and orbit similar paths, but Venus is a little closer to the Sun.
Scientists now believe that billions of years ago on Venus conditions were similar to those on Earth and could have been habitable.
But the terrified greenhouse effect caused by carbon dioxide, atmospheric erosion by solar radiation and lower rotational speed sent Venus along a completely different path of evolution.
Today, the planet is without water, the temperature on the surface is hot enough to melt lead and will be devastated by storms and winds of hurricane strength.
The findings from the European Space Agency’s Venus Express probe, which studied the planet for a year, offer a sober look at how Earth could evolve in the event of catastrophic climate change.
Professor Fred Taylor of the Department of Physics at Oxford University and one of the Venus Express mission leaders said: “It is becoming increasingly clear why the climate on Venus is so different from that on Earth, even though the planets themselves are quite similar.
“Our new data allow us to build a scenario in which Venus began just like Earth, perhaps with a habitable environment, billions of years ago.”
Police arrested for 'enriched uranium'
A kilogram of radioactive material, allegedly enriched uranium, was detained yesterday by the Slovak and Hungarian police.
A police spokesman said three people were detained and the material was being examined.
He did not confirm that it was enriched uranium, but said the substance could be sold for $1 million (<0xC2><0xA3>480,000).
I'm still on the edge.
Mitt Romney said presidential candidates are not worthy to answer questions from a snowman.
Despite this, Republican presidential candidates later agreed to a debate on YouTube, in which ordinary voters uploaded their queries to video and passed them on to broadcast candidates.
None of the questions on Wednesday were as comical as the snowman who asked Democrats about global warming in the other party’s YouTube debate.
But the questions and answers this time reflected much about the state of the Republican Party heading for next year’s election.
It is unclear exactly how the producers of CNN, one of the sponsors of the debate, selected the clips, which were then shown to the aspiring candidates.
But the first half-hour of the debate, the longest time devoted to a single topic, was focused on immigration.
This is one of the strongest Republican issues.
CNN asked a panel of undecided voters to turn the wheel when they heard something delightful: a spokesman noted the peaks of approval when candidates talked about a tough approach at the borders.
The toughest and longest exchange of views took place between Rudy Giuliani, the nation’s top candidate, and Mr Romney, who moved forward in key early votes in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr. Giuliani tries to shake the reputation of a man who, as mayor of New York, was soft on illegal immigrants.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts of hiring illegal immigrants to work at his home.
These two struggled especially hard when questioners asked whether any of the candidates would support "amnesty" (given illegal immigrants normal status and the possibility of citizenship).
Adjacent candidates, such as Duncan Hunter, a California congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, were able to throw their little bit into the mill on the subject.
Neither of the two have a chance to be nominated, but both remain in the game perhaps because they have begun to sound the alarm about immigration earlier and louder than the others.
At least on immigration, candidates have roughly the same view: more strictness at the borders, no tolerance for illegal migrants.
This topic, along with concerns about poisonous toys from China and other concerns with the surrounding world, helps Republicans forget or minimize the contradiction between libertines and Christian conservatives.
But the debate started to get very unpleasant when it came to other topics.
Mr Giuliani was asked why he had supported the possession of firearms in the past.
John McCain and Mr Romney discussed whether the simulated heating technique should be considered torture.
One questioner asked if the candidates believed every word of the Bible.
Mr. Giuliani came to the conclusion that although the Bible is his favorite book, he does not believe the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another questioner asked if Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee – who is now at the top of all assumptions in a recent survey in Iowa due to his long-standing Christian conservatism – said the death penalty is unpleasant but necessary.
Under pressure to decide whether or not Jesus would agree, he said that Jesus was too smart to run, earning himself a laugh.
The battle remains extraordinarily open.
Mr. Huckabee’s rise in Iowa is covered with recent successes in raising money and Ron Paul’s loud cheerfulness at Wednesday’s debate.
These two have bounced back from the bottom, as both wings of the party still cannot agree on more familiar and traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000, one of the candidates united the party very early and convincingly with the winning message of American size on the lips, eclipsing both wings of the party.
This time the side is split and the result is far from unambiguous.
The Pains of Labour
Gordon Brown has once again found a trap into which he might fall; his way out remains the same.
Although this is a habit in British political scandals, it is not particularly spicy.
No orders appear to have been sold, no bills in the Paris hotel were mysteriously paid, no extramarital fingers were tampered with.
But barricaded Gordon Brown would have gone around without it being discovered that some wealthy businessman for four years masked contributions of <0xC2><0xA3>650,000 ($1.3 million) to the ruling Labour Party under the names of other people, and that the party did not report it.
Two months ago, when the prime minister avoided calling elections and insulted British intelligence by claiming that the decision was not influenced by the polls, there was hope that it would secure a resilient and effective government.
Instead, as the increasingly funny Liberal Democrat deputy leader put it, the once feared Mr. Brown changed from Stalin to Mr. Bean.
The ruthless rescue of the troubled Northern Rock bank showed weaknesses in driving and poor judgment under fire.
Poorly thought-out proposals to change the tax code have brought companies together against the government.
The loss of personal data in 25 million people revealed unimaginable administrative laziness.
A trio of retired generals started a rebellion in the House of Lords; they protested against cuts in military spending, claiming that being a commander of the armed forces is part-time work.
Now there are multilingual gifts from David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the general secretary of the Labour (and their former guardian of internal discipline), has already resigned.
None of this means that Mr. Brown is inevitably heading towards his end.
Nevertheless, governments can reach a tipping point at which they find governance difficult.
People don’t trust politicians and don’t like them, but most of the time they put aside their mistrust when a new party takes over.
When it seems clear that some prime minister is unlikely to improve anything, and may not be in office for a long time, this is the push away: the state administration becomes punchy, the ministers begin to do briefings, the press looks for bad news, and the government becomes unfocused and defensive.
In one sense, Mr Brown's position is particularly complex, as he cannot take the position of a new skeleton compared to other political leaders.
As much as he wanted to distance himself from Tony Blair, he was his first officer.
For example, problems with Northern Rock and the Treasury records are linked to the decisions Mr. Brown made as Treasury Secretary.
And while he wasn’t directly involved in Blair’s troubles, such as the long investigation into political party funding caused by “value for money,” voters can safely conclude that he was.
Still, Mr. Brown's troubles aren't as bad as they look.
They're not as bad as the conservatives do.
As far as Mr. Bean is concerned, no one has died or been misled.
And the cure, as painful as it may be, is to provide what Mr. Brown’s Stalinist tendencies have always promised: a reliable, firm, and slightly brutal government.
The latest turmoil around political gifts is a good example.
Garboid Mr. Abrahams, who compares his gifts to charity, says he did not want any publicity for his charity.
That may be true, but the decision was not his.
Laws against the anonymity of big political donors are clear and exist for a simple reason: the public has the right to know who could buy access to those who rule the country.
Mr. Watt, who said he knew about Mr. Abrahams's actions but did not know that they were illegal, will certainly be thoroughly questioned; as will Jon Mendlesohn, the main Labour money-seeker, who learned about the mischievous donations in October.
But Mr. Brown is not involved yet; there is nothing to suggest that he knew about these skins, even though most of the payments were made only after his appearance in June.
The Prime Minister has done half the work.
Very quickly he condemned this violation of the laws by his own party, but he diluted his determination by reaching out for a proven instrument, a commission to investigate the matter - led by a retired bishop and a judge.
In this case, the lessons are not complicated.
If the law has been violated, it is a matter for the police.
In addition, there are other things Mr Brown has to do, such as finding a permanent chairman of the independent Committee on Standards in Public Life, which has not had one for six months, and moving forward with a real reform of political party funding.
That would require Labourers who are in a tight spot to cooperate with the Conservatives and perhaps even give up their special financial relationship with the unions - bitter pills for a committed party like Mr Brown.
But he should face a few simple facts.
The Conservatives now have a decent lead in the polls; he has two years to win back the voters; and the only way to win is unassailable integrity and high competence.
Card Sharks
Does the mortgage crisis affect the U.S. credit card market?
When there is blood in the water, the spinal cords naturally begin to agitate.
Now that the U.S. real estate market is shrinking, predators have focused on the credit card market there.
Analysts at Goldman Sachs say losses on credit cards could reach $99 billion if other variants of consumer loans become infected by inferior mortgages.
The signs of tension are obvious.
There is an increase in the number of cases of inability to repay (with more than 30-day payment delays) and depreciation of accounts (accounts that the provider considers unenforceable).
HSBC Bank announced last month that it had lost $1.4 billion in the U.S. consumer credit market – also due to insolvent credit card loans.
It is still too early to panic.
Accounts depreciated and inability to pay are still few.
According to the Moody’s rating agency, the 3.89% insolvency rate in the third quarter was almost an entire percentage point below average.
The deteriorating rates can be partly explained by technical reasons.
The change in the U.S. Personal Insolvency Act of 2005 led to a sharp drop in the number of reported bankruptcies, which make up a large part of the losses on credit cards; thus, the number of reports (and thus the number of write-offs) would increase regardless of whether or not the general conditions for lenders deteriorated.
The industry also has a good maturity rate, which shows how much consumers pay off their debts monthly.
And the confidence in the securities of secured credit cards is strong, despite the paralysis in other corners of structured finance.
Dennis Moroney of the TowerGroup research firm predicts that their emissions for 2007 will be 25% higher than last year.
Direct pathways for spreading infection between the mortgage crisis and the credit card market definitely exist: when real estate loans are dried up, consumers are more likely to indebted via credit cards.
However, credit card issuers tend to look at the cash flow rather than the value of guarantors, so falling home prices may not necessarily mean a change in the creditworthiness of lenders.
They can even be beneficial for loan providers.
Consumers’ motivation to repay mortgages decreases when the value of their assets falls below the value of the loan; as a result, card debt moves up on the priority list for repayment.
Card issuers will also be able to respond to more turbulent conditions faster and more flexibly than mortgage providers by changing interest rates or debt limits.
This should theoretically reduce the risks of rapid changes in the prices of guarantors.
“It won’t happen that we would just reassess all the loans one beautiful morning,” says Gary Perlin, chief financial officer at Capital One.
Although the risk of an explosion in the style of subordinated mortgages is low, the risk of gradual weakening is far more real.
If lower home prices and debt cuts push America into a recession, the credit card industry will face a darker future.
Watch out for the spinal cords.
British bankers plead guilty in Enron case
Three British bankers who were to be tried for their roles in a scam linked to former financial chief Enron Andrew Fastow changed their deposition on Wednesday and pleaded guilty.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew were originally guilty of seven fraud charges when they and Fastow were supposed to participate in financial fraud in 2000 -- enrich themselves on behalf of their employers -- they denied.
They were due to stand trial in January.
However, during the trial before U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein Jr., everyone confessed to one fraud.
The case of these three former executives of Greenwich NatWest, a unit of Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, was featured on the front page for the entire two years that the issuance process took.
In the United States, their case is one of the unclosed parts of an investigation initiated after the 2001 Enron crash.
The charges brought against them in 2002 alerted Mr. Fastow that he was the target of a government investigation into the Enron bankruptcy.
The indictment of bankers -- who earned the nickname "NatWest Troika" -- claims that they came to Houston in 2000 to conceive a fraud along with Fastow and his former chief aide Michael Kopper.
Greenwich NatWest invested in a subsidiary of Enron controlled by Fastow, the architect of many Enron frauds that spiraled Enron into bankruptcy.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank rated its share in this branch zero, but our three Britons knew it was actually of considerable value.
The company under Kopper's control bought the bank's stake in this branch for $1 million.
The incriminating bankers paid Kopper $250,000 for a stake in the company.
According to the prosecution, Fastow falsely informed Enron that the energy company would pay $20 million for its share in this Greenwich branch of NatWest.
But the $20 million actually went to those British bankers, Fastow and others.
The bankers were charged with $7.3 million and Fastow, Kopper and others improved by about $12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow pleaded guilty to two counts of conspiracy for his role in the collapse of Enron.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is currently serving a six-year sentence at a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is serving a three-year and one-month sentence at a facility in Texarkana.
All three Britons were freed on a $1 million bail order that ordered them to stay in the United States for the upcoming trial.
Enron, once the country’s seventh-largest company, went bankrupt in December 2001 after years of accounting tricks meant it was no longer possible to hide billions of debts or show failing speculation as profitable.
The collapse wiped out thousands of jobs, more than $60 billion in market value and more than $2 billion in pension insurance.
Enron founder Kenneth Lay and former chief executive Jeffrey Skilling were convicted last year for their roles in the company’s collapse.
Skilling is serving more than twenty-four years.
Lay's convictions for conspiracy, fraud and other charges were deleted after he died of heart disease last year.
Moscow's non-imperfection
The price of the Gulfstream G550, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and enough fuel for a non-stop flight from Moscow to Los Angeles, starts at $54 million.
For some of the Russian rich, however, they are small to return.
"It can carry up to 18 passengers," says Dan Firer, Gulfstream's deputy.
"But none of them are interested in so many places because it's for a close family or a corporate president."
Mr. Firer was sitting at the Gulfstream booth last Friday at the Millionaire's Exhibition, which is a four-day orgy of spectacular consumerism at a mammoth exhibition center on the outskirts of the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, more than 200 other luxury vendors have built their booths, hoping that the newly wealthy Russians are attracting everything from mahogany-laid yachts to diamond-decorated car compartments that they wouldn’t be ashamed of.
Mr. Firer looked carefully at the bright orange Porsche in the side stand.
"It's a nice car, but it's five-man and ten-man against us," he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second largest private jet market."
On the waves of oil, money pours into the Russian capital just as it did when it was Dallas.
“We went through the same stage in the 1980s when some Americans became enormously wealthy and moved to Europe, where they were viewed as materialists,” said Marshall Goldman, a fourth-year listener at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard.
Like the Saudi dispensers of the 1970s and the Japanese of the 1990s, the Russians are becoming the world’s most prominent spenders.
The most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their share of this Klondike.
In another place in Moscow this week, a conference of the luxury industry attracted Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, president of the LVMH group, to exchange ideas on how to sell expensive goods in markets such as the Russian one.
(The conference is hosted by The International Herald Tribune, owned by The New York Times Company.)
According to the list of the richest people, Russia has 53 billionaires with a total currency of 282 billion dollars.
In addition, the Center for Economic and Financial Research has published a report on the development of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, according to which there are 103,000 “second-tier” millionaires in Russia, whose assets total $670 billion.
(The World Bank reports that in 2005 15.8% of Russians lived below the existential minimum.)
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow -- and that's why we're all here," said Nicole Marais, sales and marketing representative for London's jewelry store David Morris.
It was the first time at the fair, together with the Russian distributor of the brand, Soho Jewelry Group.
“All women are perfectly adjusted, and men are each for the whole fortune.”
Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and five-year-old Svetlana Turovcova described themselves and their clients as millionaires.
“I’ve been looking at those cars and I can’t decide between Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche,” said Miss Yumatov, who dressed up as a veteran of red carpets, alongside Joan Rivers looking like a home run.
The fair seemed to focus mainly on fresh rich people, brand-driven Russian shoppers, who are willing to sit for a few hours on the road so that they can walk through the warehouse, which crisply mixes Cadillac Escalade, platinum fish, ice cream.
Members of the general public could buy tickets for 30 euros ($44.57).
"The Russians are interested in which brand is the most expensive and best," said Mr. Gijrath, who patriotically occupied the booth of Dutch porcelain manufacturer Royal Delft before reproducing Rembrandt's hand-painted blue tile painting in a lifetime size.
"Of course, the Russians are more interested in gold."
And indeed, the sellers here say that the Russians with old money (by Russian standards it is 10 to 15 years old) have already moved from flashy logos to little-known brands of limited editions that would never show up at the shopping fair.
Thousands of people, whether millionaires, envoys of millionaires or mere tourists, flooded the trade fair halls every day.
And some of them shopped.
On the first day of the exhibition, last Thursday, Roman Ershov, local bed manager King Koil, said he sold two sets of mattresses of silk, cashmere and cotton, intertwined with gold threads, for $70,000 each.
Also on the first day, Mikhail Lyubimov, the sales manager of A1 Moto, which equips high-end cars with high-end alarms, said his company sold a bright orange Porsche for $170,000 to a Russian millionaire.
On Sunday afternoon, Andrej Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, which customizes luxury cars on request, said he sold three lattices into cars in the style of connected chain bracelets for the Rolls-Royce Phantoms for $55,000.
He showed a reporter a wheel of a car designed for a Russian casino owner, which had a braid coated with Swarovski crystals so that it looked like a roulette wheel.
Price: $22,000 for four of those.
“The Russian millionaire who wants a wheel made of ostrich leather or a portrait of his wife made of cubic zirconia may not be riding those wheels yet,” Mr. Karapetian said.
"He'll put them in his garage for thirty to forty cars."
Although many of his Russian clients are wealthy, Mr. Karapetian said that the phrase “Russian millionaire” does not mean anything very exclusive at the moment, given the large increase in the prices of real estate here.
“If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you’re probably already a millionaire, at least on paper, if not in cash,” he said.
"There are more of them than you think."
Those who are not millionaires could at least pretend to be wealthy at a booth run by the Russian company Alliance Continental, which deals with asset management.
The company has erected four red British-style telephone booths stuffed with $1 million worth of counterfeit banknotes.
Azad Karryev, the company’s marketing manager, said his team printed 500,000 counterfeit banknotes for the Millionaire’s Fair.
The passers-by stopped to throw around a pile of money, or to let their friends take pictures on their mobile phones while they were resting in the middle of substitute wealth, or to simply clog their pockets for a few million.
"You know, in Moscow everyone can feel like a millionaire," Mr. Karryev said.
Death in New Jersey Possibly Caused by Corrupted Surgery
It was the day before Thanksgiving when Roland Livingston looked out the large windows of the restaurant here a little healthier and watched an ambulance come to the white New England cottage two houses down West Scott Avenue.
Soon a police patrol car joined.
And then another.
"Then I saw the coroner's van arrive," said Mr. Livingston, the restaurant inspector.
"At that moment, I knew someone had died."
Authorities have learned that the dead woman was Olga Arroya, 41, an executive assistant to the director of the Newark police department.
Investigators are now trying to determine if she died due to a procedure performed by an unlicensed plastic surgeon whose identity the police refused to provide, who worked at the house number 212 on West Scott Avenue.
Authorities have yet to find out what caused Ms. Arroy's death, and hope that toxicological tests, the results of which may not be known for weeks, will help solve the mysterious death that sent a wave of sadness under the leadership of the Newark Police.
Ms. Arroy has been an assistant to the police chief, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice has been known to many in the department.
"She was loyal, hardworking and hardworking," McCarthy said of Arroyo in a telephone interview on Wednesday.
"She was my shield.
She would protect me.”
Mr McCarthy said Ms. Arroy was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer who works for the Alcohol Control Commission, and that she left behind two sons aged 14 and 11 and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, a spokeswoman for the Union District Attorney, Theodore J. Romankowa, said detectives were trying to find out if Ms. Arroyo died from the consequences of an unlicensed surgery.
"It's one option," said Miss Walsh.
"The investigation is still going on."
Authorities said they arrived at the house at about three o'clock in the afternoon.
In November, they found Miss Arroyo on the couch.
She was pronounced dead on the spot.
More than a week later, authorities still said little about their investigation or about the owner of the house, who is allegedly Flor Margarita Castro.
Ms. Walsh didn't say if the authorities had heard Ms. Castro.
Investigators are trying to determine whether a part of the house was used as an office.
On Wednesday in Miss Castro's house, with a ruined pink bush in the front yard and a Dalmatian barking in the back, no one answered.
Next to the door that led to the cellar, a blue barrel with the inscription "Ethyl Vanillin" - which is a substance used as a substitute for vanilla in food and cosmetics - sat in the open garage.
There were two mountain bikes hanging on the hooks on one side.
Mr. McCarthy recalled that when he first came to Newark after 25 years in the New York Police Department, Ms. Arroy provided him with invaluable help in biting the intolerable and harsh political culture of his new city.
"She said, 'You should be careful about this one or this one,'" he said.
"She was always there when I came in, and she was always there when I left.
It was embarrassing."
The hope that the Fed will cut interest rates leads to the strengthening of the world exchanges
Stock prices on both sides of the Atlantic jumped yesterday after the market hopes that the Federal Bank would try to calm lending conditions by further lowering interest rates were bolstered by reassuring statements by the U.S. central bank’s vice president.
The stock exchanges jumped in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kohn, second in a row behind Fed chairman Ben Bernanke, said that in response to continued pressure on financial markets, managers must be “flexible and pragmatic.”
As part of an apparent effort to calm up the irritated markets amid hints of reviving credit efforts, Kohn said the recent upheavals "partly reversed some improvements in the functioning of markets at the end of September and in October".
He further said that if increased instability persists, the likelihood of further deterioration in the financial conditions of households and companies will increase.
Investors see these statements as a signal that the Fed is ready to deliver additional fresh capital instalments to U.S. markets, and possibly further interest rate cuts to stabilize credit conditions.
These remarks also helped calm Wall Street amid other bad news about the U.S. economy, when home sales in October showed record lows.
The consequences of the financial turmoil were underscored by the announcement by the investment bank Bear Stearns that it would cut 650 jobs, which is 4% of its global workforce, as part of the cost reduction due to the compensation of heavy losses caused by the unsuccessful bet on providing inferior housing loans in America.
It is expected that only 20 of these places will be abolished in London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Index grew by 331 points, or 2.55 percent, to close at 13,289.40, while the more widely used S&P 500 index grew by 2.65 percent.
The London FTSE 100 strengthened by 165.5 points, or 2.7 percent, and closed at 6,306.2, with the value of British blue-chips rising by more than <0xC2><0xA3>39 billion.
The German Dax index grew by 2.6 percent and the French CAC40 strengthened by 2.3 percent.
Some time ago, credit tensions in the markets showed their full strength after the European Central Bank’s three-month cash packages auctioned on loans to European commercial banks at a rate of 4.7%, the highest since April 2001.
Pressure on the Bank of England to follow the Fed and the ECB and release over-the-counter money into London’s money markets has risen as the rates of the three-month UK interbank loans “Libor” rose after an uninterrupted growth of 6 percent since November 12, 2019.
England must decide: Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
We have two dilemmas, one almost as heavy as the other.
Who's going to be number six for England this weekend in Kandy, Owais Shah, or Ravi Bopara?
And, in a broader context no less relevant than the first Test against Sri Lanka, who should make this decision?
The second question is relevant because David Graveney, the chairman of the selection committee, who holds this position at the best of his time, has Peter Moores, the head coach, and Michael Vaughn, the captain, with the decision to help, and because he will take the desk of Hugh Morris, the head manager of the nation, to the post of chief executive.
Anyone who doesn’t rank sixth will be unhappy, but life often isn’t fair and sport isn’t at all.
It is not easy to find what gets one to the top of his profession, while someone else will never get over the lower level, sometimes because of a lack of luck rather than abilities.
Not only in cricket, the selection is demanding and requires an assessment, which in the end must always be subjective.
Is it time for Bopara to move up?
Is it fair to Shah, if so?
We could ask the same question in another area, let's say here: John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, both smart young executives with a good education and background in the field, should be promoted to the commission - there's only one place.
Who is to say which level is right for a cricketer if he is not given a chance to drop or sail to the next one?
Of course, the numbers have a big impact on decision-making, but they also have opportunities.
In the team, a cricketer must catch the captain’s eye at the right time if he is to take the wicket, and a batter needs regular chances in the starting positions if he is ever to make an impression as a one-day cricketer.
Capturing the view of the selector is more complicated.
For example, last season there were many better ones than James Anderson, whose place in the first Test seems certain, even if Stephen Harmison declared himself healthy and threw as an artilleryman.
Anderson took 32 wickets in first class in 33 runs each.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 at the same modest average, but both had their moments at the highest level and are hoping for another.
Whether he will play at the Asgiriya Shah stadium or Bopara can only be a matter of opinion.
The choice may start or end the career of both, or may not have much impact.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in each Test and in the first class he gave good performances, five wickets and 40 free runs, but it was Paul Collingwood who fought for his place at the same time, who eventually became a stable Test cricketer, who is a top scorer, despite having scored two goals in Australia.
It is more likely that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, after another discussion following today’s training purely at Asirgiya Stadium, will follow their conservative instincts and prefer Shah’s greater experience to Bopar’s youthful lushness.
There are arguments for both.
For Shah, his sparkling and valuable debut Test shifts at 88 points in Bombay and 32 hundred in the first class against six Boparovs, who is, at the age of twenty-two, seven years younger and has excellent statistics against spin overtaking.
However, in two shifts in May against the Caribbean in the Test at Lord's, his home court in Middlesex, Shah made only ten runs, along with the immediate rejection of the pickers, when Vaughan wanted to re-occupied him at something in the next match.
On the other hand, the Essex universe has the joy of living in its bones.
On the cricket field, he is not afraid of anything and his behavior outside the field is symbolized by a recently overturned car with a four-wheel drive on the day of the exhibition of the English team’s automotive sponsor, Volkswagen.
He escaped with slight injuries and probably shock, but first he pulled out his Vodafone (of course also sponsored) and called Alastair Cook, his co-star, who watched it from a distance to ask him excitedly, "Did you see that?"
Bopara is definitely better in the field, his medium-speed slingshots on the pitches that seem to suit him, distributes efficiently and fires confidently and skillfully.
Choosing the right person is one thing, choosing the right time is another.
Maybe that’s the real art of choice.
Personally, I am inclined to give Bopara his chance now, which is not to say that Shah will not excel if, as Ceylon tea tickets suggest, it will be him who will play next weekend.
Buses take refugees back to work - and to fight al-Qaeda
The first buses full of Iraqi refugees from Syria began arriving in Baghdad yesterday, landing refugees who had run out of money or expired visas, and others who hoped the city would return to normal life.
Some have even returned to fight the armed men who have driven them out of their homes.
Mansur bus station was already before 800 people arrived from Damascus in an official government convoy for a dozen buses, full of refugees from Syria and Jordan, who returned by private transport.
"I decided to go to Syria after many doctors were killed in Baghdad," said Sabah al-Kubaysi, a Sunni doctor.
“Today I came back because of what I saw on TV and what I read in the newspapers, what was happening in Baghdad and how safe it is now.
"They say Mahdi's army stopped killing people," he said, referring to the Shi'ite militia of the militant cleric Muktada al-Sadra, who temporarily ordered his people to stop fighting.
Qasim al-Atwani, a thirty-eight-year-old Shia teacher from the predominantly Sunni region of Amariyah, returned with his two children because he could no longer renew his Syrian visas and because the regime there did not allow Iraqis to work.
His Shiite neighbors in Amarya called him, saying that the U.S.-backed local defensive forces had helped push al-Qaida out of its positions west of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of the newcomers from Jordan is a leader of a Sunni and Shia tribe who was driven from his home in Sleikh, northern Baghdad by a grenade attack after urging his fellow citizens to rebel against al-Qaeda.
He came back to fight.
“I got a phone call from a number of friends who told me that a militia is marching against al-Qaeda in Sleikh and that it needs me and the support of my boys.
That's why I came back today," said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62.
Many have spoken of the appeal of calm in the capital after the strengthening of the U.S. military presence and the growth of local "groups of interested citizens" who are defending their quarters with guns in their hands alongside the U.S. military.
But there was more talk that they were forced to return by the obstruction of visas and the loss of money in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have fled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarraj, the father of three children, expressed suspicion among the refugees that Nuri al-Maliki, the Shiite prime minister, had asked the Syrian government to impose restrictions on the visas of refugees, forcing them to return.
According to available data, more than two and a half million people have fled Iraqi sectarian murderers.
"Everything was fine before al-Maliki visited Syria and pushed the government to stop giving Iraqis visas to have to go back to Iraq," the Sunni pensioner said.
“I can’t trust a government that supports the criminals who burned my house after I left.”
A partial reason for the escalation of violence is the fact that Sunnis have been pushed out of Shia areas and vice versa, which in many places reduces tensions.
There are fears that the sudden influx of refugees will again excite sectarian tensions and lead to further fighting.
Little Sardinia, good education
Germany’s smallest country plays a leading role in vocational education, excelling even in the international focus of its universities.
Only in one area of education is the Saarland concerned by the same shortage as the rest of Germany.
"To a man who does not come from Sardinia, I explained yesterday for the fiftieth time that we are not French" - this self-ironic slogan appears on posters in Sardinia on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of this smallest federal country.
At the same time, France and Luxembourg play a major role in the Saarland education system, which monitors the education of the Cologne Institute for Economic Research (IW) in fifth place.
As a result, universities have traditionally cooperated closely with neighbouring countries.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded by the French in 1948.
Even today, students can finish their studies with a double or even triple diploma.
This corresponds to a relatively high proportion of international students, which is 15.6%.
After all, the above-average number of Sara children is admitted to college - many of them even without studying in high school.
"In the Saarland, a vocational education system is used," says Axel Plünnecke, education expert at IW.
With more than one in five young people eligible to study at a vocational school, the Saarland is more than 7% above the German average.
Compared to the rest of Germany, there are plenty of options in Saarland to combine practical and academic education.
Opportunities to study two disciplines are the second best in Germany in terms of population.
Despite practically oriented education and rising demand, the number of engineering graduates has fallen by a third in recent years.
That is why the Saarland Ministry of Education has now ordered universities to create a promotional campaign for the engineering fields.
"After the first study of Pisa, we carried out several reforms at general education schools," says a spokesman for the Ministry of Education.
Therefore, the government has introduced comparative tests throughout Germany.
In order for children to start learning as soon as possible, the last year of kindergarten is free - a model adopted by other federal countries.
If the results of the pupils improve significantly, future comparative studies will show.
When the Pisa study was conducted in 2003, the proportion of pupils at risk decreased from 29% to 20%.
Overall, however, Sardinia has not improved as much as other federal states.
Bavarians are better at counting.
And to the disappointment of Sarsko Pisa studies do not match the knowledge of foreign languages - otherwise Sarsko could score precisely in this area.
The language of the neighbors is mandatory in high schools - even if the inhabitants of Sarre are not French.
Chávez moves the clock
What you don’t see is that the clocks in Venezuela will go differently than in the rest of the world.
On December 9, President Hugo Chávez will let the clock go back half an hour in this South American country.
Meanwhile, in Spain, Chávez is becoming a ridiculous figure.
The official newspaper of Venezuela reported that under the new law, the clock will shift by minus four and a half hours from world time.
The South American state will be this step in a time zone that does not exist in any other country in the world.
Chávez, the enemy of the United States, justified his decision, among other things, by imposing on the world the division of time zones for hours.
In addition, on Wednesday, Chávez announced that he was breaking ties with neighboring Colombia because of the hostage crisis.
This left-wing nationalist has said that as long as the conservative Alvaro Uribe is president of Colombia, he will not have any relations with him or with the Colombian government.
“I can’t because of my self-esteem anymore,” said Chávez, who is pushing for a constitutional reform that the citizens of this oil-rich country must vote on in a referendum on Sunday.
With this reform, Chavez would significantly strengthen his power in the country.
Uribe’s decision to withdraw Chávez’s mandate to negotiate with the Marxist rebels in Colombia for the release of hostages sparked controversy.
Uribe “swiped Venezuela’s face” with his decision, Chávez criticized on Sunday.
In Spain, everyone is talking about Chavez.
A new mobile ringtone has sparked an uproar here: "Por qué no te callas" (Why are you not quiet anymore?) - this is the phrase that has been downloaded from the Internet by more than half a million people.
It was spoken by Spanish King Juan Carlos, who at the recent Ibero-American summit was so annoyed by the leftist populist’s remarks that he silenced him in this way.
Germans at Risk of Lower Pay in 2007
According to the forecast, German employees are at risk of real wage reductions this year despite the strong economic situation.
Experts have justified their pessimistic prognosis for a number of reasons.
According to estimates by the Hans Böckler Foundation, in 2007 employees can realistically expect to receive lower wages than last year.
"The blame lies with a slight increase in wages, a rise in value-added tax and a rise in prices for food and energy," Gustav Horn of the Institut für Macroökonomie und Konjunkturforschung (IMK) told Bild.
New burdens on employees may also await in the field of unemployment insurance.
Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück told the newspaper Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung that the planned reduction of unemployment insurance contributions to 3.3% by the new year is correct and reasonable in this situation.
However, the Federal Labour Agency should no longer fall into such difficulties as to have to demand loans or contributions from the Federal Youth, the newspapers of this social democratic policy quoted.
On Tuesday, it was revealed that a price explosion in food and oil products has pushed inflation to its highest level in 13 years.
In the annual comparison, prices rose by three percent overall.
Venus is the Earth's infernal twin.
Despite its hostile atmosphere, Venus is more Earth-like than previously thought. The European space probe Venus Express on Venus has detected phenomena that occur on Earth in winter: lightning in the atmosphere and wind beliefs at the poles.
For nearly three decades, scientists have suspected that it is flashing on Venus.
Now the European probe Venus Express has brought evidence - it has captured electromagnetic waves on the edge of the atmosphere. On Venus, lightning strikes from the cloud to the cloud at a height of about 56 kilometers, wrote in the scientific journal Nature Christopher Russell from the University of California, Los Angeles.
According to a well-known theory of the formation of primary matter, life could be created on Earth by lightning. Storms are said to have triggered reactions in the oceans that led to the formation of amino acids, the basic stones of life.
On Venus, it wasn’t: “If life ever existed there, it must have been a long time ago,” explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institute in Washington.
Today, there is hardly anything alive on the surface of Venus. The atmosphere is about a hundred times denser than on Earth, and sometimes there are temperatures around 500 ° C.
"Venus may be the Earth's infernal twin, but it's a twin," Russell said.
Why Venus, which is so similar in mass and size to Earth, began to evolve completely differently, is a fundamental question of Esa's mission.
Since no probe has been sent exclusively for the purpose of studying Venus since the early 1990s, the launch of the Venus Express probe in November 2005 was a milestone in the research of this planet.
According to the scientists, the latest results of the research, which brought several articles in the journal Nature, did not only emphasize the uniqueness of Venus in the solar system.
"They have also shown that our neighboring planet is more Earth-like than previously anticipated," Esa said.
In addition to the already known windstorms at the North Pole, scientists have found a cloud vortex at the South Pole that rotates much faster.
This phenomenon resembles air currents in the northern hemisphere, writes the research team led by Guiseppe Piccioni of the Italian Institute of Spatial Astrophysics and Cosmic Physics.
The second innermost planet in our solar system is nearly the same mass as Earth, and with a diameter of 12,100 km, it is almost the same size.
This planet, known as the Dawn or Evening, will orbit the Sun in nearly 225 days.
However, around its own axis it rotates much slower. One day on Venus takes 243 days on Earth.
Although Venus does not resemble Earth at a surface temperature of 460 °C and a pressure of 92 bar, scientists assume that both planets were formed under very similar conditions.
Water has accumulated on both, but it has remained in the oceans on Earth, while it has evaporated into space from Venus.
While carbon dioxide on Earth is bound in carbonate on Earth, on Venus it forms most of the atmosphere.
Köhler defends Merkel's meeting with the Dalai Lama
Federal President Köhler demands the end of party disputes over the adoption of the Dalai Lama in the chancellor's office.
The SPD indirectly criticized her attacks on the chancellor after a meeting in September.
Federal President Horst Köhler is concerned about Germany’s reputation and calls on the big coalition to end the dispute over the adoption of the Dalai Lama.
"We should not present ourselves outside as a nation that is not united on this issue," Köhler told the Wirtschaftsblatt.
At the same time, he expressed sympathy for German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s decision to accept the Dalai Lama in September.
“Although I respect cultural differences, for me human rights are universal,” said Köhler.
While he stressed that everyone knows that Germany must maintain a reasonable balance in foreign policy, this did not stop him from stopping Merkel when she was accused of creating a new policy towards China.
“The Federal Chancellor has not abandoned the traditional policy of a united China.
China knows that too," Köhler said.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) indirectly expressed his disapproval of the adoption of the Dalai Lama, and was therefore attacked by the coalition.
Steinmeier complained, among other things, about the coalition’s “leading” foreign policy.
After the adoption of the Dalai Lama in the Chancellor’s office, German-Chinese relations deteriorated.
Not only has the Chinese government cancelled the invitation of German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrücke (SPD), but, according to the magazine SPIEGEL, it has also frozen the so-called strategic dialogue between the two foreign ministries.
Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao has urged Chancellor Angela Merkel to acknowledge that the adoption of the Dalai Lama was a mistake.
China does not approve when European politicians officially accept the Tibetan spiritual leader, Wen Jiabao stressed China's position.
The words and deeds of the Dalai Lama have shown that Tibet, along with other Tibetan regions that are also located in China, are trying to separate from China.
Schäuble warns of similar upheavals that erupted in France
Street battles with police, shootings, burning cars. Wolfgang Schäuble warns of similar riots that erupted in France.
We must do everything possible to ensure that social dissatisfaction in Germany does not overwhelm the violence on the streets, the Federal Minister of the Interior calls for.
The barricades were burning, rioters were firing shotguns at the police. After serious riots among young people in France, Federal Minister of the Interior Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) fears similar developments in Germany.
“We must be careful not to create such social tensions among us that they will burst into violence.
We have to take it seriously," he told the Hannover newspaper Neue Presse.
Not every young person is able to cope with the rapid change of social reality.
The federal government, countries and municipalities are already working hard to solve the problems, Schäuble said.
This is not just about the integration of migrants.
"From the summit on integration to the conference on Islam, we are seeing first successes."
However, caution is still in place.
At the same time, Schäuble pointed out that the planning and sociological problems of the German suburbs are not comparable to those of the French.
In recent nights, youths and police in the northern suburbs of Paris have been engaged in tough street fights.
Cars and public buildings were also burning in Toulouse.
Greater integration efforts by the German government were demanded by the head of the Turkish municipality in Germany, Kenan Kolat.
With regard to the unrest in France, Kolat warned of a "imitative effect".
The situation in Germany should not be as explosive as in France.
Nevertheless, action should be taken.
Kolat pointed out that among people under the age of 25 who come from migrant families, the unemployment rate is "exceedingly high".
First and foremost, it is necessary to ensure a greater number of study opportunities.
Kolat emphasized: "We have to give young people hope."
The head of the Turkish municipality, however, added that in Germany, unlike France, there is more social control of families.
In addition, many teenagers from migrant families do not want to destroy what their parents built here.
Kolat urged, "But we must be careful."
We need to "allow young people to quickly start working and educating themselves."
In the meantime, the night in the Paris suburb of Villiers-le-Bel was mostly quiet.
Hundreds of policemen were deployed and a helicopter with headlights flew over the area.
Authorized authorities reported three arrests and several incendiary trash cans and cars.
Since yesterday, about 1,000 law enforcement personnel have been deployed.
Police will intervene as long as necessary, Interior Minister Michelle Alliot-Marie said after a visit to the suburbs.
Around 80 police officers were injured in riots in the suburb of Villiers-le-Bel on Tuesday night.
The following night, the riots in Toulouse took place.
The incident was caused by a car accident on Sunday, in which two young people lost their lives.
According to preliminary findings of the Prosecutor's Office, the police are not to blame for the deaths of teenagers.
In the realm of Angela "Clouds"
The chancellor’s reality-remote output documents that the coalition is programmatically at the end and that we can expect nothing more from it.
In what country does the Chancellor live?
After her inconsolable, indifferent-sounding and content-poor speech at the general debate of the Federal Parliament, we must state: not here - not in this country, which she should manage after all.
To the regret that she is too focused on foreign policy, Angela Merkel once replied with a very arrogant sentence.
That’s provincial, she said, showing that she doesn’t want to understand what the critics are talking about.
In the House of Commons, she clearly showed everyone how much she deserves to be regretted.
Merkel did not feel any real interest, let alone a feeling for the problems in the country.
Instead, Angela "Cloud" presented herself: a politician who stands out above others, who flees to foreign policy and even there expresses himself only in fog.
For example, climate protection: it constantly praises the conclusions of the Heiligendamm summit, but no longer says how the given climate goals should be achieved in Germany.
And in any case, such self-complainance - so much dishonesty would have been forgiven by the CDU president two years ago.
Now she is confined to flat phrases that could increase her popularity among people.
With this approach, he damages his image of a pragmatist who does not need to be flattered because he solves problems.
But in the realm of Angela the Clouds, internal political problems are a marginal matter.
Child poverty and the worries of low-wage people?
A few extra sentences on these topics are left to her.
It is worth noting how often Merkel is overreacting when it comes to child benefits.
Merkel has to start from the beginning three times to be able to utter at least partly the right sentence.
As soon as things start to become too specific, it stumbles like in completely foreign terrain.
Department of Attack
The debate over Republican presidential candidates on YouTube has sparked a fierce debate over Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney's favorites - and both must now fear an outsider candidate.
The tension between the two candidates is already evident in the first issue.
Mitt Romney accuses his rival, Rudy Guiliani, of making New York a “refugee for illegal immigrants.”
Giuliani quickly reacts with harsh regrets: "I think his own house was just one such refuge," he responds, dismissing the former governor of Massachusetts as privately employing undocumented immigrants.
Since the Republican base does not yet have a clear favorite, eight presidential candidates are using these debates on CNN mainly to discredit their opponents.
Half-minute videos, recorded by internet users and uploaded via Youtube, serve only as such help on a key topic.
"It is precisely this policy of isolationism that we have allowed Hitler to take power," John McCain said in a statement to his rival Ron Paul, who is the only one who advocates an immediate withdrawal of troops from Iraq.
Vietnamese veteran McCain does not spare Romney for refusing to condemn a tortured interrogation method called “Waterboarding” in which heating is simulated.
The reaction of the audience in St. Petersburg, Florida, shows that neither the war in Iraq nor the methods of torture are among the important themes of the campaign.
The public bursts into applause whenever conservative values are praised and future tax increases are rejected.
This is where the weaknesses of the two favorites lie.
"I was wrong at the time," Romney said, asking the party base and the television audience to forgive him for being a supporter of abortions back in 1994.
Giuliani is embarrassed to comment on the literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharraf for the first time in civilian rule
The day after his resignation as commander-in-chief of the army, Pakistani ruler Musharraf took an oath of office.
This marks the end of eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
Pakistani President Parviz Musharraf took an oath of office on Thursday, and will remain in the presidential office for another five years.
Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony live at the presidential palace in the capital, Islamabad.
Musharraf swore he would honor the constitution and strive for the welfare of the nation.
On Wednesday, he handed over his office to his trustee Ashfaq Kiyani, subjecting himself to international pressure, especially from the United States.
Eight years after taking power in a bloodless military coup, the former general reigns for the first time as a civilian head of state.
With his resignation from the position of commander-in-chief of the armed forces, Musharraf fulfilled one of the main demands of the opposition and the West.
Another central demand is the lifting of the state of emergency, which Musharraf declared on November 3.
According to Attorney General Malik Muhammad Qayyuma, Musharraf will abolish the state of emergency soon after his oath, fulfilling another of the demands of the West.
The country's highest court, which Musharraf seized with lawyers after declaring a state of emergency in early November, rejected all objections to the controversial re-election of the head of state on October 6.
Meanwhile, five soldiers were killed and four others wounded in an attack on a military convoy in the tribal area of North Waziristan.
An army spokesman said the bomb exploded on a road near the border with Afghanistan.
The father of the krautrock is back
The famous German band of the 1970s is playing again. Three members of the Harmonia group took their electronic synthesizers again at a concert in Berlin.
Revival will also include Live 1974, a cut from the band's most successful period.
At the time, they were much better known abroad.
The reported sensation then consists in the appearance of three seated gentlemen, who initially look like they are just enjoying dinner.
Everyone has a box, cables and especially buttons in front of them.
Thirty-three-year-old Dieter Moebius is in a snow-white shirt sitting in the middle.
To his left is seventy-seven-year-old Michael Rother, who has a laptop and guitar in front of him.
Thirty-seven-year-old Hans-Joachim Roedelius, who is focused on the synthesizers, is on the right from the viewpoint of the audience.
Everyone contributes sounds, sometimes even beats.
Sometimes, inadvertently, a traditional song comes out of them.
It doesn't seem to bother the musicians too much.
Among krautrock lovers, the revival of the band Harmonia caused considerable excitement.
One thing is worth noting here. Repeated questions have shown that while this name is part of the collective awareness about pop, it is certainly not so long-lasting that someone has been painfully missing this band for twenty-three years.
But why couldn’t even a German celebrate his still-living legends of the seventies?
And especially when you value a musical style, mistakenly called krautrock, in England and America more than in your own country.
When the music business awarded the remaining members of the Cologne group Can the Echo Award for Life's Work in 2003, the hall was filled with questioning views of German pop fans.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers thanked La Düsseldorf and Neu! in their speech, the audience’s amazement no longer knew the limits.
Michael Rother later joined the Red Hot Chili Peppers on stage as their old friend.
The problem of ignorance at home and worship abroad is one thing.
By remembering the band Harmonia we overburden the memory, this trio existed for only two years, and even at that time it was far from having the influence that others later attributed to them.
Moebius and Roedelius had previously played with the artist Conrad Schnitzler under the promising name Cluster.
Initially, they played in the basement of the Schaubühne Theater in Berlin.
Then in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons, at a church-led record company.
Rother briefly helped with Kraftwerk, but gained a reputation only as a guitarist with Neu!, which was perhaps the most radical German band at the time.
In 1973, Rother followed the musicians of the Cluster into exile at Forst in Weserbergland.
There, in the Old Weserhof, ruins of the 16th century, they lived as members of a community who had fled the city.
They did not live here as ideologically as in Commune I, where Roedelius was still allowed to nanny.
It was rather a life in such a spitzwegian artistic being.
The name for the art is allegedly derived from the name of the Harmonia Ottenstein choir, whose badge was allegedly found in the garbage dump.
Many of these have preserved harmony.
The first album was called "Music from Harmony" and the following "De Luxe".
Although their music sounded so calm and modest, the band suffered from financial difficulties.
The collection of the year was not just self-recognition.
The now-released CD "Live 1974" was said to have been cut off at a concert in Griesso in front of a record-breaking small, barely fifty-member backdrop.
Rothera then expressed his wish that the members of the Harmony would exert themselves and practice occasionally.
For Roedlio and Moebia, it was an absolutely rude request.
In 1975, the band announced their separation.
Rother ended up in the esoteric sphere and secured his future with the album "Burning Hearts".
Cluster was revived in the 1980s and has been more successful since then than Harmonia has ever been.
For the live album from Griessemer we can be grateful to Herbert Grönemeyer.
His recording company, Grönland, aimed to provide krautrock as the original German contribution to live music.
The band Neu! was considered Roedel's solo work at the time.
The physical Resurrection of Harmony will take place in the Berlin House of World Cultures.
The performance at the Woldtronics Festival will be publicly sponsored.
There will be Brit, Julian Cope, an old punk and the author of the manual "Krautrock Sampler".
The founder of the Love Parade, Dr. Motte, will also be present.
With this, we drew the overall breadth of Krautrock’s influence on future pop music.
The empty space of the famous group will be filled by Harmony.
Brian Ena’s sentence, accompanied by the strangest sounds, floats in the hall: “Unique true music belongs to the future.”
There are pictures on which the producer is with Harmony in the peasant sitting.
The creation of the legend also contributes to the projection of other black-and-white photographs, on which a set of devices are wildly connected cables.
Before that, the three veterans are again engaged in improvisation.
No longer by sticking microphones to organs and drums to extract the never-before-heard self-made tones from the instruments.
Today, electronic music looks like electronic music.
Three in the technique of plunging dots.
The House of World Cultures does not change that.
Under the leadership of Barbara Morgenstern, she whispers under the sound clouds and sings "Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Krautrock has always been a very English term.
It was never about rock.
We would find our roots in music colleges (Can), in technology (Kraftwerk) or in an escape from artistic and social conventions (Cluster) rather than in blues.
He who cries out "'68!" in this place is not so far from the truth, but Harmony will not be left alone even now.
Even the most obvious ones are carefully thought out on the scene.
Where does the music start and when does it end?
This question will either lose a person's nerve or allow him to experience fleeting moments of happiness.
Richard Gere is not cynical.
With the release of The Hunting Party and Morderischer Frieden, two films about the war in the Balkans appeared.
But none of them are convincing.
The motion picture either puts too much emphasis on action and shooting, or they are too touching.
Not even an actor like Richard Gere can stop this from happening in The Hunting Party.
The good news first: War criminals Karad<0xC5><0xBE>i<0xC4><0x87> and Mladi<0xC4><0x87> are still hiding in the Balkan Mountains, but it is there, in the gloomy backdrop of the Bosnian War, that actor Richard Gere comes to life.
Recently, we have lost sight of this most beautiful man of the 1980s, not only because he played in many cute, insignificant roles in comfortable women's films, but in conjunction with his press conferences forever on the topic of Buddhism, a person will be taken away from the taste for another film with this actor.
And yet Richard Gere is suddenly the strongest argument for watching The Hunting Party - Where the Hunter Becomes a Prey (Why do movie titles have to be so long and confusing these days?).
His war reporter Simon Hunt is basically what Gere could have been if fate and the film industry hadn't been so merciful: a man who has had his best years long ago, but still retains a remarkable monument like a wreck.
But despite this triumph, The Hunting Party, along with the German film Morderischer Frieden, which also enters cinemas this week, is just a continuation of an endless series of unsuccessful films about the war in the Balkans.
With Morderischer Frieden we can do a short process: This film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who save a Serbian girl from a Kosovo sniper, and one of them falls in love with her.
Although it is commendable that the Serbs are not presented here as the cause of all evil, this television-flat film changes too soon into shooting and action.
From the film will remain something much like the Kobra 11 series, although without a highway, but for that with the war.
In the film The Hunting Party, it is possible to explore clearly why a really good film about the Balkan War has not yet been made.
The story of three American war reporters who pretend to be a “fox,” a Serbian top war criminal, might at another time and under the direction of another director and screenwriter (both of whom are Richard Shepard) become a new “Apocalypse.”
After all, both stories are surprisingly similar: small groups go to the forest to do something the army is unable to do, but their path becomes a path to madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of The Hunting Party is that Simon Hunt isn’t that gruesome and sentimental cynic introduced at the outset.
On the contrary, the proposal will prescribe him a romantic affair with a Bosnian Muslim woman who was later murdered.
The Hunting Party can be definitively written off after the reporters have succeeded in what NATO, the CIA and all the criminal hunters of the world have failed in the last five years: catching the criminals and leaving them for the just revenge of the Bosnian Muslims.
This is so contrary to the logic of filmmaking that it would be worthwhile to appeal to the International Court of Justice in The Hague.
This film has a profoundly human message.
It condemns the fact that Karadzic and Mladi<0xC4><0x87> are still at large, and suspects Americans and Frenchmen (who are exceptionally united here) not to engage in prosecution intensively enough on the basis of secret political agreements.
But sometimes good and evil are so similar that women are attacked by Brecht's famous poem.
It is about the wooden mask of an Asian demon on the desk of the writer: "I look with compassion at the swollen veins on my forehead, noting: how strenuous it is to be evil."
In movies like The Hunting Party, there are exactly the kind of swollen heads that show just how hard it is to be good.
This problem is not limited to the subject of the war in the Balkans.
Recently, it was reported in these newspapers that all Hollywood films about Iraq were major failures.
There’s only one thing to add: No good South Africa movie has ever been made.
Almost always true: When a star roams through a crisis area or walks through a minefield, a film like Rangoon with Patricia Arquette, Border Break with Angelina Jolie or Blutdiamanten with Leonardo DiCaprio is created.
Maybe all these conflicts are just too close in time.
After all, it had to be decades before Hollywood could make a good film about the Holocaust – Schindler’s List.
Many films seem to have to mature - films that are considered classic Vietnamese works today - "Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse" or "Lead Vest" - were not celebrated as masterpieces at the time.
But perhaps today, when every mass murder at home immediately appears on two screens, we know too much about the conflicts of this world.
Writers do not have the ability to tell good stories without fail.
"To be or not to be" or "The Great Dictator" have become so good, because Lubitsch and Chaplin did not yet know how terriblely the Nazi regime really ruled.
Maybe you don't want to be good when you want to make good movies.
Perhaps he must form a sarcastic artistic outlook as the novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked about the parallel between his historical novel "Lemprièr's Dictionary" and "The Balkan War", he said: "The only similarity lies in the fact that some things never change.
The big cities will always be very dangerous, people will always be murdered in a terrible way, and there will always be war in Yugoslavia.”
Von Beust has been criticized for refusing the Olympics.
The mayor’s resignation from the Summer Olympics in Hamburg has met with fierce criticism of politics and the economy.
Many want to continue to fight for the arrangement of games by the water.
Von Beust, however, encourages realism in the estimation of odds.
Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, chief executive of the Chamber of Commerce in Hamburg, on Wednesday called the decision "business-wise unhappy".
No other project in the city has recently been as motivated as the Olympic idea.
Without this goal, it would not be possible to maintain this sporting political enthusiasm at such a high level.”
Schmidt-Trenz urged the Senate not to bury this project, but to create a new long-term concept for it, "based on a changed timetable."
Mayor Ole von Beust stayed on Wednesday with his earlier statements that Hamburg's Olympic ambitions are unrealistic at least until 2028.
"Not Hamburg, but the German Olympic Sports Association will decide on the Olympic candidacy," von Beust told WELT ONLINE.
He pointed out that at the beginning of December the Sports Union will decide on the candidacy of Munich for the Winter Games in 2018.
“This preference for us means that we have no realistic chance with the 2028 timetable.”
Yet this dream is not yet over, said von Beust.
The Hamburg Sports Association (HSB) called Von Beust’s statements regrettable.
It seems that Hamburg does not want to apply for the Olympic Games in the next twenty-five years.
"It is too early to destroy our chances by describing the plans as buried at this early stage," HSB President Günter Ploss said on Wednesday.
Rejecting the application would be contrary to the statement made by the head of the Senate at the General Assembly of the German University Sports Association.
Von Beust did not announce Hamburg’s candidacy for the University in 2015 as a substitute for hosting the Olympic Games.
The Hamburg University Sports Association (HAM) has been nominated for the nomination for the city last week.
The SPD faction in the Hamburg parliament of the Senate has suggested that it is wasting valuable time that could be used for the construction of apartments in Hamburg.
"The development of the Klein Grasbrook area has been hampered by the Senate for years because it has bet on the Olympics and excluded the construction of apartments," SPD MPs Carola Veit and Jan Quast said.
While the SPD for the Klein Grasbrook area was still planning the Olympics with the entire area being later used for residential purposes, the CDU unanimously bet on the "Olympic factor".
Appealing for the 2012 Summer Olympics sparked great enthusiasm during his time in Hamburg.
But Hamburg failed in Leipzig.
These aren't Warhol's boxes.
The person who combines Sweden and wooden boxes doesn’t think of Andy Warhol, but of Ikea.
Or is it?
Wooden boxes currently produced in Sweden cast Warhol’s dark shadows on the list.
Most of his list of ninety-four "Brillo boxes" of the Stockholm type are fakes.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" a few months ago expressed doubts about the authenticity of Warhol's "Brillo boxes" in 1968, the internal research of the Moderna Museet in Stockholm comes with a result that brought disappointment; the six "Brillo boxes" which in 1995 were dedicated to the Moderna Museet Museum - the "Brillo boxes" of the Moderna Museet
Previous events are a messy, confusing chain of artistic and curatorial events.
Warhol made his first Brillo boxes in New York City in 1964, painting wooden boxes that were based on the red-blue-white design of Brillo soap-powder paper boxes.
The exhibition of his works at the Moderna Museet in 1968 showed - with Warhol's consent - hundreds of Brillo boxes made of cardboard. These were not (for financial reasons) from Warhol, but were delivered directly from the Brillo factory.
It was not about works of art, but about their masterpieces, just exhibition pieces.
Warhol apparently also gave permission in 1968 to make several wooden Brillo buckets in Sweden, but these are not exhibited in the Moderna Museet.
Witnesses at the time are now talking about fifteen boxes that then rightfully entered art and auction history as authorized originals - "Andy Warhol's Brillo Boxy" with the designation Typ Stockholm.
Some of them were auctioned for more than $100,000.
The problem now lies in the fact that the legendary director of the museum Pontus Hultén later falsely claimed that about a hundred coffins were made and exhibited in Sweden in 1968, which Warhol then left to him.
In fact, 105 Hulten beds were made in Malmö for the St. Petersburg exhibition in 1990.
At that time, Warhol was already three years after his death.
In addition to the six Brillo boxes owned by the museum, Lars Byström, the top conservator of Moderna Museet, also examined three Brillo boxes from a Swedish private collection, two of which were made in Sweden in 1968 and after their plywood panels were painted with plywood and base bars.
On the contrary, from the structure of the copies from 1990, it appeared that the paint was applied directly to the plywood board by a paint roll without a previous base coating - besides, it is an acrylic and not an oil paint.
"These boxes were not authorized by the artist and should be removed from Warhol's official Brillo boxes list," Lars Nittve, director of Moderna Museet, said: "If the Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board doesn't come up with a six-pointer in New York, Moderna will come up with a six-pointer."
In July, the Authentication Board announced that it would deal with these "critical allegations" made in the case of soap boxes.
The organization, however, remains in relentless silence.
Rebel soldiers in Manila surrendering
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers have surrendered, encamping in a hotel in Manila and demanding the resignation of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Insurgent commander Antonio Trillanes, who accused the president of manipulating and corrupting the election, told reporters at the hotel that he was denying responsibility for the bloodshed.
Soldiers loyal to the government earlier attacked the hotel with tear gas.
A few hours earlier, about two dozen soldiers were stationed in the building.
On Thursday, about half of them were in court over a failed coup attempt in 2003, including Trillanes.
He took advantage of the negotiations to flee with his about 30 sympathizers.
The military police officers who were supposed to guard him apparently ran over to his side and joined the rebellion.
They entered the Peninsula Hotel and demanded the resignation of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Government loyal units have closed the area around the selected hotel.
The president called an emergency meeting of the security cabinet.
National Security Adviser Norberto Gonzales condemned the act of the soldiers.
"People have had enough," Triallnes said.
"We're calling on people to join us."
General Danilo Lim, commander of the former Scout Rangers elite unit, said other military units would join the march in a short time.
Critics of the government called for a large demonstration against the president on Friday.
Her government has been accused of corruption for months.
In 2003, the financial region of Manila became the main site of the uprising of about 200 soldiers against Arroyo.
Because the rebels refused to join the army, the rebellion collapsed after less than 24 hours.
Since 1986, at least seven attempts have been made in the Philippines to overthrow the democratically elected government.
United Internet becomes majority shareholder of Versatel
United Internet secured more than 20 percent stake in Versatel’s telecommunications company.
The company announced on Wednesday that the average price per share is 14.46 euros.
The company now owns 20.05% of its share capital.
There was speculation about the takeover.
The company is still counting on the possibility of further increasing its stake in Versatel.
United Internet has announced that it is trying to accelerate the consolidation of the German DSL market with this step.
After Berenberg increased its shareholding in the company of this Düsseldorf network operator by an additional 5% to 15.1%, entry agreements appeared on Wednesday.
In the financial market, it is said that this monetary institution holds shares only for a third party.
Yesterday, United Internet had a nearly 10% stake in Drillisch, a provider of mobile telecommunications networks.
As part of the capital increase, Drillisch sold an additional 17.4 million new shares worth <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>106.4 million.
Of these, 5.15 million shares were purchased by United Internet for 31.4 million euros.
The companies discussed marketing partnerships in the field of DSL and mobile networks.
"We are strengthening our partnership," a spokesman for United Internet said.
In order to take over the competing company Freenet, the companies jointly established a joint venture SME.
On Thursday, United Internet announced that the two companies would be satisfied with a stake in Freenet for the time being of more than 10% and would not exercise their right to take over an additional 18.49% of the company.
It is considered that the companies have so far retained all options, in particular the possibility of further increasing their stake in Freenet AG.
The talks between United Internet and Freenet on the strategic partnership ended in mid-November.
This months-long and difficult-to-transparent game about Freenet is part of the consolidation of the German telecommunications market.
At the end of the third quarter, Freenet had 2.9 million contract customers on the mobile network and 1.27 million customers with a full or DSL connection.
Holding United Internet and Drillische so far held a 6.01% stake in Freenet.
It has now been agreed that Drillisch will receive an additional 4%.
The right to buy 18.49% of Vatas’ investment company was agreed in August.
