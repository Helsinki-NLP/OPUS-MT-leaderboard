Obama welcomes Netanyahu
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not friendly.
The two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement as well as about the destabilizing actions of Tehran in the Middle East.
The meeting will also focus on the conflict with the Palestinians and the discussed two-state solution.
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been tense for years.
Washington criticizes Israel’s ongoing settlement construction and accuses Netanyahu of lack of will in the peace process.
The Obama-promoted deal on Iran’s nuclear program has further deteriorated the relationship between the two.
In March, Netanyahu delivered a controversial speech at the invitation of the Republicans before the U.S. Congress, which was partly considered an affront to Obama.
The speech was not agreed with Obama, a meeting he had rejected with reference to the upcoming election in Israel at the time.
In an emergency call, Professor confesses to having shot his girlfriend
In an emergency call, Professor Shannon Lamb told the police in a somewhat shaky voice that he had shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his house.
Lamb was important to emphasize that his "sweet dog" was still alive and probably excited, and he said the dead woman's family contacts could be found on the phone.
Inside the house, the officers found the body of Amy Prentiss and a handwritten note, which was scribbled on a white block: "I'm so sorry, I wanted to, I could undo it, I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me".
There was no indication that Lamb, who taught in two online courses for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had already traveled 300 miles to the school grounds where he reportedly shot and killed a popular history professor, Ethan Schmidt, at the door of his office.
Delta State University police chief Lynn Buford said university staff heard the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
He said Lamb made the fatal emergency call at some point afterwards.
By the end of the day, there was another death: Lamb took his own life when the police arrested him.
One day after the shooting at the university, which forced students and faculty to hide behind closed doors, authorities are still trying to get a picture of what motivated Lamb.
The details published by investigators at both ends of the state, as well as what students and staff who knew him said, helped draw a picture of a talented but possibly difficult teacher.
Students said they were looking forward to his class.
Police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, said he had no history of violence or a criminal history.
Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book he wrote in which he mentioned the "wonderful people" with whom he shared his academic life.
Both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History, whose faculty comprises 17 members, and many students attended courses from both.
At the same time, there were some tendencies to problematic behaviors.
One student, Brandon Beavers, who praised Lamb, said he also seemed a little excited and nervous, "as if something was wrong with him."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said that Lamm told him that he was dealing with stress at the end of the 2014-15 academic year.
Lamb had previously asked Delta State University for a leave of absence for health reasons, saying he had a health problem.
This year he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in the university’s employment policy meant that the PhD for which Lamb had worked so hard would not guarantee him an automatic path to employment as an assistant professor.
University president William LaForge said he knew nothing about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr Lamb's idea."
These are questions that Lamb can no longer answer.
After escaping from the campus, police later found Lambs's trail when he returned to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb killed himself with a .38-caliber gun in the backyard of a house about a mile south of his parent's house on the outskirts of Greenville, Mississippi, Washington County Coroner Methel Johnson said.
His car was still running in the driveway.
It was not immediately clear why Lamb went to this house, but Johnson said she believed he knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb began his work at the university in 2009, which has 3,500 students in a city with about 12,000 inhabitants and taught geography and pedagogy.
He graduated in Pedagogy in the spring.
One of Lamb’s longtime friends described him as intelligent, charismatic and funny.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamb was 20 when they met through mutual friends.
She and her friends were in high school, and he was the cool older guy who tried to teach her guitar playing for a few years.
He was the women's swarm at the time.
All the girls melted there when he was there,” said Hairston, now 40 and residing in the Jackson suburb of Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss had apparently been together for some time.
In the emergency call, Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but there was no certificate of marriage.
They had a dog named Lightning who lived with them in the brick house adjacent to a Bayou in Gautier.
Police said the dog was okay.
Prentiss' ex-husband, Shawn O'Steen, said they were divorced 15 years ago, but had remained friends and had a daughter who was now 19 years old.
"She was totally destroyed on the ground," O'Steen said of his daughter.
She and her mother were absolutely best friends.
O'Steen said he never met Lamb, but through his daughter Abigail, he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail both performed at a summer annual market three years ago.
Later they played one or the other gig together.
O'Steen said his daughter writes and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked online for various companies.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a dimly lit bar near Gautier, said he saw Lamb and Prentiss Night for the last time on the night of September 5 after Lamb finished his guitar and harmonica play in front of a sparse audience.
There was no sign that something was wrong.
“Just a happy couple,” he said.
We were cleaning up and joking with each other.
I mean, they both had a good sense of jokes.
Schmidt, the dead professor, led the first semester seminar program and specialized in Native American and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at the school.
He was married and had three small children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of his brotherhood and student committee.
At the Delta State Campus in Cleveland, about 900 people attended a candlelight memorial on Tuesday night, including lecturers, staff, students and community members.
Schmidt's wife Liz and his brother Jeff Schmidt also took part in the memorial service, while the university choir sang "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace".
Classes will resume on Wednesday.
“We’re trying to move our students to return,” LaForge said.
The crisis is over.
This is a day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated Press authors Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contributed to this report.
This story was corrected to reflect that police now say Lamb made the emergency call after he shot Schmidt, and that while Lamb in his emergency call referred to Prentiss as his wife, there is no indication that the two ever married.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer workers for Christmas
Toys R Us says it won’t hire as many Christmas season employees as it did last year, but the toy and baby products retailer says it will give the employees and season workers currently employed by it a chance to work more hours.
The company said it plans to hire 40,000 people in stores and distribution centers across the country, with 45,000 more employees being hired in the Christmas period of 2014.
Most jobs will be part-time jobs.
The company said it will start job interviews this month and the number of employees will increase from October to December.
While the holidays themselves are still months away, the Christmas business is getting closer, and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to equip stores with employees selling, shipping, and delivering products.
Michael J. Fox is joking about his "dating" with Princess Diana
The premiere of "Back to the Future" was a great professional moment for Michael J. Fox.
She was also remarkable for personal reasons.
“We were sitting in the theater waiting for the Royals, and I notice that the seat next to me is empty, and it gradually becomes clear to me that Princess Diana is going to sit next to me,” he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary, Back in Time.
The film starts, and it comes to mind that I am a simulated whining and an arm length away from being with the Princess of Wales on a date.
"Back in Time", a documentary about "Back to the Future", presents interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as with director Robert Zemeckis and producer Steven Spielberg.
"Back for the Future" premiered 30 years ago.
“It’s really for me,” Spielberg said, “indisputably the biggest time travel movie ever made.”
"Back in Time" will be on VOD, DVD and in select theaters in October.
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says his response to Russia’s increased military support for Syria is: “There is no military solution” to the nearly five-year-long conflict, and more weapons will only exacerbate violence and misery for millions of people.
The UN chief once again calls on all parties, including the split UN Security Council, to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban told a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the foreign ministers of the five permanent members of the Council – the United States, Russia, China, the United Kingdom and France – on the sidelines of the General Assembly’s ministerial meeting later this month to discuss the situation in Syria.
He regretted that the splits in the Council and within the Syrian people and regional powers "make this situation insoluble."
Ban urged the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in addressing the crisis in Syria that they have shown in reaching a nuclear deal with Iran.
8 Survey Values That Show That Donald Trump Is To Be Taken Seriously
Some have tried to brand it as a flop.
Others took him away as a joke.
And some are waiting for a breakdown.
But no matter how some Republicans try to pull Donald Trump down from the top ranks in polls, it hasn’t (yet) worked.
Ten of the last eleven national polls showed Donald Trump leading in the two-digit area, and some are beginning to seriously wonder what it means for the chances of nominating the real estate mogul.
Of course, it is too early in the election.
No one claims that Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination.
Experts point out that at this time in 2011, Rick Perry’s leadership was given to the rising Herman Cain, none of whom won even a single state in the nomination process.
And there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election.
But outsider groups like Jeb Bush’s Super PAC and the conservative economic group Club for Growth are now recognizing Trump’s resilience and starting to let their dollars flow to overthrow him.
Here are some current survey values that suggest that the real estate mogul is not just a temporary phase:
Trump’s popularity has turned 180 degrees.
Shortly before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a Monmouth University poll showed that only two out of ten Republicans saw the real estate mogul positively.
By mid-July, it was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, it was 52 percent.
Now six out of 10 Republicans have a positive view of Donald Trump.
About three out of ten say they have a negative opinion.
And these numbers are in early states.
A Quinnipiac vote in Iowa last week found that 60 percent of Republicans have a good opinion of Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP voters would be happy with Trump as a candidate.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would either be “enthusiastic” or “satisfied” if Trump was nominated.
Only two in 10 say they would be “angered” if he were the candidate.
Only Ben Carson creates roughly the same enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they would be “enthusiastic” vs. 40 percent who say the same about Trump).
Next in terms of enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio is 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters say they would be “dissatisfied” or “angry” if Jeb Bush, the establishment’s favorite, would be the candidate.
A majority of Republicans do not see Trump’s temperament as a problem.
While Donald Trump is widely criticized for his bombshell and offensive statements, 52 percent of Irish voters tending to Republicans believe the real estate mogul has the right temperament for a president, according to ABC News/Washington Post on Monday.
The same figure is true in the nation’s first pre-election state, the state of Iowa, where the same 52 percent of Republicans think he has the personality for a commander-in-chief, according to Quinnipiac last week.
Still, 44 percent think he doesn’t have the personality to perform his office effectively, and nearly six out of 10 independents say his temperament doesn’t fit in with the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republicans get used to the idea.
If they put on their scholarly hats, Republican voters think Trump is real.
When asked who is most likely to win the GOP nomination, according to a CNN/ORC poll last week, four out of ten say Trump is the best bet.
This is a change since the time when four out of ten put their money on Jeb Bush at the end of July.
Full disclosure: GOP voters did not have the clearest crystal ball in the past.
At this point in the last cycle, four out of ten Republicans thought Rick Perry would win the nomination, compared to only 28% for final candidate Mitt Romney.
Nevertheless, it turns out that a variety of GOP voters view Trump’s campaign as plausible.
Even if the Republicans gathered around another candidate, Trump still beats almost everyone.
Some experts point out that the fragmented field is likely to contribute to Trump’s leadership, while anti-Trump support is diffusely distributed to more than a dozen other candidates.
But a Monmouth University poll in early September shows that in a hypothetical head-to-head race between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump is reaping majority support.
He has 13 points ahead of Carly Fiorina, 14 points ahead of Marco Rubio, 15 points ahead of Walker, 19 points ahead of Jeb Bush and finally 33 points ahead of Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie.
It's a head-to-head race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate to beat him?
Ben Carson would beat the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypothetical head-to-head race.
A small majority of Donald Trump fans say they have formed their opinion.
A new CBS/NYT poll on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of the voters who support Trump say they have firmly cast their votes.
Of course, a lot can happen to change that, and no one can really say never to change their mind.
46 percent said they would leave the door open to switch to other candidates.
Still, Trump’s strongest competitor at the moment is the other outsider, neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say they have formed their opinion are twice as common for Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico “rapists” in his campaign speech two months ago, immigration has been a turning point in public discourse about 2016.
Some are concerned that Trump’s bombastic expression will keep decisive Hispano-Americans away from the Republican Party and damage the reorientation efforts.
But according to Monday’s new ABC/Post poll, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
So as long as immigration remains in the spotlight, Donald Trump will apparently do as well.
Frustration over the government is climbing to new heights.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson now account for about half of the support of Republican voters, mainly because of their outsider status.
Six out of 10 Republicans say in the new Monday ABC/Post poll they prefer a political outsider than someone with government experience.
They are also angry at Washington.
A survey by Des Moines Register/Bloomberg in Iowa two weeks ago shows that three out of four Iowa Republicans are frustrated with the Republicans in Congress, with 54 percent "dissatisfied" and 21 percent "hellically annoyed".
Munich, Sylt and Co.: The five most exclusive residential areas in Germany
Here in Hobookenweg is the most expensive residential complex - overlooking the North Sea.
On the street, a square meter of a reed roof house costs on average 73,300 euros.
"On Sylt, the supply of objects is naturally limited," the study says - hence the high price.
A new study shows in which particular locations a square meter costs the most.
Of course, 18.70 euros per square meter for a student buddy in Munich are not really little.
Unlike Germany’s top resorts, however, the price is like peanuts.
The real estate service provider Engel & Völkers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential locations - with square meters prices at dizzying heights.
There are sometimes several tens of thousands of euros nothing - per square meter, well noted.
Well, who can afford it...
By the way: Munich is not at the forefront here, exceptionally.
Champions League: Bayern dream start thanks to Müller and Götze
Double goalkeeper in Piraeus: Bavaria star Thomas Müller just has a run.
A happy hit by Thomas Müller paved the way for FC Bayern to a deserved 3:0 at Olympiakos Piraeus - then it was.
A sovereign start to the Champions League season.
World champions Thomas Müller and Mario Götze have given FC Bayern a dream start in the "Mission Milan".
The team of coach Pep Guardiola won their opening match in the Champions League against the Greek record champion Olympiakos in a hot atmosphere thanks to Müller's double pack (52./90.+2) and Götzes hit (89.) earns with 3:0 (0:0).
The twelfth success in the series is expected to be the first step towards the final on 28 May 2016 in Italy, where Guardiola wants to finally take the henkelpott to Munich in the third race.
In his 28th appearance in the Champions League for Bayern, Müller was kindly assisted by Olympiakos goalkeeper Roberto, who passed a shot of the World Champion intended as a flank.
"We will not underestimate them," Bayern captain Philipp Lahm had promised before the match at Karaiskakis Stadium in front of 31,688 hot-blooded fans - and the Munichers kept their word.
They showed a focused and committed vision without shining.
Piraeus had won his most recent six home games in the royal class, including against renowned clubs such as Manchester United, Atlético Madrid or Juventus Turin.
In 2011, Borussia Dortmund also stumbled (1:3).
However, Bayern, in seven European Cup duels with Greek teams undefeated, did not want to be the next victim.
They ran boldly, but often too recklessly, to work in their offensive efforts.
The attacks were too often initiated by shifting the game to the left side Douglas Costa, who rarely passed against the former Braunschweig brother-in-law Omar Elabdellaoui.
Müller was more fortunate from the right when his flank hit from the right half in the upper left toe.
In the 67th minute, the World Champion forgave the possible 2–0.
The best opportunity in half one was Robert Lewandowski.
Initially, when Olympiakos striker Ideae Brown knocked Poland's header off the line (26th).
Then by direct take-off, the goalkeeper paired Roberto with the knee (35th).
Although the Bavaria grew up their usual dominant game, Piraeus was able to put needle stitches.
But the goalkeeper Manuel Neuer was trusted.
For example, when he diverted a shot of idea over the latte (56).
Before new, Guardiola had a four-chain with David Alaba defending in the center next to Jerome Boateng, who did well.
Mario Götze, after muscular problems back in the squad, sat out first.
The World Cup hero gave the green light only after the final training, sports director Matthias Sammer told "Sky": "If you want to make something else out of it, that's already evil."
Even on the first shift Guardiola decided against him when he brought Kingsley Coman for the beaten Lewandowski (59th).
Götze came late for Arturo Vidal (76th) and made everything clear 13 minutes later, with Müller putting another one on it.
Before the game, there were cramps in the stadium.
After a small group of partly presumptuous Bayern fans in their spectator block apparently provoked the supporters of host Piraeus with words and gestures, the security forces intervened and attacked the Munich supporters with batons.
At least one Bayern fan was transported injured from the stadium.
People who smoke have a higher risk of losing teeth.
Smoking damages not only the lungs, but also the teeth, according to a long-term Potsdamer study.
The good news is that if you give up, the risk decreases quickly.
Smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early.
This is evidenced by the long-term study of an international research team, including several employees of the German Institute for Nutritional Research (DIfE) in Potsdam.
Compared to non-smokers, smokers had a 2.5- to 3.6-fold higher risk of premature tooth loss.
The scientists had observed more than 23,300 participants.
The main causes of tooth failure are caries and inflammation of the gums, emphasizes the DIfE.
For this periodontitis, smoking is a risk factor, the authors emphasize.
The association between smoking and tooth loss is therefore due to more frequent gum inflammation in smokers.
It is not clear to what extent smoking also increases the risk of caries.
People who quit smoking may reduce their risk, but within a short period of time, the researchers write in the Journal of Dental Research.
However, it could take more than ten years for the risk to fall back to the level of non-smokers, said first author Thomas Dietrich of the University of Birmingham in England.
One must convince people to become non-smokers, said study leader Heiner Boeing of DIfE: "Smoking shortens the life span."
Not smoking is good for the lungs and vessels and, according to our findings, also leads to good dental health until old age.
In Germany, more than 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 are affected by toothlessness, the DIfE said.
Previous studies have already suggested that smoking increases the risk of early tooth failure.
The new long-term study supports the findings.
Archaeologists encounter remains from Late Antiquity on Cologne Rhine bank
Archaeological finds have been made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne.
Near the site for the new Rheinboulevard, archaeologists from the Roman-Germanic Museum have dug up skeletons and remains of historic buildings, museum director Marcus Trier said on Tuesday.
Since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine, historians have been looking for so-called soil monuments.
For all construction projects in the city district of Cologne, the museum is always added as a specialist office for archaeological soil monuments.
In the third construction section of the Rheinboulevard, the archaeologists were now found.
From text documents it was already known that there was a fortress in the 4th century and a church in the 8th century, explained Trier.
In addition to the remains of the fortress and the church tower, a cemetery with about 350 graves has been discovered, which probably belonged to the church.
Young woman caught by freight train
After a young woman was injured at the train station in Geilenkirchen-Lindern, the Federal Police asked the population for help.
On early Wednesday morning, at around 1.40 am, the woman from the direction of the station building crossed the tracks at the end of the platform and was caught by a freight train coming from the direction of Mönchengladbach.
By capturing the train, she suffered the most serious injuries from it, according to the Federal Police.
She was taken to a hospital by rescuers and treated on the spot.
The investigating officers have no knowledge of the reason for the young woman’s night crossing.
The incident may have been observed by witnesses or residents have heard acoustic perceptions.
Residents or passers-by of Linderner Bahn, Ziegelbäckerweg, Thomashofstraße and Leiffarther Straße (L364) come to enquiry.
Information on the cause of the accident can be given under the 24/7 and free hotline of the Federal Police at 0800/6888000 or any other police station.
EU Commission proposes new court in dispute over TTIP
To defuse the controversy over the planned transatlantic free trade agreement TTIP, the EU Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbitration system.
The disputed private arbitration bodies for disputes between corporations and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system, which in its functioning corresponds to much more traditional courts.
"We want to set up a system that citizens trust," EU Commissioner Cecilia Malmström said at the presentation.
Sweden intends to introduce the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the United States.
The German government announced its support.
TTIP aims to create the world’s largest free trade zone with 800 million people.
The plans to reform the current arbitration procedures specifically provide for the EU and the US to jointly select independent judges for a new Investment Court.
They should come in equal parts from the EU, the US and third countries.
A second instance is also envisaged for the first time.
It would allow you to object to judgments.
Until now, the parties to the proceedings had agreed among themselves on arbitrators, and there was no possibility to object to their judgments.
In the discussion of the past months, it became clear that citizens do not trust the old ISDS system in terms of fairness and justice, Malmström commented.
In the long term, she wants to work for an International Investment Court, according to her own information.
For example, disputes between Chinese companies and EU countries could be resolved there.
The Investor-State Arbitration (ISDS) procedures, which are mainly requested by large corporations, are considered to be one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe to TTIP.
The traditional arbitration courts are criticized by opponents as a kind of parallelism over which companies can dispute damages at the expense of taxpayers, enforce national laws or enforce a reduction in consumer and environmental standards.
Anti-TTIP organisations such as Campact called the EU Commission’s proposals inadequate.
In particular, it was criticized that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada (CETA).
On the other hand, German State Secretary Matthias Machnig (SPD) described the plans as a major step forward.
The Commission takes into account in the reform key points that Federal Economy Minister Sigmar Gabriel worked with other EU Trade Ministers in the spring.
The old system of private arbitration is off the table.
The French government also welcomed Malmström’s plans.
The European business association BusinessEurope warned that too many new rules would limit the possibility of appeals to the economy.
Especially small and medium-sized enterprises could be disadvantaged by this, it said.
When the talks on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) could be concluded, it remained unclear on Wednesday.
Negotiations have been going on since mid-2013.
The issue of investor protection has not yet been discussed with the United States.
Initially, a framework for the agreement should already be in place by the end of this year.
This date is no longer valid.
Delicate Folk by Sufjan Stevens in Hamburg
Eleven years ago, Sufjan Stevens was on stage at the Cologne Prime Club (now Luxor).
Next to him is a flipchart, on which the shy folk singer has recorded the picturesque US state of Michigan with felt pencil.
The entire audience, about 40 people, is nearly captured by Steven’s lecture.
On the basis of various places, which he repeatedly records on the map, he tells about his meticulous and delicately arranged songs.
Where they originated and what it looks like there, in his homeland.
Since then, Stevens has proven to be a wonderfully creative lunatic.
With the 2003 album "Greetings from Michigan: The Great Lake State", cleverly composed songs appear that harmoniously lurk very close to American folk of the late sixties, but can drift into the great opulent at any time.
There is a rumor that "Michigan" would be the first part of a daring series: each of the 50 U.S. states should be sung in succession.
But already in 2004 and near the Rhine, "Seven Swans" has already appeared and positively breaks certain expectations.
Reduced Stevens appears here.
Live guitar and banjo are enough for him.
A year later, the New York-based musician returns to the series.
With "Illinois" ("Sufjan Stevens Invites You To: Come on Feel The Illinoise"), a widely celebrated masterpiece appears in 2005.
Overflowing with ideas and stylistic finesse.
The album rises to the American Billboard charts and is not missing in any of the year's best lists of the influential music media.
After extremely productive experiments, Stevens then relies on "The Age of Adz" (2010) very extensively electronic spare parts.
This sixth decent studio album is still widely orchestrated, but carried by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all kinds of effect and hall.
As the smaller clubs emerged, the stage shows here turn into a colorful spectacle of neon stripes and large fluorescent stage deco.
Sufjan Stevens is currently touring Germany as part of a five-piece band.
In the dark held hamburger More!
He mainly presents the theatre "Carrie & Lowell", which has been available since March.
Although nearly 2,000 guests are now sitting in their chairs here, the much matured Stevens returns to intimacy and folk.
Without a word to the audience, the group of excellent musicians play themselves through the widely enriched album.
From the audience you hear: the lecture is "more opulent" and you can thus "throw away the plate".
Only for an addition Stevens thanks modestly, acoustically plays a few older songs and finally bows under thunderous applause.
Jeremy Corbyn's debut at Prime Minister's Question Time
Since his election, Mr Corbyn’s debut at the Prime Minister’s Question Time is eagerly awaited.
The new Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is expected to make his debut at the Prime Minister's Question Time and will be making his first deal with David Cameron.
Mr Corbyn will rise to ask the first of his six predetermined questions shortly after lunch, with his performance likely to be scrutinized by the media and Labour MPs.
He called for “less theatre and more facts” at this week’s event.
He also said he could skip some sessions to leave them to colleagues.
The meeting will be the first parliamentary exam for Mr Corbyn’s leadership, as it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TUC annual meeting on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the Labour president’s decision to remain silent on Tuesday during the national anthem at a commemoration of the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain has provoked criticism from a number of Tory MPs and is at the center of several headline stories in the newspapers.
Mr. Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem has drawn attention.
A spokesman for Corbyn said he had "confessed in respectful silence" and acknowledged the "heroicness of the Royal Air Force in the air battle for England."
But a member of Mr Corbyn's shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, told the BBC Two Newsnight program that he had advised the Labour chairman to sing the national anthem "independent" of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Nearly a dozen shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Corbyn’s top team, citing differences in economics, defense and foreign policy, while less than a sixth of the Parliamentary Party originally supported him as a leader.
BBC political correspondent Robin Brant says that political differences also "stack up" within Labour, following Mr Corbyn's statements on the position on the European Union and the limitation on profits.
Mr Corbyn told the TUC conference that Labour is submitting amendments to remove the whole idea of a restriction altogether.
Hours later, Mr Smith, the shadow labour and pension minister, said the party was "very clear" that it was only against government plans to lower the limit from <0xC2><0xA3>26,000 to <0xC2><0xA3>23,000.
Mr Corbyn will be the fifth Labour president to face David Cameron, since he became the head of the Tory, over the last decade over the dispatch box in parliament.
The Labour leader, who has promised a different policy approach, says he has “crowd-sourced” ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and has been given more than 30,000 suggestions.
The Islington North MP has said the Prime Minister's Question Time is too confrontational, and that he will refrain from both "hit-skills" and back-hacking quarrels, and has instead undertaken to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality, and the challenges facing young people.
Mr. Corbyn has said that Angela Eagle, the shadow finance minister, will represent him if he does not attend – for example, when Mr. Cameron is traveling abroad.
He also raised the idea that other colleagues would occasionally take the floor and that he would address John Bercow, the spokesman for the House of Commons, to discuss the issue.
When he became a leader in 2005, Mr. Cameron said he wanted to move away from politics in the style of a "Kasperle theater", which is often linked to the Prime Minister's Question Time, but a few years later he admitted that he had failed in it.
Since it was first broadcast on television in 1990, the Question Time with the Prime Minister was regarded as the most important barometer of a leader’s verdict and his leadership in the House of Commons and his position among his colleagues in parliament, although critics have argued that it has become a cartoon and needs far-reaching reforms.
'Shooted in Joburg': Homeless teenagers trained to be photographers
The city center of Johannesburg is a tough place when you are homeless.
But a group of former street children has found a way to learn a skill and earn a living.
"I was shot in Joburg" (I was shot in Joburg) is a non-profit studio that teaches homeless youth how to take photos of their surroundings and make a profit from them.
BBC News has met one of the first graduates of the project.

Pound rises due to accelerated wage growth in the UK
The pound jumped sharply after data showing a rise in UK wage growth, while the FTSE 100 was boosted by the bidding target SABMiller.
Between May and July, earnings without bonuses in the UK grew by 2.9% compared to the same period last year.
This percentage has been the fastest since 2009 and yielded estimates of the timing of an interest rate increase.
The pound rose by more than 1% against the dollar to $1,5505 and climbed to 0.84% against the euro to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.3730.
The FTSE 100 index closed with an increase of 1.49% to 6,229.21.
SABMiller was the outstanding stock in the market and made a jump of 20% after receiving a takeover offer from rival AB InBev.
A transaction would combine the two largest breweries in the world and bring together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry shares were 0.9% higher, according to encouraging news from rival Richemont luxury goods.
Richemont’s latest sales figures surpass all expectations and also showed that sales in China – a key market for Burberry – are growing again.
Glencore shares rose 5% after the mining giant said it had raised $2.5 billion through a share sale as part of its debt reduction strategy.
The stocks of the packaging and paper company Mondi were the biggest losers on the index, with a decline of 4.3% after Goldman Sachs had set its assessment for the company's rating to "sell".
JD Sports rose 3.1% after the sportswear company reported a pre-tax earnings of 46.6 million for the half-year.
The head of JD Sports says higher wages are endangering expansion.
JD Sports CEO Peter Cowgill says a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean “more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers.”
But it is unlikely that this purchasing power will offset the higher labor costs at his company, he says.
The cost could meet JD Sports’ expansion plans, he added, and that could mean there are fewer additional jobs.
Justin Bieber in the Capital: On Bieber Expedition in Berlin
Justin Bieber, Megastar.
Läppische 21 years old young, a henfling with super chic frieze.
The guy with the platinum blonde hair weighs 100 million euros.
Rather even more.
Currently Monsieur Bieber is in Berlin.
And the U17 generation is turning through.
Like Victoria Rudzinska.
The 15-year-old has never heard the name "Ritz Carlton".
Not too bad.
Hundreds of fans accompanied Justin yesterday.
Among them are Ewa and Victoria from Poland.
Since 7 a.m., however, the Polin has been sitting on the cold stone plates in front of Berlin’s luxury hotel on Potsdamer Platz.
The Bieber-Bau: Here you live idol, whose poster hangs up in Stettin, since Monday evening.
The suite, where the Canadian singer lives, costs just as much per day as her mother Ewa earns in half a year.
If at all.
She says, "Actually, my Victoria would have to sit in tenth grade in high school."
"I'm fulfilling her a dream."
School duty?
Who's itching?
Not the fans.
Neither did Bieber.
He took care of it anyway.
For the commercials in the Superbowl commercial break, he cashed three million, a two-year deal with an anti-pickle firm washed many, many dollars into Bieber’s account.
And with every doll that looks like him and goes over the shop table, Bieber also cashes.
When Justin Bieber drinks a cup of coffee, you’re standing on the window sill.
He is said to have looted more than $100 million.
Some say the hype went too far.
Others emphasize that Bieber is finally in the US and UK with his new single "What do you mean?" at number one.
Bieber himself, whose fourth album is due to follow in November, is not interested in the many zeros for the first time.
At least he does.
Pegida poster brings Lebanese on potato tones idea
Potatoes or doughnuts?
Both are in the potato shade developed by Oldenburg snack owner Hani Alhay.
Inspired by the saying "potato instead of döner" on a poster of the Pegida movement, Alhay put potatoes and meat together on a spit.
The idea was brought to him by a poster during a Pegida demonstration with the inscription "Potatoes instead of Döner", which he had accidentally seen on television.
Since then, a barbecue spoon has been spinning in his shop, which is stocked with meat and potatoes.
"This is multiculty for the stomach," says Alhay.
The idea has now been registered by the Lebanese at the Patent Office in Munich.
According to the Authority, it has recently been protected as a utility model.
Therefore, Alhay does not want to reveal how much meat and how much potatoes the spit contains.
“It tastes even better together,” he said.
Its customers are also well versed in culinary folklore.
Metcash launches soil consistency campaign to combat Aldi invasion
Metcash is trying to protect the IGA branches from an Aldi outbreak in South Australia and Western Australia.
Food wholesaler Metcash has launched a ground consistency campaign to defend the market share of IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia ahead of a $700 million Aldi invasion.
While Aldi is preparing the opening of two sales centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia early next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening their relationships with local food suppliers and building the IGA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing via social media, as well as through event.
IGA dealers and suppliers jump on board, with brands such as Dunsborough ice cream maker Simmo distributing samples in IGA stores and store owners selling cheap tickets for the South Australian Football League to loyal customers.
Metcash is expected to release further details of its defense strategy on September 29, when the food, alcohol and equipment wholesaler carries out its annual investor strategy day.
Much is at stake as South Australia and Western Australia account for nearly 30 percent of Metcash’s IGA stores and generate higher profit margins than Metcash’s IGA network in the eastern states.
Buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are notoriously provincial and IGA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland – more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in the eastern states.
However, analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe that twelve months after opening its first markets, Aldi will seize about five percent of the food market in these two states and remove sales from all existing players, but mainly independent retailers.
According to a report released this week, Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath estimated that IGA retailers could lose $360 million in revenue per year and Metcash could lose $250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA next year and will achieve sales of $500 million and $600 million in each market.
The loss in the food and grocery business and in the amounts on Metcash’s high fixed-cost basis could cost Metcash about $13 million in profit before interest and taxes, Mr Kierath said.
At the same time, Metcash is losing market share in the eastern states, mainly to Aldi and Coles, although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found that IGA buyers are the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley expects Metcash’s sales in the food and grocery business to fall by 3.8 percent in 2016, 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018, and reduce its market share from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020.
Last week, Lead Fund Manager Hamish Douglass, the founder of Magellan Financial Group, told a business dinner in Melbourne that Metcash is likely to disappear within a decade.
Metcash declined to respond publicly to Mr. Douglass’ comments.
But it is assumed that a Metcash board member contacted Mr. Douglass last week.
IGA’s market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010, and revenue from Metcash’s food and grocery trade, which supplies approximately 1,200 IGA retailers, has fallen by 43 percent since 2012, reflecting operational debt reduction while simultaneously pressuring revenue and margins.
However, the wholesaler is resisting and investing more than $150 million to match sales prices with Coles and Woolworths for hundreds of products each week, and to improve IGA retailers’ ability to improve their stores by growing fresh foods faster and delivering a better selection of private label foods.
Metcash CEO Ian Morrice says that the price adjustments and store renovation programs will increase to Elan and hopes that the wholesaler will return to profit growth for the first time in four years in 2017.
Thanasi Kokkinakis is supported by the President of the Australian Tennis Association Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves more praise than criticism for his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was one of the "collateral damages" in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyrgios and, according to Australian tennis federation president Steve Healy, deserves praise rather than criticism for his own behavior.
Kokkinakis, the younger of the talented duo, who is repeatedly referred to as "Special Ks", came to the spotlight through Kyrgios' infamous confrontation with Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
In a fiery qualifying game in Cincinnati soon after, Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison had to be separated by the referee twice, with Harrison exclaiming, "Wawrinka should have beaten Kyrgios, and I should have beaten the child."
While he was last seen smashing a tennis bat after a spasm defeated a potential U.S. Open victory by Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was firmly defended by Healy.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, competing with Sam Groth for second singles place behind Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semi-finals against Great Britain.
"One thing I'm pretty much jealous about is the fact that in my opinion Thanasi was a bit involved in the dispute," Healy said.
He broke a bat when he lost to a cramps at the U.S. Open, but he’s not the first player to break a bat out of frustration with himself, and I know Thanasi well enough to know he’s not proud of it.
But, really, he behaved extremely well in the US Open, even under the rather provocative circumstances with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves a lot of recognition.
He has a great team around him, he has a great family around him, and I think he’s been treated a little too harshly.
He is a very mature 19-year-old, he works very hard, and he fits into the team and so on, he has never had a problem with the other players, he is respected in the dressing area, he trains hard, he is in good shape, he is a very stable and mature young guy, and I think he deserves to be paid according to his own merit.
Healy also supported the decision not to take Kyrgios into account in the important pre-decision that begins on Friday, and he describes the "joint decision" as the right one for everyone, but he assures the man from Canberra to return to the team as a long-term solid component."
“First, we want the team to be fully focused on the competition and not on all the controversies around [Kyrgios],” Healy said.
And I believe that Nick has managed the rise very quickly, which people like Federer and Murray have pointed out. He rises in the eyes of the public, and he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets, but we try to support him, we try to make him understand the consequences of his actions beyond the one time I can only make him understand.
Europe's refugee crisis: Hungary declares state of emergency, closes border, holds back refugees
Hungary declared a state of emergency and blocked the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday, detaining all those who tried to enter the country illegally, all with the aim of stopping the influx of migrants.
Chaos followed at the border as hundreds of migrants gathered in a no-man’s land and Serbian officials reacted with indignation.
The people who had fled violence were stuck for an unknown time in a strip of land on the road between the two checkpoints of the countries and built tents and settled there.
But frustrations increased.
As a police helicopter hovered over them, the migrants chanted “Open the border!” and shouted insults to the Hungarian police.
Some rejected food and water in protest.
Serbia's foreign minister said it was "unacceptable" that migrants would be sent back from Hungary as more and more arrived from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution and not a collateral damage.
Talks with Brussels and other countries must take place in the coming days," said Ivica Dacic in Prague.
The turmoil on the Hungarian-Serbian border came a day after the 28-nation bloc failed to agree on a common immigration policy at a disputed meeting in Brussels.
The ministers, however, agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people seeking refuge in overwhelmed Italy and Greece, expressing their hope that eventually - next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would be reached that the EU states would take on another 120,000 refugees, including some from Un.
Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria on Tuesday called for a special EU summit to discuss the continent’s immigration crisis.
Hungary, however, did not set its hopes on an immediate action by Brussels or its neighbours.
The state of emergency declared on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to cope with the crisis, allowing them to block roads and speed up asylum procedures.
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said his country was also planning to build a barbed wire fence along its border with Romania to stop the influx of migrants through the country after it ended a fence on the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D’Agata reported that even prisoners were employed in the race to create the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become a significant bottleneck and entry point for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East.
Prime Minister Viktor Orban, however, has insisted that most of the incoming are economic refugees seeking a better life, not war refugees entitled to protection – a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states, including Germany.
The new laws, which came into force at midnight in Hungary, make crossing the border or damaging the 4-meter (13 ft) high fence that the government had built along the southern border with Serbia a crime. These laws also impose higher prison sentences for convicted human traffickers.
"Due to the situation created by the mass migration, the Hungarian government declares the state of emergency," government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
We say it very clearly: illegal border crossing is a crime.
The parliament still has to approve the military’s deployment, which is expected next week, but reporters from the Associated Press have seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs at the border for days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, Orban's national security adviser, said authorities caught 45 people trying to cross the border, 15 others had already penetrated deeper into the country.
They come over by damaging the fence, they are now in police custody and are accused of committing crimes under the new laws.
Authorities are in the process of repairing the fence quickly.
Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after a train wagon with barbed wire arrived to close the borders.
Chaos surrounded the main border crossing near Roszke, Hungary, when the Hungarians opened a small office in a metal container to process people’s data and pushed a crowd to sneak into it.
About 20 managed to get in, but thousands remained outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the main highway link between Serbia and Hungary, saying they would refuse food and water until they were allowed to enter Hungary.
2016 Election: Hillary Clinton's lead halved over Bernie Sanders in national poll
Former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a two-figure lead in the Democratic race for nominations at the national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders wins against her on the ground.
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of Democratic voters in the pre-election (58 percent before), while Sanders is in second place, with 27 percent (an increase of 17 percent).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he is running for president, will receive support from 15 percent of the Democratic primary voters.
More than five months before the start of the pre-election, most Democratic voters say it is too early to say that their opinion is firm on which candidates they will support.
But Clinton’s supporters are more consistent in their election than those of the other candidates.
Since the CBS News poll, Clinton has lost to a number of demographic groups, while Sanders made some gains.
Clinton holds a big lead among women and moderates, but these leads have diminished.
Their support among the men has declined significantly, and Sanders is only 5 points behind here.
Clinton’s advantage over democratic voters under the age of 50 has evaporated, and she and Sanders are now at the same level.
Clinton, however, still has a big lead among older voters.
Last month, Clinton was ahead of Sanders with a two-digit lead in the Liberals, but Sanders now has a five-point lead in this group.
About half of Democratic voters across the country say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she were nominated by the party.
A quarter would support her with some reservations, and another 15 percent would only support her because she is the candidate.
Six percent would not support it.
Perhaps not surprisingly, Clinton’s current supporters are especially enthusiastic about her.
The views are more mixed with those who don’t currently support Clinton – only about a quarter would enthusiastically support them.
While 48 percent of Democratic voters say they support Clinton enthusiastically, fewer Republican voters say this about their top candidate Donald Trump (35 percent).
When Clinton’s supporters are asked in an open question why they want her to be the candidate, the most common answer is that she has the right experience (16 percent), followed by the view that it’s time for a woman to become president (13 percent) and that she is the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Clinton’s supporters also mention her connection to Bill Clinton (9%).
Consent to deal with the problems and eligibility are also cited.
As the vice president throws a potential for the presidential office into the balance sheet, 57 percent of Democratic voters want to see him in the race – though a third believe he shouldn’t.
When Democratic voters are asked who would be their second choice for the party, Biden is at the forefront.
Of Clinton’s supporters, more than half say Biden’s second choice would be far ahead of Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton’s lead over Sanders increases from 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points without him in the race.
Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chance of winning the election; however, that figure has fallen from 78 percent last month.
Biden is by far second in this measurement, but the percentage he considers the "most selectable" has risen.
Yet, when asked what is more important to a candidate, Democratic voters raise questions about eligibility.
Like last month, not a single Democratic candidate or potential candidate for these voters stands out as unacceptable.
Democratic candidates, or potential candidates, deliver good results on some important features among voters in their party’s pre-elections.
Majorities view Clinton, Sanders and Biden as honest and trustworthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities.
Biden cuts off the three candidates best in honesty, while Clinton’s strength is in the lead.
Thirty percent of Democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many say that about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent have no opinion of him.
Democratic voters in the presidential election generally also see Clinton, Sanders and Biden ideologically in line with their views.
In all these measurements, about a quarter of the Democratic voters have no opinion of Sanders.
As questions about Hillary Clinton’s use of a personal email address and a server continue to be asked during her tenure as secretary of state, most Democratic voters in the pre-election are satisfied with her statement on the matter and say it has not affected their opinions overall.
But it’s a different story in the American public as a whole.
Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with their statement, while only about a third are satisfied.
Public opinion on this was divided in March, shortly after the problem came to light.
Most Americans said that the email controversy had no effect on their general opinions of Clinton, although 36 percent said their opinion of her had worsened.
It’s mostly Republicans, more than six out of 10, who say their views on Clinton have gotten worse.
Although Clinton is considered honest and trustworthy by her party’s voters, this remains a problem for her among registered voters overall: only 32 percent see it as honest and trustworthy, eight percent less than last month and 15 points less than since May.
62% of voters do not believe they are an honest and trustworthy person.
At the same time, 55 percent of voters across the country also view Trump as dishonest and untrustworthy.
However, Clinton and Trump get good grades in leadership.
Of the six candidates tested, Biden, Carson, and Bush are best cut off in honesty.
A majority looks more like Sanders than honest, but like Carson, many have no opinion of him.
The error rate for the sample of 351 Democratic voters in the primary elections is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson comes close behind Donald Trump in nationwide poll
Ben Carson is close behind Donald Trump in the latest CBS News/New York Times poll
The two candidates now account for half of voter support in the new poll, and others are losing hold dramatically.
Republican voters across the country continue to support Trump in large numbers, rising from 23% in the last CBS poll conducted before last month’s Fox News debate to 27% in Tuesday’s poll.
But Carson shot from 6% to 23% in the same period.
The poll also found that Carson is good at demographics and Trump outperforms Republican voters with higher education.
The rest of the field, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, has been beaten down with Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, who has fallen the lowest, from 10% support last month to now 2%.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are in third place with 6%.
The margin of error for sampling 376 people from Republican voters in this latest poll is plus or minus 6% and was conducted in September.
The latest CNN/ORC poll released last week shows that Carson is rising in the polls – he lands at 19% support with Republicans, behind Trump with 32% support.
The latest ABC News/Washington Post poll also showed Trump clearly ahead of Carson.
Looking at a Carson rising in the last week, Trump found some side effects for the former neurosurgeon, even after Carson apologized for questioning Trump’s beliefs.
“We need energy,” Trump said last Saturday during a campaign appearance in Iowa.
Pleasant bathing temperatures: The eastern Mediterranean is currently warm up to 29 degrees.
Even if peak values are measured only in the distance, a trip to the Mediterranean is enough for bathers to find warm water.
A bath in the North or Baltic Sea is likely to be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees.
Some are no longer going to the sea: the water in the North and Baltic Seas has reached a maximum of 18 degrees this week, according to the German Weather Service (DWD).
Bathing temperatures, on the other hand, continue to offer the Mediterranean: in the east it even rises to 29 degrees.
In the Adriatic it is at the top 25 degrees, in France 23 degrees.
The Red Sea in Egypt is 28 degrees.
Five Brotherhood Members Charged with the Death of a Baruch College Newborn
Nearly two years after a student died during a harassing ritual of a student union in Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, murder charges are filed against five people.
Members of the New York Baruch College Pi Delta Psi Brotherhood brutally attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during an introduction ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital, which contributed to his death, police said.
Officials said he was loaded with eyes closed with a 30-pound backpack full of sand, and repeatedly attacked while trying to reach a target via a frozen field.
Mr. Deng finally complained of a headache, then he fell unconscious.
Members of the Pi-Delta Psi Brotherhood did not call 911 after Deng became powerless and allegedly waited an hour before taking him to a hospital, police said.
However, they had time to change Deng’s clothes, google his symptoms, and contact Andy Meng, the fraternity’s national president, to seek advice, police chief Chris Wagner said at a press conference.
"At this point, members began hiding utensils and basically put the well-being of the fraternity above that of Michael Deng," said police chief Wagner.
He could not be revived, and he died the next morning from his injuries.
After an autopsy report, Deng was repeatedly inflicted with blunt force injuries to the head, torso and thighs.
"Too many families have been destroyed by the harassment of the Brotherhood. At least one student has died from the harassment every year since 1970," Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing Deng's family, said in a statement.
Brotherhoods and their members need to be held accountable, and this step by authorities is very important.
A County Grand Jury of Monroe recommended an indictment for third-degree murder for the first five members.
Thirty-two members of the Brotherhood, including Mr. Meng, are also charged with harassing attacks and the formation of a criminal association.
"We not only want to hold those involved accountable, but if there is an organization that has - officially or unofficially - sanctioned this, we will also hold them accountable," Wagner said at a news conference on Tuesday.
The Baruch College has banned the fraternity, and the national fraternity has revoked its membership in the local group.
This will happen when the Fed raises interest rates.
An interest rate hike is coming, and the rise will fluctuate, yields for bonds will rise, and the economy will slide into recession.
We know that.
What we do not know is how long this will take and how long it will last.
In particular, history offers little guidance for the economy on how to proceed.
A recession occurred within just 11 months of the first interest rate increase and lasted 86 months.
The Federal Reserve’s aggressiveness in raising interest rates is often, if not always, a factor in how the economy and financial assets react.
That’s why U.S. central bank officials have so strongly stressed that investors should not focus on when they start raising interest rates, but rather on the period needed for normalization.
In fact, several variables play a role.
In the end, however, market participants might find that the whole excitement due to an interest rate hike may have been exaggerated.
“The Fed’s first increase since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the ‘cheap money’ era,” Julian Jessop, chief economist at Capital Economics, said in a statement.
In contrast, we do not expect the gradual return of U.S. interest rates to normal levels, but still at too low a level to lead to the seismic shock that many seem to fear.
However, this does not mean that there will be no impact.
Here’s a look at how some sectors of the economy might react based on historical trends:
As the market has seen over the past month, anticipating interest rate hikes can make things volatile for a while.
Once the increase arrives, the impact is not so dramatic.
“There seems to be a tendency for asset returns to be staggered 12 to 24 months after the first increase, perhaps reflecting the delay in monetary policy again,” Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study on what happens after the Fed’s interest rate hikes.
More specifically, the market has been in the upward trend in the past 35 years - about 14 percent - on the way to interest rate increase, rather flat in the 250 days after (average profit of 2.6 percent), then back to normal after 500 days, with an average return at the last six years, with a bar rate of 14 percent in the last six years, the rate of change in the past four years, the rate of change in the past four years.
Deutsche Bank said the impact on the shares tends to occur later in the increase cycle and the return starts to decrease.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but interest rate hikes often promote them.
In the current case, the Fed is facing some conditions that did not exist before and that could accelerate a recession.
What is particularly noteworthy here is that the gross domestic product will be close to its lowest point at a rate hike by the Fed.
According to Deutsche Bank, among the 118 interest rate increases since 1950, only twice the nominal GDP was below 4.5 percent.
Although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent, few expect this to continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter, according to the Atlanta Fed.
Interest rate hikes in such a fragile economic backdrop could be risky and raise the question of "whether it's different this time," Deutsche Bank said.
Market participants have been gearing up for a Fed interest rate hike all year, and all eyes were on this week’s meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which ends Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe that the FOMC could approve an increase in this session, futures trading only indicates a 25 percent probability.
“In our study, all increase cycles from 1950 to today took place in a super cycle with increasing momentum at GDP and pre-recession heights eclipsed very quickly after the start of recovery,” the report said.
In contrast, this is clearly a slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase.
The current cycle is by far the longest the Fed has waited since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, and this is 74 months so far.
Fixed income was also volatile as the market anticipates an interest rate increase, and the pattern is quite similar to that of the capital market.
The main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than on stocks when they change their strategic price.
In the case of bonds, returns appear to change direction as soon as the first increase/decrease occurs in the cycle.
At the end of the increase cycle, bond yields fall immediately, Deutsche Bank said.
The strategists of Charles Schwab believe that the rise in interest rates will bring returns closer together between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a flattening of the curve.
High-yield bonds often bring better returns in such a climate, although “we are still cautious about expecting higher returns,” said Kathy Jones, a fixed-income analyst at Schwab, in an analysis.
Interestingly, Jones believes that markets have already adjusted to Fed strategy expectations.
“In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are some signs that the market has adjusted to the prospect of tighter monetary policy,” she wrote.
Short-term interest rates have risen, the yield curve is flatter, credit spreads have expanded, and volatility has increased – all features of the market as the Fed tightens its strategy.
On the whole, companies that do most of their business in the U.S. will benefit as interest rates rise and local products become more attractive.
Multinational companies with high debts will be worse off as a rising dollar makes their products more expensive in the global market as well as financing their debts.
“History shows that ‘quality’ stocks tend to respond extremely positively three months after an initial interest rate hike,” Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report for customers.
Firms with a strong balance sheet have surpassed firms with a weak balance sheet by an average of 5 percentage points after each of the interest rate increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004.
Companies with high capital returns and low volatility in their shares also exceeded their low quality counterparts by an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points) respectively.
Debt is going to be a big problem.
Companies with a high share of flexible interest rates will lose the most, Goldman said.
Outside of pure equity games, consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar.
Savers could see profits from higher returns, even if experts disagree on how quickly this will happen.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM, says MEP Andrew Bingham
The Conservative Member of Parliament criticized the station for its "dumbness"
He argues that he is increasingly indistinguishable from commercial rivals.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards and said they were only imitating The Brits.
Parliamentary colleague Damien Collins attacked The Voice, saying it was not very original.
BBC Radio 3 "converts" to Classic FM, claiming a leading member of parliament and increasing new pressure on the station, to prove that he is doing something that the private broadcasters are not doing.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told BBC bosses that the public-law radio station is "stupid" and increasingly no longer to be distinguished from its commercial competitors.
"Radio 3 seems - I don't like to use the word 'dumb' - but it seems to be turning into Classic FM," he said.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards, which launched last December.
The BBC Music Awards, which started last year, seem to be just under a different name.
So, if you’re trying to do something different – these are two spontaneously cited examples where you’re actually just imitating what’s already on the market,” Bingham said.
The BBC’s director-general denied the allegations, arguing that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and enlightenment of the public.
What I learn from Radio 3, I will not learn about classical music anywhere else.
And there’s a commitment to live music and music that’s truly unmatched.
"And the commitment of Radio 3, finding new music and commissioning new works, I think is really important," he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 controller Alan Davey argued that work had to be done harder to engage the audience than it has done in the past because the British are less informed about classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only element of the BBC production that caught fire during the hearing in the Committee on the Selection of Culture, Media and Sport for trampling on commercial rivals.
Tory MP Damien Collins attacked The Voice - the BBC's musical talent show, which was bought by Dutch producer Talpa Media for an estimated cost of <0xC2><0xA3>22 million.
Do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 show - with Paloma Faith and Boy George as judges - was produced "in a special BBC manner".
He added that he hoped the company would "find a hit from our own stable" the next time it launched an entertainment series.
However, he refused to exclude ordering further series of The Voice in the future or spend fees money on other entertainment formats.
Internet sales rose the slowest in August and Black Friday may be responsible for this
In the first three months of 2015, there was a 7% increase in online sales.
In the last month, there was the lowest result since the beginning of records in 2000
Online sales increased three years ago through the use of mobile phones for shopping
Experts believe that Black Friday has slowed spending in November
For over a decade, virtual shopping has boomed, and many of Britain’s main shopping streets have turned into ghost towns.
But experts say there are now signs that online sales are stagnating after new figures showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015.
Total spending for August showed the lowest increase in growth since records began in 2000, with only a five percent increase from the previous year.
Experts say there are signs that online sales are stagnating after new figures showed only 7% growth in the first three months of 2015.
“If you look at the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000, then that has always evolved over time,” Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG Sales Index, told the Guardian.
He explained that online sales increased three years ago when buyers began making purchases with their phones.
It meant that more people could shop online and that people could do it in different environments, such as at home on the couch.
But now this is swinging in, and we may experience that growth is decreasing.
The Black Friday phenomenon, which was imported from America, is cited as a reason for the declining turnover.
Experts believe that buyers withhold their purchases before this event, which takes place on the last Friday in November.
Last year, five times the average number of buyers shuffled around their computers to make their bargains, and some merchant websites crashed.
Experts believe that Black Friday, on which buyers fought for bargains, could prevent buyers from making purchases.
A study by the British Retail Consortium found that out of <0xC2><0xA3>5 spending, just over <0xC2><0xA3>1 was spent online.
For some products such as TVs and washing machines, more than a third of purchases are now made through web stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online rather than in the fashion chains in the inner cities.
Muslims buried dead in Mecca in crane accident - Bin Laden's family is sanctioned
The bodies of 29 dead are carried through the streets by Muslims at the first burials in Mecca
Saudi Arabia Puts Part of the Collapse on the Huge Saudi Bin Laden Group
The Ministry of Health said a total of 394 people were also injured after the crane crashed.
Hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those who were killed when a crane crashed at the Grand Mosque of Mecca.
Mourners, mostly dressed in white, filled the track to pay their respects as the first of the dead made their final journey to Al-Moaissem Cemetery.
The procession of mourning passed at the Holy Place, where just days earlier a construction crane fell through the ceiling of the mosque and then on the prayers.
The bodies were released for burial when the Saudi king imposed a sanction on the bin Laden family’s construction company over the disaster, which also left 394 injured.
The bodies of 29 beetles who were killed when a crane crashed through the Great Central Mosque of Mecca were carried through the streets.
Among the dead was Qasim Akram from Bolton, Greater Manchester, father of four children, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane collapsed.
Mr. Akram was with his parents at the Great Mosque before the beginning of the annual Hajj.
Saudi officials have already firmly pledged that the Hadj will continue to Mecca with thousands who will continue to come to the city.
King Salman said today that the bin Laden group should not have left the arm of the crane when it was not used.
An Arabic version of the decree, published by the state-run Saudi Press Agency, said the bin Laden group was co-responsible for the collapse.
The English-language service of the news agency did not report this detail, but said that the management of the company is forbidden to travel abroad.
Earlier this week, Salman vowed to reveal what caused the fall of the crane, which crashed into a courtyard of the Grand Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered in front of the Hajj later this month.
The Bin Laden Group did not issue any statements on the collapse of Krans and its representatives were not available for comment.
The Royal Decree also blamed the group for lack of current security measures and for not cooperating with meteorologists.
Dozens of cranes surround the Great Mosque of Mecca as part of the massive construction project led by the Bin Laden Group.
The bin Laden family has been associated with the ruling family of Saudi Arabia for decades and undertakes major construction projects.
The late leader of Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, was an apostate son who was expropriated from the family in the 1990s.
The crash of the crane came amid strong winds and rain, just days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage required at least once in the life of any healthy Muslim.
Officials said 158 people remain in the hospital.
Government officials ordered that 1 million rials (<0xC2><0xA3>174,000) be paid to the relatives of those killed and the same amount of permanently injured.
Other injured persons will receive half of this amount.
B&Q Boss Says The Time of Cheap Eastern European Craftsmen Is Over
Britons are increasingly employing artisans, says Veronique Laury
The number of skilled artisans from Eastern Europe has risen
This leads to the opening of 200 more Screwfix stores targeting artisans
At the same time, Kingfisher will close 60 B&Q outlets nationwide
By Rupert Steiner, City Chief Correspondent of the Daily Mail
It is claimed that Britons lay down their hammers and brushes in favor of employing skilled Eastern European craftsmen who carry out the work in their homes.
If you can cleverly handle a hammer or a brush to paint walls, nowadays you seem to belong to a minority.
British people are increasingly employing craftsmen to do homework in their homes, according to the head of the company behind B&Q.
Véronique Laury, new CEO of Kingfisher, which owns the tree market chain, said a large increase in the number of skilled artisans from Eastern Europe who offer services at low prices is now obsolete.
Therefore, Kingfisher plans to open 200 more Screwfix stores aimed at artisans and close 60 B&Q outlets.
Mrs. Laury said she wants to employ more women in B&Q stores, as eight out of ten purchase decisions in the store are made by women.
At the moment, the employees are predominantly men.
She said it was necessary to face the growing demographic trends that have more female single households doing more renovations than in the past.
Mrs Laury said: "It still works a majority of men in our branches.
We need to move this more towards equilibrium.
Basically, half of our customers are women with 80 percent of the decisions about buying items by women.
Women play a major role in the decision-making process.
Mrs Laury, one of only five women at the top of a UK-listed leading company in the FTSE100 Index, has also restructured her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in leadership positions.
Kingfisher is almost the only company that has occupied exactly 50 percent of the team with women, including its management and financial board.
Mrs Laury said: “This was a conscious decision – diversity is an important issue here.
It was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board.
Kingfisher reported a decline in half-year earnings and sales after the group shouldered the cost of closing the stores.
Due to the trend, Kingfisher, which owns Screwfix and B&Q, will open 200 new stores.
Officials of Aich/Dob for infidelity in court
At the Landesgericht Klagenfurt on Wednesday, two officials of the Austrian volleyball vice-champion Aich/Dob were held accountable for infidelity and tax evasion.
The defendants did not plead guilty.
One of them had also been charged with abuse of office.
He was legally acquitted of this accusation in May.
The current process has been delayed.
According to the Supreme Prosecutor, Robert Riffel, in the preliminary investigation, it emerged that the defendants used funds from club accounts that they were allowed to dispose of in their functions between 2006 and 2011 for private purposes.
The damage is estimated at around 400,000 euros.
Sports officials are also charged with financial misconduct.
This fact was dismissed by the chairman of the Schöffensenat, Judge Michaela Sanin.
It should be negotiated at a later date.
As to the allegation of infidelity, the defence stated that the association had at no time suffered an asset disadvantage.
The sports officials had only paid expense compensation and removed the sports club for which they worked from 1982 to 2011 and in which they had invested a lot of time and money from the debts - the liabilities amounted to around 600,000 shillings (approximately 44,000 euros) in 2001.
"At the time, we faced the situation: shall we continue to lead the club or will we block it?" said one of the defendants, a large-scale auditor of the finance office in the bread trade.
Together with his colleague and co-defendant, he then decided to take over this task.
With all the risks.
"We've put money forward, put our life insurance as collateral at the bank," he said at the signing.
It has been agreed with the association: you can freely manage the money, it can only not be made debts.
In addition, with appropriate financial success, the payment of expense compensation was decided retrospectively until 1991.
Therefore, a part of the expense compensation was paid only years later, namely from 2003, when there was a plus on the account.
That is why there were also lump sum and not detailed deductions, the former ombudsman explained the processes.
The accounts and savings books jointly managed the two defendants, the second defendant said.
Why the payouts were not disclosed in detail to the association, the judge asked.
The association was not interested in the details of the financial arrangement, only the debt relief was important, the answer.
When investigations into abuse of office against one of the officials began in 2011, an amount of 120,000 euros was transferred to the club’s account.
It was a scam, the defendants said.
This securities account was held in the name of the second defendant and, according to him, was not known to the association.
“Why?” the judge asked.
For a long time, the respondent did not know the answer.
Then he finally said he believed that this was the best thing for the club.
If something had happened to him, no one would have known anything about this money, the prosecutor put in the room.
The co-accused was informed, the official justified.
This transfer has been formulated as "harm compensation".
Why compensation?, the judge and prosecutor wanted to know.
The first defendant stated that he did not agree with this wording, because the association had never suffered any damage.
But what should I do if the lawyer says, "With that you're all out of the cutter."
"Am I a legal representative?" he asked.
The official also said that he had never received a penny of his salary, he had only calculated the mileage and diets.
On diets, he charged the association 1,000 euros per month, but the actual expense was much higher, he added.
Accurate documents for the early years could not be presented by the defendants.
These were no longer stored after an inspection, in which everything was judged to be correct, they explained.
The second defendant also paid the mileage.
All the corrections were made in cash, he had to drive from his place of residence Völkermarkt to the bank to Bleiburg, he explained in his statement.
The main hearing will continue on September 23 with the questioning of witnesses.
Hewlett-Packard to cut 30,000 more jobs
In addition to the three-year depletion of staff, the computer giant will deplete further jobs in the company’s division.
The U.S. computer giant Hewlett-Packard (HP) has no end.
As part of its restructuring, the U.S. technology group plans to cut from 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate customer division.
This will save costs of $2.7 billion (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.4 billion), the company said on Tuesday.
The move will result in a special charge of around $2.7 billion, which will be incurred from the fourth quarter.
The reduction of 55,000 jobs, which has been ongoing for three years, has not yet been completed.
HP still employed around 302,000 people at the end of the 2013/14 fiscal year.
The Hewlett-Packard stock dropped 2.3 percent.
The printer-grown group from Palo Alto, California, is currently splitting up: this year, the computer and printer business will be bundled into a new society - separate from the more promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies, as well as other services.
Both shares will be listed on the stock exchange.
A once again disappointing PC sales, as well as a weaker demand from corporate customers for its services, recently added to the world’s second-largest PC manufacturer after Lenovo.
In the third quarter at the end of July, sales of PCs and printers fell by 11.5%.
Revenue fell 8% to nearly $25.4 billion.
Revenues fell in 15 out of 16 quarters.
HP is responding to changes in the industry with a split and massive job cuts.
The 76-year-old company, led by Meg Whitman, has responded lately to customers increasingly buying smartphones and tablets instead of conventional computers and doing more and more business online.
Whitman’s restructuring plans foresee the removal of around 55,000 jobs in total.
Conflicts: Majority Supports Anti-IS Training Mission
However, a direct involvement of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq would be largely rejected: 54 percent opposed it, 35 percent agreed.
That other states are flying airstrikes against ISIS in Iraq and Syria is 61 percent positive.
Twenty-four percent are against intervening in the conflict.
Cooperation with Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad is rejected by 51 percent of the respondents, 20 percent would be in favor.
Twenty-nine percent were unable to make a decision.
Car: Second press day at the 66th IAA
The exhibition will focus on connected, self-driving cars and electric mobility until September 27.
After two days of press, German Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 66th International Auto Show under the motto "Mobility connects" on Thursday.
The general public can visit the IAA from Saturday.
As two years ago, the organizers of the Auto-Verband VDA expect about 900,000 visitors.
Röszke: Violence at the Serbian-Hungarian border
Hungarian police have deployed tear gas and water jets at the Serbian border near Röszke against several hundred insurgent refugees.
Euronews correspondent Dániel Bozsik has witnessed the outbreak of violence at the border checkpoint.
He reported by phone:
A group of refugees crossed the border.
Behind it, a police line had formed and behind the policemen was a water projector.
40 to 50 refugees began to throw stones, sticks and plastic bottles at the officials.
The officials initially used uninterrupted pepper spray.
The police then used tear gas.
A lot of tear gas was sprayed towards the refugees.
This dissolved the group.
The refugees have now withdrawn a little while awaiting.
A pregnant and apparently injured woman was taken out of the zone.
Children who had inhaled the tear gas were screaming.
Other refugees collapsed and suffered from shortness of breath.
Serbian police spokesmen were also injured by the use of tear gas and pepper spray.
Time of decision on interest rates for the U.S. Central Bank
The world is watching when the U.S. Central Bank meets on two days, Wednesday and Thursday, to make the important decision whether or not interest rates will be raised for the first time in nearly a decade.
A poll of 80 economists polled by Reuters found that just over half of those who last week thought the Fed would do so now think the Fed would stay a little longer and keep interest rates at the current level of 0 to 0.25 percent.
It’s a historic event because it’s been seven years since the Fed set interest rates at NULL.
“For the first time, we are approaching a situation where a large central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of normalizing interest rates,” said Angel Ubide, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The U.S. economy is on a relatively good performance level, trillions of dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a small amount of inflation.
However, the Fed cannot ignore the less rosy outlook on global conditions.
It has warned the markets to set themselves up for an increase, but the signs suggest that the odds against such a move are good.
The decision will be announced at 20:00 CET on Thursday
Delta State University killer leaves letter of apology
After shooting and killing his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning — and before he shot and killed his colleagues later in the day — Shannon Lamb wrote a note saying she “sorry” for the first murder and wanted to “make it impossible,” authorities announced Tuesday.
Police in Gautier, Mississippi, said Lamb, a professor of geography and social sciences at Delta State University, called the emergency number by 10:00 a.m. on Monday morning.
He said he shot someone and killed someone.
Lamb told an emergency call center employee that the police had to send police officers to his home.
He said, "I shot my wife last night" and he also mentioned that there was a "sweet dog" in the house, but that "no one will bother" but he will probably be excited.
The police asked the caller for his name, but he did not give it.
Lamb did not give an explanation for his shots.
As police entered the scene, they found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41, and a handwritten note from Lamb, 45, which said, "I'm so sorry, I wanted to, I could undo it.
I loved Amy, and she’s the only woman who ever loved me.”
After writing the note, Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a professor of history, before finally taking his own life on Monday night when police surrounded him.
University president William LaForge said he knew nothing about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr Lamb's idea."
Despite reports on Monday that Lamb allegedly believed Prentiss also had a relationship with Schmidt, authorities said on Tuesday there was "no information, no evidence" for a "triangle relationship".
Prentiss was described by Shawn O'Steen, who stated that they had been married for about seven years, as a "good man".
The two divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends.
O'Steen said he and Prentiss had a 19-year-old daughter and she was "destroyed on the ground."
He said that Prentiss' daughter was "absolutely best friends".
Prentiss worked online from home, according to Linsday Knowles, who was identified by the Sun Herald as a close friend of Prentiss.
Knowles said Prentiss, who owned a dog called Lightning, had been dating Lamb for about three years.
"She always wanted to help other people," Knowles said.
Police said Lamb had called relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them "he's not going to jail."
When police picked him up on Highway 1 near Greenville later that night, Lamb drove his car to the side, ran on foot, ran into the forest, and killed himself with a shot.
Lamb received a doctorate from Delta State University in the spring of 2015, as his lifeline indicates on the university’s website.
Stars who lost their lucky bearer
The actor (left), in the picture with his son Redmond (right), had some stressful years.
In 2001, he fought leukemia, and in 2009, he lost his longtime partner, Farrah Fawcett, to cancer.
The actor also allegedly struggled with drugs, and in 2008 he was convicted of drug possession.
All of this surely demands his tribute.
Eurowings: Lufthansa rebuilds the group
Lufthansa is planning a major restructuring of the group.
The Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros a year with a better organisation alone.
150 of the world’s around 1000 executives will cost the company’s job.
However, there are new negotiations with the pilot union.
Lufthansa restructures its corporate structure and upgrades its low-cost subsidiary Eurowings.
The aim of the realignment is a contribution of about 500 million euros per year from cost and revenue synergies, the airline announced on Wednesday.
Among other things, Lufthansa will no longer have a board of directors for the passenger business.
The Eurowings low-cost airline should be developed as independently as possible.
Karl Ulrich Garnadt will be responsible for Eurowings in the management team around Carsten Spohr.
With the redesign, Spohr underlines the importance of Eurowings, with which the group intends to compete against Ryanair and Easyjet in the future.
So far, the organization of the 120,000-strong company has been complex.
The airlines signed under the umbrella of the Passage Airline Group, which accounts for three quarters of its annual turnover of 30 billion euros.
New Negotiations with Pilots
In the tariff conflict with the Pilots' Association Cockpit (VC), the negotiations are to resume after the judicially halted strike on Thursday.
This was reported by the union.
The subject of the talks should be the retirement scheme for pilots.
Cockpit aims to achieve bearable results “within a year with a forecast record result” as quickly as possible.
The conflict between trade unions and airlines has led to several strikes in recent months.
In addition to the transitional provision of the pilots, the background is the savings concept "wings".
It is planned that Lufthansa will outsource routes to the group’s own airline Eurowings in the fight against competitors.

Manchester United's Luke Shaw can't play for months due to double fracture
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture of his right leg in Manchester's Champions League defeat at PSV Eindhoven.
While this caused the left outer defender to cry and will exclude him from playing for at least six months, Louis van Gaal does not give up hope that Shaw will be able to play again this season.
The injury was caused by a ruthless attack by Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute after the 20-year-old Shaw broke into the PSV area.
He was treated on the field for nine minutes and needed oxygen before being taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He has a double leg fracture and is in the hospital."
He will be moved tomorrow or maybe a day later and then operated on in Manchester.
It’s terrible – a boy who comes to Manchester United at 18, has it very hard and then plays fantastically, and then that happens.
In the dressing room, he wore an oxygen mask.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, it takes six months, and he won't play in the group stage.
I hope he can play again this season.
Moreno seemed happy to have escaped a red card and the imposition of an elf meter.
Nicola Rizzoli, the referee, did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gaal suspected that the Italian referee was wrong.
You can judge for yourself when I say that an elf meter and a red card were due.
It was a very bad attack with both legs.
A tweet on Shaw's account read, "Thank you all for your messages. Words can't describe how broken I am, my path to recovery starts now, I'll come back stronger."
Related: Manchester United suffers loss of Luke Shaw in PSV defeat
With the European Championship in France, the England defender has an additional incentive to recover by June.
Phillip Cocu, the PSV coach, said, "It's a very bad injury."
When a player with this kind of injury leaves the field, everyone is very sad about it.
It is never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent.
Moreno suffered a leg fracture when Mexico played against Van Gaal's Holland team at the 2014 World Cup.
"He's doing himself very hard because it wasn't his intention to hurt the opponent, and if you then hear that it's a very bad injury, that's not good," Cocu said.
It was not possible for me to see the moment.
The only thing I could see was the ball moving in a different direction, so it looked like he [Moreno] had touched him, but I couldn’t see the attack on Luke.
Speaking to SBS6, Moreno said: "I know how it feels, I know how difficult such a thing can be.
I feel really bad about it, I'm so sorry.
PSV player Andrés Guardado was also taken to the hospital after a foul by Chris Smalling.
Are you sure David Cameron knows The Lorax better?
It’s one thing all parents will soon learn: If your child loves a book, it won’t take long for you to know it almost memorably.
Unless you might be David Cameron.
When asked by a provider of childcare systems to name his favorite children's book, the Prime Minister chose The Lorax, Dr. Seuss' 1971 environmental fable.
It was a difficult choice, Cameron writes in a message on the company's SuperCamps website, and continues: "fun, moving, creative and with a powerful message, it's a book I like to read to my children because it always seems to give a picture or a message that we've missed so far."
All good, except that the following paragraph, in which Cameron allegedly describes the plot of the book, instead reproduces a content statement from the 2012 film version that added new characters and details to expand the rather short original text.
"In the midst of the walled city of Thneed-Ville, however, where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams, by fulfilling her desire to see a real tree", reads one 1991.
As if that weren't suspicious enough: The text presented by Cameron reads partly like the summary of the Lorax film, which is presented on the website of the Internet Movie Database and starts with: "In the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity, T's wife T's name is T's heart."
Although he admits to being a pragmatic father, it seems unlikely that Cameron is so unfamiliar with the plot of the book. Here an unnamed boy hears how the local environment, through the greedy, falling trees, thneeding once-ler, is spitting in spite of the protests of the naming Lorax, a squatting br.
Most likely, such a relatively low PR assignment was delegated to a helper who did not read The Lorax to a child 20 times in a row.
A Downing Street spokeswoman said the text probably came from Cameron’s constituency office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron's staff, but made no further immediate comments.
Adam Lyth was clearly threatened by the expulsion from the England team, but it is still difficult
Clashing with Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but if you look at the squad England has chosen for the tour, a repeat of the 3-0 Test series defeat is not on my map.
I wouldn't rule out an outside victory.
Alastair Cook’s side may be less experienced than the one three years ago, but there are good spin players in the batting setup, and the community spirit is strong; they’ll carry no 2012 scars, just a youth-positive attitude.
With the ball, Moeen Ali develops as a spin bowler and Adil Rashid, even though he represents an unknown size at the test level, is an option for the attack.
Adam Lyth retires from the England Test squad and is replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to leave Adam Lyth out is, of course, difficult to analyze for me as his head coach in Yorkshire.
At his seven tests, there were two good attacks under difficult conditions, and the simple but tough reality is that cricket players are focused on results.
There were no question marks at Joe Root, for example, and that led to the nomination, since - and I have said this before - players are their own best pickers.
A long time ago, Lyth's course would have been extended, but he had control over his own destiny.
If he hopes to make more runs for Yorkshire, another chance comes.
England coach Trevor Bayliss praised his attitude, even though he did not perform so well, and that is not surprising to me; he is above all a team-man.
The question of how much time a test batsman gets to set his mark is difficult.
Lyth got seven chances - like Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton got the chance to play at home and abroad.
The only accusation that you can raise was that England first put Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean – when Lyth was in top form – but this lost opportunity is now in the past.
Alex Hales comes in, and he's a batsman that I highly value.
He is an X-factor cricketer, which we saw at Yorkshire early this season when he scored 236 against us on a Trent Bridge pitch, which hit us very hard.
He has to get at least the same chances as before him, but this of course depends on the team deployment in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of having Moeen beat next to Cook, what an extra spin bowler would do and get four quicks, came up, and I don’t mind.
I don’t see why a batsman can’t beat there, and this left-hander has already shown that he’s a hell of a cricket player.
Moeen may not have done his job for his County Worcestershire, but he's a number 3 for them, and there's no big difference.
My former teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 tests at the first drop before appearing as an opener in 2001.
He made three hundred runs immediately and did not look back.
Zafar Ansari comes in as a back-up spinner, and in my limited dealings with him he impressed me as a young man.
People might look at his stats — an average of 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball — and think it’s a point, but there aren’t a large number of backup spinners who raise their hands and the coaches have chosen youth.
He will learn a lot on this tour.
Aside from the team, England has made some clever additions to the coaching staff.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, the batsman from Sri Lanka, as a consultant for the test matches could be a master coup.
He is one of the nicest guys in the game who will bring a wealth of experience as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes for the white ball stage of the tour, bringing energy and a powerful deployment into the setup.
I’ve always felt that he was created for the international cricket competition, as a player or as a coach, and like Mahela, he has insights that we can benefit from.
Sometimes new voices in the dressing room can bring fresh air, even if the news is in line with what was previously said.
Colly’s teammate at Durham, Ben Stokes, is not used at the One-Dayers, Root got a similar break against Australia and I, for my part, have no problem with that.
Some will not agree, but coaches and team builders do not determine the schedule.
And you need to remember that as with players, their jobs depend on the results.
Such decisions are not made with an easy heart.
The Brexit stockpile (Brexit = Britain’s exit from the EU) could gain momentum if the economy goes into a flurry by 2017
David Cameron’s unprecedented renegotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU is getting deeper into trouble every day, even without electing brilliant Jeremy “Is it Yes or No?” Corbyn to be the leader of Labour or the TUC, which is fiercely clashing over Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their Corbyns and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomat friend said recently that some member states, as deeply entangled in various crises as the EU is now, and not always out of their own guilt, are fed up with Britain’s own agenda of split concessions and disruptive treaty changes that they usually don’t want.
In Brighton, the TUC decided at its annual meeting that it would not like them if they jeopardized social protection.
We could also call it Dave and George's selfie agenda.
Prime Ministers and Finance Ministers climb summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, take a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument, with or without local sizes, then come home and say they are winning allies for reforms.
It's always about me.
My European friend, who wants a Britain looking out inside the EU tent - "Let's not be alone with France," says Berlin - and makes it clear that more and more shortsighted ministers and officials in some capitals have come to the point where they don't care if we stay or go.
Germany’s cautious Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave office before it looks bad for her, as has happened with the overly long-suffering such as Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
France’s François Hollande is looking at his re-election or replacement in 2017.
He is also a fading force.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right-wing government, Spain a left-wing one.
It’s hard to imagine that they’ll tear themselves out to help the selfie Brits, whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland’s exit from the UK – something they don’t want either, because most have similar separatist tendencies.
Therefore, some such ministers may even be planning deliberately unhelpful remarks, all in the SNP style, during Britain’s 2017 referendum campaign to speed up the Brexit process, my friend suspects.
"The renegotiation was a failure" and "the UK has gained nothing of value from the renegotiation."
The Europeans know how predatory Fleet Street can be at their expense and what EU skeptics the oligarchy of the press baroness is, as they were not during the referendum inspired by Tony Benn in 1975, which supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2:1.
You may well remember Boris Johnson, the ore-euro opportunist who made a name for himself as an EU-right banana Brussels correspondent in the early 1990s.
In all his madness, Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were.
This included the medley of tax-fearing thugs, phone-hacking foreigners, and the pseudo-non-natives who own most of our major newspapers.
Actually, Tony Blair thought similarly about them, but found that when you sit in a cage with a hot gorilla, you’d better distribute bananas to distract him, rather than become his lunch and dinner.
In fact, Miliband was more Blairian than Blair himself when he opposed Cameron’s referendum whirlwind, because Blair had put forward the principle of the unenacted EU constitution, which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, thus opening him a back door.
The press never forgave him.
But the nice Jeremy Corbyn, who gave me a friendly slap on my back in Westminster on Monday – I told him he doesn’t need to waste any more time for me – seems at risk of repeating Neil Kinnock’s boycott Murdoch strategy of the 1980s, a mistake then and today.
It may take a while, but he needs to develop a coherent strategy to win the media, not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position on Europe is - I am kind enough to say it - in development.
He says we should remain in a reformed EU.
Well, most people outside of Ukip’s traditional leaching tendency and the wilder fields of Tory’s small-englishism can probably say yes.
It's what Hilary "A Benn but not a Bennite" Benn said on radio and television this week when the scout fought in it, not admitting that Corbyn's appointment of provocative John McDonnell as shadow chancellor was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 70s when his old father tried to be disloyal to his Labour cabinet colleagues on television without going too far and losing his cabinet job.
Hilary's fight was even more attractive.
But fighting to stay “under all circumstances” — Benn’s expression — wasn’t what McDonnell said, nor was it what JC told his fellow contenders and MPs, according to all reports, at their closing session on Monday evening.
Whatever the turbulent bottom-up image of Corbyn wants to convey – remember that he even touched me – news discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the whirlwind of social media, a breeding ground of paranoia and betrayal.
It’s right not to give Cameron a free pass for Europe that allows him to hold Labour’s support in the referendum campaign for a self-evident, as McDonnell said.
I'm sure Simon Jenkins thinks so.
But McDonnell and Corbyn’s fundamental ambiguities about EU membership – in line with their Bennite siege economy, their anti-capitalist past – are no longer just a matter of esoteric discussion among left-wing dissidents, for which the narcissism of the small difference is a central principle of dogmatic contention.
As with his ambiguities about NATO - Tom Watson is firmly convinced that JC is not launching a campaign to leave - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to find a meaning in everything for their superiors at home.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have suspicious voters - to make concessions to the British, if all this can be pointless?
The U.S. is already quite disappointed by the weak military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a cost reduction of the Tory government in power, which I was reminded of at the start on Monday of something called the British Influence Security Forum.
Experts Criticize Public Health England Report on E-Cigarettes
Claims by a government-funded agency that e-cigarettes are less harmful than smoking arose from a meeting of 12 people, partly with connections to the tobacco industry, researchers said.
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined Lancet by criticizing the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in their report on e-cigarettes.
PHE published the “Basic Report” last month, describing it as a “comprehensive review of the evidence.”
However, some researchers questioned the robustness of the data and pointed to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
An editorial in the medical journal Lancet last month attacked the "extraordinarily windy foundation" on which PHE grounded its most important conclusion.
Two other researchers are writing in BMJ and have asked whether the claims "build on stone or sand".
Martin McKee, Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: “A fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of effectiveness.”
They said the public expects that PHE’s claim that “the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than smoking” is based on a detailed review of the evidence and modeling.
In fact, this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who were convened to develop a model for a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) to summarize their views on the harms of various nicotine-containing products into a synthesis of the three results.
McKee and Capewell said a sponsor of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose CEOs were previously reported to have received from British American Tobacco Agents (BAT) for an independent study.
He also signed BAT’s public health references in a sustainability report, they said.
One of the 12 participants at the meeting said he was receiving funds from an e-cigarette manufacturer, but not the funding he reportedly received earlier from the tobacco company Philip Morris International, they added.
The reasons for choosing the members of the board are not provided, but these include several well-known e-cigarette champions, some of whom also state industry funding in the paper.
Some other participants in this session are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.
The PHE tobacco management also participated in the meeting.
The group’s research work “remarkably states” that there is a lack of “hard evidence for the damage to most products under most criteria,” McKee and Capewell wrote.
However, none of these connections or limitations are discussed in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said PHE's claims that "there is no evidence so far that e-cigarettes serve as a way to smoke for children or non-smokers" were premature.
Prof Kevin Fenton, director of health and well-being at PHE, said that the claims of BMJ had already been responded to before.
He said: “E-cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking.”
One in two smokers dies from their addiction.
All evidence suggests that the health risks of e-cigarettes are low in comparison, but that we still have to study the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about what the evidence proves and what it does not, especially when there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Nearly 80,000 people die each year from a smoking-related disease, and smoking costs the National Health System <0xC2><0xA3>2 billion a year.
By clearly presenting current evidence that e-cigarettes are not risk-free, but represent only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking, we fulfill our national jurisdiction.
BBC should give up EastEnders, says former head of Channel 4
Former Channel 4 chairman Luke Johnson has said the BBC should stop broadcasting programs like EastEnders and The Voice, saying commercial rivals would "give their right arm" for hit shows like the Albert Square Soap.
Johnson said the broadcasting fee should only be used to make the kind of programs that are not broadcast by other UK broadcasters.
He criticized the BBC for placing public-law programs that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience in fiercely contested time frames against the most popular shows of their rivals and from broadcasters such as BBC4.
After BBC CEO Tony Hall said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations, Johnson said he had been unsuccessful in trying to get in touch with the BBC for six years during his time at Channel 4.
“I have problems with the idea that the BBC commissions or broadcasts programs that would also be clearly shown by unsubsidized rivals,” Johnson told the House Communications Committee as part of his investigation into the BBC’s future.
If you want to keep the broadcasting fee, which I don’t think is a good idea in the medium or long term, you should at least put its production on programs that others don’t do or commission.
They send The Voice in a premium time window because they want to achieve the widest possible support for their future.
The idea that no one else would show this is a joke, it’s ridiculous, of course it’s nonsense.
Johnson said, “I don’t see why a regressive tax finances programs that could be financed even without subsidies.
The Voice is such a program, EastEnders is another, admittedly both own productions.
Honestly, other channels would give their right arm for it.
I am trying to see what this public-law television is supposed to be like.
I don’t think that would reduce the BBC at all.
Johnson, an entrepreneur for series who ran Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said the BBC was to blame for the hunt for reviews "because of the ambitions of the people who work there and because they believe this is the best way to secure long-term support."
His comments on the BBC's most popular shows reflect what former Sky executive Tony Ball suggested in his MacTaggart talk in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC should sell shows like EastEnders.
Johnson said the rather public-law niche programs "should go to BBC4, where you can't quite measure the audience, but they do their jobs, and they can argue if they go on their hypocritical missions to justify <0xC2><0xA3>4 billion in broadcast fees."
They put her in a time window where no one ever wanted to see her.
Speaking about the broadcasting fee, Johnson told the committee: "I urge you to find a rather regressive system in terms of conditions, who can get the best value out of it.
Of course everyone thinks we all think you get a great value here for <0xC2><0xA3>150 a year, but for people who are a lot of money for the <0xC2><0xA3>150, ask me if that’s true because they don’t consume much from the BBC.
Former Sky and Channel 5 chief David Elstein, who also told the committee on Tuesday, urged the BBC to review its Reithian mission to "inform, educate and entertain".
He said little of the BBC production would now officially be classified as education — he said it was 1% of its TV production and 0.1% on the radio — and she should take an example at public-law television stations in Australia and Canada to change this into “informing, enlightening and entertaining.”
On the issue of partnerships, Elstein said the BBC should do more in areas such as proms, which he said only a handful will be shown on TV, and make alliances with commercial broadcasters to make everything available online.
'Sonogenetics' Can Control Brain Cells Through Sound Waves
The video shows how the nematodes change direction the moment they are irradiated with sound pulses.
Scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by outbreaks of sound waves.
The tiny nematodes change direction the moment they are irradiated with sound pulses that have too high frequencies for human hearing to be heard.
The pulses work by switching on motor neuron cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that respond to ultrasound waves.
More on this topic: Researchers read and write brain activity with light
The researchers said the worms showed the power of a new process called sonogenetics, in which ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain, heart, and muscle cells outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that the procedure could one day replace deep brain stimulation, an invasive procedure that releases electrical impulses into people's brains to treat the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.
Threadworms usually do not react to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that they did so when surrounded by a liquid with microscopic air bubbles.
The bubbles, he found, amplify the ultrasonic waves, which then penetrate the worms.
The amplified ultrasonic waves act on structures called TRP-4 ion channels and are found in the membranes of some of the worm cells.
The sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells to which they are assigned, according to a report by Nature Communications.
To create ultrasonic-controlled nematodes, Chalasani genetically altered the worms so that some of their motor neurons carry TRP-4 ion channels.
When he applies ultrasound to the altered creatures, the sound waves are amplified by the microbubbles and transmitted to the worms, where they turn on the altered motor neurons.
The process has some similarities to Optogenetics, a groundbreaking tool that allows scientists to turn on and off neurons with pulses of light.
But Chalasani said that sonogenetics could have some advantages over this technique.
Unlike light, which needs to be sent down on an optical fiber to the desired location in the brain, low-frequency ultrasound waves can pass tissue unhindered and can thus be sent to the brain from the top of the skull.
"We believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus, it is possible to make the targeted human neurons temporarily susceptible to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments," Chalasani said.
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.
Illegal torture equipment - right at your doorstep!
The ads embarrass the UK's arms trade
Watch Amnesty International's anti-weapons trade fair video.
Terrible killer drones!
Knee shattering leg cuffs!
Scatter bombs!
And electric shock rods that cause painful pain, but leave no trace!
The cheerful voice and the cartoon images leave no doubt that this ad for the world’s largest arms trade fair is a combative parody produced by Amnesty International to highlight the British government’s willingness to explode weapons to repressive regimes via the London Defence and Security Equipment Centre in London.

But a separate campaign also leads to many posters that can be seen at bus stops and in subway trains that require a second look.
"Important Announcement: Do you ride the DLR from 15 to 18 September?" (Docklands Light Railway) can be read in the fonts of the London Underground and the trademark of the DLR line, which turns into the image of a tank.
In September, a swarm of arms dealers will ride with the DLR ... customers will be asked to help stop the arms trade fair.
The 300 posters are from artists who have exhibited their work at the Museum of Cruel Designs in Banksy’s Dismaland.
A collective called the Special Patrol Group helped distribute in London, using “Ad Space Hack Packs,” a 6-pound pack of inbox keys that are claimed to “access about a third of the bus stop advertising spaces on the planet.”
Transport for London does not find this poster "vandalism" funny.
One of the parody ads produced by Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Crueol Designs and lecturer at the University of Essex, artists are becoming more critical and trying to bring political work to audiences outside of galleries.
Many artists work with activists within protest movements, noting that they have to go out into the real world in order for their art to have an impact on society.
Another anti-weapons trade poster greets commuters in the subway.
The Amnesty video was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours via Facebook and was created by the advertising agency VCCP, which works with the graphic artist and voiceover artist, who also works for free.
VCCP Creative Director Matt Lever was astonished by the silence surrounding the ad for the arms trade fair – through a blank spot of the ExCeL calendar – and thought, “Let’s give them the campaign they’re trying to avoid.”
They played with the invention of a more realistic dubious corporate advertising, but "by blending with bright colors and animation, it remains more sticky."
“They have done a fantastic job by helping us raise awareness about the sale of illegal torture devices at the fair,” said Tom Davies of Amnesty International.
What we need now is a British government intervention and a guarantee that torture equipment will not be illegally traded at our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art around the Arms Fair comes from the area within ExCeL, where exhibitors paint fantastically euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab reveals an order from the U.S. Army about "the AT4CS RS shot from the shoulder."
This includes a "uniquely shaped warhead that delivers outstanding aftereffects inside the target."

Eight Golden Rules for Living in Student Housing
Eleven years ago, as a self-forgotten 19-year-old, I moved into a student residence, still believing in Berets and moral relativism, but only now do I remember the tense smiles of those I angered – and the numerous, long-term complaints about others.
Most of what I’ve learned can be distilled into eight simple rules.
The influx into student residences ranges from slightly nerve-wracking to absolutely frightening.
It’s tempting to sweat: people tell you where you came from, if and where you took Sabbath year, where you stand in relation to Corbyn, and why you “honestly neither love nor hate Marmite, because seriously, guys, it’s just a yeast extract HAHA, I’m in my room.”
Breathe through.
And help others do the same - ask questions and show interest.
It directs the conversation and helps you find out the people you like as opposed to those you wouldn’t talk to, even if your eyelashes were on fire and these were fire extinguishers.
Let people go.
People’s rooms often turn into beverage receptions, movie night venues, and municipal meeting places, but they are also the places where people dress and straighten their underwear.
Related: Don’t Think About Starting a Relationship at University
Introverts receive rough treatment at the university.
Your room should be a haven, but many student residences form a room-to-room bubble culture that is friendly and social and can lead to lifelong friendship.
This could be hell for someone trying to recover.
Nothing in the culture allows you to say, "I like you, and I want our friendship to continue, but you have to go away so that I can get back the energy I used to interact with you."
Try to feel when a comrade is exhausted from socializing — and text him instead of knocking.
Speaking of knocking, do it.
A guy in my student residence had the idea that an unlocked door was an invitation.
He saw some things.
Friendship is made by baking.
As you start the university at the height of back-mania, knocking on people's doors to introduce yourself with a plate full of brownies is less odd than welcoming the 1950s "Welcome to the neighborhood, I baked you something. So, and now please smile when I ask you a few personal questions."
Offering homemade treats is a good way to make friends.
Your roommates feel obligated to chat and may eventually associate your face with a tasty surprise.
Of course, this depends on whether you are a decent baker.
Poorly mixed lumps of flour, sugar, and fat cause people to fall asleep when you knock.
Stealing food is a common crime in student housing.
Of course, clawing chicken is a theft, but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea too?
Check with the dairy owner.
The chances are good that they say to serve themselves, even if they cook inside.
If someone steals your stuff, that’s annoying, and you have my sympathy — but try to deal with it more balancedly than my roommate, who added a detergent to her milk to punish thieves.
She's in jail now.
You should not make any noise that keeps people from sleeping or working.
It’s not just about being a decent person, it’s about being one of the people who sit in the glass house in the truest sense of the saying.
A girl in my hallway asked her neighbors if they would mind putting drum & bass a little quieter because it was three in the morning, and she had a rehearsal in the morning.
They responded with even louder music.
When she finally stopped at 5 a.m., she kindly let her neighbors sleep for another two hours before she let her own music play, shut her door, and went to her three-hour exam.
Wouldn’t it be romantic if your future spouse accidentally moved into the same student residence?
Conversely, wouldn’t it be profoundly embarrassing if you thought of a roommate as your future spouse, hooked up with her, separated again, and then had to see her every day and maybe see her pull all of her friends together?
Of course, the heart goes its own way - but if a hot roommate is definitely not your future spouse, at least try to convince your lower body a bit of reason.
In the exciting moment you notice that someone has left their keys in their unlocked room, the boundary between an ulk and bullying is finer than it seems.
A good stroke is funny, but it only takes moments to become a boomerang.
By hiding, give a valuable and fun lesson about safety – but never spoil someone’s room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Close their door, and put their keys in a glass of water, which you then put in the freezer - but don't grab their possessions on the ceiling more than twice.
Townhouses for refugees, single parents, low earners
Real estate contractor Markus Gildner builds townhouses for people who don’t have a lot of money in the Eckental area of central France.
So, for example, for refugees - but also as a signal: "Not only refugees need housing, but also the single-parent mother and the low-wage."
“I’m showing you how to build cheaply and well today,” the 44-year-old says in the interview.
Thousands of refugees will be forced into the housing market.
Entrepreneur Markus Gildner believes he knows how to quickly create affordable housing: he is building townhouses for refugees in a project.
Mr Gildner, many refugees will be pushing into the housing market.
What solution do you offer?
Markus Gildner: Massive accommodation in containers or gyms is not sustainable.
Because people stay here for a large part.
Given the refugee flow, we also need enough housing in the coming decades.
A very trivial, three-storey townhouse is the solution.
Gildner: A townhouse needs the least space.
It facilitates integration.
This is different when you put people in housing blocks.
Each of the six houses currently being built in the pilot project consists of three housing units for four asylum seekers each.
Each living unit has two bedrooms, a bathroom, a kitchen and a living room.
It may be that many refugees will say it is peace again, I am going back.
Then the houses can be easily rebuilt according to the respective needs.
How high are the costs?
Gildner: The price for 160 square meters of living space per house is 184,000 euros, without land.
That's manageable.
It took six months to build.
That's appropriate.
Did the building regulations complicate their plans?
Gildner: In terms of construction law, I went through my project correctly.
Particularly complicated is always the imminent damocles sword special construction and the site regulation.
Terrible.
It is still assumed that whoever creates three apartments in a detached house needs at least three pitches.
There is no room for this only in the cities.
And refugees and asylum seekers don’t have cars.
How did the locals react to their townhouse project?
Gildner: There were some who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers.
Which is definitely not right.
But don’t you exacerbate the competition for affordable housing?
Gildner: It’s true: We’ve had a boom in Germany in the last five years, but luxury apartments have been built that hardly any more can afford.
My project has the message, even the normal people need housing.
Not only refugees, but also the single-parent mother or the low-income person.
I show you how to build cheaply and well today.
That's the point.
Markus Gildner (44) studied microsystem engineering in Regensburg and initially dealt with environmental analyses.
iOS 9: How to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple update is released
The new operating system can be requested by going to the Settings app, tapping on "General" and then selecting "Software Update".
When it is ready, the phone gives you the option to download and then to install.
Some have encountered problems after the installation, as they receive an error message stating that the "software update failed".
To avoid the problem, users are advised to either wait until the storm returns or try to update via iTunes.
The phone itself will guide you through the rest of the process.
This may mean deleting apps to create space – but Apple has made this less likely by slimming down the update, and it will be easier to do so if you use a special tool to delete apps and then reinstall them once the process is complete.
It is worth making sure that your mobile phone is charged during the update or is located near a charger so that the battery is charged.
If the charge is too low, Apple won’t allow the update to continue as the phone may shut down halfway and this could result in an interruption of the update.

You should also make sure that you have checked through our checklist of all things before downloading to prevent things from going wrong and to protect yourself if they do. iOS 9 brings new features, including a much smarter personal assistant and huge new productivity features for the iPad, as well as changes that speed up the operating system and speed up the system.
Rosberg's only motto: Full Attack
Nico Rosberg knows only one motto in the fight for the Formula 1 World Championship against his clearly leading Mercedes teammate Lewis Hamilton: "Full attack".
The second World Cup before the start in the crucial seven overseas races emphasized "that I have nothing more to lose".
53 points separate the vice-world champion from title defender and double-champion Hamilton before the night race in Singapore on Sunday.
The Brit has already won seven of the previous twelve seasons and is also taking on the Floodlight Grand Prix in the city state as a favorite.
In 2009 and last year, the 30-year-old Briton was able to win the race.
Whether the current smog in the city-state will influence the Singapore Grand Prix is still unclear.
For days, a fog bell has hung over the city, triggered by fires on the neighboring island of Sumatra.
Bad Kissinger Chess Club has a prominent member
The chess club "Schachfreunde Bad Kissingen", founded three months ago, has added another member to its ranks, thus increasing the number of members to 19 players.
The new member is the entrepreneur Paul Gauselmann, a passionate chess and tennis player who has been to the spa more than 40 times in Bad Kissingen.
Gauselmann is a 1st Class Federal Merit Cross and an honorary citizen of the cities of Espelkamp and Lübbecke.
Gauselmann supported the chess club in Bad Kissingen with a donation received by Chairman Alfred Klein.
This makes it possible to accept chess players who cannot pay the membership fee.
Youth work and the search for talent should also be promoted.
Gauselmann wishes to see membership in the chess club and also friendly contact with the tennis club "Rot-Weiß" as an expression of his connection with the spa town.
Quartiersbüro seeks direct contact
Salutis and the old centre Antonistift have teamed up under the umbrella of the social foundation and opened a new contact point at Graf-Staufenberg-Platz.
In addition to consultations, you can also take part in courses there.
The social foundation pulls it down from the mountain into the city centre.
More specifically, at Graf-Staufenberg-Platz.
Recently, a new neighborhood office was opened there.
Here, next to the shopping market, seniors and counsellors will now receive information on issues such as nursing insurance or health and nursing services.
For years, we have been finding out with our outpatient care service that often nursing relatives are left alone.
There are infinitely many questions.
"It is also not uncommon that many of the benefits of the cash registers are not used, because the complexity of insurance is hardly understood," explained the new housewife Jutta Weigand, who is also responsible for the Antonistift and the civil hospital as well as for the outpatient service "Amadeus".
In addition to the consultations, the new neighbourhood office also offers prevention, health courses and wellness.
The salute was taken to the boat.
Therefore, you can use additional offers such as fall prevention, memory training or a physiotherapeutic treatment.
The offers from the Seniorenzentrum and the Salutis complement each other in an ideal way.
Salutis stands for prevention, prevention and rehabilitation.
"The Senior Care and Care Centre," said Heike Riedel, managing director of Saludis.
The reason for the opening of the new district office in the city center is seen by both managing directors, especially in the demographic change.
Because this makes a good decentralized infrastructure in the individual districts of Bamberg indispensable in the future.
In addition, Mayor Wolfgang Metzner (SPD) emphasized at the inauguration celebrations, the Quarter Office is also dedicated to old age loneliness: "There are numerous events and offers on the program and these invite to a regular social gathering".
In this way, the social foundation makes a great contribution so that seniors can live independently and well in their familiar environment.
The Quarter Office is open Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 9 am to 2 pm, Tuesday and Thursday from 4 pm to 6 pm and Saturdays from 10 am to 12 pm.
Eintracht Bamberg vs Würzburger Kickers on 6 October
Now it is official: After the date for the match FC Eintracht Bamberg against the third-leaguer Würzburger Kickers had not yet been set due to renovation work at the Fuchsparkstadion, October 6th has now been set as a date.
The match of FC Eintracht Bamberg in the eighth final of the Bayerische Fußball Totopokals against third-leaguer FC Würzburger Kickers has now been finalised.
It will be played on Tuesday, 6 October, at 7 p.m. at the Bamberger Fuchsparkstadion.
"We are happy to know now when the game will go on stage, now we have planning security," said FCE team manager Karlheinz Hümmer, who also points to the now launched ticket pre-sale.
It’s something special for our team to play against a third-league player.
We therefore hope for a large number of spectators, and this is not without reason, because floodlight games have a special appeal.
In the round of the last 16 teams FC Eintracht Bamberg moved in 2010 through victories against district leaguer 1. FC Oberhaid (3:1) and at home against regional leaguer 1. FC Schweinfurt 05 (3:2).
The winner of the competition receives 5000 euros and qualifies for the first round of the DFB Club Cup 2016/2017.
Defender of the title is Third-League descent SpVgg Unterhaching.
Vienna architect Karl Mang dies at 92
Karl Mang, one of the doyens of Viennese architecture, is dead.
He died on September 5, at the age of 92, as the Künstlerhaus reported on Tuesday.
With Mang, the Künstlerhaus lost an honorary member and at the same time "one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna", as it said in the broadcast.
Born in Vienna in 1922, Mang studied architecture at the Technical University of Vienna under Friedrich Lehmann during and after the Second World War.
From 1952 he worked as a freelance architect, but he also worked as a teacher, writer and head of the institute.
From 1972 to 1983 he was president of the Austrian Institute of Design.
In the 1980s he was commissioned to set up the Treasury in the Vienna Hofburg and to rebuild the Palais Lobkowitz into the Austrian Theatermuseum.
Punishment: Tim Wiese throws money at policewoman
Ex-footballer Tim Wiese has been badly noticed in Bremen.
Footballer was once, now is Tim Wiese, former national goalkeeper in Germany and engaged at Bremen and Hoffenheim, wrestler.
According to his own statement, he wants to have gained 30 kilograms of muscle mass in the past two years.
Intellectually, he did not agree.
Wiese had his hair cut in the city centre of Bremen when he saw a parking guard out there displaying a penalty card for his white Chevrolet Camaro.
Wiese then rushed out of the store, insulted the official and threw the due fine at her feet, as the "Bild"-Zeitung reports.
The city of Bremen confirms the allegations, but is not yet clear about the consequences for the unusual incident.
"The matter is still under review," the city of Bremen said.
It is only after that that it will be decided whether or not to show meadow.
Panamanian authorities destroy 4,500 marijuana plants
The fertile soil and the typical rainforest climate of Isla del Rey are ideal for the flowering of marijuana plants.
For the past three days, the Panamanian authorities have been tearing out the 4,500 plants and burning them.
Men beat up 17-year-old Afghans
Police are looking for witnesses for an incident in Bad Soden-Salmünster: On Friday evening, around 11:45 p.m., three young men were walking from Bad Soden towards Salmünster.
One of the group, a 17-year-old Afghan, reportedly followed his two friends at a distance of about five meters and told them to wait for him.
At that time, the group was at the level of the bft gas station.
Three people also stayed on the site of the gas station.
One of the men shouted at the young man and punched him in the face.
The victim suffered a fractured nose and bleed heavily from the nose.
When his two friends rushed in and calmly spoke to the bat, he first abandoned his victim.
The injured young man has now been brought home by his friends.
The perpetrator followed the group with a car to their apartment and passed there demonstratively several times.
When the vehicle was no longer seen, the injured person walked outside the building to smoke a cigarette.
There he was attacked again by the bat and another male person.
With the help of a percussion stick, the victim’s face and thighs were beaten.
The injured had to be taken to a hospital for medical care.
So far, there is only one vague description of the perpetrator.
One of the men was about 1.80 meters tall.
The second racket was said to be about 1.65 meters tall and was dressed in a jeans and a brown-white shirt.
The police are asking witnesses and whistleblowers to report on the phone number 06181/100-123.
Dr. Frank Müller takes over Felstehausen practice and invests 310000 euros
Silvia Müller-Gongoll and Frank Müller (from left) take over the practice of Karl-Heinrich and Ursel Felstehausen.
Samtgemeindebürgermeister Bernd Bormann, economic promoter Uta Seim-Schwartz and Asendorf mayor Heinfried Kabbert are also delighted.
In many places in the country, doctors are lacking - Asendorf, on the other hand, is lucky: Dr. Frank Müller will take over the practice in Felstehausen on October 1.
While Ursel Felstehausen is retiring, her husband Karl-Heinrich is still halfway behind his successor in the coming months.
After a renovation phase, Müller will reopen the practice on October 12th, until then he will invest 310,000 euros in the premises at St.-Marcellusstraße 6.
It was sympathy at first sight when Felstehausen met Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller-Gongoll years ago, who is currently completing her specialist training at Verden Hospital and also wants to enter into practice next year.
"We always had in mind that the Müllers would fit well into this practice," says Dr. Ursel Felstehausen and laughs.
"When it was over, I just called her."
The couple Müller liked the idea of running their own practice in Asendorf in the future.
"The proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us," says the 39-year-old Müller.
"We want to meet and accompany the families over the years".
He also sees an advantage in being his own boss soon.
And so it was agreed, the Müllers bought the house with the practice.
However, they will continue to live in Bruchhausen-Vilsen.
There, the two-time family father Frank Müller also grew up, and his medical studies in Hanover were followed by clinics in several medical practices as well as in the hospitals in Sulingen, Nienburg and Rotenburg.
He is currently working as an obstetrician in Sulingen, he was also appointed chief emergency physician in the district of Diepholz in 2009 and is a volunteer in the DRK-preparation Bruchhausen-Vilsen.
From September 19, the practice will be prepared for the new boss.
While the surgeon Dr. Karl-Heinrich Felstehausen works as a house doctor, his wife Ursel (internist) specializes in gastroenterology.
The Müllers, both internists, want to settle down as home doctors.
“The endoscopy is coming out,” says 38-year-old Silvia Müller-Gongoll.
After the renovation, the rooms will look more modern.
We will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long-term and stress ECGs and need a chat room more.
In addition, the computer will be completely renewed.
A grant of a total of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>50000 will be awarded to the Müllers as part of a funding program from the county (25000 euros) as well as from the Samtgemeinde (12500 euros) and the municipality (12500 euros).
"This shows how proud and happy we are that the practice will continue," says mayor Bernd Bormann.
According to Silvia Müller-Gongoll, about 2,000 patients come to the Felstehausen practice every quarter, in the average practice in northern Germany there are about 500.
In Asendorf there is another home doctor's practice.
A positive side effect of Frank Müller’s takeover: The pharmacy remains, according to Ursel Felstehausen in Asendorf.
If no successor had been found, she would have gone.
By the way, those who attend Müller’s talks continue to look in familiar faces: they take over the seven medical specialists and the cleaning power of the Rock Houses.
With their departure, an era ends in Asendorf, after all, the doctors have been practicing there for 30 years.
"In the beginning we had only two rooms," Ursel Felstehausen recalls.
After a long time, she feels a bit of sadness.
"But we continue to live in Hohenmoor and will surely see many patients more often," says the internist.
Her husband laughingly adds, “We have a 6000-square-meter land plot.”
"I've always pushed myself before gardening, now it could be different."
The couple also have two grandchildren and love to travel.
Croatia: "We are letting the refugees through"
"Now border controls will also be increased at our southern border," Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner said.
The controls at the Hungarian border remain in place.
It is still clear that anyone who wants to submit an asylum application can also do so "of course".
The care and safety of people is at the forefront.
But it is also clear that “clear signals are needed,” the minister said.
People need to know that we do not accept borderless migration flows, not even across the Austrian-Slovene border.
It requires a controlled approach.
Croatia considers "corridor" - Slovenia refuses
The Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia would also allow incoming refugees to continue travelling towards Austria and Germany, and may also build corridors for the refugees.
However, Minister of the Interior Vesna Györkös Znidar did not see this in Laibach.
The idea of corridors is "absolutely unacceptable", but Slovenia will intensify border surveillance - especially to Hungary.
The border with Croatia, on the other hand, is already heavily controlled as the external border of the Schengen area.
As the Minister stressed, Slovenian does not want to abolish its borders for refugees.
"Every EU member must fulfil its obligations, otherwise the system cannot work," said Györkös Znidar.
According to the Croatian government, the first refugees attempted to cross the Tovarnik/Sid border crossing into eastern Croatia in the early hours of Tuesday night to evade registration.
The Croatian police were able to pick them up in the nearby corn fields.
Since then, according to local media, police vehicles with new refugees have been constantly arriving in the Croatian town of Tovarnik.
They are mainly Syrians and Afghans, including numerous women and children.
Rescue services and the Red Cross are already in operation.
In the coming days, his country expects around 4,000 refugees, Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic said.
In addition, buses from Presevo on the Macedonian-Serbian border, which had previously brought migrants to the Hungarian border, would be rerouted to Croatia, Croatian and Serbian media reported on Wednesday.
The government in Belgrade, however, denied that it was its job to instruct people to take certain routes: “We can’t, we don’t want to do this,” it said.
According to media reports, at least a first bus with about 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of Sid in the early hours of the day, and more buses would be expected during the day.
About Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany
The occupants had been traveling through Serbia all night from the Macedonian border, some 500 kilometers away.
"We heard that Hungary closed, so the police told us to drive here," one of the refugees said.
They wanted to continue to travel through Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany.
This could actually result in the displacement of the previous Balkan route Turkey-Greece-Macedonia-Serbia-Hungary, which was already predicted by observers, to a route slightly further to the west.
Croatia: "Extensive possibilities for border control"
Croatia’s Interior Minister Ostojic had previously stressed that his country had prepared appropriate plans for possible emergency situations in the event of a strong influx of refugees.
He did not give details, but pointed out that Croatia, as a non-Schengen member, has "extensive possibilities for border control".
Strict controls are carried out to qualify for membership in the Schengen area.
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007, and the EU partners have been giving the country a good witness ever since in terms of the standard of border controls.
On the Serbian side, some 300 refugees are still trapped behind the Hungarian border fence.
According to Belgrade media reports, they spent the night at the border crossing of Horgos, which leads to Röszke.
According to the Hungarian authorities, the two border crossings Horgos and Backi Breg remain completely closed.
Whether the remaining refugees want to continue to travel to the Croatian border is still unclear.
Serbian Interior Minister Nebojsa Stefanovic tried to calm down early Wednesday at a local eye-catcher in Horgos: he considers the debates about alternative routes of refugees, after the Hungarian border is now closed, premature.
There would not be very high numbers of refugees at the moment.
It is not yet possible to say whether they would continue their journey via Hungary, Croatia or another country.
Helpers advise migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
However, private Hungarian refugee aid workers have already started distributing maps to the refugees, on which alternative routes through Croatia are plotted.
However, the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not unsafe: in parts of the border area, even 20 years after the end of the Croatian war, there are still unclear minefields.
On Wednesday afternoon, Croatian police announced that a team of mine clearers had been sent to the border region.
Stock market hackers: Ukrainians pay $30 million
Supranonok is said to have belonged to a ring of cybercriminals who have been accused of gaining access to unpublished financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire, Marketwired and PR Newswire since 2010.
With the information gathered, insiders are said to have done business in the financial markets.
According to investigators, more than $100 million was thus recovered.
"Today's comparison shows that even those outside our country's borders will eventually be caught," the SEC said in a statement.
The trials of 32 other accused in the case continued.
Most of the defendants are from Ukraine and Georgia.
The perpetrators are said to have acted in both the United States and Eastern Europe.
Ecumenical Hospice Assistance Mannheim has been in existence for 20 years
Around the Mannheim Paradeplatz there is a lot of activity.
People do their chores, partly quick steps, partly pleasantly bumbling.
They control the two stations of the Mannheim Motor Show at the paradeplatz.
Stop the city trains.
Pulsing, splendid life in the glorious autumn sunshine and in the middle of four large boards each with the headline "Before I die I want to"....
With this action, the Ecumenical Hospice Assistance draws attention to its 20-year existence and is confronted with mixed reactions.
"It's about life, so we went with the action in the middle of the city and among the people," says Josefine Lammer.
The Head of the Ecumenical Hospice Assistance is available to the passers-by for questions and conversations as well as the volunteers.
While some passers-by spontaneously take to the chalk and supplement the phrase “accept my life”, “can read”, “drive with the camper through the United States”, “stop the war” or “do not suffer for a long time”, others stay brief, read, say sentences such as “so far as I am not yet” and then move on.
Again and again, there are small discussions on the edge about the action itself, about life, about how to deal with dying.
Peter Hübinger is also on site.
“Only when I realize that the end of this world is coming for me will I be able to live responsibly,” says the Director of the Mannheim Diaconal Work, who together with the Caritas Association is the bearer of the Ecumenical Hospice Aid.
Therefore, this public action for the 20-year-old is good.
That not everyone wants to communicate publicly on the boards, however, is understandable, after all, it is a very personal matter.
The subject of death and death is still taboo, according to the experience of Josefine Lammer, although the hospice movement in recent years has contributed a lot to the opening up of people.
An assessment shared by Angelika Godefroid.
The death and mourning companion is one of the first-hour volunteers.
Faced with the subject through personal experience, she read a lot of literature and decided to engage in obstetric care.
When the Ecumenical Hospice Service sought volunteers by invitation, it immediately applied and was present at its founding in 1995.
Godefroid is part of a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - who accompany the affected and relatives in private households, hospitals, nursing homes and the St. Vincent’s Hospital.
They are all carefully trained.
Angelika Godefroid can cope well with her task and the experiences and experiences she has made.
“I see life from another perspective, consider it precious, and appreciate the moment,” she says.
The offer of the outpatient Ecumenical Hospice Service is free of charge and independent of confession.
The financial support of health insurance and donations from relatives and associations enables the training as well as further training and supervision of death and mourning companions.
Training for new employees is offered every two years.
The tables described on Saturday are now on display in the house of the Evangelical Church (M1, 1a) and in the house of the Catholic Church (F2, 6).
Further personal requests can also be recorded on postcards.
FedEx earnings mixed, financial outlook lowered for 2016
FedEx reports disappointing results for the last quarter, and the delivery giant lowered its profit outlook to an entire year due to weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its ground transportation service.
The company also said it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
At that time last year, FedEx announced that the company wanted to hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season.
The stock fell over 2.5 percent in premarket trading 45 minutes before opening on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said to make a profit between $10.40 and $10.90 in the fiscal year ending next May, 20 cents less than the previous forecast.
Analysts expected $10.84, according to a survey by FactSet.
The lower outlook comes despite the price increases, which average 4.9 percent and come into effect on January 4, and despite higher surcharges for ground transportation of heavy and large packages, which will be collected from November.
The company said it still expects earnings to increase compared to the previous year due to lower costs, higher revenues and growth in online commerce.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company “gets solid revenues when you consider the weaker than expected economic conditions, especially in manufacturing and global trade.”
The plans for the holiday employment were announced a day later than those of rival UPS, which plans to hire 90,000 to 95,000 additional workers, about the same number as last year.
In the quarter ending August 31, FedEx earned $692 million, 6% more than in the previous year.
Earnings per share amounted to $2.42 per share, just behind the $2.44 per share predicted by twelve analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research.
Revenue rose 5 percent to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts surveyed by Zack expected $12.23 billion.
FedEx has seen a decline in international priority shipments in recent years, which has led to a stagnation of sales in its Express shipment unit.
But the boom in online shopping has boosted the results at FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, turnover in ground transportation increased by 29 percent, but the operating result was basically flat due to higher costs for larger packages and self-insurance.
The Express unit recorded higher revenues due to higher prices, while earnings fell due to higher labor costs in the freight business.
In premarket trading, about an hour before opening, FedEx stocks fell by $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150.15.
On Tuesday, they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent at a record high on June 11.
At their most anticipated meeting of the year, Federal Reserve strategists spend two days this week sitting around a 27-foot Honduras-Mahagoni table to decide if it’s time to raise the lead rate for the first time in nearly a decade.
Threateningly above them at one end of the decorated, two-story meeting room is a mural of the United States.
The card is a reminder that Fed Chairman Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues should put the nation’s economic interests above all other things.
The central bank has a double mandate from Congress: maximizing U.S. employment and keeping prices stable here.
But since the Great Recession, Fed leaders have acknowledged that there is an unwritten third mandate: financial stability.
And this third term could be the X-Factor in a decision that is too narrow to predict it. It will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to start off from the unprecedented stimulus by the near-zero short-term interest rate since the end of 2008.
Although most of the economy’s data shows it’s growing solidly, recent turbulence in global financial markets could scare already cautious Fed officials into aggravating this volatility by raising the interest rate on federal bonds — even if it’s only a quarter of a percentage point.
“Obviously, the labor market and inflation will be the most important thing they’re seeing,” said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
“But I think if they were looking for an excuse not to raise the interest rate, the increased uncertainty around the global market is justification enough to continue to wait,” she said.
There is no consensus on what the Fed will do, which in itself insures the financial market.
About half of economists surveyed by Bloomberg recently predicted an interest rate hike this week.
However, financial markets expect a wait on the Fed, with a key indicator indicating only a 30% chance of an increase.
This indicates a decline in the stock market if the Fed raises the rate, unless the strategists mitigate the blow by promising that another rise is far away.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial average jumped by 228.89 points or 1.4% to 16,599.85.
The move was triggered by expectations that Fed policy will maintain the rate this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody’s Capital Markets Research Group.
It would be a surprise if the Fed would raise rates at this point,” he said.
If she does, "should she go very far in her statement to calm the financial markets so that they don't panic."
Other experts argued that an interest rate hike would calm the financial markets because it would eliminate the uncertainty about when the Fed would trade.
A month ago, the Fed seemed well on its way to raising the rate by 0.25 percentage points this month, the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of the recovery in the United States.
Yellen had said in the spring and early summer that despite complaints from liberals that more economic progress would be needed, she expected an increase in the rate this year.
Although job creation slowed in August, the improvement in the labour market was solid this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest in more than seven years and close to what the Fed sees as full employment.
Increases in wages have shown signs of recovery.
And while inflation was consistently below the central bank’s annual target of 2%, Fed officials said the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.
The economy “can cope with higher interest rates and needs them because of the stresses in the labor market,” said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But financial markets around the world tightened at the end of last month after China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial average fell more than 16 percent below its peak in May when investors feared a slowdown in China’s economy would stifle global growth.
The market has recovered slightly this month, with the Dow now nearly 10% below its May high.
For the Fed representatives, market turbulence affects the complex calculation of when to raise interest rates.
“If the events in the financial markets and the news of the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred in the last few weeks, they would have taken the reins in this session,” said Stephen D. Oliner, a senior research fellow at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the U.S. Central Bank.
Now he predicts that she will wait at least a month to better manage the effects.
"There's a lot of uncertainty about what the impact will be on the U.S. economy, and there's almost no reliable data describing developments in China," Oliner said.
The health of the world economy is not one of the main concerns of the Fed, so it should not be technically involved in its decision-making.
But in the end, the Fed has become the world’s monetary authority.
The central bank’s influence has been enormous in recent years.
The mere remark by then-leader Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed could “shrink” its monetary expansion sparked confusion around the globe.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, Fed officials can be expected to not only monitor developments elsewhere, but also consult with other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy.
Their decision making is “more art than science,” said Zachary Karabell, head of global asset management strategy at Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, VA, noted this month that “the Fed has a history of overreactions to financial market movements that are apparently unrelated to the economic fundamentals.”
Lacker, a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, which advocates an interest rate hike, cited decisions in 1998/1999 as an example.
A financial crisis in Asia prompted the Fed to lower its lead interest rate by 0.75% in three sessions “despite limited recognizable impacts on U.S. growth,” Lacker said.
A year later, Fed officials reversed these cuts.
The Fed should only put aspects of financial stability first during a severe crisis such as the 2008 market crash, said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England’s interest rate committee.
The recent turmoil does not come close to this level, he said.
“She certainly doesn’t want to get into a situation where she’s afraid of an interest rate hike because markets are getting upset,” said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until that is changed, I don’t think it should be ahead of time.
Do you need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown
The market/store was opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
LAX-C is often referred to as Thai Costco and is a Thai wholesale market that also sells to the general public.
Yes, it is located in Chinatown and not in Thai Town.
The market / warehouse is a central point of contact and offers a confusing number of fresh, frozen and dried goods, popular Thai and Asian snacks, and dishes, furniture, religious jewelry and Christmas decorations.
There is even an auto department if you need engine oil.
The store is huge, and it takes over an hour to stroll through the corridors.
If the entire grocery store makes you hungry, there is a meal for you at the LAX-C BBQ Express.
The kitchen (good and inexpensive) in this store is located near the box offices and has various take-away options.
What is there here: Do you need something - something - Thai?
LAX-C probably has it.
Products are inexpensive and a number of them are sold in large quantities.
Fresh products include Asian specialties and regional Thai herbs, fruit and much more.
The meat counter is extensive, as is the fish counter - the staff behind the counter will clean and file the fish and even fry for you on request.
A good part of the store belongs to the massive freezer department, where you will find frozen curry leaves, bitter melons and galgant, whole ducks, fish, beef blood and bile, pig's natural gut, fish balls, regional sausage, commercially prepared foods and more.
Who buys here: restaurant owners and chefs, also single families and individuals.
The wide aisles are suitable for shopping carts and forklifts.
You will find here: fresh Monthong Durian next to the checkout.
Where it is located: The store is located in an industrial area of Los Angeles on the outskirts of Chinatown and downtown - a few blocks away from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own parking lot, along with other shops and restaurants.
Even if the store is well visited, it is not difficult to find a parking lot.
Hoyerswerda: Small life support for refugees
More and more refugees are arriving in Germany these days.
A warm welcome to them is not possible without the commitment of countless volunteers.
There are also a number of people in Hoyerswerda who are selflessly supporting asylum seekers in the city.
These include Petra and Klaus Heine.
Petra Heine is a teacher with body and soul.
She also likes to teach with her 74 lenses.
Every Thursday, she does it at the asylum seeker’s home on Dillinger Straße.
There, she helps refugees from Syria, Kurdistan, Kosovo and Pakistan learn the German language.
Of course, the teaching is quite different than in a proper school.
Brazilian Paediatric Society Rio Grande Promotes Diet for Healthy Breastfeeding
The Brazilian pediatric organization SPRS is trying to shockingly educate women about the importance of good nutrition during breastfeeding by presenting pictures of babies sucking on breasts painted with depictions of unhealthy foods.
Breast milk consists of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system.
Due to the additional energy requirements, pregnant women and young mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories per day.
However, new research suggests that a higher calorie intake is not the only dietary adjustment that mothers should make.
A recent study led by Robert Waterland, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects their babies’ genes and protects them from developing tumors.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet of the child can negatively affect the immune system.
Exception for the new Bernrieder Sporthalle
The Bernried Municipal Council approved the construction of the 2.3 million euro sports hall.
And he made an exception.
The roof may become flatter for solar system.
The plans for the long-awaited gymnasium construction at the Bernried sports ground are progressing step by step: In the recent council meeting, the draft construction proposal was unanimously approved without much discussion.
Previously, the panel had also decided, among other things, on an application for a building "exemption" or "exemption" from the current construction plan.
The "exception" was about the permission for a special shape with regard to the roof construction.
Accordingly, a "seat roof with non-central first and roof overhang" is to be erected.
The background of the planning is the planned use of the roof area for solar systems: "This will give us a wonderfully large south roof together," Mayor Josef Steigenberger explained at the meeting.
The "liberation" was in turn about the roof slope, which is supposed to be below ten degrees for energetic reasons - contrary to what is prescribed in the construction plan.
The volume of the hall is thus significantly reduced.
A "exemption" was therefore necessary, because the construction plan does not allow "exceptions" regarding the inclination of the roof - with the Bernried Municipal Council usually acting more restrictively in the case of exemption applications.
However, the construction of gymnasiums is not a recurring project: "We do not create a precedent with this," says Steigenberger.
The gym building at the Sportzentrum is a joint project of the municipality and SV Bernried.
The cost is estimated at around 2.3 million euros.
Grants are expected from the school and broad sports promotion.
In the next procedural step, the construction application for the 18 x 36 meter hall will now be submitted to the Landratsamt for examination.
Pissenberg Clinic moves to Schongau
The Pissenberg hospital is expected to close earlier than planned – in 2016.
At the same time, Dr. Wilhelm Fischer (66) becomes the new Medical Director at the Schongau Hospital.
The station and the majority of staff move from Peißenberg to Schongau.
This is according to the surprising plans of the county’s Hospital GmbH, confirmed by Landrat Andrea Jochner-Weiß.
The Supervisory Board, however, will take a decision on this, and will meet on Wednesday, September 23.
If the plans were to be implemented, all of the nearly 50 staff at the hospital in Peißenberg would continue to be employed.
The vast majority will move with fishermen and the further existing inner station to Schongau.
The rooms are available.
Employees who cannot go to Schongau will be offered a job in Weilheim, according to Jochner-Weiß.
Employees are informed about the plans.
The change was triggered by the resignation of Dr. Andreas Eder, who has only been Medical Director of the Schongauer Clinic since the beginning of the year and is now moving to a private practice in the immediate vicinity of the hospital.
When asked who would take over the succession, according to Jochner-Weiß, the name "Fischer" came into play, who declared himself ready to take over the leadership from October 1st and to switch with his team to Schongau.
For the house in Schongau, this means in any case an "upgrade" and an expansion of the offer in the field of "inner medicine", according to Jochner-Weiß.
Fischer is a specialist in pacemakers and defibrillators.
Schongau (180 beds) specializes in gastroenterological diseases at the inner station.
For the next two years, Fischer and his team, if the Supervisory Board agrees, will run both houses until next year, when the former hospital of the scarcity, which still has 35 beds, will be permanently closed in Peißenberg after almost 140 years.
So far, the county had planned this for 2018, when the current renovation at the Weilheim Hospital is completed.
Landrätin Jochner-Weiß, who is also chairman of the Supervisory Board, opposed rumours that the house, which is owned by the federal government, will be used in the future as a shelter for asylum seekers.
"I exclude that." As with the property, Jochner-Weiß could not say that there are several considerations.
Currently, there is a short-term care of the Caritas and a day psychiatry.
"What better could not have happened to us, such an opportunity will not come again," says Fischer about the quasi-move to the lake, which was "positive and very understanding" by the employees.
A real perspective for the house, where fishermen have been working as chief physicians for over 30 years, has not existed.
He was asked by Schongauer colleagues to take over the post of Medical Director.
The Pissenberg Hospital (once 100 beds) has been repeatedly threatened with closure in recent decades, departments have been closed, for example, surgery and obstetrics.
The handball players of the Rhine-Neckar Lions are challenged at Bergischen HC this evening (20.15 am).
The leader of the Bundesliga is the clear favourite in Wuppertal, but there is no reason for arrogance.
Last season, the Badens suffered a painful defeat at the BHC and have something to make up for.
Hunting accident with two injured at Pratau
Two tractor drivers were seriously injured by gunshot wounds during their corn harvest on Tuesday afternoon.
During the harvest on a cornfield near Pratau (Wittenberg County), several hunters were on duty, police said.
A 63-year-old and a 22-year-old man sustained serious injuries and was taken to hospital after being shot.
How exactly the accident happened was unclear at first.
The criminal police are investigating.
16-year-old from Rhineland-Palatinate missing victim of violence
A suspect led the police to the body of the missing 16-year-old from Rhineland-Palatinate since Saturday.
In the interrogation, the 20-year-old admitted to killing the teenagers and throwing their body into a canal in Rockenhausen.
A 16-year-old man from Rhineland-Palatinate who has been missing since Saturday has been the victim of a violent crime.
The young woman's body was found Tuesday evening in Rockenhausen near Kaiserslautern, prosecutors and police said on Wednesday.
A 20-year-old also arrested on Tuesday evening is considered a suspect, who confessed to the crime and led the investigators to the whereabouts of the body.
The 16-year-old was reported missing on Sunday morning after failing to return home the night before after a visit to an autumn festival in Rockenhausen.
In the search for the young woman, the investigators first came across the victim’s personal belongings.
During interrogations in the circle of friends and acquaintances of the missing, there was finally a suspicion of an act against the 20-year-old.
The suspect then led the police to a canal in Rockenhausen, where the body was found.
According to the authorities, the detainee admitted in the police interrogation that he killed the 16-year-old and put the body in the canal.
The 20-year-old was due to be presented to the judge on Wednesday, with investigators charging him with murder.
Disclosure of the specific circumstances of the crime will be provided by further investigations.
Refugees need housing: study warns of housing gap
The situation on the German housing market is tense.
More and more people are looking for affordable housing.
The pressure on the housing market is growing.
Social housing is facing a challenge.
Distribution struggles in the German housing market have long begun.
With the arrival of refugees and job seekers from the EU, more and more people are pushing into a market already overloaded in many large cities.
They compete with low-income citizens for the last affordable housing.
In order to meet the demand for affordable housing, 400,000 new units would have to be built each year by 2020.
To this result comes a study commissioned by the association "Social Housing".
By comparison, 260,000 units will be completed in Germany this year.
140,000 homes are missing.
After the first three months of their stay, refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seekers in a first-reception accommodation.
Many then head to the housing market and line up in the long queues in front of the rental apartments.
However, according to the Federal Statistical Office, less than half of all asylum seekers lived for rent in the last year.
However, the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the increasing numbers of refugees.
The study also highlights significant shortcomings in housing policy in recent years.
Germany is facing a housing deficit that is growing year after year.
At present, there were already around 770,000 housing units missing in the agglomerations, complains Matthias Günther, author of the study.
Therefore, many professionals lived in large cities in need of WG-rooms.
Young adults involuntarily stayed longer at the "Hotel Mama" because of the flute on the housing market.
In large cities, the number of square meters per capita has declined for the first time in recent years.
To solve the problem, the Alliance "Social Housing" proposes a restart.
New incentives will boost social housing construction once again.
Thus, the property tax could be waived and the property tax for subsidized housing could be temporarily suspended.
In addition, according to the Alliance, attractive tax depreciation options are needed.
The State Bank KfW’s support programme for refugee accommodation is already well received by cities and municipalities.
A good week after the launch, more than half of the around 300 million euros available had already been retrieved on Monday evening with 184 million euros.
Now the project could even be scaled up.
Refugees have free passage: Croatia and Slovenia set up corridor
After Hungary, there is virtually no way through, as more and more refugees choose the path through Croatia.
Zagreb announces to grant transit through Slovenia to the north without obstacles.
The route is dangerous, however.
Croatia wants to reach an agreement with neighbouring Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees.
"I have spoken to the Slovenian Interior Minister, and if necessary, we will organize a corridor," Croatian Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic said.
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen area.
The EU-Croatia country is not yet a Schengen country.
After the demarcation of the Serbian-Hungarian border, hundreds of refugees have left for Croatia to reach Western Europe.
500 people crossed the border at Tovarnik, reports the Croatian television station RTL.
Hungary had locked up its border for refugees the day before.
New laws, which came into force on the same day, also make ordinary asylum procedures in Hungary virtually superfluous.
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass.
Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic said: "You can pass through, and we are preparing for this opportunity."
These people are there, it’s women, children and men who want to live and achieve something.
However, they are people who did not want to live in Croatia.
The Croatian police picked up the first refugees at Serbia’s border with neighbouring Croatia in the morning.
According to media reports, most of them came from Syria, Iran and Afghanistan.
They came both by bus and taxi to the Serbian border town of Sid.
Immediately after their arrival, they would have tried to cross the green border to Croatia on foot.
At the Croatian-Serbian border, refugees do not come across border fences.
The border strip poses other dangers: there are still sharp mines from the Yugoslav Civil War in the 1990s.
Mine clearers are now supposed to quickly create a safe passage.
However, after the closure of the border, hardly any more refugees come to Hungary.
On Tuesday, police arrested 366 people.
Just before the gate was closed on Monday, there were 9380.
The new Hungarian laws classify overcoming and damaging the border fence as a crime.
In the southern border town of Szeged, 35 criminal proceedings were initiated.
The convicted person faces up to five years in prison and expulsion from the country.
According to the immigration authority, a total of 94 asylum applications were received on Tuesday in the newly established "transit zones" at the border, of which almost all - 93 - were in the most important transition Röszke.
Among the applicants are 13 families with young children and two elderly people.
By Wednesday morning, there were 40 more refugees in the area.
However, practically no one has the prospect of being granted asylum in Hungary anymore.
According to Hungary, Serbia is a "safe third country".
Rejected asylum seekers are to be deported there.
Only a few hundred refugees gathered before the "transit zone" in Röszke.
In Röszke, workers began to clean it up.
They collected the garbage that tens of thousands of people had left on the side of the road in recent weeks.
Barrier grids were dismantled and one of the reception camps in the border town was rebuilt.
No one wanted to comment on the purpose of this conversion.
After the closure of the Serbia-Hungary border, only a few refugees are still arriving.
The country has also stepped up its border controls.
About 20,000 migrants were still in the country, according to the government.
In Salzburg, about 1,400 people are waiting for their journey to Germany.
The train from there to Germany was stopped on the morning following instructions from the German authorities.
In Freilassing, smaller groups of refugees regularly arrived on foot.
Mayor drives 'stranded' across border
"We were busy cleaning up after the bridge festival on Sunday when suddenly ten people with suitcases stood at the entrance of the tent," Wernstein's mayor Alois Stadler said.
Tourists, they wanted to take the train to Passau.
But because Germany had unexpectedly stopped rail traffic with Austria on Sunday because of the refugee flow, it was over for them in Wernstein,” said Stadler, who immediately offered his help and drove the stranded along with two other helpers and their cars across the border to the near Passau.
Before that, we tasted the unexpected guests, with jause and drinks.
We just said we'll take her to Passau by car.
"That was a matter of course for us," Stadler said in the O<0xC3><0x96>N conversation.
You were very grateful.
A man did not take the time to hand over a generous donation - 100 euros for the fire department.
"We were very pleased," Stadler said.
The stranded train passengers had switched from an ICE to a regional train towards Passau on Sunday evening in Wels to try to cross the border after the short-term announcement that train traffic to Germany had been stopped.
However, the regional train was stopped before the border in Wernstein am Inn.
In Wernstein, cross-border spending is generally high.
The bridge festival connected with the Bavarian neighbors on Sunday, a day before a two-bridge race sporting - organized by the Wernstein Union and Bavaria from Neukirchen.
The fact that Viktor Orbán is now sending thousands more to us is a logical result of a hypocritical policy:
Instead of immediately assisting in the construction of structures that ensure humanity in the Röszke camp, our Federal Chancellor has officially and publicly pushed the Hungarian government’s stance into the black circle of National Socialism.
The sufferers of this policy are not only those Austrians who are now confronted with chaotic conditions in the border areas.
The refugees will also have to realize that the “promised land” that invited and welcomed them is nothing more than another refugee camp.
Given the ongoing flows of refugees and the approaching winter, it will be a great challenge to create decent conditions for asylum seekers.
And there will be an even greater one – to maintain peace, security and stability in Austria.
Konrad in search of 35,000 winterproof quarters
Konrad has everything to do with refugee accommodation.
Christian Konrad is accustomed to the fact that his word has weight.
The government has deployed the former powerful Raiffeisen banker to set up neighborhoods for the thousands of refugees.
The chaos in the first reception center Traiskirchen has already got Konrad under control.
"We no longer have homeless people in Traiskirchen," he said of his first success.
The accommodation of the 20,000 refugees who arrived in Austria on Monday also took place without much turmoil, Konrad said, praising the organization's "master achievement".
The Interior Ministry, on the other hand, spoke of a "crisis situation".
In total, Konrad expects a demand of 85,000 quarters this year.
To meet this figure, 35,000 more accommodations will have to be found in the coming weeks - 20,000 are to be provided by the countries, 15,000 by the federal government.
If there are more refugees, we can do it.
"But it's not a barrel without ground," Konrad said.
He has already held talks with the country’s chiefs.
These would have assured him that he would also create neighborhoods for the coming refugees.
"In Upper Austria it's going well," said Ferry Maier.
The former VP-mandatar supports Konrad.
Tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schönborn to discuss how the Church will help.
The Asylum Coordinator also sets high expectations in the ORF action "Help like us".
On the platform, individuals can easily offer accommodation.
There are also hotels that are empty in the winter.
Konrad and Maier yesterday criticized the standards for accommodation as "very high".
In times of emergency, it may not be that neighborhood givers have to comply with a certain height of the towel holders or the size of the headlights.
For a limited period of time, "emergency standards" should apply.
Konrad argues with his experience that he is more successful in accommodation than the Ministry of the Interior.
I am an elderly gentleman, to whom the untruth is not easily told in the face.
Persuasion is his most important weapon.
Conrad and Maier did not incur any cost to the republic, as they themselves explained.
They want to increase the number of employees to three or four.
My own neighborhood search has not yet been successful.
Konrad wanted to set up a container on Stephansplatz as an office.
However, there are apparently problems with the approval.
Linz calls for better distribution
For the time being, the city of Linz plans not to open urban sports halls and other buildings such as Tips-Arena and Design Center to accommodate refugees.
This is not necessary at the moment, as it is currently possible to accommodate the affected persons without these measures, says Mayor Klaus Luger (SP).
However, additional locations should be checked for suitability in the event of an emergency.
The mayor criticizes the division of refugees within the federal state.
Other districts must also contribute to this.
Seehofer: "borders are not locked"
In a lengthy phone call with the Bavarian Prime Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU), the head of state Josef Pühringer (VP) on Monday agreed on the next step in the refugee issue.
Seehofer assured me that the German borders will not be locked.
The continuation of the journey of refugees to the Federal Republic is still possible.
However, there are now the corresponding border controls.
There will be no more special trains with refugees to Germany for the time being.
However, the asylum seekers would be brought to Germany by regular trains.
Pühringer once again called for increased solidarity in the refugee issue from other EU member states.
The fact that Austria is now reintroducing controls on its borders is “a logical consequence” for Pühringer of the Germans’ actions.
The next runtastic is a matter of time
The general renovation of the "New Shipyard" in the Linz industrial line is officially completed.
In four of the six floors of the office and production building, the listed IT group S&T has moved in, the rest (2700 square meters) is to be leased to young, innovative companies from the technology sector.
"In IT, smart minds are our raw material - and we have to try to make them work for us," says S&T chief Hannes Niederhauser.
He could imagine investing in startup companies of the New Shipyard and later also acquiring some.
From the very beginning, S&T wants to cooperate with the new neighbors - of which Niederhauser promises a lot: "The next runtastic is only a matter of time".
1.7 million euros were invested by S&T in the site, 3.3 million euros by the Techcenter, which belongs to one-third of the city of Linz, the state of Upper Austria and the federal government (FFG).
The building has been leased by Linz AG for 60 years to S&T and Techcenter.
30 percent of the 2,700 square meters of remaining space in the building have already been leased, for another 40 percent there are requests.
Lia Peroni owner opened a second store in the arcade
In the new shop Furla handbags are the focus.
In fact, Jutta Breit wanted to get a dog.
The 49-year-old owner of Lia Peroni had to postpone this project shortly in the pigeon market arcade: after all, she has now grown in the form of another business premises.
In the Furla shop opposite the store, where she sells, among other things, bags, suitcases, shoes and clothing from different manufacturers, everything now revolves around women's handbags of the Furla brand, purses are to have from 75 euros.
Larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros.
The new shop has been in operation since yesterday.
It was rebuilt several weeks ago.
"I've been thinking for a long time if I should open another store," says Breit.
Among other things, the decision was that the Furla producers who are home in Bologna were also inspired by the idea of a site of their own, where only their handbags are sold.
“We are the only ones in the Linz area selling this brand,” says the mother of two daughters, who herself has Italian roots.
Her fashion interest has been broadly put into the cradle by her mother.
I do the most good when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices.
Why so many women are astonished at the sight of a beautiful handbag, even the specialist can not answer with the last certainty.
Maybe it’s because a nice bag enhances any outfit.
The Brulljesmacher from Kallstadt
The Palatine ancestors of Donald Trump came from a place whose inhabitants are called Angeber.
This quality also connects some with the billionaire who wants to become president of the United States.
Donald Trump (69) is always good for agitators.
Whether he speaks xenophobicly, criticizes journalists or reveals knowledge gaps in international crisis policy – the candidate for the US presidential office stirs up the election campaign vigorously.
And cut it well.
This is also recorded in the Palatinate city of Kall, where the grandparents of the real estate billionaire originate.
The New Yorker with the hair dryer is a term for many in the winegrower village on the Weinstraße.
Some in the 1200-inhabitant place is about -ten corners related to it.
His grandfather came from Kalllstadt in the Palatinate: Donald Trump, here in campaign mode.
Simone Wendel made a film about Trump.
And what do the villagers think about his goal of becoming the most powerful man in the world?
"I think they find this somewhat exciting, but they are not so deeply impressed in their Kallstadt style either," says Simone Wendel.
The native calliper has made a fun documentary about the place and its famous spr<0xC3><0xB8>sslings, which includes, besides Trump, the Ketchup family Heinz.
Trump, who is not known for modesty, also speaks out in “Kings of Call City” (2014) – so saying that he would certainly be successful even if he lived in Call City.
He did not bring it there to the King of Hearts.
While there is respect for the family's performance, there is also a tendency to believe that Trump is "already a bit of a big deal," says Wendel.
Coincidentally, the nickname that the town in the vicinity has was "The Brulljesmacher" - in High German: the Gebeber, she says.
So Trump comes from the village of Angeber.
Trump's success story began in 1885, when his later grandfather emigrated and opened a gold mining facility in the United States.
The foundation stone of the real estate group were the first purchases of land in New York.
But the life of the grandparents was not free from tragedy: their desire to return to their homeland in the long run failed in the Bavarian state, to which the Palatinate belonged at the time.
He did not include Trump because he had once left without permission, the director of the Institute of Palaean History and Folklore, Roland Paul, had declared the film's launch.
Trump is the grandson of an illegal immigrant.
This contrasts with the sometimes pronounced statements of the offspring.
He had repeatedly spoken disgustingly about Mexican immigrants to the United States and called for the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants.
“Just as he polters, that’s not as nice,” says Hans-Joachim Bender, a distant relative of Trump (“The grandmother was a born Trump, the grandfather was a born Heinz”).
The retired winemaker sees the American rather distanced, "he is always so uplifting".
Do you think Trump will come?
“I can’t imagine that,” says the 72-year-old.
"He never cared about Kallstadt".
Pensioner Veronika Schramm mentions, like some Kallstadters, that a descendant of the Heinz family donated something for the church organ during a visit, which was generally good.
“I can’t imagine that from Donald,” says the 68-year-old.
She thought it would be better if he didn’t win the election, because “he has such radical views, I don’t know if that’s good.”
If those who had the say in the United States at the time of his grandfather had been like him, “he would never have gotten there at all.”
"There are more interesting topics than him," says winemaker's daughter Sarah Bühler.
And as president?
"It's not my president," she says.
“The grapes will ripen even without President Trump.”
Wendel’s film, for which Trump has been interviewed for a long time, has been seen by 12,000 moviegoers, even in the U.S. interest is aroused.
The Upper Bavaria municipality of Ramsau near Berchtesgaden is Germany's first "mountain climber village".
From the hand of the Vice President of the German Alpine Association, Ludwig Wucherpfennig, the 1800-inhabitant village in the Berchtesgaden National Park received the award for gentle tourism on Wednesday.
There are already 20 "mountain climbing villages" in Austria.
In the neighbouring country, the Alpine Association is responsible for awarding the award.
A "mountain climbing village" may have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants.
At least one-fifth of its area must be designated as a protected area.
Seven's Sunrise dominates the ratings, despite Nine's attempts to take over the loss of leadership at the Today Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson rush to Canberra to report on the loss of the Liberal leadership, but it has not made any major shifts in the ratings for Today.
Nine’s breakfast show was broadcast by the federal capital when Malcolm Turnbull succeeded in overthrowing Tony Abbott.
Rival Sunrise, with moderators David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was featured in London as part of a one-week series of international television shows including Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This disadvantage of the distance seemed to play no role for Australian TV viewers, as Sunrise averaged 397,000 viewers in the five capitals, compared to Today 339,000.
Today achieved a slight increase compared to the ratings for Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but its number lagged behind that of last Thursday (343,000).
Today has closed the gap to Sunrise in recent months.
In August, Today averaged 318,000 compared to Sunrise’s 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, the distance was between 40,000 and 50,000.
So far in September, Sunrise has an average of 349,000 spectators to 314,000 at Today.
This is the most interesting thing that happens every morning.
The winds of change affect these morning people more than Parliament!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thank you for the review!

The big news for Seven was the impressive 800-word debut with the former serial star of Packed to the Rafters Erik Thomson.
The new drama about a recently widowed father, who decides to settle down with his two children on the coast of New Zealand, reached a very impressive number of 1,219 million spectators.
Critics had wondered if Thomson could have worn a hit show solo without the Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
Yesterday’s answer was a clear yes.
The X-Factor of Seven remained strong with 1,136 million viewers and easily beat The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000).
Seven had mixed results on evening two of The Chase Australia.
The first half-hour (17:00 to 17:30) of the new quiz show, moderated by Andrew O'Keefe, generated an average of 446,000 spectators.
The second half hour (17:30 to 18:00) jumped to 623,000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Eddie McGuire's hot-seat (613,000).
On Monday evening, the first half-hour of The Chase Australia reached 520,000 spectators and in the second half-hour, 720,000 spectators.
Hot-seat averages 620,000.
The decline in the odds of the second evening of The Chase Australia will give Nine a confident vote that Hot-Seat will finally prevail at 5:30 p.m.
The Chase Australia is a replacement for the million dollar minute that failed to surpass McGuire’s show.

The last three agree: Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man – but who will he choose?
Revealed secret? ...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have unknowingly revealed who wins The Bachelor.
The woman, with whom Sam Wood finally lands in The Bachelor, has been enveloped in utmost secrecy.
And none of the three remaining girls will certainly reveal whether she is the one who received the last rose.
But when we checked in with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski, and Lana Jeavons-Fellows the day before they became three-two, you may have accidentally given a hint of who will be the winner.
Sam Wood holds his lips tightly sealed until the final on Thursday
All three women lyrically talked about why Wood is the perfect man, citing his sense of humor, ambition, family values and positive attitude as reasons for wanting to be his partner.
However, if the question is asked, “If not you, who should get Wood’s last rose?”, their answers could become the game’s spoiler who won the heart of the bachelor.
Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski both quickly named Mackay as the best partner for Wood.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship from day one.
“From the moment I went into the house and noticed [Sarah’s] and Sam’s energies, I felt they were pretty compatible, and I thought about that throughout the show,” Jeavon-Fellows said.
“Sarah is standing on the ground with both feet, it’s so much fun to be with her,” Markoski added.
I've seen them together, and they have the right chemistry.
They feel comfortable and comfortable with each other.
Sarah Mackay believes that she and Sam Wood would be well suited as a couple.
From her point of view, Mackay said the house visit last week made it clear to her that Wood could be "the One".
"As soon as I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that this is obviously not just a game - I'm now unreservedly committed to him," she said.
And when she was asked who Wood should choose, if not her, she was mysterious.
"I don't know if I can say that," she said.
I love the remaining girls equally - it's a draw between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor will be broadcast on Ten on Wednesday, 7:30 p.m.
Originally released as Sarah's first choice for Sam Wood?
Jarryd Hayne had several options to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after his move to the U.S. - and there were many other teams sending inquiries after his impressive open training day at the end of last year.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula and it looks like a wise decision.
Some coaches would have banished Hayne to the bench for the remainder of the game when he lost a touchdown as did the Aussie Rugby League convert on his first point return on Tuesday at a 20-3 win against Minnesota.
But Tomsula trusted his husband and gave Hayne the next opportunity to a point-return and also into the ongoing game after an injury to Reggie Bush.
Tomsula continued to show his true face in the dressing room after the game.
Instead of grinding his rookies through the mill in front of the rest of the team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly strengthened Hayne in his post-game press conference.
49ers sports reporter Cam Inman reported that Hayne was also encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget his spoiled catch and take care of the next game.
Jarryd Hayne hits a point that was restored by the Minnesota Vikings in the first quarter
It was certainly not the start Hayne and his massive Australian following had hoped for for his NFL debut.
Hayne left the field after the fumble and later told Australian radio duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 that he could not imagine a worse start to his NFL career.
"That was one thing that happens now, you only care about the next game, and that's it," Hayne said.
Hayne compared the carpenter to his original debut in 2007, when a pass at his own in-goal area led to a try for Queensland.
Overall, it was a great experience for the 27-year-old.
Hayne posed for a photo with fans holding an Australian flag after the game and posted it on his Instagram.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss gay rights
Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Russia’s richest man, was arrested on a Siberian field with gunshot wounds.
After he openly challenged President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was convicted, his oil company Yukos seized, and his democratic efforts halted.
Because of the high refugee numbers, the Free Electors are demanding the recruitment of 1,000 new teachers in Bavaria.
Party and faction leader Hubert Aiwanger warned at the beginning of the FW autumn clause in Großwallstadt of a severe crisis in Bavaria’s schools, if there are not new teachers accordingly for the many new students: “We need at least 1,000 additional teachers to keep the schools from collapsing,” Aiwanger said.
"Otherwise we will get rejections in the Bavarian education system."
The Landtagsfraktion of the Free Voters meets in the Lower Franconian municipality until Friday.
In fact, there were other main themes.
But the record number of refugees now also dominates the Free Electoral Meeting.
"Of course, the issue of asylum will overlap the cloister," Aiwanger said.
Aiwanger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria, as they did during the Yugoslav wars in the 1990s.
"This is not going on, we have to go to the causes," said the Free Electoral Chief.
Rejected asylum seekers want to deport the free voters as soon as possible.
That is why Aiwanger also demanded more staff for the administrative courts responsible for asylum lawsuits: "We also need at least 50 new asylum judges," Aiwanger said.
The FW chief criticized that several federal states are not consistent: "We need uniform federal standards across the federal states."
"Bayern pushes away, others don't."
“We need to become more capable of action.”
However, the state policy in Großwallstadt should not fall under the table.
One long-standing issue remains on the agenda: education policy.
For the new school year, Minister of Culture Ludwig Spaenle (CSU) has started the pilot test "middle-level plus" at 47 high schools, in which an extension of the high school middle-level from three to four years is tested - as a result, it will take nine years again until high school.
But Aiwanger doesn’t go far enough.
"The G9 issue needs to be accelerated," the FW chief said.
We demand freedom of choice for all high schools who want it.
Free ride at the G9 wherever it is desired.
Stronger Wall Street Helps Dax Leap
The German stock market has closed with profits after a long, directionless and nervous trading history.
Only in the afternoon did a firmer start to the US stock exchanges provide a clear direction, which ultimately pushed the Dax by 0.56 percent to 10,188.13 points.
The MDax averaged 0.54 percent to 19,552.88 points.
The technology-intensive TecDax rose by 1.03% to 1,736.69 points.

Solid profits also booked the trading venues in London and Paris.
In the U.S., the Dow Jones Index recently posted a 1 percent increase.
Many stock exchanges expect the markets to take hold on Friday until after the US interest rate decision and also after the large decline in the futures exchanges.
The discussion about the charges from the nuclear exit has meanwhile pushed the shares of RWE to a record low and also left deep traces at Eon.
According to Spiegel, the German energy group may be missing 30 billion euros in provisions.
The federal government denied the figures reported in the press.
The shares of the two largest German energy companies recovered slightly, but ultimately lost 3.31% (RWE) and 6.15% (Eon).
Infineon shares rose a further 3.22% at the Dax peak.
According to a trader, a positive report from U.S. investor magazine "Barron's" from the weekend worked.
Accordingly, investors were currently paying too little attention to the German chipmaker.
Investing in future-proof wafer technologies and focusing on the automotive market should pay off.
Car values were in demand: Even in the traditionally weak summer month of August, more cars were sold again than in the previous year, as the Acea Industry Association announced at the start of the International Automobile Exhibition IAA in Frankfurt.
The papers of Daimler and BMW increased by 1.34% and 2.21% respectively.
Volkswagen’s advantages increased by 1.26%.
In the German pension market, the yield of listed federal securities fell to 0.48 per cent (Friday: 0.50).

The exchange rate of the euro fell last afternoon to $1,1262.
By noon, the European Central Bank had set the reference rate at $1.1305 (1.1268).
The dollar thus cost 0.8846 (0.8875) euros.
Four people killed after police fired rubber bullets at protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after police fired rubber bullets at a crowd protesting against the proposed new constitution, an official said on Wednesday.
The violence erupted in the Rupandehi district, about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, a senior district official, said more than 1,000 protesters had gathered outside a police station, some of them throwing stones and firebombs.
Mr Dhakal said the police used tear gas and then fired into the air before resorting to rubber bullets.
Twenty policemen and five civilians were injured, he said.
It was not immediately clear why the rubber bullets used, which are known to kill but are traditionally used as a less lethal alternative, apparently produced such a high death rate.
The clash was the latest in weeks of violent protests in Nepal’s southern plains, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group say new provinces formed under the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence.
There were also protests in western Nepal by the ethnic group of the Tharus, who want their own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, have been in violent clashes since the 10th.
August was killed when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces – an important step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal that has been centrally governed for centuries.
Work on a new constitution has been underway since 2008, but lawmakers have accelerated the process following the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
Legislators voted this week on certain clauses in the draft constitution in Kathmandu, and officials have said the new constitution could come into effect on Sunday.
Planned construction site in the city
The plot at the Emder Jugendzentrum Alte Post is to be rebuilt.
The city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000-square-meter area.
A mix of trade, commerce and housing is planned - but there are no concrete offers yet.
Emden - The city of Emden wants to market a plot of approximately 4000 square meters in the immediate vicinity of the Jugendzentrum Alte Post.
Preparations for this are currently underway.
It is planned to use the site for a mix of commerce, commerce and housing.
We are waiting for offers, according to the city.
Which investor to question is still unclear.
Accordingly, no contracts have been concluded yet.
The town of Emden had already bought a part of the property, which is located on the Ringstraße / corner of Große Straße, a few months ago and had the building located on it demolished.
Project Hieve: Details on the table
The plans for the holiday home settlement on the Small Sea at Emden are taking shape.
The investor presented plans for the project publicly for the first time.
A number of residents are still concerned - they fear the sale of their recreational shelter
For months, behind closed doors, negotiations had been negotiated, scrambled, debated and drawn.
Now the plans for a new holiday home on the Kleine Meer near Emden are on the table.
The interested party, the medium-sized Emder company "System-Bau", presented its plans publicly for the first time in the city development committee of the Emder Council on Monday evening.
Initially, this item had been placed on the non-public part of the agenda.
Under the pressure of the project critics and the FDP faction, who blamed the investors and the administration for stealth, Ralf Behrends went from the System-Building business management to the offensive: "We do not yet have an answer to all questions," he said in front of the council members and more than 50 visitors.
But it is good to be able to face all the rumours now.
The <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>10 to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>12 million project has been under discussion for months.
Fierce reactions among seafaring owners who had come to the meeting evoked the images and new details about the desired hotel construction.
Roberto Schulz, owner of seabeds and member of the board of directors at the interest representation of the tenants, Pro Hieve, complains: "This will be a giant block that outperforms all other buildings".
He also fears, like many other project critics, that traffic would increase sharply due to the intended size of the plant: "There must come whole bus loads to make sure this count," says Schulz.
However, what is happening exactly on the one-hectare area of the former restaurant is still open.
There is no operator yet.
"First we need to have a definite concept," said Ralf Behrends.
Because this was still missing, the construction plans are still variable.
Newborn twins with gorillas at Frankfurt Zoo
The Frankfurt Zoo is delighted with its newborn gorillas.
The 26-year-old Dian gave birth to twins yesterday.
Twin births are rare in gorillas.
The last one in a German zoo dates back almost 50 years and was also in Frankfurt in 1967, according to the zoo.
The gender of the newborn gorilla twins is not yet established, as Mother Dian holds them tightly on the body so far.
At first, the "picture" was reported.
NHC predicts 60 percent chance of cyclone south of Cape Verde
The U.S. National Hurricane Center said on Tuesday a wide low-pressure system about 350 miles (560 km) south of Cape Verde's southernmost islands had a 60 percent chance of evolving into a tropical hurricane in the next 48 hours.
Another well-defined low-pressure system, about in the middle between the Cape Verde Islands and the Small Antilles, also has a 60 percent potential to form a tropical hurricane in the next two days, the Miami-based weather experts added.
Google launches doubling donation campaign to raise $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) announced a doubling donation campaign to raise $11 million for humanitarian organizations to help thousands of refugees who overwhelmed European nations as they flee war-torn and impoverished countries.
Google has an unusually personal approach to announcing the donation call on its blog.
Instead of having a manager make the announcement, Rita Masoud, a Google employee who fled Kabul with her family when she was seven, wrote about her personal experiences.
“Our trip included many dark train and bus trips, as well as hunger, thirst, cold and fear,” she wrote.
I was lucky.
But as the refugee and migrant crisis in Europe has grown, many people like my family are desperately seeking help.
The donations go to four non-profit organizations that provide assistance to refugees and migrants: Doctors Without Borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said the first globally collected donations up to a value of 5.5 million on google.com/refugeerelief would double to $11 million.
Europe is facing its worst refugee crisis since World War II, largely caused by the four-year civil war in Syria, which has displaced more than 4 million people this year.
Many are also fleeing the war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

For slightly overweight diabetics, weight loss surgery can be helpful.
The benefits of weight loss surgery for mildly overweight people with type 2 diabetes can last for at least five years, according to a new study.
It is still too early to say whether slightly obese people with diabetes live longer after weight loss surgery than those who receive non-surgical treatments.
“The mortality data takes a long time to show something,” said Dr. Robin Blackstone, a weight loss surgery expert who wrote an editorial on the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Weight loss surgeries or obesity surgery, use various methods to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce hunger and limit the body’s ability to absorb food.
Over the years, obesity surgeries to treat type 2 diabetes have proven effective, but most studies have been conducted in people who are morbidly obese with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, a certain amount of weight in terms of size, is considered normal between 18.5 and 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight, and people with a BMI over 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers from Taiwan’s Min-Sheng General Hospital used data they had collected in a study since 2007, comparing two types of obesity surgery – stomach bypass and stomach tube formation – to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight.
The average BMI among those who underwent this surgery fell from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year in this study.
Meanwhile, the BMI in those who received non-surgical diabetes treatments remained roughly equal at 29.
Among those who underwent surgery, 36% resolved diabetes completely and 28% partially.
In the medically-treated group, diabetes resolved completely in only one percent and partially in only about two percent.
In addition, the results in the blood pressure, triglyceride, and “bad” LDL cholesterol controls were “generally better in the ‘surgical’ group,” the authors found.
The researchers also monitored patient blood levels of hemoglobin A1c, which reflects blood sugar levels over time.
Hemoglobin A1c is best kept below 7 percent, the researchers write.
After surgery, the average hemoglobin A1c level dropped from about 9% to about 6%.
However, in the medical therapy group, it remained stable at about 8 percent.
But this better "glycemic control" - as reflected in the improved hemoglobin A1c level - did not reduce mortality in five years, according to lead researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared average results for the two types of surgery.
In the fifth year, the bypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the gastrectomy group (18.7 vs. 14.2 kg), achieved greater decreases in BMI (7.4 vs. 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c (3.1% vs. 2.1%), and were more likely to have a complete overcoming of diabetes (46.9% vs. 169%).
While the new study shows no surviving benefit of surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life, says Blackstone of the University of Arizona, College of Medicine Phoenix.
In the Swedish study, obese people who underwent obesity surgery were about 29 percent less likely to die over the course of 15 years — compared to a group who tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study did not show any benefit for survival in surgical patients, Blackstone said it was reassuring for people with a BMI under 35 who are interested in the procedure.
“This is the critical point of this study because it says this surgery is lower in this lower BMI group,” without an increased risk of death or kidney disease, she said.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously as soon as the patient with their BMI is between 27 and 30.
“I think we’re waiting too long to get people to take this seriously,” she said.
I think once they’ve accumulated these genetic changes that have tightly linked their bodies to obesity and diabetes, a reversal is really hard.”
Love story plays in Hunsrück
It is a topic that is currently increasingly being considered in the literature: a young woman, unpopular and unpleasant at school, meets again after years the swarm of her youth, and he falls in love with her.
In the novel “We Are Not That Way” by Luisa Binder.
Beyond the love story, the novel is likely to be interesting especially for Hunsrück readers, because it plays in boredom and the surrounding villages.
The main professional author grew up in Langeweiler and is pleased that she was able to set a literary monument to her hometown.
"It is impossible that everyone can come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT-News
Europe cannot accept all refugees, the Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The Tibetan-Buddhist leader called for an end to violence in the refugee’s home countries.
The Dalai Lama addressed the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten-day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, which is dedicated to ethics studies.
He called for the interests of humanity to be put before the interests of individual nations or even continents.
He also stressed that while the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is admirable, the situation is not appropriate.
"It is impossible for anyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised Germany’s and Austria’s efforts to deal with the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
"Caring for several thousand refugees is wonderful, but in the meantime you need to think about long-term solutions, how real peace and real development, mainly through education, can be created for these Muslim countries," he said.
Ultimately, we need to think about how to reduce killing in their countries.
We must reduce the use of violence.
“The use of force has never solved these problems,” he added.
The Dalai Lama addressed the problem of violence and also commented on George Bush’s actions following the 9/11 terror attack, noting that the US’s violent response was drawing a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 9/11, I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush, and I told him that the way to solve this problem lies in non-violence.
"I know his motives were good, but he used violence, and that has caused unexpected consequences," the Dalai Lama said.
Fourfold increase in children’s use of hand sanitizers in the last 4 years
U.S. poison control centers report a nearly 400-percent increase in the number of children under the age of twelve who swallow heavily alcoholic hand sanitizers, according to the Georgia Poison Center.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Poison Center, cases of hand sanitizer intake in children under 12 years of age reportedly rose from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
"Children are increasingly coming to these products, and unfortunately, a percentage of them end up going to the emergency room," Lopez told CNN.
He said some children deliberately drink disinfectants, while some do so to impress their friends or because of a test of courage on social media.
Videos on YouTube show how teens drink disinfectants only because of a cheap experience.
Teens have allegedly mixed disinfectants with alcoholic mouthwash to get a harder drink.
Younger children can be attracted to attractive fragrances of disinfectants.
“A child doesn’t think this is bad for him,” Lopez said.
Many of the more attractive (hand disinfectants) are those that are perfumed.
There are disinfectants with strawberry, grape and orange scents that are very appealing to children.
Hand sanitizers contain between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.
Especially in young children, few sprays can lead to alcohol poisoning.
“It’s highly concentrated alcohol,” Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the Poison Emergency Center at the University of Kansas Hospital, told Fox 4 in Kansas City.
So, you wouldn’t leave a sip of whiskey around, but people leave these hand sanitizers within reach of children, and if children get it, then it’s a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who had recently taken four sprays of strawberry-scented hand sanitizer at school, was taken to an emergency room for treatment.
Her blood alcohol concentration was 179, twice the threshold that is legally considered drunk in an adult, said Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency room doctor who treated her at the Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah lamented her words and was unable to go when she arrived in the emergency room.
Doctors monitored them overnight in a separate children's hospital for signs of brain trauma as the girl had fallen through the alcohol and bumped her head, Ritchey said.
"That was very frightening," Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah's mother, told CNN.
It could have been deadly for my child.
Lopez has recommended that parents and teachers use non-alcoholic products or disinfectants and store hand sanitizers outside the child’s reach.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants were associated with deaths.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died after swallowing hand sanitizers that contained a toxic, undeclared ingredient.
Health officials suspect the product contained methanol, a deadly solution rather than ethyl alcohol, which was listed as the active ingredient.
In January, three fourth-grade students in New York State planned to poison their “bad” teacher by exposing antibacterial products around the classroom, according to a police report.
The teacher is highly allergic to hand sanitizers and banished her from her room.
The police considered the failed plan to be "talk" and referred disciplinary measures to the school authority.
Villingen-Schwenningen: Three vehicles damaged
A 33-year-old driver has been slightly injured in an accident on the cross bracket between Nordring and Auf Herdenen.
A 60-year-old truck driver drove on the crossbar towards the circular industrial area and realized too late that two vehicles had stopped at the circular.
Subsequently, he crashed into the back of an Audi with his truck and pushed this vehicle onto a Ford Fiesta in front of it.
The damage to the vehicles involved in the accident amounted to about 10,000 euros, the police said.
The 33-year-old Audi was no longer ready to drive and had to be towed off.
Rumor cuisine: No Disharmony at Celtic
Griffiths plays down the talk of disharmony at Celtic Glasgow, Deila admits that the hoops are in a bad place, but that he will turn it over again.
Hearts will fight SFA over Neilson’s allegations, and Warburton will be cautious about January re-commitments that could destroy the squad’s unity
Dons increase lead over Celtic by five points
ADAM Rooney’s elf in the first half gave Aberdeen a narrow victory over Hamilton in Pittodrie, so the Dons create a five-point gap between themselves and Celtic.
Griffiths plays down talk about disharmony
There are rumours of disharmony at Celtic Glasgow, which was spontaneously rejected by Griffiths, who insisted that he and his teammates are not under increased control as they prepare for the confrontation with the Dutch table leader.
I don’t think we’re feeling pressured, I think the players are looking forward to it.
The lack of title competition in Scottish football bores Dutch - de Boer
Former Rangers midfielder and former Dutch national player Ronald de Boer has said Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic as there is no title rivalry with the Rangers.
De Boer, currently an ambassador for Ajax, said: "In Holland, they no longer show highlights of Celtic games and why?"
It's because the Rangers aren't there.
People here are not just talking about the return of the Rangers.
They're talking about the old firm.
They talk about both teams together and that’s what interests them.
There’s a lot of excitement in the old company games, and it’s not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games.
I'll turn things around, Deila swears.
RONNY Deila has accepted that Celtic must fight, but the Norwegian boss has vowed to turn things around.
After the defeat against Malmö and the subsequent withdrawal from the Champions League, the defeat was followed by 10 men from Aberdeen, who are now clearly at the top of the table with five points of lead.
Deila said, "Celtic had bad times before, and we'll be back."
Now we want to get out of there as soon as possible.
I know it’s very frustrating and a lot of people are very, very angry or sad about what’s happening.
We feel the same way, but we have to move on.
We really, really need the support of Celtic because that makes the players better.
Getting together now is so important.
Warburton cautious about January transfers
Despite his comments just a few weeks ago suggesting he was targeting some January transfers, Rangers boss Mark Warburton is cautious about signing new additions and insists he doesn’t want to disrupt the unity of the Ibrox framework.
The former head of Brentford said, "The January transfer window is very different from the summer window."
Players coming in the summer will have this pre-season time to integrate what you’ve seen with our own group this season.
The team is really good.
Sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need.
Celtic target Michu with withdrawal notice
Swansea striker Michu, speaking to Celtic during the transfer period, has indicated that he could retire if his contract with the Swans expires.
The 29-year-old has been plagued with an annoying ankle for two years and has failed to leave Wales this summer.
Hearts set to SFA battle over Neilson's comments
The Hearts led 2:1 when Paterson was sent off the field and then lost 3:2, but the Defender's Red Card was later revoked - Collum's third Red Card, which was revoked in eight months.
Neilson insists, "I didn't question integrity, I didn't comment on performance."
Griffiths vows to avoid Tynecastle
The incorrigible Hibee was corrected after admitting to singing a song with offensive lyrics about ex-Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident took place in a pub in the Roseburn area of Edinburgh before an Edinburgh Derby in Tynecastle in March 2014.
"It was a derby, and it was the heat of the moment," the striker said, adding, "It's safe to say I won't return to Tynecastle unless it plays for Celtic Glasgow."
Tannadice Supervisory Board has confidence in Dundee United Management
Simon Donnelly insists that the board of Dundee United still has confidence in the management team to turn things around – but admits that the downturn must end on the pitch.
I think Stephen Thompson has confidence in us.
We’re going to get the guys back on track,” Donnelly said.
McInnes is happy to win against Hamilton.
Derek McInnes admits that his Aberdeen team had to fight desperately against Hamilton Accies to see a seventh consecutive league victory, bringing them a five-point lead over Celtic at the top of the table thanks to Adam Rooney's elf in the first half.
McInnes said: "There is no team that has won everything, in cup games or leagues that have never won games of this kind."
Unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged, while overall unemployment in the UK is rising.
Unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at 164,000 between May and July, while the number of unemployed for the UK as a whole rose by 10,000 to 1.82 million in the same period.
Scotland's unemployment rate of 5.9 percent was above that of the UK of 5.5 percent, as the figures of the Office of National Statistics (ONS) showed.
In the meantime, employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 during the three months, with the number of employees now at 2,612,000.
The employment rate for Scotland fell to 74.0 percent during the quarter, a figure above the UK average of 73.5 percent.
Scottish Secretary of State David Mundell commented on the latest figures, saying, “The government’s long-term plan has laid the foundation for a stronger economy.”
It is almost exactly a year ago that Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months, we have seen further improvements in the Scottish labour market, with an increase in employment and a decrease in unemployment.
Drunken people disrupted the flow.
Since the security personnel could not satisfy the situation, the staff called the police.
It was only with the use of pepper spray that the officials were able to take the disturbers into custody.
A breathing alcohol test resulted in a 16-year-old 0.89 promille.
The grown-up was picked up by his mother.
A 28-year-old had 2.15 perm and initially remained in custody.
Why I'm Going to Witness an Execution in Oklahoma
A little later today, except for a late legal intervention, I will watch a man be put to death.
If it happens, and I hope it doesn’t, I’ll be sitting in a spectator gallery in the Death Chamber at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary when Richard Glossip is executed by the poison syringe.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death.
The invitation was made for the first time in January by his best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As the day drew nearer, I began to fear.
So, why should I do it?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty.
It would offer a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists are allowed to see executions in the U.S., and since there are often more applications than places available, a macabre lottery takes place to decide who is elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media outlets from 12 to five.
Whoever is selected will observe it without emotion.
I can't do that.
I will sit next to Richard Glossip’s closest friend, with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a two-and-a-half-hour visit.
I like the guy.
We often laugh a lot when we talk.
Prison authorities say I can’t be a witness and a journalist, so I won’t be allowed to bring a notebook and a pen to record what I see.
I just have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter of giving up my impartiality.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the prisoner's story the way he wants it, and you get access.
I complained to her.
She admitted that she “could have formulated it better,” but she still thinks it’s wrong what I’m doing.
Richard Glossip had problems with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn’t tell me what I have to write, and I wouldn’t do it even if he did.
I told him he could remove me from his witness list at any time.
But he wants an international reporter present to write there.
If he dies, he thinks publicity will help the movement against the death penalty.
Kim Bellware, a reporter for the Huffington Post, will sit next to me.
If you want to know more about the case, please listen to the series of podcasts I made.
I do not want to go back to all the details here.
I can't say for sure that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese would blame him for being a beneficiary of the act.
But I think there's a strong probability that he's not guilty of murder.
I'm sure there's not enough evidence to justify a death sentence.
I think his execution is wrong.
And from that perspective, I'm going to see him die.
I can’t say I’m really objective.
There will be other reporters you can turn to.
What you'll get from me is what it's like to see a man die an unnecessary death.
Man Convinced to Come From Canning River After Wet Police Chase
The Canning Vale policeman remained dry when he persuaded the man from the Canning River.
An attempt by a man from Perth to hang the police was unsuccessful when he found himself in shallow and swampy waters, just a few meters away from a police officer trying to "gently persuade him to return to the shore."
Canning Vale police were summoned on Tuesday to a break-in incident in Beckenham.
When they discovered the suspect, he tried to escape them towards Canning River.
But he didn't go too far.
"He stood in the water and said, 'I'm not coming out, come and get me,'" said Senior Sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Constable Lachlan Perhavec was not too enthusiastic about wetting his uniform, so he applied a more reliable tactic - "A good policeman negotiates".
"Sometimes people do funny things to try to escape," said Senior Sergeant Castledine.
Championship football player Ben Cousins offers an unforgettable example.
In 2006, Cousins drove his car into the trenches to escape an alcohol control and then attempted to swim across the Swan River.
His efforts were unsuccessful, but inspired locals to humorously plan a Ben Cousins biathlon.
Peter Moody claims stewards tried to spy on him and threatens to end racing
Peter Moody claims that stewards of Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in their stables last year and threatened to end the race immediately.
He targeted the stewards and integrity department of Racing Victoria, claiming that they were conducting a personal campaign against him with Lady Tatai’s late scratching due to a race day treatment, the last straw on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he has always tried to do what is best for racing and he found himself under difficult conditions when it came to the positive cobalt tupfer test at Lidaris that he cannot explain.
He had held back for 18 months because of the espionage allegations and did not want it to "look like grapes hanging too high."
"I was going to say nothing about it, and I've been sitting on it for a long time, but sometimes you're so frustrated that everything comes out at once," Moody said.
You know it went on.
Sometimes you react, and you have to live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I'm gonna go home tonight and get a good night's sleep.
I want to walk around the raised head, and I want my owners to think that I’m trying my best for them.
If they start thinking I’m not doing that, then I shouldn’t be a coach anymore.
I have to think about what I do with my license.
Previously, Moody had launched the bomb in an interview with racing.com that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stable.
“Eighteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown, and Dr. Brian Stewart were sitting in a room with a man — whom I’ll name when I’m asked — and offered him employment in my stables to provide information about what I’m doing inside my stables,” Moody said.
Apparently you think I'm a fraud.
If that is the case, they should definitely stick to their noses because they failed in trying to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former chairman of the RVL, David Moodie, acting president of the RVL and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of the RVL, were aware of this at the time and still are today.
Is this supposed to make me think it’s personal?
Has the RVL behaved cowardly and perhaps makes people outside of coaches responsible for what is going on in the industry?
Am I bad for the industry?
Am I that bad for the industry?
Maybe people out there think it's me.
Maybe they have to take my license and fire me, and I have no doubt that what I say now makes them think about it.
But now I'm at the point where I don't care, and that makes me sad.
That makes me really sad.
I will put pressure on them and urge them to make a decision.
I have the support of my family and I can go.
The coach's frustration levels have built up with the long-running cobalt investigation at Lidari, and the late scratching led him to say he could "throw his license over the table."
Moody, best known for his preparation of the undefeated master Black Caviar, called the race day treatment rule "ridden" after a packet of mud or clay was applied to the horse legs, which violated the rules.
"It's against the rules of racing.
I have to take full responsibility for that,” he said.
"One of my employees mistakenly applied mud to the leg.
It could have been that way last night.
Yesterday could have been like this all day, whatever it was.
It was the same on the race day.
Moody could face a three-month disqualification for treatment with the pack on race day. An investigation into this matter has been opened.
It's a joke.
People who make these rules don’t know anything about the horse.
“We all see that we need rules, but here you have gone too far,” Moody said.
Man arrested after driver's escape
Police arrested a man over the weekend after a collision with a cyclist and then a driver fleeing in Cobram.
The cyclist was delivered to the Royal Melbourne Hospital by helicopter with serious injuries after being hit by a car on the Murray Valley Highway on Saturday morning.
Police said the driver continued driving without stopping to help the injured driver.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia appeared to police in Shepparton.
He is expected to be charged with driver's flight and omission of assistance and other traffic offences.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, remains in the hospital. He is in a stable condition.
Melbourne storm coach Craig Bellamy beats back rivals over allegations of ring-fighting
Melbourne storm coach Craig Bellamy has criticized tackling his players as "agenda setting" by two Premier League favorites of the NRL.
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said the referees allowed the storm players to "ring fight" with his team during the high storm victory in the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made a hardly disguised remark to the storm team after his team scored the final victory against the North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night, calling the game a "pattern" of the Rugby League and saying the two from Queensland were "not too good" in the Rings.
Bellamy defended his team's tackling limb, saying they were only focused on their "contact" when tackling.
Bellamy added that the criticism of two leading coaches on his team sounded confident to him, as it meant they were worried about being beaten by the Storm team.
"It's coming up over and over again - I didn't hear Trent Robinson talk about ring fights when they beat us 24-2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we haven’t changed anything about our defensive system or techniques throughout the year, but over the past six weeks, we’ve made our contact at Tackles a real focus, and that has brought the trend shift for us.
Trent has been there for three years now, and he obviously has a great team to train, so he's probably not used to losing, so it was a bit of a shock to him.
It’s funny how this happens again and again at this time of year.
Bellamy attacked Bennett's idea of "exciting football" and reminded his mentor that Bennett's St George Illawarra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with "boring" football.
Wayne talks about exciting football.
He compared his game on Saturday night to ours on Friday night and how exciting their game was," Bellamy said.
I remember in 2010 St George was criticized as a boring team, and Wayne said he’d take a shit job of it.
But now he has a team that can play and that we see as exciting, especially his young players at their speed.
This is the ball game you want to play when you have this kind of player.
He made this statement in 2010, now he wants everyone to play his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can play like this.
I build more confidence because they say these things because they’re a little worried about having to play against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn’t think of us when it came to the Big Games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the game Storm vs. Roosters scored a higher score than the game Broncos vs. Cowboys.
The game of the Broncos was probably a good game, I haven't watched it yet, but what was the result? 16 : 12 ?
Our game was 20:18, there were two more attempts in our game, but is this an exciting game?
Or are there breaks and no points something exciting?
For me, it's the game plans.
If they mention us, it means that we will meet them at some point.
The Storm team is free this weekend as they have won the right to receive either the North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronulla Sharks next Saturday night in the pre-finals at AAMI Park. Ticket sales start from next Tuesday morning.
Serbian with $200,000 bail after drug indictment
A man who could face a life sentence for his attempt to get into possession of 40 kilograms of cocaine smuggled into Queensland was released on bail of $200,000.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of five men arrested last month after the federal police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Solay, which came from South America via Vanuatu and landed in Coomera in August.
Maksimovic was observed meeting his co-defendants at the marina during the morning and later at the Café Coomera Roadhouse, where police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo.
Despite a potentially life sentence for attempting to possess a commercial amount of cocaine, Maksimovic’s lawyer argued that there was no evidence that he was attempting to possess the entire amount and that he could have been in the cafe for a harmless reason.
The judge at the Supreme Court, Peter Flanagan, was concerned about the danger of escape at Maksimovic.
He has strong relations with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he told the court on Wednesday.
In the criminal case, he lied to the police about his whereabouts.
Maksimovic's mother and stepfather had offered a $200,000 bail jointly to secure his release.
“After reading the two persons’ affidavits, it is clear that the imposition of a security of $200,000 is a real financial burden,” said Judge Flanagan.
But that alone will not be enough to keep him from appearing, he warned.
Maksimovic was released on bail, on the condition that he surrenders his Australian and Serbian passport, reports to the police daily, and abides by an exit lockdown from 18:00-06:00.
Accident on A5 near Karlsruhe: Führerhaus torn apart
In an accident with three trucks on Highway 5 near Karlsruhe, a truck driver was seriously injured on Tuesday evening.
Two of the three trucks involved had braked in front of a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel.
The third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to evade the left at the last moment, police reported.
The driver's cabin was completely torn apart.
The driver was seriously injured in a hospital.
The A5 between Bruchsal and Karlsruhe-Nord was completely closed for six hours until 2 a.m.
There was a damage of 122,000 euros.
Stevan Hogg Used Girls' Phone to Entice Pedophiles to Send Pictures
A paedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to request pictures of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg picked up the girl’s phone when it fell asleep, logged into an online messaging service, from which he received a series of indecent pictures of children sent to him by another user.
The girl later woke up and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of sleeping Hogg.
She looked through it, found the confusing messages, and immediately alarmed her mother.
Police took care of it and looked at the five pictures, then analyzed computers found under the address and discovered "relevant" web searches that used terms to search for indecent pictures of children.
Hogg then claimed to the officials that he did it because it would lead to "pedophiles on the Internet" and he then "pretended to be a police officer to scare them".
Attorney Eilidh Robertson told the Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said it would be an addiction - that he was addicted to scaring people.
He admitted that the searches on the computer were carried out by him, but said it happened because he wanted to claim to be a police officer to scare paedophiles.
He was asked about his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send even more photos.
He said he did it to lure her.
He said he was sick in the head when he drank, and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder.
Ms. Robertson added: "When the girl found the news on the phone, she called her mother and was shaking and crying.
She then saw the indecent pictures on the phone and confronted the accused with it.
The girl was interviewed and said the defendant was using computers and PlayStation to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.
Hogg, 23, Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty, within the meaning of the indictment, to having taken indecent pictures of children on June 14 last year, to having violated the injunctions on January 25 of this year, and not appearing in court for a hearing on March 24 of this year.
Defense lawyer Gregor Sim asked Hogg not to appear on the sex offender register, as one could argue that "no significant sexual element" could be found in his crime.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed the verdict until October to receive background reports on social work.
Hogg was granted bail in this case, but was kept in custody for hearings on other cases still pending.
He was included in the list of sexual offenders even before the date of the verdict.
Smugglers evade small border crossings to Germany
More and more refugees are being taken away from the major checkpoints on the German-Austrian border.
Many smugglers left people increasingly at smaller border crossings out of fear of discovery and arrest
on the Austrian side, a spokesman for the Federal Police said.
Along the Inn border river, more than 1,000 refugees have been seized in the districts of Passau and Rottal-Inn since Tuesday.
They had reached the German side on foot via bridges and congestion.
There, they are received by federal police officers and forwarded for registration.
According to the Federal Police, there were significantly more refugees at Munich Hauptbahnhof than at the beginning of the week on Wednesday.
By 8:00 a.m. alone, about 700 people had arrived in the country's capital, a spokesman said in the morning.
After the reintroduction of controls at the German-Austrian border, on Tuesday 1759 refugees had reached the city.
Stuttgart: Tropensturm "Henry" expected in the southwest
Meteorologists warn of storm surges in the southwest from Wednesday afternoon.
Due to a low-pressure area across Western Europe, warm sea air is currently flowing into the country, the German Weather Service (DWD) in Stuttgart announced.
The strong depth is the outflow of the Tropical Storm "Henry", which in recent days has been pulled from the Bermuda Islands over the Atlantic.
Heavy storms and thunderstorms are expected especially in Baden.
According to DWD, bows of 60 to 90 hours are also expected in the Black Forest, on the Swabian Alb and in the Lake Constance district until Thursday morning.
On Friday, the sun can be seen for longer.
The crowd does it: Every two years, the automakers showcase their innovations at the IAA.
2015 is especially marked by movement in the compact cars, which are currently selling particularly well.
Compact cars are currently in high demand: around 28.1 percent of new registrations came from this segment in August alone, according to the Federal Motor Administration (KBA).
This is also reflected in the IAA (Public Days 17 to 27 September).
Among all the futuristic concept cars and new high-end and luxury cars, many new compact models will be introduced this year.
One of the biggest premieres for the German car industry is the Opel Astra, which will be at the dealerships in the fall.
"The Astra is an extremely important model for us," Opel chief Karl-Thomas Neumann said at the fair.
It is at the core of the brand.
In order for the volume model to sell well, the new Astra should not be much more expensive.
Opel is set to enter below its biggest competitor, VW Golf, which starts at <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>17,650.
The current Astra costs from 16,990 euros.
The Astra is available with a new 1.4-litre engine with 74 kW/100 hp.
In addition, the Hesse offers further diesel and gasoline engines from 70 kW/95 hp to 147 kW//200 hp, which for the first time also include three-cylinder gasoline engines.
Unlike the main competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus, the Opel Astra is initially only available as a five-door car.
The second variant will follow in the spring of the combi, which is already on display at the IAA.
And what will happen to new compact cars besides the Astra at the IAA?
Renault Mégane: Renault is sending the fourth generation of its Astra competitor Mégane into the race.
At the fair, the Mégane can be seen exclusively as a five-door in a conventional and a sporty GT version.
It will go on sale at the beginning of next year, then also as a combo.
Infiniti: The Infiniti Q30 is a brand new product in the segment.
With the new model, the Nissan sedan wants to find its position in the fast-growing segment.
The compact Infiniti fully fits into the brand’s design line with its curved lines.
The base model will receive a gasoline engine with a power of at least 90 kW/122 hp.
But there is also a diesel with 80 kW/109 hp or 125 kW/170 hp.
Suzuki Baleno: New in the segment is also the Suzuki Baleno, which is celebrating its world premiere in Frankfurt.
The model is offered with petrol engines, including a newly developed 1.0-litre turbo engine and a power of 82 kW/111 hp.
The maximum torque, according to the manufacturer, is 170 Newton meters (Nm).
The launch of the Baleno in Europe is in the spring of 2016.
DS 4: Not entirely new, but completely renewed is the compact class DS 4 model, which can be seen at the IAA.
Outside, the designers of the Citro<0xC3><0xAB>n’s high-end sedan put their hands on the front: here the cooler grille was redesigned and the modified headlamps equipped with LED technology.
In the interior, the infotainment system was mainly modernized, the number of buttons was reduced by a touch screen and Apple’s CarPlay was integrated for the first time.
In addition, the IAA will feature a number of revisions and new variants in the compact class, such as the updated Mercedes A-Class or the Peugeot 308 GTI.
JVA Berlin-Tegel: Five square meters of cell are unworthy of man
The Federal Constitutional Court has given justice to an ex-prisoner of the Tegel Judicial Enforcement Institution, who was housed for months in a too small cell.
Because of the violation of their human dignity, prisoners are generally entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in too small cells.
This was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday.
According to the judges, those affected can hope for money even if they were locked in too tight spaces for a few days (Acts: 1 Chronicles 1127/14).
With this, an ex-prisoner was successful with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe: he was housed in the Berlin-Tegel judiciary between June and November 2009 in a single cell with about five square meters of floor space; the toilet was not separated spatially.
Afterwards, the man, who according to his lawyer is now back on the loose, was transferred to a larger cell.
His civil liability lawsuit over the unworthy conditions of detention against the state of Berlin failed.
However, the constitutional judges revoked the verdict of the Berlin Chamber Court and dismissed the case for re-examination there.
You see the human dignity of the man violated.
The Court of Appeal now decides on the amount of compensation
Even if, for legal reasons, only a few days of detention are decisive for the compensation of the period in question, there is a claim for compensation, it said.
Otherwise, "an aggravation of the legal protection of the personality would be to be feared".
The court must now clarify the amount of compensation.
In the past, constitutional judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners.
It was not until April that they awarded damages to a prisoner because he was naked in a cell.
According to a 2011 decision, the multiple occupation of a cell without a separate toilet is also unworthy of humans.
Karlsruhe also confirmed on Wednesday the Berlin Constitutional Court, which in a parallel case in November 2009 had certified an inhumane accommodation to a prisoner.
The then plaintiff was housed daily for three months between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cell as in the Karlsruhe case.
The Berlin prisons had also come to the headlines in recent weeks due to the lack of staff.
Prisoners are therefore repeatedly locked up for 23 hours, the aggressiveness increases, even fighting is said to have already occurred due to the tense situation.
According to the judicial press office, 21 posts in Tegel are not occupied due to a shortage of young people, 19 are due to be dropped in 2016.
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy: "We can do this"
Immigration of refugees is a huge challenge - the Federal Chancellor is determined to accept it.
What is happening to Germany?
Approximately 800,000 asylum seekers will come to Germany this year, according to forecasts by the Federal Ministry of the Interior, according to Deputy Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel (SPD), Germany is even able to accommodate one million refugees.
Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) has demonstrated determination in the face of the unusual challenge: "I say again and again: We can do it, and we will do it."
What will happen to Germany, the following overview.
According to different forecasts, between 350000 (estimate of the Federal Ministry of Construction) and 400000 (estimate of the Pestel Institute) homes are used annually - for the next five years.
That is almost twice as much as is being built so far (250,000 apartments).
The lack of housing is dramatic, but especially in the case of affordable rental properties: 60,000 to 80,000 social dwellings fall out of the rental price bond each year, and refugees will also apply for these particularly affordable dwellings.
Federal Minister of Construction Barbara Hendricks (SPD) wants to double the funding, from currently 518 million to one billion euros.
This is far too little from the point of view of the Pestel Institute: 80,000 social housing units would have to be created each year, and for that the federal government would have to invest a funding of 6.4 billion per year.
Scientists and the Federal Minister of Construction agree that there must also be more tax advantages for investments in housing.
According to estimates by the Institute for Labour Market and Occupational Research, 55 percent of refugees in Germany are expected to be able to work in the long term.
However, refugees in Germany would not be systematically asked for their qualifications to help them get started, criticizes Claudia Walter, project manager for integration and education at the Bertelsmann Foundation.
However, it is crucial for the integration of refugees whether they find work in Germany.
Work is the key for social contacts, for appreciation in the host society, but also for the self-esteem of immigrants, says migration researcher Dietrich Thränhardt.
According to Thränhardt, there has been a political turn in Germany: from the prohibition of work for refugees to the recognition of work.
While previously there was a work ban for asylum seekers of up to five years, this was reduced to three months in November 2014, as well as the residence requirement, which restricts asylum seekers to a place of residence.
The majority of people in society - also because of the lack of skilled workers - have adopted the view that refugees should be given quicker access to the labour market.
A major obstacle to access to the labour market is the lack of knowledge of German.
To date, there is not a sufficient range of general and vocational language courses.
Studies also show that jobs are most often mediated through personal contacts.
In Thränhardt’s view, networking is therefore the king’s way to work integration.
The Berlin School Administration has found that only a few refugee parents put their children in the Kitas, an estimated 10 to 15 percent: “For the rootless parents, it is first of all very important to keep the family together,” says Ilja Koschembar, spokeswoman for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration.
To convince the family of the benefits of kita, however, the administration distributes handsheets in different languages.
Should the need for educators increase sharply due to the large number of refugees, the Berlin Senate would try to increase the educational capacities - for example, by allowing more specialized schools.
In the countries, students with no knowledge of German are prepared for lessons in welcome classes.
However, they are not always taught by fully trained teachers, but, as in Berlin, also by teachers who have only one qualification in German as a second language.
There is no shortage of them, says Beate Stoffers of the Berlin School Administration.
The German Students’ Association estimates that about 20 percent of refugees want to study in Germany.
In principle, no federal state prohibits asylum seekers or patients from studying - the only exception so far was Berlin, but interior senator Frank Henkel (CDU) has now abandoned his position.
Student-willing refugees could be facilitated access to the university.
Refugees with a residence permit or tolerance will no longer receive benefits under the Asylum Applicants Act when they start studying.
The latter generally do not receive bafög, as they do not fall under the circle of bafög entitled persons.
Patient refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years to be eligible for Bafög, from 1 January 2016 this span will be reduced to 15 months.
But this funding gap also needs to be closed, demand Steffen Krach, Berlin’s State Secretary for Science, and the Deutsche Studentenwerk.
Students should receive bafög immediately.
Islam will play a more important role in the future, because many refugees are Muslims, and for many, religion is an important part of their identity.
The state should gradually grant Islam the same rights as the churches, and further develop the existing state-church right into a new state-religion relationship.
It would also be important to set up an Islamic welfare association that would take care of the newcomers professionally.
The rights also include duties.
Thus, the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contacts and be willing to cooperate with the state in many areas and give it certain control options.
This includes the willingness to act courageously against religious fundamentalism.
The chairman of the Central Council of Muslims, Aiman Mazyek, on Thursday expressed concern that religious conflicts could also be brought into Germany.
Those who wanted to carry out such conflicts in Germany "have immediately realized their right to stay here, in Germany," he said on Bavaria Radio.
He proposed translating the Basic Law into Arabic.
In the future, integration will be much more a matter for the whole of society than it is today.
This will have to change the majority society as well, and the reduction of discrimination and racism will become more pressing.
As a result of European decisions, Germany has had an anti-discrimination body and a General Equality Act for nearly a decade.
But it is learning very slowly, as the NSU murder series showed, in which the police and authorities systematically ignored the racist motive.
Equal opportunities for all: What migrant organisations and interest groups of non-white Germans have long demanded and to which international agreements such as the Anti-Rassism Convention oblige Germany must become a reality in the coming years, if the country is to remain peaceful and its new citizens are to use their opportunities - for the benefit of all.
In general, Germany is able to provide medical care to the refugees expected so far, says Dr. Frank Ulrich Montgomery.
"As far as man power and capacities are concerned, we can do that," he told the Daily Mirror.
However, additional money has to be flowed into the system.
To avoid bottlenecks, Montgomery urges all newcomers to hand out health cards immediately upon registration.
The services provided could later be settled with the federal states.
And in the long term, it would be highly questionable to feed so many people with the limited catalogue of benefits provided for by the Asylum Applicants Act.
Otherwise, the doctors make the language barriers above all to create.
Already so far, according to Berlin health scientist Thea Borde, migrants are being less informed about their diseases than other patients.
Not only in clinics, but also in doctor’s offices, interpreter costs should be taken over, she demands.
But many refugees would also be helped with more general medical contact points in the emergency ambulances.
And with a different diagnostic look.
Among refugee children, for example, there are significantly more untreated disabilities, and adolescents are concerned with HIV education.
However, with the partially different medical conditions German doctors would come out of their training, says Montgomery.
"Parasitic infestation or tuberculosis are not so difficult to detect." And as far as the lack of doctors is concerned, refugees may even have relief in sight.
The Syrians had a highly developed education system, and many of the refugees were even doctors.
However, in order to be allowed to practice, they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly pass exams again.
At least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are mentally ill, according to estimates by the Bundes Psychotherapeutenkammer (BPtK): most suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder or depression.
Refugee children are particularly vulnerable, explains Dietrich Munz, President of the BPtK.
A recent study by the TU Munich shows that one in five Syrian refugee children arrive traumatized in Germany.
Those who suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder suffer from so-called flashbacks with shortness of breath, dizziness, heart palpitations and death fears.
Other symptoms include sleep and concentration disorders, severe dreadfulness and emotional deafness.
To prevent the symptoms from becoming chronic, early treatment is necessary, Munz said.
So far, however, only 4% of mentally ill refugees are receiving psychotherapy.
While mentally ill asylum seekers can apply for psychotherapy in the social services, the processing usually takes several months.
In addition, in the social services, the majority of cases are handled by specialists or doctors who are not trained for mental illnesses, who decide whether or not therapy is necessary.
This often leads to misjudgments, Munz says.
Manege invites you to dream
With the new staging "Passion", the Circus Probst draws on the traditions of circus art.
The goal is to attract every age group to the ban of fascinating acrobatics, animal dressage and unique entertainment.
Now the Circus Probst invites Waves to dream in the manege on the brick.
"Our passion is the circus."
"I can't imagine living without my circus family," says Stephanie Probst, animal teacher and junior headmaster.
"Passion" - under this motto is the current moon staging.
For more than 33 years, the circus has been in the hands of the Probst family.
The gift of enthusiasm lies in the blood of the family.
"It's important to us to take people away from their daily routine and take them to a completely different world for two hours," said the 27-year-old junior manager.
"Manegen cocktail with world city flair", so Director Reinhard Probst calls his concept.
50 cities on the nearly 3,000-kilometer tour can now experience this flair.
The program of the circus convinces with talented artists from all over the world.
Awarded at the international circus festival in Monte Carlo, the Russian Stoliarov Clown Family attracts the audience with jokes and charm.
The Castillo Brothers also understand their craft.
With the heroes of the silent films, the Cuban duo wants to take it easy.
Ease and agility - with these words they identify themselves.
Her humorous art at the mast is supposed to conquer women's hearts in the storm.
In addition to numerous salmon ointments, the acrobatics of the Circus Probst also fascinate with fingertips and articulation.
Balancing with a single wheel on a ball?
No problem for He Yuan.
Snakes fascinate and scare people at the same time.
Wang Lin from China is familiar with the oldest form of acrobatics like few others and fascinated by its agility.
60 employees from 12 nations provide diversity in every way.
"The animals belong to our family," Stephanie's mother, Brigitte Probst, said.
Abuse of circus animals is only too often the subject of various animal welfare organizations.
Stephanie Probst also commented: “If our animals are not doing well, we are not doing well either.”
Around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each stray unit.
The "four-legged artists", as they are affectionately called, are read by the eyes whenever possible.
We want to work with the animals and have fun with them.
If the animal does not feel comfortable, it does not want to ride.
The most important thing is to take good care of the animals.
Especially on her Zebroid Jumbo, a mixture of a Shetland pony stallion and a zebra stud, the Probst family is proud.
The two animals have lived together in a fence for eight years and nothing has happened.
"But then, suddenly, our little jumbo was there," says Brigitte Probst.
The zebroid is not yet ready for riding, but for this it is the unique mascot of the Circus Probst.
There should be something for every visitor.
"One thing is certain," says Stephanie Probst: "Whether it's five or 1,200 spectators, we always give our best and are there with all our heart."
The Circus Probst invites you to his performances every day from September 17th to 20th at 5 pm and 8 pm.
On Sunday, the program starts at 11 and 16 hours.
Thursday is family day, for the performance at 5 pm the prices are reduced.
In addition, the animal show is open daily from 10 am to 6 pm.
Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe Makes False Speech in Parliament
Mr Mugabe, Africa’s oldest leader, fell down the stairs from a podium earlier this year.
He remained unharmed, but the video of the case quickly spread through social media.
The opening of parliament was also blurred by allegations by opposition MPs that they had received anonymous death threats and were warned not to accompany Mr Mugabe’s speech with shouts.
Last month they had stalked him and interrupted him during his speech on the situation of the nation in parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday.
Innocent Gonese, spokesman for the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), said seven opposition politicians had received text messages on their phones warning them not to interfere with Mugabe’s speech.
"The message comes from a number that isn't shown, but it's titled 'Death'," he told reporters after Mugabe's speech.
It warns the Members of Parliament concerned that immunity in Parliament will end, and once they leave Parliament, their parliamentary immunity will no longer be effective.
The chief spokesman said the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai was “concerned” about the dangers to politicians.
Hewlett-Packard to cut up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard is expected to cut 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of the company’s restructuring and savings efforts.
HP will split into two listed companies later this year, separating the computer and printer business from its fast-growing enterprise hardware and service business.
The expected job cuts will result in a burden of over $2.7 billion from the fourth quarter, HP said in a statement.
“These restructuring measures will enable a more competitive, more sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett-Packard Enterprise,” said Meg Whitman, HP Chairman and Chief Executive, who will lead the unit after the separation.
“Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP is today, and we have a broad and in-depth portfolio of businesses that support companies in transitioning to a new style of business,” Whitman said.
As an independent company, we are better placed than ever to meet the changing needs of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than $50 billion in annual revenue and “will be focused on delivering unparalleled, integrated technology solutions for enterprises,” the company said in a statement.
It splits a company that was founded in the 1930s by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to manufacture electrical installations and whose Palo Alto Garage is called "the birthplace of Silicon Valley".
HP has undergone a massive restructuring to cope with the shift from traditional PCs to mobile devices.
The move by HP, the world’s second-largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest U.S. tech companies, is the latest in this area based on the belief that tightly focused companies deliver better performance.
FC Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says teammates must stand behind injured Jack Wilshere before the game against Dynamo Zagreb
Wenger stressed to Wilshere that it was September and as long as his rehabilitation runs as planned, there is no reason why he can’t play again before Christmas.
This optimistic scenario already means that Wilshere will surely miss at least the next four games for England and given his history, his participation in the European Championship next summer is certainly still uncertain.
The big shame with this current problem is that Wilshere had severely finished last season after a separate ankle injury and then found his old momentum back during the preseason.
"This type of injury does not threaten the career," Wenger said.
It's a bone that didn't heal well.
This is not a big deal.
This was just an accident.
It was not related to his ankles or the injuries he had before.
This may be true from a purely medical point of view, but as Wenger also acknowledged, there is the associated risk of further injuries whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season.
It also develops an unpleasant pattern.
The investigation by Premier Injuries Ltd has recorded 23 different diseases of Wilshere since its debut six years ago.
He also played in only 65 of Arsenal's 157 league games in the last five seasons.
The broader picture for Arsenal is that in six out of eight seasons since 2007/08 they were one of the two Premier League clubs that have the most injury days to record.
Wenger accepts the potential of a devil’s circle, but Arsenal believes an improvement in injury rate will continue during the last season.
"Sometimes when you come back from an injury, you have a vulnerable period, a time when you need to strengthen your body and gain combat strength," Wenger said.
Jack is young enough to get over it.
I hope his body stabilizes, I’m confident he’ll do it and he’ll go through a career of the kind he deserves.
Arsenal starts their Champions League season on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb before the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tottenham Hotspur on Wednesday, and Wenger sets up a rotation within the team.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not travelled to Croatia, which means Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are expected to start.
Wenger can also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I'm trying to keep the balance and give the players who need it a little break," Wenger said.
Although Arsenal are clear favourites to move through Group F, the Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the playgrounds with the greatest intimidation effect in Europe.
Dynamo is also undefeated after 41 games after the "invincible" campaign was launched last season.
The stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday night, measuring 3.2 on the judges scale.
This year it was the 10th in Zagreb.
Wenger believes that Arsenal has drawn the lesson from last season with the Champions League capitulation against Monaco and remains driven by the distant hope of leading the club with its management to its first European Cup triumph.
"This drive is immense," Wenger said.
It has never worked at Arsenal.
We were very close to it in 2006, but on the other hand I’ve been in business long enough to be realistic.
We are ambitious, but we are not dreamers.
FriendsFest: The Comedy Show That Gives Us Serious Lessons About Men's Friendships
The lack of similar portrayals in shows is obvious, especially in terms of how the need for men to open up has now become even more desperate than ever before, as suicide rates among young men at a 15-year high prove.
In 2013, it was the leading cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in the UK, and it remains three times more common in men than in women.
In an effort to address the problem, the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) announced 2015 as the Year of the Man, with the goal of questioning the culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is at the heart of the struggle to overcome this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depressive symptoms found that if the sufferer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with a “healthy mood,” his chances of recovery doubled.
For those who are not depressed, a circle of mentally healthy friends halves the risks of mental problems.
But of course you have to have friends first so that a friendship can work.
In the age of social media-led communication, with its emphasis on style over substance, the immediateness of the response is often more important than meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong, cheerful and successful, even though in reality isolation dominates.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinsic values; money, image, social status, all at the expense of intrinsic values – our inner longing for personal development and friendship, which has a much deeper impact on our mental health.
And as a video game inventor and billionaire recently explained, money really can’t buy happiness.
The nice thing about Friends was that this focus was put on the head.
Each character was not defined by his work, but by his personality, which shone through the interaction as a friend.
The humour of Joey and Chandler’s frequent hugs, moments watching football in cozy armchairs, and Ross’s longing for Rachel—all of which came from knowing that men can definitely relate to it, even though they often refrain from fully exploring their feelings.
As an employee of the telephone psychiatry department explained to me:... "my listening role for people who feel depressed and at risk of suicide has really clearly shown me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference."
The men who contact us often feel unable to talk to friends.
The old saying “I can handle it” has a huge effect, like the feeling that it’s perceived as weakness when you talk openly about problems.”
Friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer longer-term coping mechanisms.
It clearly presents the small moments of men’s friendships.
As much as my objective outsider status over the phone may also help people in moments of despair, the long-term support comes from a personal network of family and friends.
And so, if you’re visiting this weekend’s Comedy Central FriendsFest with the completely redesigned backdrop to celebrate the day, why not take your friends out for a drink at the Central Perk.
Or, even better, if you see someone sitting around alone in Starbucks, give them a smile and say hello.
You never know what difference your friendship could make.
Friends will be broadcast on Comedy Central from beginning to end - the total of 236 episodes - for #FriendsFest
Di Maria meets to help PSG crush Malmö
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after his hit against Malmö.
Di Maria meets in his Champions League debut on Tuesday and helps PSG to pass Malmö.
Here is the game report and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani were on track when Paris Saint-Germain started their Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2-0 win against Malmö in the Prince Park Stadium on Tuesday.
Di Maria made his Champions League debut less than four minutes after starting as a PSG player who set the French champion on track, but afterwards they missed a number of opportunities before finally raising their lead when Cavani scored a header goal in the 61st minute.
With Real Madrid and Schachtjor Donezk also in Group A, Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish champion, as they are not only seeking qualification for the K.O. rounds, but an improvement on the way to the quarterfinals in each of the last three campaigns.
But while they got the points, it wasn't a class game of Laurent Blanc's team with Zlatan Ibrahimovic's missed opportunities in front of the goal. He was later replaced in the game against his hometown team and against the club with which he began his illustrious career as early as 1999.
"It's not easy to win at home or away in the Champions League, so it's a good start to win 2-0, causing our opponents problems and looking back relaxed, even if there are certain things that we still have to perfect over the course of the season," Blanc said.
"This is a good sign.
We wanted to win and we won, although I regret that we haven’t scored one or two more goals.”
After his injury, Ibrahimovic returned to the Paris team in one of three altercations, which was able to hold a 2–2 draw at home against Bordeaux in the First League over the weekend, but he was stabbed by Di Maria in the fourth minute.
The Argentine winger was described as the man who can take PSG to the next level in Europe when he was taken over by Manchester United last month, and he pointed out why, when he entered Marco Verratti’s pass behind the Malmö defense, he passed Johan Wiland beautifully into the long corner of the network.
However, if anyone believed that PSG would achieve a major victory, they were disappointed.
Malmö, who beat Celtic in a play-off to reach this level, joined Anpiff with nine national players on the field and was a heavy opponent with a five-man defense and two deep in the middle.
But except for a shot from Nikola Djurdjic, who passed Kevin Trapp’s posts far in the 34th minute, they offered little in the attack.
Instead, PSG itself sometimes gave up, with some bad passes and bad finishes, not least by Ibrahimovic, who, on no less than five attempts, was hit in the first half alone and then given up after Cavani had used him after the restart.
Nevertheless, he proved much more skill when he brought his teammates into the game, and it was a pass from Ibrahimovic that turned Di Maria into a shot, which was passed by Wiland in the 52nd minute at the pole ...
The second goal finally fell shortly after the hour mark thanks to Cavani, the Uruguayan scored his sixth season goal after Ibrahimovic caught a left flank of Maxwell.
This ended all thought that Malmö could get back into the game, and only an excellent intervention from Wiland from the shortest distance to stop David Luiz could keep the end result low before substitute player Ezequiel Lavezzi was denied a goal at the end.
Malmö coach Age Hareide later admitted that PSG was playing a class over his team, and the Norwegian said, "Our last Champions League game was in December last year.
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish league, which does not have the same level.
Qualifying games are not enough.”
Hats off to Paris!
It was a great game of them!
Glencore raises $2.5 billion through share sales
The Swiss-based mining giant Glencore, which is hit by falling commodity prices, raised $2.5 billion through a share sale as part of its huge debt repayment plan on Wednesday.
The London-based company Glencore said in a statement that it has sold new shares worth about <0xC2><0xA3>1.6 billion to pay off its own debts.
The company, which lost 57 percent of its market value this year, is struggling with falling commodity prices as China’s economic downturn pushes demand and has devastating effects on markets.
The issue of referral rights brought Glencore’s stock price to the top of the London Stock Exchange in early Wednesday morning trading.
The stock jumped 2.77% to 131.60 Pence on the FTSE 100 index, which opened 0.69% higher.
Glencore announced a $2.5 billion share sale last week as part of its broader plans to pay off about a third of its $30 billion debt.
The company sold the new shares at 125 pence per share, meaning a 2.4 percent discount on Tuesday’s closing price.
There were 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.99 percent of the group.
Concerns about long-term slow growth in China have cut iron ore prices by about half, coal, copper and other commodities prices have fallen by 20 to 40 percent.
Refugees arriving in Weimar
On Tuesday afternoon, 49 people reached the Weimar city administration after a mostly long flight.
The refugees come from Syria, Albania, Afghanistan, Macedonia and Somalia.
The youngest is a six-month-old girl from Syria.
The White House confirms Xi Jinping's visit to Washington
Chinese President Xi Jinping will make a state visit to the United States at the end of the month, the White House confirmed in a statement on Tuesday.
The visit, Xi’s first official in Washington, will take place on September 25 and will be in response to President Barack Obama’s trip to Beijing last November, the statement said.
U.S. President and First Lady Michelle Obama will also host Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan at a state dinner after the two leaders held bilateral talks.
“President Xi’s visit will provide an opportunity to expand U.S.-Chinese cooperation on a range of global, regional and bilateral issues of common interest, while also giving President Obama and President Xi the opportunity to constructively address areas of disagreement,” the statement adds.
XI, whose visit was initially announced in February, is expected to meet several U.S. technology leaders in Seattle on his way to Washington before continuing to New York City for the UN General Assembly in September.
Obama and Xi are expected to address a number of controversial issues, including Washington’s concerns regarding alleged cyber espionage by China and its growing self-confidence in the disputed waters of the South China Sea.
440 hp sports car borrowed and driven to rubbish
A 29-year-old wanted to make a dream come true and borrowed a Ford Mustang.
On the rainy highway then came the evil awakening.
At a company in Gotha you can fulfill your dream and once rent a V8 US sports car Ford Mustang Boss 302 with 440 hp and drive.
So did a 29-year-old from Gotha County.
On the A 71 near Arnstadt, the dream was then over and over.
The 29-year-old lost control of the sports car, crashed onto a wet road and drove into the dashboard.
The sports car suffered total damage, no one was injured.
The damage is estimated at EUR 40,000.
Xavi: Pep Guardiola prevented transfer to FC Bayern in 2008
World and European champion Xavi has been playing for al-Sadd Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
FC Bayern was apparently just ahead of the commitment of Spain's superstar Xavi, who played for FC Barcelona at the time.
Eight times Spanish Champion, three times Cup Winner, four times Champions League Winner, two times Club World Champion, two times European Champion, one time World Champion - Xavi's title list is breathtaking.
In the summer, the 35-year-old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and moved to al-Sadd Sport Club in Qatar.
However, in an interview with Marca, Xavi now reveals that he was already ahead of the 2008 World Cup before leaving Barcelona.
"I was told that Barça wanted to sell me."
“Madrid won everything at the time, we won nothing,” he says.
This was also recorded by FC Bayern.
Xavi: "There was an offer from Bayern."
"Rummenigge wanted me."
In the summer of 2008, Jürgen Klinsmann took over FC Bayern.
Guardiola was the reason that Xavi did not change
But the change did not happen.
And the decisive man for this is working today for the German record champion: Pep Guardiola.
Xavi explains why: "Barça has signed Guardiola and I played a great European Championship."
"Pep told me that I wouldn't change, that he couldn't imagine the team without me."
"That's how he got me."
Who knows how Bayern’s 2008/2009 season would have been with Xavi.
Xavi stood for Barca in the quarter-finals of the Champions League against the Bayern over the entire distance on the lawn, knocked out the reds (4:0, 1:1) and finally celebrated the king-class triumph.
Matt Damon plays down diversity in filmmaking
Matt Damon confronted African-American filmmaker Effie Brown during a discussion about diversity and said she would not be needed behind the scenes.
During an episode of HBO’s Sunday Night of Project Greenlight, the experienced actor interrupted Brown as it emphasized the need for alternative perspectives in relation to a black protagonist in the project’s chosen script.
“If we’re talking about diversity, then you do it in the cast of the film and not in the cast of the show,” Damon said.
Brown responded with shock, insulted disbelief, and shouted "Hoo! Wow. Okay", as the actor's comments of The Martian solidified.
Damon and Brown joined fellow producers Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers to discuss the show's finalists.
"I want to encourage people to think about how they treat the character of Harmony, whoever the director is going to be," Brown said.
The only black person, and she is a whore who is beaten by her white suitcase.
Dear White People's producer advocated for finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio for directorial rights to the film; Damon replied that their directorship "in the end could give us something we don't want."
After the discussion aired, social media exploded before disapproval over Damon’s comments.
Twitter user Mr Pooni expressed his anger at the clip, writing "Matt Damon is talking about the only black person in the room, so he can explain their diversity - it's SO WISH it hurts."
The tweet has earned more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes since its release.
Damon’s comments come at a time when accurate racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social discussion.
After teen Michael Brown was killed by a white police officer in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement achieved nationwide impact and urged lawmakers and authorities to ban discriminatory practices against color restraint.
In February, singer Prince made a reference to the movement during the Grammy Awards nominee albums of the year.
"Albums still matter," he said.
Like books and black lives, albums still have their meaning.
In recent times, leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement have published a statement in response to the question of the Fox News personality Elisabeth Hasselbeck whether the group should be considered a hate group.
“The network Black Lives Matter is a love group,” the leaders said.
Recently, it was announced that Damon was on a list of entertainers, producers and media moguls invited to visit the pope to discuss the depiction of the Catholic Church in the West.
Whether he accepted the invitation or has already met the Pope is unclear.
'American Ninja Warrior' crowns first champion
Professional sports climber and operator Isaac Caldiero became the first athlete to win the American Ninja Warrior on Monday night and take home the $1 million Grand Prix.
The competition show, which just finished its 7th season, had never experienced a contestant who could complete all stages of his obstacle course.
During the season finale, two men, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten, managed to reach the final.
The last task included climbing a 75-foot-long rope in 30 seconds.
Britten finished the task within time, making him the first athlete to complete the strenuous Phase 4 of American Ninja Warrior. However, Caldiero finished this challenge full three seconds faster, making him a winner.
Caldiero spoke to E!News after the hard-fought victory, still shocked by the win of the Grand Prix of $1 million.
“I mean, it’s amazing to think about it, I’ve never earned or had more than $10,000 to live,” Isaac E! said of his pile of money.
As suddenly .. as I can not even imagine what this is... the future is unknown.
Lead producer Kent Weed sat down with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the final and why Britten, although he was the first ever to finish the course, did not receive any prize money.
According to the rules, the money goes to the fastest person.
"If there is more than one finalist, it gets the one with the fastest time," Weed said.
How much money is a wonderful price and life-changing, he gets the great gratification.
I don’t think he has any resentment about it.
He's just so happy to have done what he did.
He received many awards from fans.
He's such a great guy and a family father.
He is a hero to his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me, "If I should be beaten by someone, then I'm glad it's Isaac."
And I think Isaac would have felt the same if they had switched roles.
America Ninja Warrior has been extended for an eighth season, shooting will begin in the spring of 2016.
Detroit Tigers sneak past Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS--The second half of the season was not particularly fun for the Detroit Tigers.
Once they were one of the best teams in baseball, today the Tigers are in last place in the American League Central.
The Tigers are reduced to their role as spoilers, but played this part perfectly against the Minnesota Twins with 5-4 in Target Field on Tuesday.
The twins wasted a chance to climb within a game-half of the Houston Astros for the second American League wildcard spot.
For Detroit, if only for an evening, it was a return of the three letter F word that was so hard to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season.
“All wins are fun, no matter how it comes,” said Tigers manager Brad Ausmus.
Tiger pitcher Alfredo Simon maintained his early offensive support when Detroit scored three times in the first two innings, then once in the sixth and then again in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) hit 6 times in the 1/3 innings and allowed three runs.
It was his third successful start in his last nine games.
"I want to end this year strongly," Simon said.
It’s hard to throw every game in the bullpen, and that’s why I want to focus on the game.
Designated tiger hitter Victor Martinez had three hits and was in two runs, his first RBIs since mid-August.
It was Martinez's first three-hit game since he had four hits against the Seattle Mariners on July 6.
"He swung the batter well," Ausmus said.
He looked good in the (stroke training), he looked much better in the bullpen, and he brought it right into the game.
With three runs in the backstroke at the end of the seventh inning, the twins had their best chance to get back into the game.
Center Fielder Byron Buxton finished the inning with a double on the left field line.
Right Fielder Aaron Hicks reached a bunt, and Simon brought his second baseman Brian Dozier to the strikeout before being replaced by left-hander Blaine Hardy.
Hardy overtook Mauer, the only man he faced, in front of designated rookie striker Miguel Sano, who scored a two-run for right-hander Drew Verhagen.
With a pair of runners and the finish run in the second, Verhagen brought third baseman Trevor Plouffe to a double play.
It was the 27th time in the Major League this season that Plouffe hit a double play.
After Detroit added an insurance run at the end of the ninth inning, Wall created an RBI double against Tigers closer Bruce Rondon, scoring 5-4.
However, the right-hander outscored Sano in three pitches for his fifth save.
Detroit benefited from an immobile Phil Hughes at the start of the game.
The Tigers scored three runs in the first two innings against the right-handed veteran, who had been eliminated from the injured list before the game after missing for more than a month due to a back injury.
"Obviously not the start I wanted," Hughes said, "but I felt more comfortable when I started and felt like I was going to make some pretty good pitches there in the third inning."
After receiving the Leadoff batter in the first, Hushes released a single to Second Baseman Ian Kinsler.
A two-out walk for J.D. Martinez brought Victor Martinez into the game, who created a single "up the middle" on the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez made his 0-21 success series with the runners in the scoring position.
Third baseman Nick Castellanos followed with a single on the right, making another run, but Victor Martinez was thrown out of the game as he tried to get to third, ending the threat.
The Tigers added in the second, scoring a one-out double by Catcher James McCann and a two-out single by Center Fielder Anthony Gose to 3-0.
"It was a big hit," said Twins manager Paul Molitor.
He didn't hit very well, but he got the right spot.
Hughes was in a pitch count, scoring no points in the third inning before being replaced by the right-hander A.J.Achter.
Hughes had three runs with six hits and a walk with four strikeouts.
REMARKS: Tigers RHP Anibal Sanchez retired due to a throwing shoulder injury.
He is being examined by Dr. James Andrews, who operated on the shoulder of Sanchez in 2007.
Sanchez, who has been on the injured list since mid-August due to a shoulder strain, is set to be activated for the start on Wednesday.
With Sanchez out of the game, LHP Daniel Morris is removed from the injured list to start against the Twins.
Norris 1-1 in four starts with the Tigers since he was acquired in exchange with LHP David Price on July 30
He has been missing since August 20 due to a dislocation in the right hip joint.
The Tigers and Twins will finish their three-game series at Target Field on Wednesday
Norris (2-2,4.43 ERA) will play against Minnesota RHP Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73)
Hundreds of refugees to be accommodated in Wiesbaden
A train with hundreds of refugees is on its way to Hesse.
His arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday.
The people who arrived will then be accommodated in emergency accommodations in Wiesbaden, as the city of Wiesbaden announced on Tuesday evening.
It expects 450 to 750 refugees to arrive.
Several sports halls of the Hessian state capital had been prepared in recent days for this case.
Up to 1,000 refugees can stay there temporarily.
They will then be distributed to other municipalities.
In the last ten days alone, 7,500 people had arrived in Hesse, according to the Government Presidency responsible for the first reception.
Due to the large number of refugees, Frankfurt and Hanau have also set up emergency accommodation in sports halls.
Ischinger: German military action in Syria an option
The head of the Munich Security Conference, Wolfgang Ischinger, considers military measures with German involvement in Syria as an opportunity.
"I believe that the decisive reflection on military action options must not take place without Germany," he said.
He accused the European states of "collectively looking out."
Four years ago, one was glad that the cup had passed a military involvement in Germany.
"Now the conflict lands crashing at our doorstep," he told German radio.
The former German ambassador to Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid on the ground for the refugees.
Austria controls southern and eastern borders
After Germany, Austria has also reintroduced controls on its southern and eastern borders.
Austrian Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner told the Austrian television station ORF on Tuesday evening that no one would be sent back to Hungary.
Germany has not sent any refugees back to Austria.
"No, that's agreed," she explained.
Asked about an agreement that would allow Germany to accommodate a certain number of refugees from Austria per day, Mikl-Leitner said there had already been talks between the Director-General for Public Security and representatives of Germany.
She did not mention concrete figures and referred to talks on Wednesday in Berlin.
In recent days, tens of thousands of refugees have come to Austria via the so-called Balkan route from Hungary.
Their target is mostly Germany.
Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and her Austrian counterpart Werner Faymann, together with several other EU heads of state and government, requested a special summit for next week.
Germany had begun temporary border controls on Sunday.
So far, the EU countries have not been able to agree on a common approach in the crisis.
The EU Interior Ministers want to take a new approach to the mandatory distribution of another 120,000 refugees at a special meeting on Tuesday (September 22nd).
In view of the strong refugee situation in Germany, the Federation wants to support the countries more in the initial reception and distribution of people.
The federal government will manage this jointly with the countries, Merkel announced late Tuesday evening after nearly four hours of discussions with the prime ministers at the Chancellery in Berlin.
Merkel stressed that those people who needed protection would get it, too.
But those who do not have a stay-at-home perspective cannot stay in Germany either.
This view was strongly shared in the round.
The chancellor stressed that the state as a whole now has to cope with a "huge force effort".
Thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan route.
Hungary closed its 175-kilometer-long border with Serbia on Tuesday night.
A few hours later, the government in Budapest announced that it would also block the border with Romania with a fence.
This neighbouring country is part of the EU, unlike Serbia.
Hungary wants to prevent smugglers looking for escape routes over Romania, Hungary's Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said on the planned new border fence.
The Romanian government condemned the plan immediately.
There were first arrests of people who had cut through the fence.
In Turkey, thousands of other migrants were on their way to the Greek border, according to eyewitness reports.
Cassini spacecraft finds ocean on Saturn's moon Enceladus
Under the ice sheet of Saturn’s moon Enceladus, a global ocean floats.
This is the conclusion of researchers from observations of the space probe Cassini.
Thus, the moon wanders easily on its orbit around the ring planet.
This dim motion is only small, but still too large for a permanently fixed celestial body, according to a statement from Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, on Tuesday.
The researchers present their analyses in the journal "Icarus".
It has long been known that there must be liquid water under the ice sheet of Enceladus.
As early as 2006, Cassini had discovered ice volcanoes at the south pole of Saturn's moon, spying on water vapor and ice particles, thus feeding the so-called E-ring of Saturn.
At least at the South Pole there must be an underground sea, the astronomers closed at the time.
The extent of the hidden ocean, however, has not been clarified.
Rama is missing Munich for several weeks in 1860
The 1860 Munich had to renounce offensive agent Valdet Rama for about a month.
An investigation has resulted in an adductor injury in the 27-year-old, the association said.
Rama had already complained of pain earlier this week.
According to Münchner Löwen, the diagnosis means "expected four weeks of compulsory pause".
"It's hard for us, Rama is a loss."
"Of course, we need to think now," sports director Necat Aygün told the "Bild" newspaper regarding the possible commitment of an unified professional.
As a training guest, however, the sixties initially presented a defensive man.
The 30-year-old Hrvoje Cale was last active in Belgium and was previously under contract with VfL Wolfsburg.
Croatia currently has “the opportunity to prove its ability”.
Goalkeeper Rubin Okotie can return to team training next week after his concussion.
Already on Thursday, the Austrian national player is expected to enter running training.
Okotie had injured his head in the match at Fortuna Düsseldorf (0:3).
Despite his initial fears, he was left without a serious injury.
No Diet Fruit - Mangos contain a lot of sugar
Mangos are exotic and juicy-sweet.
But those who want to pay attention to its slim line are often advised against it.
Mangos contain a relatively high amount of sugar, especially sucrose.
The exotic fruits are healthy nonetheless: they contain B vitamins as well as vitamins E and C. Above all, mangoes contain a lot of vitamin A and its precursor beta-carotene.
Thus, those who eat the fruits support vision, immune system and metabolic processes in the body.
When buying mangoes should not be too soft or too firm and smell pleasant.
The shell color alone does not say anything about how ripe the fruit is - so green mangoes can also taste very tasty.
They should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days.
Then, of course, they taste pure or in sweet dishes.
But a mango also gives hearty dishes a special touch.
It softens the slightly bitter taste of some leafy salads such as Chicoree and Radiccio.
And a mangochutney fits well with fish, poultry, lamb and wild.
The US parcel service UPS is releasing up to 95,000 donations for the Christmas business in the US.
The company has already started recruiting seasonal workers, UPS said on Tuesday.
Drivers are mainly wanted.
Already last year, UPS had increased its workforce for the holiday season by 95,000 subsidies.
Given the booming online business, UPS and its competitor FedEx have been making arrangements for the Christmas business since last year.
In 2013, delayed deliveries brought harsh criticism to parcel services.
First a hairstorm, then a striking cold front
In the coming night, the hair dryer breaks through in the valleys of the Alpine north side, as Meteoschweiz announced on Tuesday.
On Wednesday and in the night to Thursday the hair dryer blows partly with storm power through the hair dryer valleys.
After drying out on Thursday morning, we will have a marked cold front that will bring heavy rain, gusts of wind and a drop in temperature.
As MeteoNews writes in a statement, Switzerland is currently at the forefront of an extensive low-pressure area over the British Isles in a strong southwestern current.
On the northern side of the Alps, the hair dryer breaks through the valleys at night to Wednesday.
As a result, until Thursday morning, the hair dryer blows in the hair dryer valleys with bows from 60 to 100 km/h, occasionally and especially in the Urnerland partly with more than 100 km/h.
The hair dryer can sometimes penetrate into the adjoining Middleland, and on the mountains, even hurricane booms of over 120 km/h are possible.
While in the north on Wednesday stormy hair dryer ensures summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees, the humidity on the Alpine south slope begins to stagnate.
It will be rainy until Thursday night.
In total, more than 100 litres of rain per square meter must be expected in the south of the Alps in the next 48 hours, after large amounts of rain have already fallen in the last few days.
On Thursday morning, the hair dryer runs out of air, followed by a cold front with strong, partially permeated rain from west to east over Switzerland.
Along with the cold front, the wind is cooling strongly to stormy, and the temperatures are decreasing significantly.
The following days present themselves in the north in autumn with 15 to 20 degrees, while in the south it will be sunnyer and warmer at the weekend with up to 25 degrees.
Rome now has a Martin-Luther-Place
Almost 500 years after the Reformation, there is now a Martin Luther Square in Rome.
In the presence of city president Ignazio Marino, a previously unnamed square in the park on Oppio Hill was named after the German reformer on Wednesday.
At the "Piazza Martin Luther" he is now recognized as the "German theologian of the Reformation".
The park is located in the middle of ancient Rome right next to the Colosseum.
The naming had been requested by the working community of the Protestant Churches in Rome.
Jens-Martin Kruse, pastor of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Rome, recalled on Wednesday that the Protestants in the city of the popes for centuries as a minority often could only live their faith in secret.
The square symbolically shows that their tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome.
Martin Luther (1483-1546) spent several months in Rome as a young Augustinian monk around the turn of the year 1510/11.
He felt the city at that time as a depraved sin-baby.
His negative impressions may have strengthened him in the view of historians in his later struggle against Rome.
Luther had then initiated the division of the Western Church with his theses against the decommissioning trade.
Hammer artist invested three years in personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the (golden) thorn crown is one of the main works that Otmar Alt painted for his Bible.
Klaus Altepost wrote the introduction and updated Bible texts.
In the beginning was the word?
No, not with the Otmar Old Bible, which has now appeared with magnificent images.
In the beginning was the image for Otmar Alt, who in 150 motifs has formulated his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas.
His "language" with colorful colors and imaginative shapes has been given to the 75-year-old - which is by no means synonymous with "fun" pictures.
On the contrary: adapted to the respective topics, this may seem quite dark.
For about three years Otmar Alt has been working on his Bible project, for which he has made a subjective-artistic selection from the many themes of the "Book of All Books".
Cycles have emerged that deal with topics such as the way of the cross, plagues, commandments or Our Fathers.
This has spontaneously fascinated several partners: this applies to the Luther-Verlag with its theological focus as well as to the Kettler-Verlag with its focus on art books.
And there is above all the author Klaus Altepost, who has dealt with the respective biblical passages on the basis of the painting.
He interpreted the Bible passages selected by Otmar Alt and thus "translated" into today's contexts.
These texts are like verbal mirrors of Alts painting.
They are embedded between the original biblical quotation of Martin Luther and a sentence by the artist, who here formulates his very personal thoughts on the particular situation.
The jewelry tape has golden letters.
Thus, the 75-year-old allows double a deep insight into his soul, his emotions.
This is a high level of intimacy.
Emotions were ultimately triggers for the Bible project: Otmar Alt, born in Wernigerode in 1940 and raised in Berlin, comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant Lord Huter Order.
"Education has already happened with the cane," recalls Otmar Alt.
"I've tried to work that out, maybe to get back to the Lord's Father."
His second concern was to restore the importance of art in a fast-paced time: "The perception of visual worlds is today shaped by advertising, and that is loud.
Symbolism is suppressed.
Artists have a different desire and desire to show things.
Pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative.
"In this respect I am a dinosaur".
Otmar Alt wants the viewers to "fall into" the images, let them act on themselves, discover and feel what power they have: "The image seeks its opposite".
Klaus Altepost confessed on Tuesday at the presentation of the Otmar-Alt-Bibel in the Otmar-Alt-Stiftung, "already" being a lover of Otmar Alt's art: "I like how he understands life with his pictures".
Old had not taken care to fully grasp the Bible, but had chosen the topics that were important to him, including mysterious ones.
"This was not a collaboration at eye level," says Altepost: "This is about the pictures, the text only explains."
For Hans Möhler from Luther-Verlag, this work is an invitation to "deepen your life and find freedom".
Otmar Alt’s pictures speak for Möhler both the (biblical) language of love and that of responsibility.
Part of the originals - paper and canvas paintings - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition that will open on November 15 at the Otmar-Alt-Stiftung.
Construction start for BMX tracks close
Plans made, place found, company commissioned, earth hill modeled for a round course: a year later almost everything was finished - but before the official opening of the BMX track, it was finished again.
Failures in politics and administration caused discontent, especially among the locals, who did not want to tolerate the railroad.
So hills displaced, looking for new place - now with formal planning and application for building permits.
The approval will be granted in October, the First Municipal Councillor Sabine Mosebach-Bock could now announce in the Committee on Children and Youth.
"I hope that something visible will happen this year," she said.
It should then be started with the work on the former indoor swimming pool without a "further memorial break".
DFB Intensifies Engagement for Refugees
The DFB is expanding its commitment to refugees until 2019, and the Bundesliga is setting a clear mark on the weekend.
Football responds to the growing situation in Germany and assures politics of its help in tackling the problems ahead.
"I think this is the biggest challenge our country has faced since reunification."
"In principle, no one can say that it's none of my business, I have nothing to do with it."
"It must be in everyone's interest to get this issue under control," said DFB head Wolfgang Niersbach.
At the annual meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin on September 23, he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively.
"I will be in the Chancellor's office next Wednesday and will meet the Minister of State Ms. <0xC3><0x96>zo<0xC4><0x9F>uz and the Chancellor there."
“The issue will certainly play a central role,” he announced.
Soccer can and will help.
But the policy must take the decisive steps.
The German Football Federation has therefore extended its refugee initiative "1:0 for a welcome" by four years.
"As regards the Egidius Brown Foundation, we have ensured that this programme continues until 2019," Niersbach said on the sidelines of the UEFA conference in St. Julian's/Malta.
A number of federal officials also support this program.
Already this weekend, the 36 professionals will put a clear sign when they will wear the words "We help - #refugeeswelcome" on the left sleeve instead of the usual sponsor logo (hermes).
"We also want to make it clear that everyone should help, where and how they can," said Rudi Völler, Leverkusen's sports director, to the "Bild" newspaper (Tuesday), describing the project as "self-evident".
"The refugee drama affects everyone, no one should look away."
"We football leaguers can, no, we must use our radiance, our influence and our opportunities to help the many refugees who have already suffered so incredibly," Hertha manager Michael Preetz said.
Hoffenheim's CEO Peter Rettig spoke of a "prominent sign of the league".
To the European Qualifiers against Hungary on Friday, the women’s national team invites 100 refugees to Halle/Saale.
Niersbach described the support of refugees as "a great community work of German football".
That all 36 licensing clubs have started their own projects in their places is great.
Equally great is that small and small clubs are active there.
The message "1:0 for a welcome" that we have issued is lived in football.
"This is of enormous importance," he said.
This year and next year, the association, together with the DFB Selection and the Federal Government, will each provide 300,000 euros for the integration of refugees.
"The clubs have already collected the entire sum for 2015," Niersbach said.
Reports: SAP CEO loses an eye in an accident
The CEO of Europe’s largest software company, Bill McDermott, reportedly lost his left eye in a fall in early July.
In the accident on the stairs in his brother's house in the United States, he fell on a glass of water he had worn in his left hand after midnight, the "Economic Week" reports on Wednesday.
"He's almost bleeding, was powerless, then dragged himself out to the street - that's what he told us last week," SAP co-founder Hasso Plattner said.
McDermott could do his job.
"In early October, we will meet before the Supervisory Board meeting in Walldorf," Plattner said.
The 54-year-old manager was present at the meeting and "fully able to work".
McDermott announced in an interview with the "Süddeutsche Zeitung" (Thursday edition) that he would return to Germany in October and continue to lead the software group.
"I'm full for SAP, full in my job."
"Of course, I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Hasso Plattner all the time," McDermott told SZ.
McDermott usually commutes between Germany and the United States, but since the summer he was no longer at the German SAP headquarters in Walldorf.
It was important for him to go public with such a personal story, the manager of the "SZ" said: "Something like this can happen to anyone."
"It's important to get back up when you've fallen."
McLaren replacement pilot Magnussen except battle ...
Magnussen tweeted a corresponding photo, stating that he suffered the injury when he fell off the wheel.
He is therefore no more a reserve driver for the two regular drivers Fernando Alonso and Jenson Button at the weekend night race in Singapore than he was a week later at the Grand Prix of Japan.
Football: BVB without giants against Krasnodar: pasture fields in goal
At Borussia Dortmund, all hopes for a comeback of Marco Reus in the first group game of the Europa League have finally been shattered.
The national player will also miss the leader of the Bundesliga in the match with FK Krasnodar on Thursday (19.00 am/Sky).
"Unfortunately, we cannot have recourse to him," Thomas Tuchel said on Wednesday.
Whether Reus will be back in the Bundesliga top game against Leverkusen on Sunday, the BVB coach left open: "We expect a return of him to training on Friday".
Given the high load of its professionals, Tuchel will not only change his stock on the Reus position.
So he announced a change in the goalkeeper position.
That is why Roman Weidenfeller takes the place of Stammkeeper Roman Bürki.
"He's training at an absolute top level," the football teacher praised the world champion.
However, Tuchel left open whether Weidenfels will be used in all Europa League games in the future.
It is very likely that he will also contest the second game.
The research statement by fellow player Reus that the final draw for the BVB in the Europa League must be the goal, thinks midfielder Julian Weigl understandable: "This is not so wrong Marco."
"I think we have a good chance of winning the title."
Robotic cars: government wants to be a pioneer for Germany
According to the Federal Government, Germany should be a technological pioneer in the change of the car.
On Wednesday, the Federal Cabinet adopted a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU), which provides for investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure, among other things.
Dobrindt spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the edge of the Automesse IAA of a "new mobility era".
Automated and connected driving will increase road safety and reduce traffic congestion, Dobrindt said.
He also wants to discuss the issue with his G7 counterparts, who also meet with representatives of the industry at the IAA.
The strategy paper of the Ministry of Transport emphasizes, among other things, the importance of mobile broadband expansion and a rapid transition to digital radio.
To test new technology, a test track is currently being created on the highway 9 in Bavaria.
In order for the driver to be "no additional liability risks" the federal government wants to "review the legal framework conditions and, where necessary, adapt to the new developments".
For example, Germany wants to work internationally to increase the maximum permissible speed for self-driving cars from 10 to 130 kilometres per hour.
The federal government also wants to advocate for an amendment to the Vienna Convention, which so far only provides for people as drivers.
With automated driving, the car increasingly takes over the lead, the driver becomes more and more the passenger.
The technology is primarily based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process the data in seconds.
According to a study presented by the Ministry of Economy, highly automated driving on motorways will be technically possible by 2020.
However, driverless vehicles on public roads are “only to be expected far beyond 2020.”
The value added in the field of driver assistance systems and highly automated driving functions at the location in Germany is estimated by the authors of the study to be around 8.4 billion euros for 2025.
"Digital networking of cars can lead to more safety and efficiency in road traffic," said SPD traffic politician Sören Bartol.
However, the question of liability in the event of accidents and the security of personal data of drivers must be clearly clarified.
However, Germans still see self-driving cars skeptical – much more than French or Americans.
A survey by the Forsa Institute on behalf of the testing organisation Dekra, presented on Wednesday at the AA, concludes that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous cars will prevail in the next ten years, 32 percent do not expect it until 20 years, 31 percent do not believe it at all.
In France, 21 percent of respondents expect autonomous cars by 2025, while in the US, 33 percent expect autonomous cars.
After all, drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely completely on a self-driving vehicle.
According to a survey by the digital association Bitkom, only seven percent would agree to give up control throughout the ride on all roads.
On the highway, this could be imagined in the flowing traffic at least 15 percent, in the congestion 45 percent.
One in four people would not leave the car under any circumstances.
Boll cancels team and double start at table tennis championship
According to the current status of the title fights from September 25th to October 4th, the Düsseldorfer wants to strike only individually.
The final decision is expected to be taken no later than September 22.
“This is a huge loss for our team.”
"The boys found out in the morning."
"But we are strong enough to win the title even without Timo," said Bundestrainer Jörg Roßkopf during the European Training Course in Düsseldorf.
Boll was on the flight at that time to a long-term sponsorship appointment in China.
The 34-year-old German champion is expected to return on Friday.
"Without Timo, we are no longer such a clear favourite," said European singles champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov.
The Hamelner, who leads the setlist in Yekaterinburg, also reminded me of the 2013 European Championship in Schwechat.
"At that time, Timo was missing too, and we became European champions."
"That's what we should focus on," the World Rankings Fifth explained.
English national footballer Luke Shaw of Manchester United has suffered a serious injury in his right leg.
In the Champions League match at PSV Eindhoven, the defender was hit in a tackle by Héctor Moreno and replaced after a long treatment.
The first diagnosis indicated a fracture in the 20-year-old co-star of Bastian Schweinsteiger.
Gaultier feels too old for a terrible child
It’s a mix of a very big fashion show and a wax-figure horror cabinet: Designer Jean Paul Gaultier (63) presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich.
The highlights: showcase dolls that look terrifyingly human thanks to video projections.
They carry the spectacular creations of the French designer who, among other things, became the big star of the fashion scene with Madonna's stage outfits - and with him putting men in skirts.
“I can’t say today that I’m the enfant terrible of haute couture because I have white hair.”
"It used to be bleached, but now it's real," Gaultier said.
For visitors to the exhibition "From The Sidewalk To The Catwalk", which will be on display in the Hypo Cultural Foundation's Art Hall from September 18, it is a good thing that the fashion designer has changed his initially reluctant attitude to a look over his person.
In fact, he was against it, because: "For me, an exhibition sounded a little bit like death," he said.
When you die, you enter the museum.
The impressive collection had already been made in Montreal, Canada, and in Paris Station.
“It’s about so much more than just beautiful dresses,” said the director of the Kunsthalle, Roger Diederen.
It is about tolerance, acceptance and the vision of an open society.
The exhibits give an insight into the hardly yet overlookable work of the man who wrote fashion history without ever having completed an education.
Chronologically, the show is not built up, but it is an excellently choreographed overall work of art, for which a lot of effort was made: for example, a stylist was specifically hired to shave the dolls.
14 tons of material have been transported to Munich, according to curator Thierry-Maxime Loriot.
Shortly before the start of the Oktoberfest there was a special charm: a leather trousers outfit with a corset.
Heidi meets Madonna.
He has always been interested in strong women (“women are smarter than men”) and in people who are a bit different, Gaultier said.
Gaultier’s old Teddy is also featured in the exhibition.
It stands for the designer’s first, sloppy fashion walk attempts.
As a child (he was not a good student and bad at football) he put on his teddy bra and dresses, Gaultier said.
To play with a doll, his parents wouldn't have let him.
He later taught himself to design fashion.
He stole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers, as Gaultier told in Munich.
I bought them later, of course.
For his first fashion show, he could not pay the models.
They didn't get anything, but they were allowed to keep the clothes.
Jewelry instead of curtain - Plauener lace as a fashion niche
In the past, the long embroidery machines used to be in and around plauen about making meters.
The embroidered fabrics and lace were created in large quantities for customers, who, for example, processed them into blankets and curtains.
That alone no longer works today, explains Andreas Reinhardt, Managing Director of the Fashion Spitze Plauen.
Instead, fashion is important again.
In the early days of the Plauener Spitze, fashion played a larger role, was then displaced by the home textile industry - and is now rediscovered as a niche.
Reinhardt cites some examples: lace in jewelry, accessories such as bags and regional outfits.
In general, the so-called vintage fashion, which relies on past style epochs, creates an increasing order potential.
Those who do not serve niches in the textile industry in Germany are no longer on the market.
With us, they already make up half of all orders.
Modespitze Plauen is, together with nine other companies, a member of the industry association Plauener Spitze und Embroidery.
Only they are allowed to carry the protected label.
In the last 15 years, about 80 percent of sales have broken down.
Private specialist shops and also wholesale there is almost no more.
Our products hardly reach customers in this way.
The bulk goods are nowadays manufactured in Asia much cheaper and distributed almost exclusively via chains.
In addition, exports, currently to Russia and the United States, are weakening.
There are plenty of reasons for new ways.
The industry association also tries to score through environmental awareness, as Cordula Bauer from the Stickperle in Falkenstein explains: "Since this year, we have been carrying a quality seal that shows that we produce ecologically and socially sustainable".
Reinhardt adds: "This also applies to the materials used."
Diploma designer Ute Schmidt teaches at the Schneeberger Outskirts of the West Saxon University of Zwickau - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and specializes in embroidery and lace.
In order to counter the competition from the Asian region, you need to find high-quality and innovative products.
It takes time and courage.
There is a tension between the freshest ideas of the designers and the companies that need to think economically,” says Schmidt.
Therefore, an existing design is often only slightly varied to maintain a customer base.
A few years ago, textile designer Kati Reuter revived the historic snowball peak.
In some places, the machine stitches small balls.
The Plauen goldsmith champion Bianca Hallebach-Krausse was inspired by this: "Before I could not begin anything with traditional Plauen lace".
Now she uses the snowball tip for her jewelry.
In an elaborate process, she embosses the pattern in silver.
"Many people in the region identify with the topic of Plauener Spitze - young and old," says Reuters.
It also delivers to the USA, Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in Plauen and surroundings and who want a souvenir.
So I see my jewelry as a modern ambassador of the Plauen Spitze.
Disney Announces New ‘Mary Poppins’ Movie
Legends should not be touched, but Disney still dares to make a new film of his classic "Mary Poppins".
According to Entertainment Weekly, however, it is not about a new film, but about a kind of sequel that plays with the magical nanny 20 years after the first film.
It is about the experiences of the nanny with the Banks family in times of the global economic crisis in England.
Who plays Poppins more than 50 years after Julie Andrews is still unclear.
But the director is already firm: Rob Marshall, last with "Into the Woods" in the cinema.
Xi urges to open the economy wider to the world
The economy needs to open up more broadly to the outside world to drive growth, President Xi Jinping said on Tuesday of a group tasked with leading the reform.
"China should be committed to attracting foreign investment and know-how and improving business start-up strategies," he said in a speech at the 16th meeting of the Central Leadership Group to deepen a comprehensive reform.
Fostering new start-ups and advancing reforms will bring new momentum and vitality and provide new space for economic growth, Xi said.
The leadership has adopted a number of guidelines, including a negative list on regulating market access, relaxing border control policies, promoting state-owned enterprises (SOEs), incorporating private capital, and overhauling the resident reporting system.
After the statement, a negative list is created that identifies sectors and companies that are not eligible for investment.
The system is gradually tested and improved by testing programs.
The initiative is important because it assigns a greater role to the market in allocating resources, ensures a rule of law business environment and makes the market more open, the statement said.
The government will also loosen controls over the powers delegated to companies and ensure that companies decide how to conduct their business.
The statement also said that China will allow border regions to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
As part of an offer to open state-controlled sectors, additional areas for private investment will be opened.
"The government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign-funded companies and provide better services to them," the statement said.
In addition, it will make it easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the "Green Card" by optimizing the requirements and facilitating the application process.
The right of lawyers to guarantee the exercise of their duties and to employ professional judges and public prosecutors was also discussed at a meeting.
The meeting was also attended by Prime Minister Li Keqiang and key leaders such as Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, as reported in a statement released after the meeting.
EU aims to double mercury limit in predatory fishery
The European Commission aims to double the limit values for mercury in large predatory fish, thereby giving consumers a significantly higher dose of the nerve agent.
The consumer organisation Foodwatch, which has a corresponding EU working paper, sharply criticised the plans: "The risks and side effects of failed industrial and environmental policies are being passed on with full force to pregnant women and toddlers," explained Matthias Wolfschmidt of Foodwatch.
According to Wolfschmidt, the limit values of the neurotoxicity for large fish at the end of the food chain, such as shark or swordfish, should be raised from one to two milligrams of mercury per kilogram of fish for "economic reasons".
However, large predatory fish are already so heavily charged with mercury that about 50 percent of the catches are not allowed to be sold on the basis of the limit values still in force.
After doubling the limit values, only 14.5 percent would be unselling.
In return for this relaxation, the EU wants to tighten the limit values for other fish from currently 0.5 milligrams to 0.1 milligrams of mercury per kilogram.
Foodwatch called this a “trick” because smaller fried fish, such as carp, are usually so low-loaded that they already meet the planned maximums today.
The reduction in small fish is therefore "a perfidious diversion maneuver that alone helps the economy," Wolfschmidt explained.
Mercury is a heavy metal that is highly toxic to humans and is highly enriched throughout the food chain, especially in predatory fish.
The federal government therefore warns that "already small amounts can cause damage to the nervous system, especially in the case of unborn babies".
However, the Federal Ministry of Environment states on its homepage with regard to the current maximum values that a "health hazard to the general population" is not to be expected.
Mercury enters the environment mainly through the burning of coal.
German coal-fired power plants emit more than six tons of mercury per year, two-thirds of the total amount emitted in Germany, according to a written information from the Federal Ministry of Environment to Greens-Bundestagsabgeordnete Annalena Baerbock.
The concentration of mercury in fish such as in the Elbe, the Rhine and the Danube was "permanently and extensively exceeded," the "mirror" had quoted from the paper in March.
Last year, Europe-wide mercury warnings in fish were already among the most frequently reported health risks in the EU’s RASFF warning system.
