Members of the Welsh Assembly are urged to "take them for puppets"
Consternation among some of the members of the Assembly, currently referred to as AM, over the suggestion that they should change their name to MWP (Member of the Parliament of Wales).
The debate arose because of plans to change the name of the assembly to the Parliament of Wales.
Members of the Assembly of the whole panorama fear being ridiculed.
A Labour Party member said his group was concerned that the new name "ride with Twp and Pwp".
For those who do not know Welsh, "twp" means "parvo" and "pwp" means "caca".
A member of the Plaid Cymru party said the group was "unhappy" and suggested alternatives.
A Welsh conservative said his group kept an "open mind" about the name change, but pointed out that from MWP to Muppet there is only a small verbal leap.
In this context, the letter "w" in Welsh is pronounced similarly to the Yorkshire English pronunciation of the letter "u".
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce the name changes, stated: "Of course, the final decision on any descriptor of the members of the Assembly will depend on the members themselves."
The Welsh Government Act of 2017 granted the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation conducted on these proposals which showed strong support for the designation of Parliament of Wales.
Regarding the issue of the title of AM, the committee preferred members of the Welsh Parliament or WMP, but the MWP option received a majority of support in a public consultation.
The AMs seem to be suggesting alternatives, but the struggle to reach consensus could result in a headache for the president, Elin Jones, who is expected to deliver the bill on changes in a few weeks.
The reform law will include other changes in the functioning of the assembly, such as the rules of disqualification of the MPs and the design of the committee system.
The MPs will get the final vote on what they should be called when they debate the legislation.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change the country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday if they change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular vote will decide to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that its northern neighbor’s name represents a claim to its territory and has repeatedly opposed its requests to join the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the name change in the referendum, said he would ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is no longer the price to pay to join the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin remain silent as the churches of Harlem continue to fight
“The elders I spoke with said that before there was a bar and a church in every corner,” Mr. Adams said.
“Today, not one thing or the other.”
He said he could see the bars were gone.
“People are socializing in other ways,” he said.
“The bars are no longer the living rooms of the neighborhoods that people usually go to.”
As for churches, he fears that asset sales money won’t last as long as leaders expect, and “sooner or later they’ll get back to where they started.”
He added that churches could be replaced by apartment buildings with communities of owners filled with the kind of people that would not help the neighborhoods remain sanctuaries.
“The vast majority of people who will buy the apartments of these buildings will be white,” he declared, “and therefore they will speed up the closure of all these churches, because it is unlikely that the new owners will become members of those churches.”
The two churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis, metropolitan community in 1870, St. Martin a decade later.
The original White Methodist congregation moved in the 1930s.
A nearby black congregation was built with the building.
St. Martin was occupied by a black congregation headed by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of stores on 125th Street, a Harlem shopping street that resisted hiring and ascending black people.
A fire in 1939 left the building very damaged, but as Father Johnson's parishioners made plans to rebuild it, they commissioned the carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and his successor in St. Martin, proudly named the carillon "the bells of the poor".
The expert who played the carillon in July called it another way: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan also noted that it was the first carillon in the world played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who replaced it with the larger carillon of the Riverside church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said no one took his place in St. Martin.
Those who have occupied St. Martin for the past few months are a group of architects and contractors, some led by the secular leaders of the church and others by the episcopal diocese.
The parish council, the organ that governs the parish and which is composed of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July showing his concern that the latter "desires to affect the costs" to the council, although the latter had not participated in the recruitment of the architects and contractors that he sent to the diocese.
Some bishops have complained of a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
A shark hurts a boy while fishing for lobster in California
Police said a shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while practicing underwater fishing in search of lobsters in California on the first day of the crustacean season.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy asking for help screaming, at which time he swam with a group of people to help him get out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was only excitement to catch a lobster, but that he soon realized that he was yelling, "They got me!
They beat me!"
Hammel said he noticed it when he got to the boy.
“Everyone who came out of the water said, ‘There’s a shark in the water!’”
The boy was transported by helicopter to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is admitted in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
The rescuer, Captain Larry Giles, said in a press conference that they had spotted a shark in the area a few weeks ago, but that they had determined that it was not a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the upper part of the torso.
Officials closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach, in Casablad, to Swami's, in Ecinitas, for 48 hours to undertake an investigation and also for safety reasons.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but that most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's is competing with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with beauty runners similar to those of the large warehouses full of specialist assistants.
As part of the significant <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion immersion in the UK beauty market, which continues to grow as fashion and home products sales fall, the biggest beauty runners will be put to the test in 11 stores across the country, and then switch to other stores next year if they succeed.
The investment in beauty comes at a time when supermarkets are looking to fill the shelves that once occupied televisions, microwaves and household products.
Sainsbury's said it would double its beauty product offering to 3,000 products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The current collections of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also get more space with exclusive areas similar to those seen in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket is also relaunching its Boutique makeup range so that most products are vegan-friendly, something increasingly in demand by younger customers.
In addition, the fragrance shop, The Fragrance Shop, will test concessions at two Sainsbury's establishments; the first opened in Croydon, south of London, last week, while the second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, this year.
Online shopping and a change that translates into buying small amounts of food daily in small stores means that supermarkets have to do more to convince people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, executive president of Sainsbury's, said the establishments will increasingly resemble shopping malls as supermarket chains try to compete with discount stores like Aldi and Lidl, with more non-food services and products.
Sainsbury's has already introduced Argos and Habitat outlets in hundreds of stores, since it bought the two chains two years ago. Apparently, this has strengthened grocery sales and made acquisitions profitable.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to modernize its pharmacy and beauty departments was a failure.
Sainsbury's launched a joint initiative with Boots in the early 2000s, but the partnership came to an end after a dispute over how to distribute pharmacy revenues in their supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its 281-store pharmacy business to Lloyds Pharmacy owner Celesio for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
It was commented that Lloyds would participate in the plan by adding a wide range of luxury cosmetics brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in 4 stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sales Director at Sainsbury's, said: "We have transformed the image of our beauty salons to improve the environment for our customers.
We also invest in specially trained staff that you can turn to for advice.
Our product range is designed to fit all needs and the attractive and practical locations mean that we are now a cosmetic destination that challenges the old buying habits.”
Peter Jones 'furious' after Holly Willoughby pulls out of 11 million pound business
Dragons Den star Peter Jones left "furiously" after TV presenter Holly Willoughby withdrew from an 11-million-pound business with her lifestyle brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn’t have time for her homewear and accessories brand Truly.
His company had been compared to Goop, the brand of Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old This Morning presenter used Instagram to announce her departure.
Holly Willoughby left Dragons' Den star, Peter Jones sparking sparks as he retired from his lifestyle brand at the last minute to focus on his new gold contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources indicate that Jones was "furious" when the golden TV girl admitted during a tense meeting held Saturday at the headquarters of her business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new businesses, valued at <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million, meant she no longer had time to dedicate to the brand of homewear, and accessories with Truly.
The business came to be compared to Goop, the brand of Gwyneth Paltrow, and was forecast to double Willoughby's fortune, estimated at <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When 37-year-old Willoughby turned to Instagram to announce that he was leaving Truly, Jones boarded a plane to Britain and headed to one of his vacation homes.
A source said: "Truly was by far one of Holly's priorities.
It was going to be their long-term future for the next two decades.
His decision to leave was shocking to all the people involved in the project.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, so close to the launch.
There was a warehouse full of merchandise in Marlow's offices ready to sell."
Experts believe that abandoning the presenter of This Morning is among Britain’s most profitable stars could cost the company millions of pounds, due to considerable investment in products ranging from cushions and candles to clothing and home textiles, and that it could further delay its launch.
It could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, are parents of three children and have a close friend with Jones and his wife, Tara, for ten years.
Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as president in March.
The couples went on vacation together and Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin's television producer.
Willoughby will become M&S brand ambassador and replace Ant McPartlin as presenter on ITV's I'm a Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night that "we shouldn't comment on his business affairs."
A complicated conversation "and then we fell in love"
He played with the criticism that he would receive from the media for making a comment that some would consider "not very own of a president" and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said he put his voice as "telejournal presenter".
“I gave up nothing.”
He pointed out that Kim is interested in holding a second meeting after his initial meeting in Singapore in June, which Trump considers a major step towards North Korea's denuclearization.
Negotiations for denuclearization have stalled.
More than three days after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders at Saturday's United Nations General Assembly that the North does not see a "correspondent response" from the US to North Korea's first disarmament measures.
On the contrary, he stressed, the U.S. continues to impose sanctions aimed at continuing to exert pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic view in his rally speech.
“Things with North Korea are going well,” he said.
“We are going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have this great relationship.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had positive results: ending the missile tests, helping to free the hostages, and bringing home the remaining U.S. soldiers.
And he defended his unusual strategy by talking about his relationship with Kim.
“It’s very easy to act like a president, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this amphitheater, we would have about 200 people standing here,” Trump said.
An earthquake and tsunami devastate an island in Indonesia, leaving hundreds of people dead.
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were informed that they did not need them.
Although more than 10 percent of the population of Lombok has been displaced, no national disaster has been declared, which is an indispensable condition for catalyzing international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they have made it very clear that they will not seek international aid, so it is a challenge," Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is gathering a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet clear whether foreign personnel will be able to work on the ground.
Mr Sutopo, spokesman for the national disaster management agency, said Indonesian officials are evaluating the situation in Palu to see if international agencies can contribute with their help.
Given the earthquakes that Indonesia constantly endures, the country is extremely ill-prepared to face the wrath of nature.
Although tsunami shelters were built in Aceh, it is not common to find them on other shores.
Although an alert was issued, the absence of a tsunami warning siren in Palu probably contributed to the loss of lives.
In the best of cases, traveling between many of Indonesia’s islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship that had been deployed in Lombok to attend to the victims of the earthquake is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to arrive at the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo’s election campaign revolved around improving Indonesia’s deteriorating infrastructure, and wasted money on roads and railroads.
But Mr. Joko’s administration is affected by a huge lack of funds in the final straight to next year’s re-election.
Mr. Joko is also affected by ongoing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative way of living the faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were forced to leave their homes because of the clashes in the streets between Christian and Muslim gangs, who use machetes, bows and arrows and other rudimentary weapons.
See: Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge scores the goal of the draw against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat to Chelsea by scoring in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri while still about 27 metres from Chelsea's goal with his team losing 1-0.
He touched the ball with his left leg before firing a shot at the second pole.
The ball flew over the area as it advanced towards the upper left corner of the net.
The ball ended up falling on a Kepa Arrizabalaga that was jumping in the air and entering the net.
"I was just trying to get to that position, to organize us, and players like Shaq always play the ball forward as much as possible, so I tried to win as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I came up to Kante and they gave me a touch without thinking too much and I just shot.”
Chelsea won 1-0 in the break after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The Blues forward passed the heel ball to Mateo Kovacic in that game, before turning close to the midfield and entering the Liverpool field.
Kovacic built a wall in the center of the field.
He made a beautiful in-depth pass leading Hazard to the area.
Hazard overcame the defense and ended up in the second pole scoring with a left-handed shot that Alisson Becker was unable to stop.
Liverpool will face Naples in the Champions League group stage on Wednesday at 3 p.m. at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will do the same with Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami rises to 832
The death toll from the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, according to the National Disaster Management Agency.
Many people would be trapped among the debris of the buildings that came down with the magnitude 7.5 earthquake that occurred on Friday and that caused waves of up to 6 meters, according to a press conference the spokesman of the agency Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, is covered with debris from the demolished buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man suspected of murder after woman dies stabbed
A murder investigation has been opened after the body of a woman was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. with gunshot wounds on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police asked people in the area who had seen or heard something to take a step forward.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in its early stages, but I would like to make a call to contact anyone who is near John Street in Birkenhead who sees or hears anything suspicious.
I would also like to ask anyone, especially the taxi drivers, to capture anything with the camera on the dashboard that comes in contact with us, as they might have key information for our investigation.
A police spokesman confirmed the body belonged to a neighbor in Birkenhead and was found inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who believed they knew the woman came to the scene to answer questions about where she was that morning.
The investigation continues as the police say they are in the process of informing the victim’s closest relatives.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has just tried to return to his apartment, but police have informed him that no one is allowed in or out of the building.
The man was speechless when he discovered what had happened.
Residents have just learned that they will not be able to enter again within a few hours.
A police officer was heard telling a man that the area was considered a crime scene.
A woman appears on the scene crying.
He says, “It’s horrible.”
At 2:00 p.m. there were two police vans inside the cordon with another van just outside.
Several officers remain inside the cordon guarding the apartment block.
Anyone with information is asked to send a direct message to <0x40>MerPolCC, to call 101 or to contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 citing record 247 of September 30.
The Cromwell statue of Parliament becomes the last monument affected by the struggle for "rewriting history"
His ban would be poetic justice for his Taliban destruction of so many religious and cultural objects of England carried out by his fanatical and puritanical followers.
But the Cromwell Society called Mr. Crick's suggestion of "stupid" and "trying to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable in the current debate about the removal of statues that Oliver Cromwell's figure outside Westminster Palace would become a target.
The iconoclasm of the English civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps they would have sacrificed the wrong Cromwell for the actions of their predecessor Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent depiction of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is proof of 19th-century opinion, and part of the historiography of a figure that many consider to be still worthy of homage.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more at the end of the nineteenth century than now, as an advocate of parliament before external pressure, in this case, of course, it was the monarchy.
Whether or not this is a complete representation is the subject of continuous historical debate.
What is clear is that the conflict of the mid-17th century defined the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure representing one side of the divide.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebration and commemoration.”
Killing Pig Kills Chinese Farmer
According to local media, a pig attacked and killed a farmer in a market in southwest China.
On Sunday, the South China Morning Post reported that the man, identified solely by the nickname, "Yuan," was found dead with a sectioned artery and covered in blood near a barn at the Liupanshui market in Guizhou province.
A pig farmer prepares to put the vaccines on pigs in a slaughterhouse on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
She apparently travelled with her cousin on Wednesdays from the neighboring Yunnan province to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered an open door giving to another adjacent courtyard.
He said that in the courtyard there was a large male with blood in his mouth.
Forensic analysis has confirmed that the pig, almost 250 kilos, attacked the farmer to kill him.
"My cousin had bloodied and crushed legs," his cousin, nicknamed "Wu", told Guiyang Evening News.
The security camera footage shows Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told the Evening News that the pig had been locked up to prevent it from attacking anyone else as police gathered evidence on stage.
It seems that Yuan's family and market authorities are negotiating a compensation for his death.
Although they are not very common, there have already been cases of pigs attacking humans in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on the farm the couple had in Massachusetts, causing serious injuries to the man.
Ten years earlier, a pig weighing nearly 300 kilograms pounded a Welsh farmer against the tractor until his wife arrived and frightened the animal.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his own pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but that the taste of the blood can act as "trigger.
“They’re just playing.
They are like children, very curious... they do not intend to do harm.
You just have to have the necessary respect,” he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa will bring heavy, widespread rainfall to the southwest of the United States.
Forecasts indicate that Hurricane Rosa weakens as it flies over the cold waters off the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring torrential rainfall to northern Mexico and southwestern U.S. over the next few days.
At 5 a.m. on Sunday, Rosa was a Category 1 hurricane with winds of more than 135 km/h and was located about 620 kilometers from Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to head north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a valley begins to take shape over the Pacific Ocean and move eastward toward the U.S. East Coast. As Rosa approaches the Lower California Peninsula as a tropical storm on Monday, it will begin to push tropical moisture northward, which will penetrate the southwestern U.S.
Rosa will bring more than 250 l/m2 of rain in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Next, the interaction of tropical moisture with the valley will create abundant and widespread rainfall in the southwest in the coming days.
At the local level, precipitation of between 25 and 100 l/m2 will cause dangerous sudden floods, debris flows and the possibility of landslides in the desert.
The high tropical humidity will cause precipitation that will approach 50 or 75 l/m2 in punctual areas, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In parts of the southwest, 50 to 100 l/m2 of rain is expected, especially over much of Arizona.
Possibility of sudden flooding with deteriorating conditions due to the dispersed nature of tropical rainfall.
We strongly advise against venturing into the desert under the threat of tropical rain.
Heavy rains could form cannons that could turn into floating rivers, and electric storms would bring locally raked winds and dust.
Valgada will bring locally strong rainfall to parts of the southern California coast.
Total precipitation could reach more than 12 l/m2, which in turn could cause a flow of smaller debris and rough roads.
These would be the first rains of the wet season of the region.
Scattered tropical rains will begin approaching Arizona in the late hours of Sunday and early Monday, before the rain spreads to late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will arrive at Four Corners on Tuesday, which will last until Wednesday.
October will witness major temperature fluctuations in the U.S. due to the cooling of the Arctic, although the tropics will remain quite warm.
This sometimes involves significant temperature changes over short distances.
On Sunday we can see a great example of drastic temperature differences in the center of the US.
There will be a temperature difference of nearly 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the persistent summer heat will try to reappear and expand again.
For the central and eastern part of the country, a warm October start is expected, with temperatures exceeding 26 degrees from the southern plains to parts of the northeast.
New York could reach 26 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 12 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast indicates high odds of higher-than-average temperatures for the east of the country during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people have seen the trial of Brett Kavanaugh.
More than 20 million people followed on six television channels the passionate testimonies of Supreme Court judge Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of a sexual assault that allegedly took place in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political stalemate continues and chains interrupt their usual schedule for a last-minute news on Friday: an agreement designed by Arizona senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh had touched him while he was drunk and that he had tried to take his clothes off at a party at the high school.
In a passionate testimony, Kavanaugh said he was absolutely certain that this would not happen.
Nielsen reported on Friday that more than 20.4 million people would have seen him.
The company told the media audience on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available to other channels that relayed it, including PBS, C-SPAN and the Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has trouble measuring people who watch TV from offices.
To get an idea, it is an audience similar to a football final or the Oscars ceremony.
Fox News Channel, which largely supported Kavanaugh's nomination, led all chains with an average of 5.69 million viewers during a day-long trial, according to Nielsen.
ABC was second with 3.26 million.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94, MSNBC 2.89 and CNN 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
After the trial, interest persisted.
Flake was the central figure on TV on Friday.
After the moderate Republican's office made a statement stating that he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was captured by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning by protesters as he tried to enter an elevator on the way to the Judiciary Committee hearing.
He remained gazing low for several minutes while being reprimanded, televised live on CNN.
"I'm here in front of you," said one woman.
“Do you think he’s telling the truth?”
They said to her, "You have power while there are many helpless women."
Flake said his office made a statement Flake, before the elevator was closed, added that he would have more to say in the committee hearing.
All television and cable channels broadcast live hours later when the Judiciary Committee had to vote to advance Kavanaugh's appointment before the full Senate to be put to the vote.
But Flake said he would only do that if the FBI investigated the allegations against the nominee the following week, which a minority of Democrats urged.
Flake was convinced in part by the conversations he had with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a later conversation with Coons and several senators, Flake made a decision.
Flake's election had power, because it was obvious that Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister accuses critics of 'playing politics' with Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused those who criticized her plans to leave the European Union of "playing politics" with Britain's future and harming the national interest.
Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview alongside his newspaper cover, his former foreign minister, Boris Johnson, insisted on attacking May’s so-called Chequers Brexit plan, saying the proposal that Britain and the EU should collect the other party’s tariffs was “totally absurd.”
Wayde Sims Murdered: Police Arrest Dyteon Simpson as Suspect of LSU Player's Death
Police have arrested a suspect in the shootings that ended the life of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player from LSU (State University of Louisiana).
According to the Baton Rouge police department, 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested and imprisoned for a second-degree murder charge.
Officials released the video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson and police said Sims had lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered the glasses from the scene and claimed they contained Simpson's DNA, according to CBS affiliate WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, police said he admitted to being the author of the shot that killed Wayde.
The defense said he was charged with a $350,000 bail.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office issued a preliminary report on Friday indicating that the cause of death was a bullet wound to the head that reached the neck.
The department praised the Louisiana State Police Refugee Unit, the State Police Forensic Laboratory, and Southern University Police for their help in getting the arrest.
LSU Sports Director Joe Alleva thanked the local law enforcement for their "diligence and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 2.01 wing was raised in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for the LSU.
His average last season was 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "shocked" and "shocked" by Wayde's passing.
“That’s what worries us all the time,” Wade said.
Volcano throws ashes over Mexico City
The ashes from the Popocatepetl volcano reached the southern neighborhoods of the capital of Mexico.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention on Saturday advised Mexicans to move away from the volcano after activity in the crater was detected and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded in 24 hours.
The center was monitoring several roars and tremors.
Social media images showed thin layers of gray on the windshields of Mexico City neighborhoods such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have detected an increase in the activity of the volcano located 72 kilometers southeast of the capital since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Clash between Catalan separatists and police ahead of independence referendum
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police and thousands joined rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the polarizing vote on Catalonia's secession.
A group of masked pro-separatists held by the anti-disturbance police scrambled eggs and powder paint that created clouds of dark dust on the streets that are usually crowded with tourists.
There were also later chills that same day with the police, who used the cockroaches to contain the liorta.
For several hours, pro-independence groups chanting “No Forgiveness or Forgiveness” clashed with union protesters shouting “Long live Spain.”
Fourteen people had to be cared for for minor injuries received in the protest, according to local media.
The tension continues to bloom in the independentist region a year after the October 1 referendum held by Catalan separatists, although considered illegal by Madrid.
Voters overwhelmingly opted for independence, though participation was low and secessionists boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to halt voting in polling stations across the region in violent clashes.
Pro-independence groups camped all night on Friday to avoid a demonstration of support for the national police.
The demonstration also took place but they were forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who attended the independence demonstration with his wife, said he no longer had hopes that Catalonia would achieve independence.
“Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents cry with joy when they were able to vote, but now we’re stuck,” he said.
Despite obtaining a sharp, albeit decisive, victory in last December’s regional elections, this year the pro-independence Catalan parties fought to maintain the momentum, with many of their best-known leaders in self-imposed exile or detained awaiting trial for their participation in the organization of the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who was recording the demonstration in support of the police with his mobile phone, said the conflict had been fueled by politicians on both sides.
“There’s more and more tension,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in pre-trial detention since last year, announced that he would run for the European Parliament elections next year.
"To present myself as a candidate in the European elections is the best way to denounce the regression of democratic values and the repression we suffer from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Man arrested after car hits a house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car ransacked a Londonderry house on several occasions.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 7:30 p.m. (UK summer time).
Police Investigation Inspector Bob Blemmings declared the grid and the building itself were the damaged parts.
It is also possible that a bullet was fired at the car at some point.
Menga's goal gives Livingston a 1-0 win over the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston ended in victory
The ascending Livingston surprised the Rangers by leading Steven Gerrard to his second 18-game defeat as Ibrox club coach.
Dolly Menga's goal was decisive for Gary Holt's team to rise one level behind Hibernian, in second place.
Gerrard's team is still out of the house this year in the Premiership and next Sunday they face the leader, the Hearts, from which they are separated by eight points.
The Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston remains undefeated in the division for the sixth consecutive game; head coach Holt has not yet known the defeat since he replaced Kenny Miler in the past.
Livingston misses opportunities in front of weakened visitors
Holt's team had to advance well before the time they scored, as with their control they caused all sorts of problems to the Rangers.
Scott Robinson made his way but his cross shot did not cross the goal threshold; then Alan Lithgow's shot came out driven by a Craig Halkett header from the other side of the goal.
The host team contented themselves with letting the Rangers play in front of them, aware that they could endanger visitors in the standing ball games.
That’s how the final goal came.
The Rangers conceded a free kick and Livingston scored a draw in which Declan Gallagher and Robinson joined forces to fix Menga, who touched the ball and scored from the center of the area.
At that time the Rangers dominated the possession but stumbled upon an impenetrable defense that avoided much work from guard Liam Kelly.
That pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced a Kelly stop.
Rangers keeper Allan McGregor stopped a Scott Pittman shot, and Lithgow sent the ball out in another Livingston stop-ball play.
Many cross passes were given in the Livingston area that were continually stripped, while two requests for penalty were rejected: one by hand and one for a Halkett entrance to substitute Glenn Middleton.
'Fenomenal' by Livingston: analysis
Alasdair Lamont for BBC Scotland from Tony Macaroni Stadium
It was a great performance for Livingston.
"And unanimously, they have been excellent and continue to exceed expectations in their upward trajectory.
His playing style and players have barely changed since he returned to the top category, but part of the merit is from Holt for the way he has driven the team since his arrival.
He had a lot of heroes.
Halkett, the captain, proudly led a perfectly organized defense while Menga gave Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall no respite throughout the game.
The Rangers are lacking in inspiration.
Despite working well on occasions under Gerrard's orders, this time they did not reach that level.
They failed the last pass. They only managed to penetrate the host team once. All an alert call for the Rangers, which is located in the middle of the board.
Erdogan Receives Ambiguous Reception in Cologne
On Saturday, September 29, there were smiles and blue skies during the meeting of the leaders of Turkey and Germany for lunch in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which aims to settle relations between NATO allies.
They disagreed on many issues, including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey’s accession to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to inaugurate a new giant mosque.
The city has the largest population outside of Turkey.
The police claimed security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters of Erdogan came to see his president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan (many of them Kurds) also raised their voices condemning both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to receive him in the country.
The duel of demonstrations reflects the division in front of a visitor acclaimed as a hero by some German Turks and criticized as an autocrat by others.
Traffic accident in Deptford: a cyclist dies in a car crash
A cyclist died in a car crash in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford, southeast of the city, around 10:15 a.m. (UK summer time).
The driver of the car stopped and paramedics arrived, but the man died in the act.
The accident comes months after another cyclist died in a runaway crash on Childers Street just over a mile from Saturday's accident.
Metropolitan police said officers were working to identify the man and inform his relatives.
Streets are closed and buses are diverted and drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured in riots
Six prison officers were injured in an altercation in the high-security prison, according to the prison officer.
The riot began at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 9:30 a.m. (UK summer time) on Sunday and is still ongoing.
A "Tornado" unit of specialized officers has gathered to deal with the riots, involving eight inmates who are contained in a pavilion.
Officers received attention for minor facial injuries.
A prison service spokesman said: "Specially trained prison personnel have been deployed to face an ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members had to be cared for for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and we are clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and could spend more time in jail.”
HMP Long Lartin is home to more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the director of the prison had to be hospitalized after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, riot police officers had to go to jail to calm a riot in which the staff were assaulted with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden flooding (drought-affected places could benefit)
It is rare for a tropical depression to affect Arizona, but it is likely to occur early next week, when the remaining energy from Hurricane Rosa crosses the Southwest Desert leaving the possibility of sudden flooding.
The National Weather Service has issued sudden flood alerts for Monday and Tuesday from western Arizona to south and east Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to pass directly over Phoenix on Tuesday and arrive at the last hour of Monday with rain.
The Phoenix National Meteorological Service said in a Twitter post that only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained the state of depression or tropical storm within a 320-kilometre radius of Phoenix since 1950.
Hurricane Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that extended within a radius of 64 kilometers of the Arizona border.
The latest models of the National Meteorological Service forecast 50 to 10 l/m2 of rain, with insulated amounts of up to 150 l/m2 on the Mogollon Border of Arizona.
Other areas of the Southwest Desert, such as the Central Rocks and the Great Basin, could reach up to 25 or 50 litres, with 100 l/m2 of total insulated areas possible.
For those who are out of danger of sudden flooding, the Rosa rain could be a blessing, as the region is heavily affected by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious problem, some of this rainfall may be beneficial, as the Southwest is experiencing drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, more than 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least extreme drought, the second largest category.
First, Hurricane Rosa will hit the Mexican peninsula of Baja California.
Rosa, which will still have hurricane strength on Sunday morning, with a maximum wind of 136 km/h, is 620 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and heads north at 19 kilometers per hour.
The storm is encountering cold water in the Pacific and therefore losing strength.
For this reason it is expected to touch land in Mexico with tropical storm force in the afternoon or in the evening of Monday.
It could rain heavily in some areas of Mexico, posing a significant risk of flooding.
“Total precipitation is expected to be between 75 and 150 l/m2 from Baja California to northwestern Sonora, and it is possible to find up to 250 l/m2,” weather.com reports.
Rosa will then head north across Mexico in the form of a tropical storm before arriving at the Arizona border early on Tuesday as a tropical depression, and then continue to climb across Arizona and enter southern Utah at the last hour of Tuesday night.
"The main danger of Rosa or what remains of it is the heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the Southwestern Desert of the United States," the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
It is hoped that these rains can provoke sudden water rumblings and debris flows in deserts, and landslides in mountainous terrain.
Midsomer Norton assault: four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder in order to find a 16-year-old boy with white gunshot wounds.
The teenager was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton on Saturday around 4:00 a.m. (UK summer time).
He was taken to the hospital, where he remains "stable".
According to Somerset police, three boys aged 17, 18 and 20 were arrested in the Radstock area during the night.
Officials asked for the help of anyone who had a recording of the incident on their mobile phone.
Trump Says Kavanaugh 'Suffered the Grief and Grief' of Democratic Party
“Voting for Judge Kavanaugh is voting to reject the Democratic Party’s ruthless and outrageous tactics,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had "suffered the clumsiness and anger" of the Democratic Party throughout its nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, where he categorically and emotionally denied the accusation of Christine Blasey Ford sexually assaulting her decades ago as a teenager.
Ford also testified in the trial about his indictment.
The president said on Saturday that the “Americans” witnessed Kavanaugh’s brilliance, quality and courage.
“A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the best lawyers of our time with an unpolluted record of public service,” he told a crowd of West Virginia fans.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's appointment as he talked about the importance of Republican results in the midterm elections.
“Five weeks are missing for one of the most important elections of our lives.
“I don’t do it, but I do,” he said.
“That’s why I’m everywhere fighting for great candidates.”
Trump argued that the Democrats’ mission is “to oppose and obstruct.”
The first procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's appointment is expected to take place before Friday, a Republican Party aide told CNN.
Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami have killed hundreds of people and the number continues to rise
Authorities said at least 384 people died, many of them dragged by giant waves that broke off on the beaches, when a major earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Hundreds of people gathered on Friday to attend a festival on the beach of the town of Palu when waves of up to six meters broke on the ground to the luscofusco, taking the lives of many and destroying everything in its path.
The tsunami was followed by a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
“Yesterday, when the threat emerged, people were still with their activities on the beach and did not immediately flee, so they were dead,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia’s BNPB disaster mitigation agency at a prey round in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, it dragged cars, logs, house, razed everything it found," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had travelled high seas at a speed of 800 km/h before reaching the coast.
Some people climbed the trees to escape the tsunami and managed to survive, he said.
Around 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
The aerial photographs released by the National Disaster Management Agency showed many destroyed tents and buildings, twisted and overturned bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
Replicas continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area with 2.4 million inhabitants.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) said the energy released by the huge earthquake on Friday was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
The geography of the city, set at the end of a long and narrow bay, could magnify the size of the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as "quantitative" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels had come down.
The bodies of some of the victims were found trapped under the debris of the collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people had been injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho announced that the casualties and damage could be greater along the northern coast of Palu, an area called Donggala and which is closer to the epicenter of the quake.
Communications were "totally paralyzed and there is no information" from Donggala, Nugroho added.
There are more than 300,000 people living there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could be much worse," he said.
The agency was harshly criticized on Saturday for failing to report a tsunami to Palu, although officials said the waves arrived at the time the warning was issued.
In an amateur footage shared on social media, one can hear a man standing on the top floor of a building screaming frenziedly warning people on the street of the arrival of a tsunami.
In a matter of minutes, the water collides with the mound carrying buildings and cars.
Reuters was not able to immediately certify the authenticity of the recording.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major shutdown that caused communications to be cut across Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue tasks.
Authorities say the army has already begun sending cargo aircraft from Yakarta and other cities, but the evacuated still urgently need food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport has been reopened but only for rescue tasks and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit the Palu evacuation centers on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami exceeds 800.
It's awful.
While World Vision staff travelled to reach the city of Palu, where employees watched in canvas shelters raised in the yard of their office, they contemplated scenes of total devastation, Mr. Doseba said.
“They told me they saw a lot of houses destroyed,” he said.
It's awful.
Even when the groups began the unpleasant task of starting disaster assistance, some complained that they were preventing foreign aid workers with great knowledge and experience from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian legislation, funds, supplies and staffing from abroad can only flow if the place of the disaster is declared a national disaster zone.
And that hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a disaster at the level of a province," said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As soon as the government says, ‘Okay, this is a national disaster,’ we can open up to international aid, but that time has not yet come.”
As the second night in Palu fell after the earthquake and tsunami of Friday, family and friends of the missing held on to the hope that their loved ones would be one of the miracles that would shed light on the depressing argument of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a child was taken out of a dungeon.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who was carrying her mother's body under the rubble for two days.
Gendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Mr. Mandagi added that some of the people trapped in the Roa Roa hotel were his students.
“As a person with extensive experience in the field of paragliding, I have my own emotional load,” he said.
Gendon told how, in the hours after the news of the downing of the Roa Roa hotel among the paragliding community, he had desperately tried to send WhatsApp messages to the competitors of Palu, who were participating in the beach festival.
However, in the messages only a gray mark was shown instead of two blue marks.
“I think that means that the messages were not delivered,” he added.
$26,750 stolen while charging a cashier in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink worker recharging a cashier in Newport on the Levee, according to a news release from the Newport police department.
In the press release, investigative officer Dennis McCarthy wrote that the driver of the car had emptied a cashier in the leisure complex and was preparing to deliver more money.
While he was busy, another man "came running from behind Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money he had to deliver.
According to the report, witnesses saw several suspects abandoned the scene, but police did not specify how many were involved in the incident.
If you have information about your identities, contact the Newport Police Department by calling 859-292-3680.
rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye
The rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
To announce the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "Or being formerly known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has long been known as Ye's nickname, which he used as the title of his eighth album, released in June.
The change took place before their appearance on Saturday Night Live, where they are expected to release their new album Yandhi.
He will replace singer Ariana Grande on the show, who canceled her attendance for "emotional reasons," according to the creator of the show.
In addition to being an abbreviation for his current professional name, West had previously explained that the word had a religious meaning for him.
"I think 'yes' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," West said that same year while talking about his album with radio presenter Big Boy.
“So I am you, it is us, it is us.
I passed from Kanye, which means the one, the only You, which is a reflection of the goodness that is in us, of evil, of confusion, of everything.
The album is a reflection of who we are.
Kanye is another of the famous rappers who changed his name.
Sean Combs was previously known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, although this year he announced that he prefers to be called Love and Brother Love.
A former West collaborator, JAY-Z, also pinned himself by putting and removing the script and using capital letters.
Amlo vows not to use military against civilians
Mexican President-elect Andrés Manuel López Obrador has vowed not to use military force again against civilians as the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students approaches.
López Obrador promised on Saturday in Tlatelolco Square that he "would not use the military again to repress the Mexican people".
On October 2, 1968, troops fired at a peaceful demonstration in the square killing some 300 people at a time when student movements were taking root throughout Latin America.
López Obrador has pledged to support Mexican youth by giving monthly aid to boys who study and opening more free public universities.
He said unemployment and lack of educational opportunities drag boys into criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double its investment in I.A.
According to Kai-Fu Lee, an AI investor and professional, a former employee of Google, Microsoft and Apple, the U.S. should double the amount it invests in AI in view of China’s growing activity in the field.
The comments came after several parts of the U.S. government made AI announcements, even though the U.S. lacks a formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan the previous year: it aims to be the number one in AI innovation in 2030.
"Duplicating the research budget in AI would be a good start, given that the other countries are much behind the U.S., and we are looking for the next big breakthrough in AI," Lee said.
Duplicating funding could double the likelihood that the next AI achievement would be made in the U.S., Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World order was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China’s most prominent AI companies: Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that defeated the highest-scored American Othello player and later became executive at Microsoft Research at Google's subsidiary in China.
Lee recognized former U.S. government technology competitions as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotic Challenge and asked when it would be next to help identify future visionaries.
In the U.S., researchers often have to work hard to get government grants, Lee says.
“It’s not China that’s taking academic leaders, it’s companies,” he said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired university geniuses to work in AI.
Lee stressed that changing immigration policy could also help the U.S. boost its AI efforts.
“I think they should offer residency cards to doctors in AI,” he said.
The State Council of China published its Plan for the Development of New Generation Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
The National Science Foundation of China offers funding to people from academic institutions in the same way that the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established an Artificial Intelligence Center that is intended to include industry and university partners, and the White House announced the formation of the Select Committee on Artificial Information.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for NSF, it currently invests more than $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislation that sought to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not recorded movement for months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum to change the country's name.
The Macedonian people voted on Sunday in a referendum to change their name to the "Republic of North Macedonia", a movement that would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece and block admission requests to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that the name of its northern neighbors represents a claim to its territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
The governments of the two countries reached an agreement in June on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would harm the ethnic identity of the majority of Macedonia's Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign raised doubts about whether the result would achieve the minimum 50 percent needed for the referendum to be valid.
The question that appeared on the referendum paper was: "Are you in favour of joining NATO and the EU with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying for admission to entities such as the EU or NATO from Macedonia, one of the emerging countries of the fall of Yugoslavia.
“Today I have come to vote for the future of the country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the protection of the European Union, because that means a safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, several members of parliament said they would abide by the result of the vote and make it final.
The change of nine would require a two-thirds majority of the parliament.
The State Election Commission stated that no irregularities had been recorded by 1 p.m.
However, the turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent of the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters filed their ballots.
"I have come to vote for my children, our site is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, a 62-year-old voter from the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko filed their vote for the Macedonian referendum on changing the name of the country that would pave the way for its accession to the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small stage and placed chairs in front of the tents assembled for those who had boycotted the referendum.
"We are in favour of joining NATO and the EU, but we want to do so with our heads high and not through the service door," Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t accept us as Macedonia, we can go to other countries like China and Russia and join the Eurasian Union.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I think the vast majority will be in favor because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of joining the EU and NATO," Zaev said after casting his vote.
He said a positive outcome would be “confirmation of our future.”
A poll published Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Political Research revealed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would take part in the referendum, a figure that is below the required.
Another survey conducted by Macedonian television network Telma indicated that 57 percent of the people surveyed planned to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
For the referendum to be valid, the result must be 50 percent plus one vote.
A failure in the referendum would represent the first major blow to the pro-Western government's policy since it came to power in May.
Sergio Agüero, Manchester City player, crosses the entire defense of Brighton and ends up scoring a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling reported the defense of Brighton with Manchester City's 2-0 on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it seem ridiculously simple to score the goal of the 65th minute.
The Argentine forward received a pass in the midfield at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran between three Brighton defenses before heading to the open field.
Then Aguero found himself surrounded by four green shirts.
He disbanded a defense before overcoming several more on the edge of the Brighton area.
Then he passed the ball to his left and found Sterling.
The English forward used the first small area to return the ball to Aguero, who hit Brighton guard Mathew Ryan with a shot to the right of the net.
“Aguero is going through some problems in the pe,” City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We're talking about playing 55 or 60 minutes.
And that was when it happened.
We were lucky to score at that point.”
But it was Sterling who gave the blues the initial lead in the Premier League match.
That goal came in the 29th minute.
Agüero received the ball in the depths of the Brighton field in that game.
He sent a beautiful hollow pass on the right side towards Leroy Sane.
Sane gave several taps before driving Sterling towards the opposite pole.
The Blues put the ball in the goal before leaving the field.
City will face Hoffenheim in the Champions League group on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to celebrate the Rockies
With the Nationals out of the elimination fight, there was not much reason to force another titularity.
But an ever-competitive Scherzer hopes to launch Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are still implications in the elimination for the Rockies, taking a lead game to the Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League's West Division.
The Rockies secured at least one position of the wildcard with a 5–2 victory over the Nationals on Friday night, but are still trying to close their first division title.
"Although we haven't played anything, we can at least touch the gum knowing that the atmosphere in Denver with the crowd and with the other team would probably be playing at the highest level I played this year.
“Why don’t you want to compete?”
The Nationals have not yet announced who will open on Sunday, but they seem to be inclined to make Scherzer the pitcher in a situation like that.
Scherzer, for whom his starting number 34 would be, did another bullpen session on Thursday and will likely launch on Sunday on his usual rest day.
Washington's right is 18-7 with an ERA of 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 entries this season.
Trump holds a rally in West Virginia
The president indirectly referred to the situation surrounding Supreme Court elector Brett Kavanaugh, while speaking about the importance of the outcome in the midterm elections.
“We played everything we did in November.
There are five weeks left for one of the most important choices in our lives.
This is something big, big... I don’t do it, but I really do and that’s why I’m going everywhere fighting for great candidates,” he said.
Trump continued, “Already you see this horrific radical group of Democrats, look what’s happening now.
And they are determined to regain power using any means necessary, evil, and clumsiness.
They don’t care who they hurt, above who they have to pass to get power and control, that’s what they want, power and control and we’ll never give it to them.”
The mission of the Democrats is to oppose and obstruct.”
"And they've seen that in the past four days," he said, calling Democrats "annoyed, vandalized, dirty and liars."
He listed the Senate Judiciary Committee citing Senator Dianne Feinstein by name, who received strong public endorsements.
“Do you remember his answer?
Did you filter the document?
Mmm..hey, what?
No, mmm, no, wait... it was the worst body language, the worst I’ve ever seen.”
The Labour Party is no longer open.
He is not tolerant of those who express their opinions.
When momentum activists from my local party voted to censor me, the truth is, I wasn’t too surprised.
After all, I am the last of a series of Labour MPs who are not well received, and all to say our opinion.
My colleague in parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated similarly because she faced anti-Semitism decisively.
In my case, the censorship motion criticized me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security and on Europe, randomly issues about which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The notification for the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday indicated that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
For most of the eight years I have been a Labour MP, Friday night committee meetings have been exactly that way.
Unfortunately, that is no longer the tone of many meetings, and the promise of a "more kind and kind" policy has long since been forgotten, if ever it has begun.
It is becoming increasingly evident that the Labour Party does not tolerate different opinions and is judged if all opinions are acceptable to the party leader.
This began shortly after Jeremy became the party leader, when colleagues with whom he believed to share a similar political vision began to expect me to be portrayed and taken positions with which I would never agree, whether in terms of national security or the EU single market.
When I speak publicly, and I actually do a little bit of what I say, there is a tremendous uproar and attacks on social media censoring center politics, telling me I shouldn’t be in the Labour Party.
And it's not just me.
In fact, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, as the comments that are addressed to me are usually of a political nature.
I am impressed by the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face a torrent of sexist or racist comments every day and who do not give up.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is how levels of insult have been normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party had to foster a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer so open and that with every move of “no confidence” or every change in the rules of selection, the party becomes narrower in sight.
Over the last few years I have received many tips that urge me to keep my head down, not to be so frank and that then "everything would be fine for me".
I didn’t get into politics to do that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago while still in school, led by the negligence of the Thatcher government that had literally dropped my classroom, I have tried to claim better public services for those who need them most, both as a local councillor and as a minister of government.
I never hid my politics, not even in the last election.
No member of Nottingham East could be confused with my political stances and that I disagree with the current leadership of the party.
To those who promoted Friday’s motion, the only thing I would say is that as the country moves toward a Brexit that will affect our homes, businesses and public services, I don’t understand that desire to waste time and energy questioning my loyalty to the party’s leader.
But, in reality, the only message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my constituents, whether they are members of the party or not: I am proud to serve them and I promise that no threat or political convenience will deter me from acting in accordance with what I consider to be the best interests of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: an undefeated Ayr takes the lead
The last two attempts may have slightly altered the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win this amusing Premier League match.
He is now the leader of the team and the only undefeated team of the ten.
Eventually it was the superiority of his defense, as well as the fact of risking, that led the team to victory. And coach Peter Murchie had every right to be happy.
"So far we've put them to the test in our game and we're still unbeaten, so I have to be happy," he said.
Melrose's Robyn Christie said, "We have to recognize that Ayr took advantage of the opportunities better than we did."
Grant Anderson's 14th minute rehearsal, transformed by Frazier Climo, put Ayr ahead, but a yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, ceded to the Warriors game, allowed Melrose to talk the numbers and Jason Baggot scored a wrong pitch.
Climo increased the lead for Ayr with a penalty, before, just in the middle, he turned a shot into a solo, leaving the score 17-5 in favor of Ayr at rest.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's rehearsal, transformed by Baggot, reduced the lead to five points.
There was then a prolonged stop due to the serious injury suffered by Ruaridh Knott, who left the field on a paddle and, from the restart, Ayr advanced further through a Stafford McDowall rehearsal, transformed by Climo.
Ayr's acting captain, Blair Macpherson, received a yellow card and Melrose took advantage of having one more player with an unused Bruce Colvine rehearsal at the end of a period of much pressure.
However, the local team returned and when Struan Hutchinson received the yellow card for scoring Climo when he did not have the ball, McPjherson scored a rehearsal from the penalty line at the back of Ayr's maul.
Climo scored, as he did almost from the restart, after Kyle Rowe picked up the pitch in the David Armstrong area and sent it to the third line Gregor Henry to get the fifth rehearsal from the local team.
The protagonist of Still Game starts a new career in the catering industry
Still Game star Ford Kieran seems to be ready to enter the catering industry after discovering that he has been appointed director of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, which he writes and co-stars with his old partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo have announced that the next ninth season will be the definitive, and it looks like Kierman is planning another life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment, though a Scottish Sun source hinted that Kiernan wanted to get involved in Glasgow's "prosperous restaurant business."
'The sea is ours': Bolivia's interior hopes the court will make the way to the Pacific
The sailors guarded a naval headquarters covered with apparatus in La Paz.
Public buildings waving a blue flag.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are drowned in the slogan: "The sea is ours by right.
Recovering it is a duty.”
In Bolivia without a sea, the memory of a coast lost to Chile in a bloody 19th-century resource conflict remains alive, as well as the desire to sail back across the Pacific Ocean.
Perhaps those hopes are at their peak in decades, as Bolivia awaits a decision by the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the necessary momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity and, of course, expects a positive outcome," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the CIX ruling on giant screens across the country in the hope that the Hague Court will rule in favor of Bolivia’s claim and that, after decades of intermittent talks, Chile will be forced to negotiate the concession to Bolivia of a sovereign exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, who faces a controversial battle for re-election next year, also has a lot at stake in Monday's ruling.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts consider it unlikely that the court will give Bolivia a reason, and that little would change if that happened.
The United Nations agency based in the Netherlands has no power to adjudicate Chilean territory, and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
The fact that the CIX ruling comes only six months after the final arguments we heard indicates that the case "was not complicated," says Chilean international law expert Paz Zárate.
And far from promoting the cause of Bolivia, the last four years could lag behind.
"The issue of access to the sea has been blocked for a long time by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
Morales’ belligerent rhetoric undermined the goodwill left to him in Chile, he suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will resume the talks at some point, but it will be very difficult to hold them after that.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltze, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court had taken an unusually quick decision.
On Monday, Bolivia will have "a fantastic opportunity to open a new stage of relations with Chile," and an opportunity to "end 139 years of mutually beneficial disagreements.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America, was using this subject for political purposes.
“Bolivia will never renounce its right to access the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
“Judgment is an opportunity to see that we need to overcome the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not occur unless it can rely on the United States.
North Korea's foreign minister, Ri Yong, said his country would not proceed with nuclear disarmament if it could not be trusted by Washington.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He made a call to the United States to fulfill the promises made during a summit in Singapore among its leaders.
This remark comes at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be about to restart stalled nuclear diplomacy for more than three decades after the summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it is "a utopia" that the continued sanctions and objections of the United States to a declaration ending the Korean War will succeed in doubling the North.
In Washington, they resist accepting the declaration without Pyongyang taking the first step towards disarmament.
Both Kim and President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about renouncing an arsenal that the country probably sees as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to travel to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris fashion shows reveal the latest line of giant hats that will soon be in stores.
If you want to increase your collection of hats or well cover yourself completely from the sun, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled a series of extravagant accessories for their spring-summer 2019 collection that captivated the public with the purest style of the Paris Fashion Week.
The impossible shaders filled Instagram this summer and these designers brought to the stage their most amazing creations.
Valentino's main piece was an exaggerated beige hat adorned with a wide wing mimicking feathers that flooded the models' heads.
Among other big-sized accessories were stirred watermelon, a wizard's hat and even a pineapple, but they were not designed to protect the head from the cold.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of strange masks... just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colored masks had sewn lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than high seam.
One of the creations looked like a complete diving gear, with the glasses and the tube, and another a melted ice cone.
And if you're a fan of the huge fashion, you're in luck.
The fashion experts predicted that giant hats could reach the stores.
The disproportionate hats come right after the "Bomb", the straw hat with a 60-centimeter wing that carries the whole world, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind the impossible hat that invades all social networks has brought another great creation to the catwalk: a beach bag of straw almost as large as the model dressed in a swimsuit that wears it.
The orange raffia bag adorned with raffia flakes and finished with a white leather wing, was the highlight of Jacquemus' La Riviera's Spring Summer 2019 collection at the Paris Fashion Week.
Famous designer Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I hope the big umbrellas and beach bags will arrive in stores next summer, as the designer had such a big impact that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for oversized accessories."
John Edward: Linguistic skills are essential for the citizens of the world
Scotland’s private schools maintain a record of academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with another collection of outstanding exam results, which is only reinforced by individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other community subjects.
With more than 30,000 pupils across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Private Schools (SCIS), strive to offer the best level to pupils and their parents.
Private schools aim to prepare their students for higher education, for the career they choose and their place as world citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a tailor-made curriculum, we are seeing modern languages continue to be a popular and desired topic within schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, that comes to mind.
But if you speak to him in his own language, it will reach his heart.”
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely solely on English when we want to establish relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the results of this year’s recent exams, we can see that languages are at the top of the board and with the highest approved rates in private schools.
Sixty-eight percent of students who studied foreign languages gained an outstanding degree.
The data, compiled from the 74 schools that make up the SCIS, show that 72% of students obtained honorary enrollment in Mandarin, while 72% of those who studied German, 69% of those who studied French and 63% of those who studied Spanish, also achieved an outstanding score.
This demonstrates that Scottish private schools support languages and consider them key skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
At present, languages are taking the same consideration as subjects such as science, technology, engineering and mathematics in programs of private schools and of all kinds.
A 2014 survey by the U.K. Commission for Employment and Training found that a lack of knowledge of languages constitutes 17% of the reasons why employers find it difficult to fill vacancies.
Therefore, language skills are increasingly essential in preparing young people for their future careers.
These skills are essential in a globalized world, as there are more job opportunities that need languages.
Regardless of your chosen career, if you learn a second language you will have a real advantage in the future with a lifelong skill like this.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries will put a bilingual person directly at the head of the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75% did not speak any foreign language well enough to maintain a conversation, and French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage, in this case 15%.
That’s why it’s so important to invest in a language for children today.
Knowing several languages, especially those of developing economies, provides children with more opportunities to find meaningful employment.
In Scotland, the language of instruction varies according to the school.
Some schools focus on more classical modern languages, while others opt for languages considered more important to the UK by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of the interests of your children, private schools always have several languages to choose from and teachers specializing in this field.
Scottish private schools specialize in providing a learning environment that prepares children and staff with the skills needed to succeed, whatever the future holds.
We cannot deny that at this time, in a global business environment, languages remain of vital importance for the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered "international communicative skills".
Private schools will continue to offer this diversity and excellence to Scottish youth.
We have to do it.
John Edwards is the director of the Scottish Council of Private Schools.
Lebron debuts with the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for fans who want to see LeBron James play with the Los Angeles Lakers for the first time.
The team's coach, Like Walton, announced that James will play the opening game of the preseason against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
It remains to be seen how many minutes he will play.
“It’s going to be more than 1 and less than 48,” Walton said on the Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James would probably play a few minutes.
After training early in the week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game preseason.
“At this point in my career, I don’t need pre-season games to be ready,” he said.
Trump's Election Acts Arrive in Virginia on YouTube
President Donald Trump begins a series of campaign rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It will be Trump’s first of five planned rallies next week, including stops in cities like Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation vote paused for his candidate to fill the vacancy in the Supreme Court, Trump aims to gain support for the upcoming midterm elections, given that Republicans risk losing control of Congress when they vote in November.
What time is Trump’s rally in West Virginia and how can you see it on the internet?
The Trump rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for Saturday, September 29, 2018 at 7 p.m. ET.
You can watch the Trump rally in West Virginia to follow via live streaming on YouTube.
Trump will likely address the issue of this week’s trial of Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who has become tense over allegations of sexual misconduct and who keeps the Senate’s confirmation vote suspended for a week as the FBI investigates.
But the main goal of this series of rallies is to help Republicans face the November elections with a new impetus.
So these five rallies Trump will give next week aim to “dynamize volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives,” according to Reuters.
“Congress control is so important to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible ahead of the campaign season,” Trump’s campaign spokesman told Reuters.
The evening rally, which will be held at Wesbanco Stadium, could gather supporters of “Ohio and Pennsylvania and get Pittsburgh media coverage,” according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be Trump’s second visit in a month to West Virginia, the state he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate nominee Patrick Morrisey, last in the polls.
“It’s not a good symptom for Morrisey that the president has to come to support him in the polls,” Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows perseverance to fight and keep hope alive until Sunday’s individual matches
After three individual sessions, the Saturday afternoon foursome could have been what this Ryder Cup needed.
The Pulse Oscillating Pendulum is a fully invented sports concept but in what athletes really believe, and especially in competitions like this one.
Where do you think the momentum is now?
"They had a six-point lead and now it's four, so I guess we're taking that as a bit of a boost," Spieth said as he walked away at the end of the day.
Of course, Europe has four points of advantage with twelve more in play.
The Americans, Spieth said, feel they have a little wind in their favor and a lot to get excited about, among other things, the technique of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each scored three points out of four.
Spieth has been lethal from tee to green and is preaching by example.
Those gutter screams became stronger as he advanced his round, making a crucial putt to tie the fourth game when he and Thomas were two points below after two.
By getting the putt that made them win the game at 15, he threw a similar scream, the kind of scream he says he believes the American team is not out yet.
“You just have to focus and worry about your game,” Spieth said.
It’s the only thing that’s left for these players.
18 holes to leave a trace.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed history of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but adorable European couple have four of four and can’t go wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't make a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also avoided them on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and no last nine holes on Friday morning.
That tour, and the way it seems to flow their energy to and from the crowd, confirms them as rivals to be beaten on Sunday, and there could be no more popular players to achieve a victory when the sun sets on Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both at the same time in different holes.
However, talking about European glory is still premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly dispatched Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning fourballs, when he paired up with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the first race ended up with the Spanish and the Swede in a hole they were never close to leaving.
But on Sunday, there will be no one to help get out of the hole.
Fourballs and foursomes are so fascinating to watch closely for the interactions between couples, the tips they give each other, the ones they don’t, and the way you can change a strategy in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team so far and have a significant advantage last day, but this foursome session also demonstrated that Team USA has the endurance to fight, something some, especially Stateside, doubted.
Europe takes a 10-6 lead on the last day of the Ryder Cup.
Europe will enjoy a good lead on the last day of the Ryder Cup after leaving the fourballs and foursomes with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
The inspired duo formed by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari headed the charge with two victories over a struggling Tiger Woods to climb four points to the finish line at Le Golf National.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who seeks to retain the trophy they lost two years ago at Hazeltine, dominated an American team that failed in the morning fourballs, putting the series 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance to the foursomes, winning four games, but were unable to cut the advantage.
Jim Furyk's team needed eight points from Sunday's 12 individual matches to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, nicknamed "Molliwood", after a sensational weekend, are the second pair to win four points from the first four games in Ryder Cup history.
After smashing Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, they fit perfectly to defeat a detached Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with a more categorical 5&4.
Woods, who played two games on Saturday without penalty or glory, showed occasional bursts of brilliance, but now lost 19 of 29 games in fourballs and foursomes and five straight.
Justin Rose, who had rested in the morning fourballs, reunited with his partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes, scoring a defeat against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, world number one and three.
Europe could not always win on a pleasant day of breeze in southwest Paris.
Three-time champion Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for the Americans by scoring two points on Saturday.
They scored a 2&1 victory over Spaniard John Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourballs and again beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the foursomes after losing the first two holes.
There have only been two times in Ryder Cup history when a team has four points in the individual, although as the current holder of the trophy, Furyk's team only needs to tie to keep it.
However, after being the second best in two days, a counter-attack on Sunday seems to be out of reach.
North Korea says no to unilateral disarmament if there is no confidence
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions increased its mistrust of the United States and that the country would not deliver its nuclear weapons in those circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "important measures to show its goodwill" last year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling nuclear test fields and committing to the proliferation of weapons and nuclear technology.
"However, we do not see the corresponding response from the U.S.," he added.
Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and, in such circumstances, there will be no unilateral disarmament first on our part.”
While Ri resumed North Korea's well-known complaints about Washington's resistance to "gradual" denuclearization under which North Korea would be rewarded as it took action, his statement seemed important, as he did not reject unilateral denuclearization as it had happened with Pyongyang in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement made by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between an active U.S. president and a North Korean leader held in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to "denuclearize" the Korean peninsula while Trump ensured North Korea's security.
North Korea has long sought a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has declared that Pyongyang must first drop its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted relaxing tough international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States insists on 'denuclearization first' and increases pressure through sanctions to achieve its coercive-eight objective, and even opposes the 'declaration of an end to war'," Ri said.
“The perception that sanctions can make us kneel is an impossible dream for those who don’t know us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions exacerbate our mistrust.”
Ri did not mention the plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump that the U.S. leader mentioned at the United Nations earlier this week.
However, he spoke about three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: “If the other part of this denuclearization issue were South Korea and not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have come to a dead end.”
Still, Ri’s tone of speech was radically different from last year’s, when he told the United Nations General Assembly it was inevitable to attack the United States with North Korean missiles after “evil president” Trump called Kim “a rocket man on a suicide mission.”
This year at the U.N., Trump, who last year threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea, praised Kim for his bravery in taking steps to disarmament, but said there was still a lot of work to be done and that sanctions must be maintained until North Korea denuclearizes.
On Wednesday, Trump said there was no deadline for that, and that “it takes two years, three or five months anyway.”
China and Russia are discussing whether the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that “Enforcement of the Security Council sanctions must continue firmly and without exception until we observe total, final and verified denuclearization.”
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to cut funds for Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and then commented that he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but the last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying he had made progress, just hours after North Korea denounced him for making “mafia-like demands.”
In a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to dismantle a missile deployment as well as a nuclear complex, if the United States took the "corresponding measures".
He pointed out that Kim had told him that the "corresponding measures" he was requesting were the security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and the progress towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to get enough rest
This year, a new Harvard University course is making all of its students sleep more in order to combat the growth of the male culture of caffeine-stimulated all-night study.
One academic found that students at the world’s number one university often miss the basics about how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard School of Medicine and a specialist at Brigham and Muller Hospital, conceived the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after giving a talk about the impact that lack of sleep had on learning.
“At the end of the course, a girl came up to me and said, ‘Why are they only telling me this now, in my last year?’
He said no one had told him about the importance of sleeping, which surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
The course, which was launched this year for the first time, explains to students the basic aspects of how acquiring good sleep habits helps with academic and athletic performance, as well as improves overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students had a significant lack of sleep during the week.
The one-hour course involves a series of interactive tasks.
In one section there is an image of a bedroom, where students click on coffee mugs, curtains, trainers and books to get information about the effects of caffeine and light and how sleep deficiency affects athletic performance, as well as the importance of having a routine at bedtime.
In another section, participants are informed about how prolonged lack of sleep can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
A campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that it will not change the behavior of students immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know this information, just as we have the right to know what the health effects are if we choose to smoke tobacco,” added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride to spend the whole night awake still exists, he says. And he adds that modern technology and the increasing pressure for students that involved lack of sleep was a growing problem.
Ensuring that you sleep enough and have a good quality sleep should be a student's "secret weapon" to combat stress, fatigue and anxiety, it signals. Even avoiding fattening, as lack of sleep causes the brain to enter starvation mode, or which causes him to be hungry constantly.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after attending one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to promote a course across the campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all postgraduate students to complete a similar study program before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students consider setting an alarm for bedtime, as well as for when they wake up. Likewise, it is advisable that they be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" emitted by electronic displays and LED lighting, which can imbalance the circadian rhythm and cause trouble sleeping.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal knocks down Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another sad episode when Dolly Menga's attack relegated Steven Gerrard's disarticulated team to a 1-0 defeat at Livingston.
The Ibrox team intended to record their first home win since the 4–1 win in February at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team caused Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as a coach, which left his team eight points behind the Hearts, leaders of the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga attacked seven minutes before the break, and an alignment of the Rangers with little inspiration never gave the feeling that he was tied.
While the Rangers dropped to sixth place, Livingston climbed to third place and is only behind the Hibernian with a difference goal.
And it could have been much worse for the Rangers after line judge Calum Spence had to deal with a head injury after the alleged launch of an object.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that razed Ayr in the semifinals of the Betfred Cup, the Scottish League Cup.
On the other hand, Holt was with the same 11 of Livingston who scored a point to the Hearts last week and would have been delighted with the way his organized team suffocated their opponents at all times.
The Rangers may have dominated possession, but Livingston did much more when they had the ball.
They could have scored in just two minutes when Menga's first-time pass sent Scott Pittman towards Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder wasted this great opportunity.
A powerful free kick from Keaghan Jacobs reached Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner, Alan Lithgow, only managed to nail him in the second pole.
The Rangers took control, but it seems they had more hope than conviction about their game in the offensive area.
Without a doubt, Alfredo Morelos felt they should have pitted a penalty at 15 minutes when he and Steven Lawless collided, but the referee, Steven Thomson, ignored the Colombian's claims.
The Rangers scored only two shots to the goal in the first half, but Ibrox's former guard, Liam Kelly, barely had problems with Lassana Coulibaly's header and Ovie Ejaria's attack.
While the opening of Livingston in the 34th minute could have gone against the logic of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it for their hard work.
The Rangers once again failed to cope with Jacobs' strong formation.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher fit the ball for Scott Robinson, who kept the blood cold to choose Menga for a single draw.
Gerrard acted in the break by switching Coulibaly to Ryan Kent, a change that almost had an immediate effect when the left made a pass to Morelos, but the imposing Kelly ran off his line to block him.
But Livingston continued to devour visitors by playing exactly the type of game they liked, with Lithgow and Halkett picking up a long ball after another.
Holt's team could have expanded the lead in the final moments, but McGregor rose perfectly to reject Jacobs before Lithgow headed from the corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton claimed another penalty by messing up with Jacobs, but Thomson turned his sights on him again.
Almanac: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page of our "Sunday Morning" almanach: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and CONTADO... was the day on which the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led him to the device known as the Geiger counter.
A pillar of science since then, the Geiger counter has also become a key element of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", starring those seemingly unusual cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Home: "What is this in the world?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, which is used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
By putting on these headphones, you can hear the effects of the atoms emitted by the radioactivity of the minerals."
Evans: "Say, surely it's bursting right now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days after his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name survives.
New Cancer Vaccine May Teach Immune System to “See” Defective Cells
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" defective cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize defective cells as part of treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient, altering them in the laboratory.
They can “see” a protein common to various cancers and inject it back
A test vaccine is showing promising results in patients with a variety of cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize defective cells, has seen her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient, which are altered in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein common to various types of cancer called HER2 and then reject the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 "drives the growth of various types of cancer", including those of breast, ovaries, lung and colorectal, Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach to extracting immune cells from patients and "teaching" them to address cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West embarked on a speech in favor of Trump wearing a MAGA (Make America Great Again) hat after his appearance on Saturday Night Live (SNL).
And the result was not good.
During a Saturday Night Live show, Kanye West was spotted in the studio after a confusing presentation in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run for office in 2020.
After playing the third song of the night, called Ghost Town, in which he wore a Make America Great Again cap, he criticized Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
“I often talk to a white man and say, ‘How can you like Trump if he’s racist?’
“If I were concerned about racism, I would have left the United States a long time ago,” he said.
SNL began the show with a satire starring Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee about the sexual assault lawsuits made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not aired, Chris Rock uploaded the images of West's criticism to social media.
It is unclear if Rock was trying to make fun of West with this post.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he had had a bad time behind the scenes due to his hat.
“They went with me behind the scenes.
They said, 'Don't go out with that hat.'
I was intimidated!
And then they said he was going to pick me up,” he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see how I'm getting pissed?", saying that I'd "use my superman cap, because it means you can't tell me what I have to do." Do you want the world to move forward?
Try it with love.”
His comments sparked a blast in the audience at least twice and the SNL cast seemed to be embarrassed, he told Variety magazine, with the following testimony that a person who was there testified to the publication: "The whole studio remained in absolute silence."
They had named West as the last replacement for Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West left many perplexed with a performance of the song I Love It, dressed as a Perrier water bottle.
West got the support of conservative group leader TPUSA, Candace Turner, who wrote the following tweet: "For one of the bravest spirits: THANK YOU FOR FRONTING THE MAFIA"
However, interview show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was simply “being who he is and that’s completely wonderful.”
“I chose not to reward anyone (by buying their music or clothing or supporting their ‘art’) who I think is embracing and spreading an ideology that is harmful to my community.
It's free.
Just like us,” he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying it was now "being officially known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name; he follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The rapper Snoop Dogg was named Snoop Lion and, of course, the last legend of the song, Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then the artist formerly known as Prince.
Man charged with attempted murder for stabbed to death at Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
The Public Prosecutor’s Office will review the charges.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his sword-handling role as Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
The 31-year-old actor attacked the stereotype of a male hero, saying that such roles on the screen translate into it appearing that young people often have to be tough to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said "something has failed" and wondered how to tackle the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that she feels "strong enough" to address the problem.
"Personally, I feel pretty strong right now. Where do we go wrong with masculinity?" he said.
"What do we teach men when they grow up, in terms of the problem we see now?"
Kit believes that television may be partially responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity thanks to its very masculine characters.
He continued, "What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught on television and on the streets; what makes young people feel like they have to be that particular part of being a man?
I think that’s one of the big questions of our time; how do we change that?
“Something went wrong with the kids.”
In the interview, he also admitted that he will not make any prequels or sequels to Game of Thrones when the series comes to an end next summer, stating that "enough of horses and battlefields."
Starting in November, Kit will star in a remake of True West by Sam Shepard, which tells the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
Recently, the actor revealed that he considers his encounter with his wife, Rose, was the best of Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife on this show, so in a way she provided me with my future family and my life from here on out,” he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the love of Kit's character, Jon Snow, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 on Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV or AIDS.
It affects more than 820,000 people in the country, health authorities said.
40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new cases have been sexually transmitted, which marks a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly to parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who contracted HIV in this way had been reduced to virtually zero, Chinese health authorities said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, in interannual terms, the number of people living with HIV or AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Sexual transmission of HIV poses a serious problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was discriminated against in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people has spread.
Due to the country’s conservative values, studies estimate that between 70 and 90% of men who have sex with other men will end up marrying women.
Many of the transmissions of the disease come from inadequate sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged universal access to HIV mediation as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that a staff member leaked data from Republican senators, "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
On Saturday, U.S. Representative Maxine Waters denounced allegations that a member of her staff had published personal information of three U.S. Republican Party senators on the legislators' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat said the statements were being made by websites and "ultra-right" commentators.
“Lies, lies, and more infamous lies,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information circulated included the private addresses and telephone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch of Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, published by an unknown person at Capitol Hill, the U.S. government headquarters, during a Senate panel hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak appeared shortly after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address identifying the origin of the posts was associated with the Waters Department and disclosed information from a Waters staff member, Capitol Hill reported.
“This unfounded allegation is totally false and a complete lie,” Waters continued.
“The member of my staff, whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised as a result of these false and fraudulent allegations, was not responsible in any way for the leak of this information.
This unfounded accusation is totally false and a complete lie.”
Waters' statement promptly aroused online criticism, including that of former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer.
“This denial was done with anger,” Fleischer wrote.
He has no temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone accuses you of something you didn’t do, you shouldn’t be angry.
It should not be challenging.
You should not question the defendant’s motives.
It must remain calm and serene.”
It seemed that Fleischer was comparing Waters' reaction to the criticism of Judge Kavanaugh's Democrats, to whom critics accused of appearing too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who ran to defeat Waters in the midterm elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"I'm sure you're right," he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said his department had alerted "law enforcement agencies and appropriate authorities of these fraudulent allegations.
“We will make sure that the culprits are discovered and that they are legally held responsible for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to everyone and every member of my team.”
Johnny English Strikes Again (Johnny English: De nuevo en acción), the powerless spy parody of Rowan Atkinson
It is already traditional to seek the transcendence of Brexit in new films from a British point of view and it seems that this can be applied to the return of the Johnny English parody and action comedy franchise, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and came back to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn ("Johnny English Returns").
Will the ironic satire become about the issue of the obviously stupid that we are in the nation’s new export opportunity?
Either way, Johnny English's incompetent gum-eyed and gum-faced character has renewed his license to ruin things for the second time. His name is already a clear indication that this is a general comic creation designed for non-English-speaking cinemaphile territories.
Naturally, it is the silly secret agent who, despite his oddly flattering glamour pretensions, has a bit of Clouseau, a hint of Mr Bean and a piece of that kind that contributed a single note on the theme of Fire Cars at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
It is also originally based on the cosmopolitan and mysterious international agent that Atkinson once played in Barclaycard's now-forgotten television commercials, in which he sowed chaos at his passing.
There are a couple of good moments in Johnny English's last outing.
I love it when Johnny English approaches a helicopter while wearing a medieval suit of armor and the rotor steps make a brief roar against his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy jumps in the face, but gives the impression that humor has little strength and is strangely superfluous, especially when such "serious" films, such as 007 and Mission Impossible, already use comedy convincingly as one of its ingredients.
It seems like humor was directed at children, rather than adults, and, in my opinion, Johnny English’s extravagant misadventures are not as ingenious or concentrated as Atkinson’s silent-movie jokes when embodying Bean’s character.
Now the permanently topical argument is that Britain has serious problems.
A cyber pirate infiltrates the super-secret web spy network of Britain and reveals the identities of all the British agents in the area, to the anguish of the agent in service, an unfortunate little role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the culmination for a pompous and conflicting prime minister, who already suffers a total crisis of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson gives her best with this character that almost looks like Theresa May, but you can't do much with the script.
Your intelligence advisers inform you that as all active spies are committed, you will need to get someone out of retirement.
And that refers to the incompetent Johnny English himself, who now works as a teacher at some snob institution, but gives unofficial lessons on how to become an infiltrated agent; in this part there are some jokes, when English offers the spy academy to a rock school.
They take English back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and meet with his former and suffering companion Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a man married to a submarine captain, an enthusiastic role in which Vicki Pepperdine is somewhat lost.
So the Batman and Robin of Her Majesty's Secret Service mistakes return to action, stumbling upon Olga Kurylenko's beautiful fatal wife, Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is dangerously succumbing to the charm of the charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve British computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of ridiculous falconry: disguised as waiters, they set fire to an ostentatious French restaurant; create a turmoil that illegally puts them aboard Volta's luxury yacht; and English provokes total anarchy by trying to use virtual reality helmets to get acquainted with the interior of the house.
Obviously, all arrests come from this latest sequence, but in the kind and scandalous way it is, it seems taken out of a children's television show.
The result is quite regular.
And, as with other Johnny English films, I couldn’t help but think: the British film industry can’t offer Rowan Atkinson a role that really does justice to his talent?
The Labour Party denies that it is designing a plan for the British to work four days a week, but they charge for five days
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party is considering a radical plan that will make the British work four days a week, but they charge for five.
Presumably, the party wants employers to spend the savings achieved through the Artificial Intelligence (AI) revolution on workers by offering them an extra day off.
In this way, employees would enjoy a three-day weekend, but would still receive the same salary.
Sources say the idea would "adjust" to the party's economic agenda and its plans to incline the country in favor of workers.
The Congress of Trade Unions supported the four-day weekly shifts as a measure for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
An important Labour source told The Sunday Times: "A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
“It won’t happen overnight, but a four-day working week is an ambition that aligns with the party’s approach to balancing the economy in favor of the worker, as well as the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day working week during its 2017 general election campaign.
At the moment, however, the Labour Party does not fully support the ambition.
A Labour Party spokesman said: “A four-day working week does not enter the party’s policy and is not being considered by the party.”
The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, used last week’s Labour Party conference to reinforce his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to regain the power of "anonymous directors" and "speculators" in public service companies.
The chancellor’s plans in the shadow also imply the possibility that current shareholders of water companies will not recover their entire investment, as a Labour government could make “deductions” due to perceived irregularities.
It also confirmed plans to place workers on corporate boards and create inclusive ownership funds to deliver 10% of private sector companies’ shares to employees, who pocket annual dividends worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy on “60 Minutes” if FBI investigation of Kavanaugh could make them change their minds
The FBI's investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed at least a week the final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court. It raises the question of whether the department's findings could influence Republican senators to withdraw their support for him.
On Sunday, in an interview broadcast, 60 Minutes reporter Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could uncover something that would lead them to change their minds.
Kennedy was more open-minded than his South Carolina counterpart.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
"I said I was going to the hearing. I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the indictment came out and asked him if he had done it.
It was firm, determined, rounded.”
However, Graham's vote seems to be unmovable.
"My opinion about Brett Kavanaugh is determined and would make an explosive accusation," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened; but I know the following: Brett denied it rottenly," Graham added in reference to Christine Blasey Ford.
And the people you mentioned couldn’t verify it.
It happened 36 years ago.
I don’t see anything new.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and did something to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that has an impressive cartel of stars to perform and an equally impressive mission to end global poverty.
In its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see thousands of people flocking to the Great Lawn area of Central Park, not only to enjoy performances like those of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness about the event’s real goal of ending poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international support group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free ticket for the event (unless you want to pay for a VIP ticket), the attending audience had to complete a number of tasks or "actions", such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call or any other meaningful way to help raise awareness about your goal of poaching.
But what is the degree of success achieved by the Global Citizen in 12 years of achieving its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a genuine way to persuade people to ask for action or is it just another case of so-called “clitivism,” people who think it makes a difference when signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its followers, driving a set of different goals.
It claims that these actions have helped stimulate world leaders to announce commitments and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion set to influence the lives of more than 2.250 million people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements derived from its shares, of which at least $10 billion has already been disbursed or raised.
The group estimates that so far the guaranteed funds have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK investor and executor society that has pledged to "help children develop to their full potential", with the promise to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 global tweets.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national authorities and Global Citizen supporters like you, we can turn the social injustice of malnutrition into a footnote of history," The Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman told the crowd during a live concert in April 2018 in London.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were taken in favor of improving mother and child nutrition in the UK, the government announced funding for The Power of Nutrition project that will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on your website, “What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?”,
Global Citizen responded: “It will be a long and difficult journey and sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, just as it happened with the great anti-apartheid movements and in favor of the civil rights that precede us, we will achieve it, because together, we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe are some of the artists who will perform at this year’s event in New York, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. could use the navy to carry out a "blockade" to hinder Russia's energy exports, the U.S. Secretary of the Interior announced.
"In case it is necessary," Washington could resort to the Navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including the Middle East, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke said, citing the Washington Examiner.
Zinke argued that Russia’s engagement in Syria, especially where it operates at the behest of legitimate government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
“I think the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to negotiate with energy in the same way they did in Eastern Europe,” he said.
In addition, according to the official, they have the forms and means to deal with it.
“The United States has the capacity, along with the Navy, to ensure that maritime routes are open and, if necessary, block them to ensure that their energy does not go to market,” he said.
Zinke addressed the participants of the event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that calls itself the "energy consumer voice" in the US.
He compared Washington’s strategies for dealing with Russia and Iran, considering that in practice it is the same.
"The economic option in Iran and Russia is, more or less, to exploit and replace fuels," he said, while referring to Russia saying it "has only one tactic" with a hydrocarbon-dependent economy.
The statements were made while the Trump administration was on a mission to boost exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, in order to replace that of Russia, the most economical option for European consumers.
To this end, officials in the Trump administration, including the president himself, tried to persuade Germany to withdraw from the “inadequate” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, made Berlin a “captive” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which has been set to double the capacity of the existing pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is a mere economic project.
The Kremlin argued that Washington’s fierce opposition to the project is argued only for economic reasons and that it is an example of unfair competition.
“I think we share the idea that energy cannot be a tool to exert pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after meeting U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in September in Moscow.
The U.S. position obtained the reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading German industry organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has urged the US to move away from EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, president of the BDI, after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will carefully consider her 2020 presidential nomination, says Massachusetts senator
On Saturday, Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren said she would carefully examine her candidacy for the presidency after the midterm elections.
During a public meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider his candidacy.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and repair the broken government and that includes a woman in power,” she said.
"After November 6, I will carefully consider my presidential nomination."
Warren commented on President Donald Trump during the public assembly, saying he was "taking this country in the wrong direction.
“I am very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” he said.
Warren was frank in her criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren commented in a tweet "Of course an FBI investigation is needed before the vote."
However, in a poll published Thursday, it was shown that most Warren voters themselves do not believe he will be running for office in 2020.
Fifty percent of Massachusetts's "probable" voters said the senator would not submit her candidacy, according to a poll by the University of Suffolk's Center for Political Research and the Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported the nomination.
The poll showed more support for former governor Deval Patrick's candidacy, with 38 percent support for a possible candidacy and 48 percent against.
Other prominent names of Democrats in connection with a possible 2020 candidacy include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide before January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin cites Track Palin’s Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) at Donald Trump’s rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with a domestic violence incident.
"What my own son is going through, what he is going through again, I can see myself reflected in other families who feel the consequences of PTSD and some of the wounds with which our soldiers are returning," he told the audience at a Donald Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin said his arrest was a taboo subject and that his son and other war veterans, "return different, hardened, wondering if there is any respect for what fellow militia and airmen, as well as other members of the army, offered to the country."
They were arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, interfering with a report of domestic violence and possession of a gun while drunk, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla police department.
18 states and the District of Columbia challenge new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a judicial appeal in connection with a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence or criminal organizations.
On Friday, representatives from 18 states and the district filed a friendly report from the court in Washington to support an asylum seeker who challenges politics, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff's claim of Sessions of Grace v. the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against the federal policy has not been revealed.
She said her partner "and her children members of a violent criminal organization" abused her, but that U.S. officials rejected her application for asylum on July 20.
Detained in Texas.
Lawyers from the states that support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce a large number of asylum seekers for the U.S., as nations facing widespread problems with criminal organizations and related to domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy revoked a 2014 decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy “ignores decades of state, federal and international legislation.”
"Federal legislation requires all asylum applications to be adjudicated according to the specific facts and circumstances of the application, and said prohibition violates that principle," the court's friend's report explained.
The prosecutors continued to debate in the report that the policy of rejecting immigrants harms the U.S. economy, explaining that they are likely to become entrepreneurs and that they “provided labor.”
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and violence from criminal organizations.
“Asylum is available to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or belonging to a particular social group or political opinion,” Sessions said in his June 11 announcement.
Asylum has never been meant to alleviate all the problems (including all the serious problems) that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as the number of victims doubles in a race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation is getting worse.
"The circumstances are very tense," said 35-year-old Risa Kusuma, comforting her feverish baby in the evacuation center of the devastated city of Palu.
“Every minute an ambulance arrives with bodies.
Clean water is scarce.”
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes, picking up their drowned belongings, trying to save anything they found.
Hundreds of people have been injured and the hospitals, damaged by the magnitude 7.5 earthquake, are overflowing.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who fractured his back and shoulder, rested outside the Palu Military Hospital, where patients were treated outdoors due to continuous and strong replicas.
Tears filled his eyes as he explained how he felt the violent earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor he shared with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to save us.
The ruins of the wall crushed me, I think," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was at a wedding in the city.
"I heard my wife ask for help and then just silence.
I don’t know what happened to her or my daughter.
I hope they are safe.”
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of Abusing ‘Propaganda Ads’
A week after a Chinese official newspaper published a four-page ad in a U.S. newspaper preaching the benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accuses Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump referred to the China Daily payment supplement on the Des Moines Register, the state's best-selling newspaper, after accusing China of interfering in the November 6 U.S. Congressional elections, a fact China denies.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the U.S. election marked what officials in the country coined on Reuters as a new phase of Washington’s growing campaign to coerce China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to publish ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently trapped in a growing trade war witnessing the levelling of tariffs on their respective imports.
According to experts from China and the US, China’s countervailing tariffs at the start of the trade war were designed to harm exporters from states like Iowa, which supports Trump’s Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, one of the leading exporters of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had harmed U.S. workers, farmers and businessmen.
In an opinion paper written by Branstad and published in Sunday's edition of the Moines Register, it was stated that China "is intensifying that harassment campaign by spreading propaganda advertisements in the free American press."
"By spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government takes advantage of the much-appreciated American tradition of freedom of expression and press by publishing a payment announcement on the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"On the contrary, in the newspaper post at the end of this street in Beijing, there are few dissident voices and there is no real reflection of the disparate opinions that the Chinese can have about China's worrying economic trajectory, given that the media are under the firm thumb of the Chinese Communist Party," he added.
He also claims that "one of China's most important newspapers declined the offer to publish" his article, although it did not confirm which newspaper it is.
Kavanaugh's Disaster Loses Female Republican Vote Few Days After Midterm Elections
While many of the top Republicans support and defend Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, despite various allegations of sexual assault, analysts warn of a violent reaction, especially from female voters, in the upcoming midterm elections.
Reactions around these accusations were numerous and the majority of Republicans positioned themselves to proceed with the vote.
"These things cannot be undone," said Grant Reeher, a political science professor at Syracuse University's Maxwell School in an article published Sunday in The Hill.
Reeher also said he doubted that Senator Jeff Flake's (R-Arizona) last minute for an FBI investigation would be enough to calm the moods of angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday, nor will they forget it in the near future or in November," Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, told the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, opponents of the “November is Near!” flu protested in the Senate corridor, while Republicans, with control of the Judiciary Committee, decided to move forward with Kavanaugh’s appointment, despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford’s testimony, Mic reported.
"The motivation and enthusiasm of the Democrats will exceed any expectations," Stu Rothenberg, a neutral political analyst, told the news site.
“It’s already high.
But it is even more so, especially among indecisive women from the outskirts or those between the ages of 18 and 29 who, although they do not like the President, do not usually go to the polls."
Before Ford's public testimony detailed his allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court candidates, analysts suggested it was possible to undergo a violent reaction if the Republicans went ahead with the confirmation.
"This has become a disaster for the Republican Party," Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, told NBC News earlier this week.
"This goes beyond the committee vote, the final vote or whether or not Kavanaugh will sit on the defendants' bench. The problem is how the Republicans handled this and how they treated her," said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats on the news channel.
However, it seems that Americans are divided as to whether to believe the testimony of Ford or Kavanaugh, although they are more inclined to support the latter.
A new YouGov survey shows that 41 percent of respondents believe Ford’s testimony in full or likely, compared to 35 percent who support Kavanaugh’s testimony.
In addition, 38% believe that Kavanaugh is most likely to lie during his testimony, compared to 30% who think the same as Ford.
Under pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the charges filed by Ford, as well as those of at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
Last week, Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath that Kavanaugh attacked her in her drunken state when she was 17.
On the contrary, Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate showed her genitals at a college party when she was studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The creator of the World Wide Web wants to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt, the latest project of this technology legend, is a company based on Solid, Berners-Lee's open source platform.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and which people can access what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee chanced Inrupt's intention to "dominate the world".
“We have to do it,” he said of the start-up.
"This is a historic moment."
The app uses Solid’s technology to allow people to create their own “online personal data warehouse” or POD.
Contact lists, pending task lists, calendars, music, and other personal and professional tools may be included.
It’s as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify were available in a single browser at the same time.
All this makes this personal data store unique is that the user has full control over who can access that information.
The company describes this as “personal empowerment through data.”
Inrupt’s idea, according to its president John Bruce, is that the company provides appropriate resources, processes, and skills to help make Solid available to everyone.
The company is currently formed by Berners-Lee, Bruce, an IBM-owned security company, some developers hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, developers from around the world could create their own decentralized apps with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee stated that neither he nor his team spoke with "Facebook or Google about whether or not to introduce a complete change that would change their business models from day to day.
“We don’t need your permission.”
In an article published Saturday in Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that "the mission of Inrupt is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of a new web based on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by establishing the World Wide Web Consortium community at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has emerged as an influential voice in the debate over net neutrality.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee continues to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium community, as well as the Web Foundation and Open Data Institute organizations.
“I’m very optimistic about this new era of the web,” Berners-Lee added.
Tribute to Bernard Vann, clergyman decorated with the Cross of Victoria in World War I
The only clergyman of the Church of England who was awarded the Cross of Victory during World War I received a posthumous tribute in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel and Reverend Bernard Vann was awarded on September 29, 1918, in the attack of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later without knowing that he had been awarded the largest British military decoration.
On Saturday, his two grandchildren were tasked with discovering a memorial in his honor at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
Michael Vann, one of his grandchildren, enhanced the symbolism of discovering this monument just 100 years after his grandfather’s feat that earned him the title.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann directed his battalion through the Saint-Quentin Canal "through a dense fog and under the yoke of an intense machine gun fire".
Later he hurried to reach the line of fire and, with "great courage", led the line forward before rushing with a cannon and without anyone's help, and knocking down three people from the enemy detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a month before the war was over.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "something he could never live with, but a lesson still."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also placed a crown of flowers after the parade, which led the youth band Brentwood Imperial.
Michael Vann said he was "very honored to participate in the parade" and added that "the value of this genuine hero demonstrates the support of so many people."
Peppa Pig cuts the roll to MMA fans at the best time
Imagine that you take all night smart to enjoy the full Bellator 206 show, and when the best part arrives something stops you.
The San Jose cartel included 13 fights, the top six, and was broadcast live in the UK on Channel 5.
But at 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were about to see their faces, viewers in the UK were puzzled when they saw Peppa Pig appear.
Some weren’t impressed after spending so many hours waiting to see the fight.
One fan described the change to these children's cartoons on Twitter as "a very bad taste joke."
"State regulations rule that that content was not appropriate for 6 a.m., and so it had to be switched to children's programming," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president of Marketing and Communications, when asked about the retransmission.
"Peppa Pig, that's it."
Scott Coker, president of Bellator, said they will take UK viewers into account in future programming.
“I think we can solve it when we think of repetition,” Coker said.
"But if it's 6 a.m. there, we can't fix it until Sunday, which is already Monday for them.
We are working to find a solution.
When the change took place I started to receive a lot of messages and not all were pleasant.
We were trying to fix it because we thought it was a technical error.
No, it was a government problem.
I promise it won’t happen again.
We'll limit ourselves to five fights, instead of six. We wanted to give our fans the most, but we passed and
It hurts a lot of anger.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior because of his sexuality
Olympic jumper Tom Daley claims he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality, but this made him find the motivation to succeed.
This 24-year-old athlete claims that he did not realize that not everyone was like him until he arrived at high school.
Guest of the first broadcast of Radio 4’s Desert Island Discs program led by Lauren Laverne, she explained that she began talking about the rights of homosexuals to give hope to others.
He also shared that being a father helped him relativize the importance of winning the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the regular host of this show, is on sick leave.
As a guest on Laverne's first show, Daley shared that he felt "inferior" to the rest of the people because "it was socially unacceptable that you liked boys and girls."
“To this day, that feeling of inferiority and being different has driven me and given me the strength to succeed.”
I wanted to prove that I was “someone” so that people wouldn’t feel disappointed when they discovered their sexuality.
With two bronze Olympic medals, he became a prominent LGBT activist and used his appearance at the Commonwealth Games in Australia to call for more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He decided to speak because he felt lucky to be able to live openly and without fear of repercussions, and wanted to give hope to others.
The three-time world champion said falling in love with American director Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, "was a complete surprise."
Daley married this Oscar winner last year and claims that the 20-year difference between them was never a problem.
"When you live so long in such a short time" (at just 14 years old he first participated in the Olympics and his father died of cancer three years later), it's hard to find someone your age who had experienced similar ups and downs.
The couple had their first child in June, Robert Ray Black-Daley, and this birth made Daley completely change her perspective.
“If you asked me last year, my biggest motivation would be to win a gold medal,” he said.
"But now I know there are things much more important than an Olympic gold medal.
For me, my medal is Robbie."
His son is named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
Daley's father did not accept that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked his son was a ticket to London in 2012, he wanted to be in the front row.
“I wasn’t able to tell him I wouldn’t be here to occupy that first row,” Daley said.
"I was holding his hand when he stopped breathing and it was at that very moment, at the moment of his death, that I realized that he was really not invincible," he added.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"At that moment I knew that was the dream of my life: to jump in front of a crowd in my country participating in the Olympics, there was no better feeling," he said.
Heather Small's Proud song choice is also not in vain, as it is the melody that accompanied her during her preparation for the Olympics and still puts her hair on the tip.

A low-form Mickelson ended up on the Ryder Cup bench on Saturday.
American Phil Mickelson will break a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but will have to improve his technique so that it does not become an unfortunate event.
Mickelson, who participates in the biennial event for the 12th time, stayed at the bank by Captain Jim Furyk's decision and was unable to participate in the fourball or Saturday's foursomes.
Instead of being the center of action, like so many other times for the United States, the five-time champion spent the day encouraging and working to improve his movements.
Although he was never the most accurate of the players, not even at the peak of his career, at the age of 48 he does not fit into the tight course of Le Golf National, where high grass usually punishes the wrong shots.
And even if that wasn’t enough, Mickelson faced in Sunday’s ninth match precisely Francesco Molinari, the British Open winner, who joined Tommy Fleetwood to win the four games this week.
If the Americans, four points below the start of the 12 individual matches, start well, Mickelson's performance could be totally crucial.
Furyk trusted her husband, although he could not say much more.
"He perfectly understood the role he was playing today, gave me a slap on the shoulder, passed my arm and told me that tomorrow he would be ready," Furyk said.
“I had full confidence in myself.
He has a prominent place in the Hall of Fame and has contributed a lot to the teams last week and this week.
I didn’t think I would have played two games.
I thought I’d play more, but in the end, that’s the way things are and that’s how we thought they should be.
Like everyone else, he wants to be out there.”
On Sunday, Mickelson will break Nick Faldo's record for the most games played in the Ryder Cup.
He could mark the end of his career in the Ryder Cup, a career that has never reached the level of his individual scoring.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven halves, although Furyk claims his presence also provides the team with inseparable strength.
“He’s a fun, sarcastic person, with genius and he likes to get into people, he’s a good guy to have on the team,” he explained.
"I like to see how well the youngest players have had with him this week.
It’s more like a good player.”
The captain of Europe, Thomas Bjorn, fears for the disappearance of the advantage
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a considerable advantage in the last day of the Ryder Cup individual can easily become an awkward journey.
The Great Dane made his debut in 1997 in a game in Valderrama, where a team captained by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but they ended up reaching the finish line with a minimum lead by winning 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"You still think we had a big advantage in Valderrama; just like in Brookline, where we lost, but in Valderrama we won by little," reflects Bjorn, in the photo, after seeing the 2018 promotion win 5-3 on Friday and, yesterday, 10-6 at Le Golf National.
History shows that this is not over yet.
I have to go for all of them tomorrow.
You have to go out and do the right thing.
This does not end until the points are in the marker.
Our goal is to win that trophy, and we have to focus on that.
I won’t get tired of saying it, I’m focused on our 12 players who are on our side, but I’m also very aware of what’s on the other side: the best players in the world.”
Delighted with the performance of his players on a tough golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never sing victory before time.
Tomorrow we will face another beast.
Tomorrow is the day of the individual performances, and there too we have to prove our worth.
It’s great to be with a partner when things are going well, but when you face things individually, then put your golfing skills to the test.
That’s the message you need to convey to the players, who get the best out of themselves tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind, and he too must get the best out of himself.”
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk will seek for his players to have a better individual performance than his teammates, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk himself was on both ends of those last-day rounds, being part of the winning team at Brookline, but finishing as a loser after the European miracle at Medinah."
"I remember every damn word," he replied when asked if he remembered how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had gathered the players for the last day.
"We have 12 important matches, but you would like to have a quick start like Brookline or Medinah.
When you see the momentum going in one direction, there is a lot of pressure on those intermediate parties.
We prepared our alignment taking this into account and put the players as we thought, we want to do magic tomorrow."
Thomas has the task of trying to lead the fight and confront Rory McIlroy in the first match, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans, in the top half of the standings.
"I decided this order because I think it covers the whole way," Bjorn explained about his selection for the individuals.
Germany's new warship postponed once again
The newest frigate of the German Navy should have been delivered in 2014, to replace the old warships of the Cold War era, but it will not arrive until at least next year due to faulty systems and the increasing cost, local media reported.
The commissioning of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the leading ship of the flaming frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class, was delayed until the first half of 2019, according to a military spokesman for the newspaper Die Zeit.
The ship should have been incorporated into the Navy in 2014, but post-delivery problems affected the destination of this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships, commissioned by the Navy in 2007, will replace the former Bremen-class frigates.
It is understood that they will have a powerful cannon, with different anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as with concealment technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods, it should be possible to deploy the younger frigates up to two years outside the ports of origin.
However, as Die Zeit well points out, these continuous delays mean that warships with the latest technology, and which will allow Germany to project their power abroad, will be obsolete when they enter service.
The unfortunate frigate F125 was news last year, when the German Navy officially refused to commission the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to a builder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons behind this return, but the German media spoke of "crucial defects in software and hardware" that made it impossible to use the warship in a combat mission.
Software defects were particularly important, as the Baden-Württemberg-class ships would be operated by a crew of 120 sailors; that is, half of the necessary personnel in the former Bremen-class frigates.
In addition, it was found that the ship had a dramatic excess weight, which reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to add improvements in the future.
The 7,000-ton Rheinland-Pfalz is thought to weigh twice as much as the similar-class ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the defective hardware, the total cost of the project, which includes crew training, is also becoming a problem.
It is said that it has already reached the astonishing amount of 3,1 billion euros, compared to the initial 2,200 million.
The problems of the newer frigates are of particular importance in light of recent warnings that Germany's naval power is making waters.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the defence committee of the German parliament, acknowledged that the Navy is running out of ships fit to deploy.
The officer claims that this problem is growing, as the old ships were withdrawn, but not replaced by others.
He also regretted that none of the frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class could join the Navy.
National Trust spies on the secret life of bats
A new research is being conducted on a farm in the Scottish Highlands to reveal how bats use the landscape to hunt for food.
The results are expected to shed light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
This study led by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland will follow the bats Pipistrellus pygmaeus and Pipistrellus pipistrellus, as well as the bat Myotis daubentonii and Plecotus auritus in the Inverewe gardens at Wester Ross.
Special recording equipment will be placed in key locations around the property to track bat activities during the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys with manual detectors.
A sound analysis by experts of all recordings will determine the frequency of calls from bats and what each species is doing.
A habitat map will then be drawn up to create a detailed landscape-scale image of your behavior.
Rob Dewar, NTS Nature Conservation Advisor, expects the results to show which habitat areas are more important to bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as creating meadows and what is the best way to maintain forests for bats and other associated species.
Flea populations in Scotland and across the UK have declined considerably in the last century.
These animals are threatened by the construction and development works that affect children and the loss of habitat.
Aerogenerators and lighting also pose a risk, as do fly glue traps, some chemical treatments of building materials, and attacks from domestic cats.
The bats are not blind.
But due to their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when hunting.
They use a sophisticated ecolocation technique to locate insects and obstacles in their flight trajectory.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
It has ten trained experts, who conduct periodic surveys, child inspections and sometimes even rescues.
The organization even counts on Scotland's only and first bat reserve at Threave Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
David Thompson, the estate manager, claims that this is the ideal territory for them.
"In Threave we have a large area for bats," he says.
"We have old buildings, historic trees and a great habitat.
But there are many things we don’t yet know about bats, so the work we do here and on other properties will help us better understand what they need to thrive.”
It highlights the importance of controlling the presence of bats before carrying out maintenance tasks on the properties, as it is possible that the involuntary destruction of a single maternity child could kill up to 400 females and offspring, which could exterminate an entire local population.
Bats are a protected species and it is illegal to kill, harass or molest them, as well as destroy their children.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official of the Bat Conservation Trust, encourages people to help:
"There's still a lot to learn about bats and, in the case of many of the species, we don't know how their populations are doing."
Ronaldo dismisses rape lawsuits and his lawyers prepare to sue German publication
Cristiano Ronaldo described the allegations of rape as false, claiming that the only thing he wants people to know is using his name.
His lawyers will sue the German magazine Der Spiegel for publishing these allegations.
The head coach of Portugal and Juventus was accused of raping Kathryn Mayorga, an American woman, at a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
It is alleged that the footballer paid the woman $375,000 to say nothing about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Hours after his publication, Ronaldo, 33, tagged this fake news in a live video from his Instagram account, which has 142 million followers.
No, not a thousand times no.
What was said today is false," said the five-time Golden Ball winner.
“People want to get to know me by my name.
It is normal,
They want to be famous by just saying my name, it’s part of my work.
I am a happy and respectable man,” the player added smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for the charges, which they call "an inadmissible statement of suspicion in the area of privacy," according to Reuters.
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for "moral damages for an amount corresponding to the severity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident took place in June 2019, in a suite at the Palm Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her anally, according to documents filed in the Clark County District Court of Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo, after the alleged incident, kneeled down saying that he was 99% a gentleman, but that 1% had betrayed him.
The documents assure that Ronaldo confirms that both have had sexual relations consented by both parties.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and had photographs of the wounds, but later reached an extrajudicial agreement because she felt terrified of reprisals and worried about public mockery.
The 34-year-old woman says she is seeking to revoke the deal while still traumatized by the alleged incident.
At the time of the alleged crime, Ronaldo was about to meet with Real Madrid from Manchester United, and this summer he joined Italian giant Juve in a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million deal.
Brexit: Car manufacturers to leave UK
The UK would forever regret the loss of its position as the world’s leading automaker after Brexit, according to Business Secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it is worrying that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily halt production at its Burnaston plant near Derby.
"A deal needs to be reached," Clark added.
The Japanese automaker said that if no agreement was reached, the impact of the delays at the border could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant, responsible for manufacturing Toyota’s Auris and Avensis models, produced about 150,000 vehicles last year, of which 90% were exported to the rest of the EU.
“In my opinion, if Britain leaves the EU by the end of March, we will be witnessing how production stops at our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota CEO at Burnaston.
Other UK automakers have also expressed their fear of leaving the EU without reaching an agreement on the functioning of cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW has confirmed that it will close its Mini plant in Oxford a month after Brexit.
One of the main concerns of car manufacturers is the risk of the supply chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line is very tight, with parts from UK and EU suppliers arriving every 37 minutes for custom-made cars.
If the UK leaves the EU on 29 March without a deal, the border could be affected and delays and shortages of parts could be generated.
The company claims that it would be impossible for Toyota to maintain a normal pace for more than a day at the Derbyshire plant, so production would have to stop.
Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is "precisely calibrated to avoid such border checks."
"It is essential to have an agreement. And we want it to be the best agreement, in order to enjoy the current success but also to make the most of this opportunity," he said on BBC Radio 4's Today program.
"The experience of Toyota and other manufacturers is that it is necessary to continue these excellent supply chains."
Toyota could not estimate how long production would stop, but warned that in the long run the added costs would reduce the plant’s competition and could even cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, a Burnaston employee for 24 years and union coordinator for Unite, said his members are increasingly concerned: "By experience, I know that once these jobs disappear, they never return.
A government spokesman said they had presented a precise and credible plan for the future relationship between the UK and the EU.
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed
The White House said Donald Trump’s high-risk meeting with Assistant Secretary of Justice Rosenstein could be delayed another week due to the fight for Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the election, links between Russia's aides and Trump, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether or not Trump fires the deputy attorney general, which would jeopardize Mueller’s independence, fueled rumors in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein spoke of using a microphone to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of dismissing the President through the 25th Amendment.
However, Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday he went to the White House, amid reports that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced with Trump, who was in New York on Thursday.
Trump said he would rather not have to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was delayed to avoid a clash with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who accuse him of sexual misconduct, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the vote in the Senate.
Sarah Sanders, Trump’s press secretary, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
To the question about the meeting with Rosenstein, he replied: "There is still no set date, it could be this week or be delayed another week, given everything that is happening in the Supreme Court.
We’ll see, but you know I like that the press is informed.”
Some journalists have questioned this claim, as Sanders has not held a press conference since September 10.
When Chris Wallace asked him why,
Sanders said the lack of briefings was not due to an aversion to the reporters' grandiosity, although she added that it would not be her who denied that attitude.
He also suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
"The president grants more interviews than the previous president," he said, although he did not cite any sources supporting that data.
Press briefings will continue, Sanders said, but insisted that "if the press has the opportunity to ask directly to the President of the United States, that is much better than asking questions to him.
You are witnesses of how we have been doing this over the last few weeks, and that will replace a press conference in which you can speak directly to the President of the United States."
Trump usually answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
However, solo press conferences are scarce.
Perhaps the president demonstrated the motive this week in New York, with a free and occasionally odd appearance before the journalists gathered.
A letter from the Health Secretariat to calm the spirits before Brexit
The Health Secretariat has sent a letter to EU workers at Scotland’s NHS expressing the country’s gratitude and expressing their desire to stay in the country after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter less than six months after the UK left the EU.
The Scottish government has pledged to cover the cost of covered status applications for EU citizens working in their decentralised public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on abandonment continued, and decisions are expected to be reached this fall.
However, the UK government, for its part, has also stepped up its preparations for a possible no-deal situation.
This is a time of unrest for everyone.
Therefore, I want to reiterate how much I value the contribution of each of the staff members, regardless of their nationality.
Our colleagues from the European Union and beyond provide an indisputable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the health service work, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here with us.”
Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after a head injury
Christion Abercrombie, a Tennessee State Tigers linebacker, underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury during Saturday's (31-27) defeat against the Vanderbilt Commodores, Tennessean's Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee State coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before the break.
He seemed to faint when he got to the band line.
The trainers and medical staff gave him oxygen on the line before taking him on a stretcher for a further evaluation.
A Tennessee State technician told Chris Harris, a WSMV reporter in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was recovering from surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
He also added that there are still no details of the type or extent of the injury, and that Tennessee State is trying to find out when that injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year student in a red t-shirt, is in his first season with Tennessee State after being transferred from Illinois.
He made five entries in total on Saturday before leaving the game, raising his total to 18 the season.
A ringtone tax will apply to foreign buyers who buy a property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher bell tax when they buy a property in the UK. This additional money will be used to help homeless people under the new Conservative plans.
This measure will neutralize the success of Corbyn’s campaign to attract young voters
The increase in the stamp duty will apply to those people who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Treasury expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help homeless people
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher toll tax when they buy a property in the UK. Theresa May will announce that this additional money will be used to help homeless people.
The move will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s campaign to attract young voters with promises to promote more affordable housing and focus on high-income people.
The increase in the stamp duty will apply to people and businesses who do not pay taxes in the UK, and the money raised will serve to support the government’s campaign to reduce the number of people sleeping on the street.
The surcharge, which is added to the current bell tax, including the highest levels introduced two years ago for second homes and purchases for rent, can be up to 3%.
The company expects the change to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
Approximately 13% of new constructions made in London are purchased by non-residents in the UK, which is causing an increase in prices and making it harder for people who want to buy a home for the first time to have more difficulty accessing the real estate market.
Many wealthy areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become "ghost cities" due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
This new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson applied for a cut in the estate transfer tax to help young people acquire their first home.
He accused major home builders of keeping home prices high by buying land and not using it, and urged Mrs May to remove the percentages of tax revenues on moderate-priced homes to fix the “shame of the housing sector” living in Britain.
Mr. Corbyn announced an attractive series of housing-related reform proposals, including the control of rents and the prohibition of derelictions in which the tenant is not to blame.
It also wants to give the city councils greater powers when it comes to building new homes.
Mrs May said: “Last year I said I would dedicate my mandate to restoring the British dream: that life should be better for each new generation.
This is why we need to rebuild the disastrous housing market.
Britain will always be open to anyone who wants to live, work and start a life here.
However, it is not fair that it is as easy for those people who do not live in the UK, as well as for foreign-based companies, to buy housing as for UK-based workers.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home is too far away, and the indignity of not having a roof is still too real.”
Jack Ross: "My last ambition is to be able to train Scotland"
Sunderland manager Jack Ross said his "last ambition" was to become Scotland's coach at some point.
This 42-year-old Scottish is enjoying the challenge of reviving the Northwestern club, which currently occupies third place in League One, three points away from the head.
He arrived at the Stadium of Light this summer after taking St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
"When I was a player, my dream was to play for my country.
I played once in Squad B, and that's all," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportssound.
"I grew up watching Scotland play at Hampden many times with my father when I was a child, something I always wanted to live again.
But that opportunity will only come if I succeed in running a club.”
Ross's predecessors as Sunderland coach included Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic manager says he felt no concern at all about the succession of such well-established figures in such a large club after previously rejecting proposals from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
Will success for me at this point depend on whether I can return this club to the Premier League?
Because the structure and facilities of the club are undoubtedly the property of a Premier League club," he said.
"It's not going to be an easy task to come up with, but I'm likely to consider that I've only succeeded here if I can return the club to the Premier."
Ross only took three years as a coach after a period of assistant at Dumbarton and a period of 15 months within the Hearts' technical staff.
In that period, he helped the Alloa recover from the descent to the third division and managed to get St. Mirren out of being on the verge of winning the Championship title the following season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than ever during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
“I was probably at a real crossroads,” he recalled, taking over the Alloa.
“I really thought training was perfect for me, even more than playing.
It sounds strange because I didn’t feel bad, I gained reasonably well in life and enjoyed some successes.
Playing can be hard.
There are a lot of things you need to overcome each week.
I still suffer from stress and stress at work, but I like to train.
I’ve always loved training and now that I’m doing it, I feel more comfortable than ever in my adult life.”

According to a survey, the perfect time to take a pint is at 5:30 p.m. on a Saturday.
The summer heatwave increased consumption in British pubs with more difficulty, but put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Pubs and bars experienced a 2.7 percent increase during July, but consumption in restaurants fell 4.8 percent according to figures.
Peter Martin, a member of CGA's commercial consultancy, who compiled the figures, said: "England's sunny days and staying in the football world for longer than expected caused a pattern similar to that of June in July, in which the ads enjoyed a 2.8 percent increase in their consumption, even higher than in restaurants.
The decline of 1.8 percent in restaurant turnover during June worsened during July.
Pubs and bars specialized in beverages were the ones that obtained the best results with increases in consumption higher than the reductions experienced by restaurants.
Food-specialist pubs also suffered from the sun, though not as dramatically as restaurant operators.
It’s like people just want to go out and drink.
In controlled pubs and bars, drinking increased by 6.6 percent during the month, and meals decreased by three percent.
Paul Newman, an employee of RSM's leisure and hospitality analysis company, said: "These results represent a continuation of the trend that has been taking place since the end of April.
The time and impact of major social and sporting events continue to be the main factors in relation to consumption outside the home.
It is no surprise that restaurant groups continue to suffer, however, a fall of 4.8 percent annually will be especially painful if added to the continued increase in costs.
The warm and long summer could not have arrived at a worse time for the catering business and the weather will be in charge of saying whether the temperature moderation experienced during August will provide the much-needed respite for the sector."
Total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the slowdown in brand launches.
The UK's Coffer Peach Tracker Industry Sales Indicator collects and analyzes data on the performance of 47 operating groups with a combined profit of more than <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion and is considered the industry benchmark.
One in five children have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents
One in five children (some as young as 11 years old) have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers, according to a survey.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in the number of pages of "False Insta"
This news has led to an increase in the fear of sexual content being published.
Twenty percent of students claimed to have a “main” account to show their parents
One in five children (some as young as 11 years old) are creating social media accounts that keep adults secret.
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed an increase in the number of "False Insta" accounts (in reference to the social photo sharing network Instagram).
This has led to a growing fear of sexual content being published.
Twenty percent of students said they used a softened "main" account to show their parents while they had other private ones.
A mother who stumbled across the secret account of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenage girl asking to be “raped.”
The research, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmasters' Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 percent of boys and girls between the ages of 11 and 18 had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having private accounts.
HMC head Mike Buchanan said: “It is alarming that there are so many teenagers tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of the athletes" on the council of the Scottish athletics federation
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the board of the Scottish Athletics Federation as non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the board of directors.
Doyle is the most award-winning Scottish athlete and President Ian Beattie has defined this decision as an excellent opportunity for those who lead the sport to benefit from his extensive international experience over the past decade.
"Eilidh enjoys tremendous respect within the Scottish community, the UK and globally, and we are confident that Scottish athletics will benefit enormously from its incorporation into the council," Beattie said in a statement.
Doyle said: "I am very excited to be a spokesperson for the athletes and I look forward to contributing and helping to lead the sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200m and 400m at the 1996 Atlanta Games among a total of four Olympic gold medals and currently works as a regular commentator for the BBC, suffered a transient ischemic attack that prevented her from being able to walk.
He wrote on Twitter: “I suffered an apoplexy a month ago.
I couldn’t walk.
The doctors said that only time could determine if I could recover and to what degree.
It was exhausting work, but I managed to recover completely, I learned to walk again and I am currently doing agility exercises.
“Thank you for your messages of encouragement.”
An ad from a breast milk extractor that compares women with cows divides public opinion on networks
A mother’s milk extractor company shared public opinion on the networks with an ad comparing breastfeeding mothers to cows that are being wet.
To announce the launch of the proclaimed "world's first silent portable breast milk extractor", the company Elvie has released an ironic announcement in the style of a music video to demonstrate the freedom offered by the new breast milk extractor to mothers.
Four royal mothers dance in a barn full of ugly cows to the rhythm of a song with lyrics like, "Yes, I've moved myself, but I don't have a queue" and "If you don't realize, they're not open, they're my breasts."
The choir continues: “Move, move, I’m feeding the babies, move, move, move, I’m messing with my friends.”
However, the announcement, which was posted on the company’s Facebook page, sparked controversy on the networks.
With 77,000 plays and hundreds of comments, the video provoked different reactions among spectators. Many of them claimed that this manifests the "horrors" of the dairy sector.
“Using cows to advertise this product was a very mediocre decision.
Like us, they need to get pregnant and give birth to be able to produce milk, but in their case, we steal their children days after giving birth.”
The Elvie milk extractor can be discreetly placed inside a maternal bra (Elvie/mother)
Another viewer commented: "Clearly traumatic for the mother and the baby.
But yes, why aren’t they used to advertise a milk extractor for mothers left with their babies?”
Another spectator added: "What an announcement with so little tact."
Other viewers defended the ad, even a woman claimed that the song seemed "very funny".
“I think it’s a great idea.
If I was still giving breasts, I would buy one.
My milk made me feel like a cow.
The ad is a bit silly, but I interpret it as a joke.
“It’s a great product,” he wrote.
Another commented: "This is a fun ad aimed at mothers who extract their milk (often in their workplaces or bathrooms) and feel like "cows."
This is not an announcement to praise or judge the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, this group of women reveals that they were dancing with the discreet extractors inserted into their braces.
The concept behind the campaign is that many women who extract their milk claim to feel like cows.
However, the Elvie milk extractor is completely silent, has no wires or tubes and can be discreetly fitted into a maternal bra, which gives women freedom to move, hold their babies and even get out of there while they are extracting their milk.
Ana Balarin, Partner and Executive Creative Director of Mother commented: "The Elvie Extractor is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
In describing the parallelism between women and dairy cows, we wanted to focus on milk extraction and all the challenges it entails while demonstrating in an entertaining and close manner the incredible feeling of freedom that the new extractor will offer.
This is not the first time that Elvie has taken the headlines of the newspapers.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two paraded on the catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children silently displaced to a camp on the Texas border
The number of migrant children detained increased despite the fact that the monthly number of border crossings remained relatively unchanged, in part due to the rigorous rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration making it difficult to allocate godparents for children.
Traditionally, most of the godparents were also undocumented immigrants and were afraid to jeopardize their ability to stay in the country by taking a step forward to claim a child.
This risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential godparents and other adult members of their homes would have to send their fingerprints and that that data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official at the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Service, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied to foster unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no criminal history.
“About 80% of the people who are godparents or who are part of their household are illegally in the country, and a large part of these are foreigners who have committed crimes.
Therefore, we will continue to pursue these individuals,” Mr Albence said.
In order to process children more quickly, officials have introduced new rules that will require any of them to appear in court before a month has passed since their detention rather than 60 days, which was the previous rule, according to refugee workers.
Many will appear by videoconferencing rather than in person to try to legalize their case in front of an immigration judge.
Those who do not meet the requirements for assistance will be deported quickly.
The longer they remain in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent abductions or escape attempts, according to refugee workers and system reports published in recent months.
Lawyers said these fears increase in larger centers such as Tornillo, where there is more chance that the symptoms that a child is experiencing will go unnoticed due to their size.
They also added that moving children to the camping area without giving them enough time to prepare them emotionally or to say goodbye to friends could be a trauma that many continue to suffer.
Syria urges U.S., French and Turkish occupying forces to withdraw immediately
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem, addressing the UN General Assembly, also called on Syrian refugees to return home, despite the war in the country currently in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also holds the post of Deputy Prime Minister, stated that foreign forces were illegally on Syrian soil, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and that they would "handle them in a timely manner".
"They must be withdrawn immediately and unconditionally," he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the "war on terror has almost ended" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions of them have had to flee their homes.
He also said Damascus would continue to "fight this sacred battle until we clear all Syrian territories" of terrorist groups and "from any illegal foreign presence".
The United States has approximately 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly to train and advise Kurdish forces and Arab Syrians who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in this war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem stated that the conditions for their return were being given and blamed "some Western countries" for the "spreading of irrational fears" that caused the refugees not to return.
“We are relying on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns,” he said.
“They’re politicizing what should be a mere humanitarian matter.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not offer reconstruction aid for Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.N. diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a neutral zone in the last major rebel stronghold in Idlib has allowed political talks to continue.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey prevented a large-scale assault by Russian-backed Syrian troops in the province, in which three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had "clear deadlines" and expressed his hope that military actions would target jihadists, including soldiers from the Al-Nusra front linked to Al-Qaeda, which "will be eradicated".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of members of the government and the opposition to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and to facilitate the holding of elections.
Moualem set out the conditions for ensuring the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying the body's work should be restricted to "reviewing the articles of the current constitution" and warned of possible interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
Following that logic, Mr. Trump would get re-election in 2020 unless, as many liberals are expecting, impeachment and scandals end his presidency prematurely.
It would be the most dramatic ending of a presidency.
At the moment, there are no signs of fatigue among the observers.
Since 2014, prime-time audience indices have more than doubled to reach 1.05 million viewers on CNN and nearly tripled to reach 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers on prime-time, an increase of 1.7 million compared to four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" led the cable channel's audience ratings with 3.5 million viewers over the nights of major news.
“It’s like a fire that attracts people because it’s something we don’t understand,” said Neal Baer, showrunner of the drama for ABC’s “Designated Survivor,” which deals with a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club," has another theory.
Remember a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told him that he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? he asked.
"He said, 'Because it makes me laugh,'" said Mrs. Scovell.
There is entertainment within the chaos.
Of course, unlike everything else that appears on television, the plots that arise from Washington can determine the future of the Roe v. Wade case, whether immigrant families can reunite and the state of the world economy.
Disconnecting from reality is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Still, I suppose something that goes beyond being an informed citizen spent six hours watching a panel of experts discussing Bob Woodward's use of "anonymous" sources for his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's 15,000-dollar ostrich skin bomber jacket ("a lady full of arrogance").
I'm not going to look at Super Mario the same way.
"Part of what makes it look like a reality show is that it's giving you something new every night," said Brent Montgomery, senior executive at Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars, a space that deals with the changes in the characters and the daily argumental tours of the show.

When I contacted Mr. Fleiss this week, it was sunshine and a temperature of 26 degrees outside the house on the north coast of Kauai, but I was locked in the house watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He was unable to disengage while Brett Kavanaugh was about to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court pending a thread.
“I remember when we were doing all these programs so crazy at the time and people were saying, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Fleiss told me.
“I thought it was kind of a joke, but it turns out they were right.”

Foreign money comes in to finance the nominations to the House for the elections of half of the legislature
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th Congressional District is receiving a large flow of money due to the reorganization of a congressional district with two acting representatives in the race to occupy the same position.
This newly reorganized Pittsburg district is represented by Democratic candidate Conor Lamb, who secured his seat in another district in a special election held last spring.
Lamb presents himself against another incumbent representative, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the former 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is largely superimposed on the new 17th district.
The maps were reorganized after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that Republicans had manipulated the electoral districts of the old districts in their favor.
The election race in the new 17th congressional district unleashed a campaign funding festival among the main financial arms of the parties, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a famous name in Pennsylvania after achieving a tight victory in the March special elections for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district, which enjoyed wide following.
That post was held by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts give the Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States assessed the possibility of penalizing El Salvador for its support for China and then backed down.
Diplomats warned that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little response from Washington.
Mr. Trump held a pleasant meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and even owned a hotel in Panama until his partners dismissed the Trump Organization leadership team.
State Department officials have ordered the return of heads of U.S. diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama "because of recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan," Department of State spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
However, only the possibility of imposing sanctions on El Salvador, which received approximately $140 million in U.S. aid during 2017, including to control drug trafficking, development and economic aid, was disputed.
The proposed sanctions, including cuts in financial aid and visa restrictions, would be very negative for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
As the internal meetings progressed, U.S. and Central American officials postponed the holding of a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to hold a similar meeting last year, which was considered a step forward in efforts to prevent the emigration of people to the United States.
But in mid-September, important administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to move forward, effectively ending any possibility of imposing sanctions on El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is scheduled to lead the conference, now scheduled for mid-October, in a sign of the importance the administration attaches to him, diplomats said.
The three U.S. envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic with no new message or harsh punishment from Washington.
Bolton's White House spokesman declined to comment on the details of the debate, which were described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to talk about internal deliberations as long as the participants' anonymity was maintained.
His accounts were corroborated by an external analyst close to the administration and who also agreed to speak whenever his anonymity was retained.
Studying History
The next negative case could be the report by Special Adviser Robert Mueller on the case of possible obstruction of justice for Mr Trump, of which there is currently abundant evidence in the public archive.
“Mr. Mueller is also directing his investigation to find out whether Mr. Trump’s campaign conspired with Russia in his attack on our elections.
If Congress changes hands, Mr. Trump will be held accountable to that body, just when he has to prepare for the election, and he may finally have to face a popular jury.
They are many unknowns and I do not want to suggest that the fall of Mr. Trump is inevitable, as is the fall of his European counterparts.
We all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the duration of the battle.
In 1938, German officials were determined to take a coup d'état against Hitler if the Western Front resisted and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of massacres that occurred subsequently.
The course of history revolves around these turning points, and the inexorable advance of democracy either accelerates or reverses.
Americans are facing several of these turning points at the moment.
What are we going to do if Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has carried the water to his neck since this newspaper reported that, last year, he suggested recording in secret to the president and speculated that he was incapacitated for the post.
Mr. Rosenstein stated that the information from The Times is not true.
"How are we going to respond if the investigation that has just been requested by the FBI about Brett Kavanaugh is not completed or not impartial or if his appointment to the Supreme Court is confirmed despite credible allegations of sexual abuse and false witness?
And, above all, will we vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that demands responsibility from Mr Trump?
If we do not pass these tests, democracy will be subjected to a long winter.
But I don’t think we will fail, thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that also occupied my home, which was embassy headquarters.
He survived, emigrated to the United States and, 60 years later, sent me to lay Shabbat candles on that table that included a swastika.
With that legacy, how am I not going to be optimistic about the future?”

Rangers player Graham Dorrans is optimistic about the match against Rapid Vienna
The Rangers receive the Rapid Vienna on Thursday knowing that a victory against the Austrians, after the impressive draw achieved in Spain against Villarreal that same month, would put them in a very favorable position to qualify in Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from debuting this season until the 2–2 draw against Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use that result as a springboard to achieve more important things.
"It was a good point for us, as Villarreal is a good team," said the 31-year-old.
"We entered the game believing we could get something positive and we reached a point.
We had the opportunity to win in the end, but overall, the draw is probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half, but we were better in the second half.
Next Thursday will be another great European night.
We hope to be able to score all three points, but it will be difficult, because they got a good result in their last game, but with the support of our audience, I'm sure we can fight to get a positive result.
“Last year was tough between everything that happened to my injuries and the changes that happened to the team, but there’s an excellent environment right now.
The team is good, the guys are having a good time and the training is good.
We hope to be able to fight, forget the past season and succeed.”
Preoccupied with savings for retirement
Despite the fact that the survey participants were clear on how they wanted to be cared for, few people spoke to their family about the matter.
Approximately half of the participants in this study conducted by Nationwide said they commented with their partners on the cost of prolonged care.
Only 10% said they would talk to their children about the issue.
“People want to be cared for by a family member, but they are not taking the necessary steps to have that conversation,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide’s life insurance department.
You can start with the next.
Talk to your partner and children: You can’t prepare your family to take care of you if you don’t communicate your wishes to them well in advance.
Collaborate with your counselor and family to agree where and how to receive care, as these decisions can be a determining factor in determining the cost.
Call your financial advisor: Your financial advisor can also help you find a way to pay for those expenses.
Prolonged care financing options include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a cash value hybrid life insurance policy to help cover these expenses, or self-insurance covered with your own funds, whenever you have the money.
Negotiate your legal documents: Avoid legal battles.
Get a health care representative to appoint a trusted person to oversee your health care and make sure that professionals meet your wishes in case you are unable to communicate.
You should also consider signing a notary to manage your finances.
You should choose a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and make sure your bills are paid if you are disabled.
Don’t forget the small details: Imagine your parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about your medications and allergies?
Write down this information in a written plan to be prepared.
"Not only is the financial issue at stake, but who are the doctors to attend to it?" asked Martin.
"What medication are you taking?
Who will take care of the dog?
Make a plan.”

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
A powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to official sources, caused the deaths of at least 384 people, a figure that is expected to continue to increase.
Due to the cut-off of communications, rescuers were unable to obtain any information from the Donggala regency, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5-degree earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of the province of Célebes Central, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Célebes, with a population of approximately 379,800 people in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a regency located along more than 300 km of coast northwest of the island of Celebes.
This regency, an administrative region less than a province, had an approximate population of 299.200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main pillars of the economy of the province of Celebes Central, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but are mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Celebes.
Palu and Donggala have been affected by tsunamis several times over the past 100 years, according to Indonesia's Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck the western part of Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located on the Pacific Fire Belt of high seismic activity, so it suffers earthquakes regularly.
These are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis that have suffered in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the western coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra, which occurred on December 26, caused a tsunami that affected 14 countries, killing 226,000 people on the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half, in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-degree earthquake hit southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that devastated the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009 – A 7.6-degree earthquake hits the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-degree earthquake hit the Mentawai islands off Sumatra, causing a 10-metre tsunami that destroyed dozens of people and killed about 300 people.
2016: A mild earthquake hit the Pidie Jaya regency, located in Aceh, causing destruction and panic as people recalled the devastation caused by the 2004 deadly earthquake and tsunami.
There was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died due to the collapse of buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes occurred on the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, most of them in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily removed.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of aggression.
Palin, a 29-year-old native of Wasilla, Alaska, has been detained on suspicion of a domestic violence crime, preventing the filing of a complaint for domestic violence and resistance to authority, according to a note published by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a friend tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took away her phone.
Palin remains in pretrial detention at the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility with a $500 bail, according to KTUU.
He appeared before the court on Saturday, in which he pleaded "not guilty, since then" when asked, the prison said.
Palin faces three minor crimes of type A, which means he could go to jail for up to a year and receive a $250,000 fine.
He was also charged with a B-type offence, punishable by a day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Alaska War Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic aggression, preventing the filing of a complaint for domestic violence and possession of drunken weapons in connection with the incident.
His wife accused him of giving him a punch in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by groups of veterans in 2016 after linking her son's violent behavior to the post-traumatic stress disorder syndrome she suffers from after serving with the army in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia cause hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people have been killed in the earthquake that struck the Indonesian island of Celebes on Friday.
The 7.5-degree earthquake caused a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are unavailable, and the death toll is expected to increase over the next few days.
The quake occurred just in front of Célebes Central, in the northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos are circulated on social networks showing the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people were gathered at a festival on the beach of the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors seek to apply a few-time death penalty for suspected terrorist attack in New York
New York federal prosecutors are trying to impose the death penalty on Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York terror attack that killed eight people, a sentence that has not been applied in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out an attack on a bike lane on Lower Manhattan's West Side Highway, following the lives of pedestrians and cyclists he found on his way in October.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and caused them serious injuries "intentionally", according to the notification of the intention to apply for the death penalty filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both offences imply the possibility of applying the death penalty in accordance with the court’s document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal jury filed a charge against Saipov of 22 crimes, including eight murder crimes in collaboration with an organized crime group, a practice commonly used by prosecutors in organized crime cases, and a crime of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "notable planning and premeditation," prosecutors said, describing how Saipov carried out the "atrocious, cruel and depraved" attack.
Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damages and losses to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
For a decade, the South District of New York has not prosecuted a death penalty case.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug traffickers, but was finally sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was applied in a federal case in New York was in 1953, in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a marriage that was executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, born in Uzbekistan, demonstrated a lack of repentance during the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
He told investigators that he felt good about what he had done, police said.
Saipov told authorities that in order to carry out the attack, he was inspired by the videos of ISIS that he viewed on his phone according to the accusation.
He also requested to be able to see the ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal attorneys in charge of representing Saipov, said he was "obviously disappointed" with the indictment.
“We believe that the decision to apply for the death penalty rather than accept a life imprisonment plea without the possibility of revocation will only prolong the trauma caused by these events for all people involved,” Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to apply for the death penalty.
Tory MP says NIGEL FARAGE should be put ahead of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize an army of people" today during a protest at the Tory conference.
The former leader of the UK’s Independence Party said politicians had to “feel the pressure” of Eurosceptics (when one of Theresa May’s own parliamentarians suggested that he should be in charge of negotiations with the EU.
Ordinary MEP Peter Bone said at the Birmingham rally that the UK would have "already left" the EU if Mr Farage were the Brexit secretary.
But Mrs May’s challenge to reconcile her party’s divided ranks was highlighted by joining the Tories in favour of remaining in the EU in an independent protest against Brexit held in the city.
The prime minister is struggling to keep the commitments of her Chequers plan between the attacks of Brexit supporters, opponents and the EU.
His allies insisted that he continue to fight to try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the negative response, to force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between his plan and chaos.
Mr. Bone stated in the concentration of Solihull's Leave Means Leave movement that he wanted to end Chequers' plan.
He suggested that Mr Farage should have been counted on to assume responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
“If I had put him in charge, we would already be outside the EU at this time,” he said.
Wellingborough MP added: “I will continue to defend Brexit, but we must aborte the Chequers plan.”
Showing his opposition to the EU, he said: “We don’t fight world wars to be servants.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Mr Bone denied suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to remain in the EU is completely false.”
The member of the Tories and supporter of Brexit Andrea Jenkyns also went on the march, since she told reporters: “The only thing I say is: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
“Chequers’ plan is not popular among the public, the opposition is not going to vote for it, it is unpopular between our party and our activists who, to begin with, are the ones who occupy the streets and allow us to be elected.
Cancel the Chequers plan and start listening.”
In a message to May, he added: “Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises.”
Farage said in the rally that it is necessary to make politicians "uncomfortable" if they intend to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
“Currently this is a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class,” he said.
“They are trying to betray the Brexit decision and we are here today to tell them that we will not let them go with theirs.”
In a message to an enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make our political class, which is about to betray the Brexit decision, feel uncomfortable.
“We are mobilizing the army of people of this country who gave us the victory in Brexit and who will not rest until we become a proud, independent and autonomous United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, supporters of remaining in the EU marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour concentration in the city centre.
A few activists waved banners with the message “Tories Against Brexit” following the group’s launch this weekend.
Labour's Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives for the security problems they suffered in a party application at the beginning of the conference.
“These are the people who tell us that they can have IT systems in order and all the best technology for Canada, to have a frictionless border, to enjoy a free market without borders in Ireland,” he added.
“This is an absolute farce.
The concept of good Brexit does not exist,” he added.
Warren Plans to Seriously Think or Apply for President
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren has said she will seriously consider running for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future on Saturday during a municipal session in a locality in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, will run for re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who was co-chair of the 2016 Trump campaign in Massachusetts.
She has been the focus of speculation that will place her as Trump’s successor in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with his constituents using the city hall format since Trump took over the presidency.
One of the assistants asked him if he was planning to introduce himself to the president.
Warren responded that it is time for “women to go to Washington to fix the problems of our government, and for that a woman fails in the office of the presidency.”
Detained in connection with the shooting of Sims, the LSU player
Baton Rouge police announced on Saturday that a suspect was arrested for the murder of Wayde Sims, the LSU basketball player on Friday.
The Baton Rouge police department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at a news conference held at 11:00 a.m.
They posted a video of the shooting on Friday asking for help to identify a man who was in the pictures.
Sims, 20, was shot dead near the Southern University campus early on Friday.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and eventually died as a result of this," police chief Murphy J. Paul told reporters on Saturday via 247sports.
Wayde intervened to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being on the scene with a gun and admitted to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and placed in custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims, a 2-meter-old boy who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games with 10 titles last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Grand Prix of Russia: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title thanks to team orders, which allowed him to achieve victory over Sebastian Vettel
It was clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that Mercedes' team orders would be decisive in the race.
Bottas, who started from the pole, had a good start and almost left Hamilton alone while defending his position during the first two laps and inviting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel entered the boxes first and let Hamilton run with traffic at the back of the group, something that would prove decisive.
The Mercedes stopped in boxes one lap later and left behind Vettel, but Hamilton advanced after several wheel-to-wheel maneuvers that caused Ferrari's driver to leave the interior unwillingly at risk of being delayed after a double defensive maneuver in the third corner.
Max Verstappen left from the last row of the starting grid and went back to seventh at the end of the first lap on the day of his 21st birthday.
He then led the race for a large part of this thanks to retaining his tyres to get to go faster in the final part and ahead of Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
He finally entered boxes in lap 44 but was unable to advance any position in the last eight laps, which ended with Raikkonen in fourth place.
It was a difficult day because Valtteri did an excellent job throughout the weekend and was a real gentleman.
The team did an extraordinary job of getting the first two places,” Hamilton said.
Inappropriate body language
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein in an act held on Saturday for her insistence that she had not leaked Christine Blasey Ford’s letter accusing Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse.
In a speech at an event in West Virginia, the president did not speak directly of Ford’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee and commented in his place that what was happening in the Senate demonstrated that the people were “miserable, disgusting, and liars.”
"The only thing that could happen and the most beautiful thing that's happening in the last few days in the Senate, when you see the indignation, when you see people who are angry and who are miserable, disgusting and lying," he said.
“When you see these posts and leaks and they say, ‘Oh, I didn’t.
I wasn’t.”
Remembrance?
Dianne Feinstein, did you make any leaks?
Remember his answer... did you filter the document?: "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no, no, no.
I didn't go.
Wait a minute.
“No,” he added, imitating the senator.
Feinstein was sent a letter detailing the allegations against Kavanaugh made by Ford in July and leaked in early September, but Feinstein denied that the leak came from his office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s allegations, I didn’t filter her story,” Feinstein told the committee.
“I asked him to keep his confidentiality and I did what he asked me to do.”
But his denial did not seem to sit well with the president, who commented on the following during Saturday night's act: "I tell you that body language was not the right one.
He may not have leaked it, but he used the worst body language I’ve seen in my life.”
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court candidate, who was accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president suggested that Democrats were using the allegations for their own purposes.
They are determined to regain power by any means necessary.
They are evil and disgusting, they don’t care who they hurt, who they have to hit to regain power and control,” he said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars spotted Friday's Elite League defeat against the Belfast Giants winning the game back 5-3 at Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants got an early lead with two goals from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie tied for the local team before Dwyer regained the Giants' lead.
Francois Bouchard tied for Dundee before two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen allowed them to win.
It was the third Elite League defeat of the season for Adam Keefe's men, who managed to climb back to win Dundee 2-1 at Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth match of the season between the two teams, with a balance of the three wins before the Giants.
Dwyer's initial goal came in the 3:35 minute thanks to Kendall McFaull's assistance, and the second came four minutes later by Beauvillier after assistance from David Rutherford.
In a turbulent start-up period, Sullivan put the local team back in the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt attended Cownie to score the draw goal at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants advanced on the scoreboard before the first break when he scored his second night's goal at the end of the first period.
The local team regrouped and Bouchard again tied the game with a power play in the 27:37 minute.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen advance Dundee for the first time in the game at the end of the second half and secured the victory by his team's fifth goal in the last half.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will play their next game at home in Milton Keynes, which will be held on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies to make sure hundreds of passengers on a plane can escape an earthquake
An Indonesian air controller considered a hero after dying to make sure a plane loaded with hundreds of passengers could safely take off.
The death toll is 800 and there are many missing after a major earthquake shook the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Strong replicas continue to be felt in the area and there are many people trapped under the gravel of the city of Palu.
Despite his co-workers fleeing to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post at the control tower of Palu's violently swinging Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport.
He remained in his position to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at that time, could safely take off.
He then jumped from the control tower when he thought he was going to fall.
He later died in the hospital.
The spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said it was possible that this decision would allow hundreds of lives to be saved, Australia's ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived at Palu.
“It breaks our hearts when we hear it,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could be in the thousands and the country's disaster management agency said access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
“The balance of victims is believed to continue to rise because there are many bodies under the rubble and many of them could not be reached,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the agency’s spokesman.
Waves of up to six meters devastated Palu, where a massive funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are transporting aid and livelihoods.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute an ambulance is bringing bodies.
Drinking water is scarce.
People are looting mini-markets.”
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is fighting to help the survivors, but we don’t know what they’re going to find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask you all who worked day and night to complete all the tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?” he told CNN.
Indonesia suffered earlier this year earthquakes in Lombok in which more than 550 people died.
Air Niugini says there is a missing person after a plane crash in a lagoon
The airline that operates a flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now claims that there is a missing person after previously claiming that the 47 passengers and crew left without incident the plane that was sinking.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday afternoon they were unable to locate a passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to locate the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more detailed information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Boats from the area helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed against the water as it attempted to land at Chuuk Island airport.
Authorities said on Friday that seven people had to be taken to a hospital.
The airline reported that six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday and all were stable.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy confirmed that the plane landed on the lagoon before arriving at the runway.
Some witnesses claim that the plane passed by the long runway.
Bill Jaynes, a passenger of American nationality, commented that he entered with very little height.
“That’s extremely positive,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes said that both he and other passengers managed to advance between the water that reached their waist to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He also recalled that the flight attendants were screaming and frightened, and that he suffered a mild head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors who were working near the site on quay improvement tasks also helped with the rescue using an inflatable boat to move people to shore before the plane sank about 30 meters.
According to Aviation Safety Network data, 111 people have died in airline crashes registered in Papua New Guinea in the past two decades, but none have affected Air Niugini.
Analyst compiles the chronology of the night a woman was burned alive
The prosecution on Saturday referred to the evidence in the re-trial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett has testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
During the trial he described to the jury how he used the records of a mobile phone to recompose the movements of the 29-year-old defendant, Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night of her death.
Rowlett said she had received data from the location of several mobile phones demonstrating that Tellis was with Chambers on the night of his death contradicting his earlier claims, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When these data showed that his mobile phone was with Chambers during the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford went up to the stand on Saturday and testified that he was not in the city that day.
When the prosecution asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he declared that he was in the Sanford truck that night, Sanford said he was "lies because my truck was in Nashville."
Another contradiction was that Tellis claimed to have known Chambers for about two weeks when he died.
The mobile phone records indicated that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett stated that some time after Chambers's death, Tellis deleted Chambers's messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"It's been erased from your life," Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its final allegations on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be heard by the jury on the same day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip hop?
A hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative perception that the genre has by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, a group from Bristol, claims that hip hop has moved away from its origins with political messages and struggles against social problems.
They want to get back to their roots and make combative hip hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common recently experienced a resurgence in the UK through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?
A New York babysitter sues a couple after a "racist" message
A New York babysitter is suing a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a message that was not addressed to her from the mother she complained she was “another black.”
The couple denies being racist and compares the lawsuit to “extortion.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, showed her distress when she discovered that babysitter Giselle Maurice was black when she introduced herself on her first day of work in 2016.
“NOOOOOOOOOOON, OTHER BLACK,” Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a message.
However, instead of sending her to her husband, she sent her to Mrs. Maurice twice.
After realizing her mistake, an "uncomfortable" Plasco-Flaxman fired Mrs. Maurice, claiming that the caregiver who had just left, who was African-American, had done her job wrong and was expecting a Filipina according to the New York Post announcement.
Mrs. Maurice was paid her workday and sent home in an Uber.
Now Maurice is going to sue the couple for compensation for the dismissal and demands a compensation of $350 a day for the six months of internal work for those who were initially hired even if there was no middle contract.
“Look, I want to show you that those things don’t happen,” he told the Post on Friday, adding later, “It’s a case of discrimination.”
The couple responded to allegations of racism by stating that firing Maurice was the most reasonable, as they were afraid not to be able to trust her after offending her.
“My wife sent him a message that I didn’t intend to send him.
He is not racist.
We are not racists,” his husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
But would they leave their children in the hands of a person they offended, even if it was because of a mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Come on!"
After comparing the lawsuit with an "extortion", Plasco stated that his wife had just had a baby two months ago and was in a "very difficult situation".
Would you go for a person like that?
That’s not very ethical,” added the investment banker.
As the legal process continues, the public opinion court quickly denounced the couple on social media, attacking them for their behavior and applied logic.
The editors of Paddington feared that readers would not identify with a talking bear according to one could conclude in a new letter.
Karen Jankel, Bond's daughter, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, commented on the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the skin of a person who reads it for the first time before it's published.
It’s really fun to know now what we know about Paddington’s huge success.”
After stating that his father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before he was inspired to write the children's book about a small toy bear, would be optimistic about the possibility that his work would be rejected, he added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books was "sweet" after his death last year.
Of Paddington, to whom he describes as a "very important member of our family," he added that his father was discreetly proud of the success he finally achieved.
“He was a quiet man and nothing presumptuous,” he said.
But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a son who gets something: you’re proud even if you didn’t really do it.
I think I felt Paddington's success a bit like that.
Although it was a creation of his own and a product of his imagination, he always gave Paddington all the credit.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye through the phone
After the landing, her daughter was quickly taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors worked unsuccessfully to save her life.
“Nad called regularly to say that he was very ill, that he was not expected to survive.
“Then I got Nad’s call telling me that I was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, my love.
I'll meet you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications that doctors gave her to keep her heart beating were slowly consuming and leaving her body.
He had died a while ago, and now he was dying.
I just sat there and waited, knowing it was happening.
I couldn’t cry or cry because I was surrounded by family and friends.
I had to hold on.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, in that moment of mourning for the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane along with the other passengers, without noticing the calvary she was suffering.
"No one detected it," he said.
I had my head down and my tears were falling all the time.
It’s hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I felt this impressive sense of solidarity for Nad.
I needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much I loved her.”
Postcards of afflicted women to prevent suicides on a bridge
Two women who lost loved ones due to suicide are working to prevent others from doing the same.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys put cards on a Welsh bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers that can be called for help.
Tyler, Ms. Davis's son, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression, and committed suicide at 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel the way I feel every day,” he said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, commented that her son was a promising cook with a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always say that their smile lights up any room.
However, he quit work before he died and was "in a very deep depression."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, was the one who found his brother after he committed suicide.
Ms. Davis commented: "I am continually concerned that there will be a side effect."
Mrs. Davis created the cards "to inform people that there are people you can go to and talk to, even if you're a friend.
“Don’t be silent, you need to talk.”
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been a friend of Mrs. Davies for years, lost her partner Mark for 15 years, shortly after her mother's death.
“He didn’t tell me he was sad or depressed or anything like that,” he said.
"A few days before Christmas, we detected a change in his attitude.
The Christmas day touched the bottom (when the children opened their gifts, he made no eye contact with them or anything)."
He claimed that his death meant a huge trauma to them, but they must overcome it: "He tore up the family.
Destroy us.
But we have to move forward and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance as FBI investigates
"I thought that if we could get something like what I was asking for (an investigation for a limited time and limited scope), it's possible that we could get a little bit of unity," Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would be "wrapping up" due to the paralysis of supporters.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to conduct the investigation?
Its reluctance is due to a matter of deadlines.
If, as expected, Republicans get poor results, they will be severely weakened in their attempts to get the man they want to be elected to the country's highest court.
George W. Bush has been calling senators, exerting pressure to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush, thanks to whom he met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen when the FBI carries out your report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, which currently occupies 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can reach at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break the tie and confirm it to the Supreme Court.
The number of defectors in North Korea falls under Kim's mandate
The number of North Korean defectors destined for South Korea has declined since Kim Jong Un’s accession to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean lawmaker.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from South Korea's unification ministry, said there would be 1,127 desertions during last year, far from 2,706 in 2011.
Park said tightening border controls between North Korea and China and increasing tariffs charged by people entrusted with crossing the border were key factors.
Pyongyang has made no public comment.
The vast majority of North Korean defectors are finally offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul declares that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, which has the largest stretch of border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone between the two Koreas.
China considers deserters as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often compulsorily repatriates them.
Relations between the north and the south (which technically continue to be at war) have improved significantly over the past few months.
That same month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to hold talks focused on negotiations on the elimination of nuclear weapons that were parked.
This came after the historic June meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed to work hard to eliminate nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea’s foreign minister, Ri Yong-ho, blamed the sanctions imposed by the United States for the lack of progress since then.
“If we don’t have confidence in the United States, we will not be able to trust our national security and, in those circumstances, there is no possibility that we will disarm unilaterally first,” Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he's not fit to go to Supreme Court
House minority leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and assured that he was not suitable by nature for access to the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview held Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if a woman ever behaved that way, I would call her hysterical," Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations of sexual abuse against Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when she was a teenager.
During the initial statement, Kavanaugh was very excited, sometimes almost yelling and talking while describing his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the committee's Democrats, labeling the charges against him as a "grotesque and coordinated murder of reputation" organized by liberals angry at Hillary Clinton's defeat in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi stated that he believed Kavanaugh's statement showed that he could not access the Supreme Court because it showed he had prejudice against the Democrats.
“I think he disqualifies himself with those statements and the way he attacked Clinton and the Democrats,” he said.
Pelosi objected when asked if he would try to challenge Kavanaugh if he was confirmed in office and if the Democrats obtained a majority in the House of Representatives.
"What I have to say is this: if you're not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, then it's not appropriate to be not only in the Supreme Court, but in the court you're currently in," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Washington D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she was concerned about possible resolutions that Kavanaugh could adopt against the Patient Protection and Affordable Health Care Act or the Roe v. Wade case, as he is considered a conservative judge.
In the confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh circumvented questions as to whether he would override certain Supreme Court decisions.
"This is not the time for a hysterical and prejudiced person to go to court and still wait for us to say, look what good!" Pelosi said.
Women need to exercise it.
It is a justified diatribe, months and years of fury overflowing, and it cannot be expelled without weeping.
“We cry when we get angry,” said Mrs. Steinem 45 years later.
"I don't think it's that strange, do I?"
She continued, “I got a lot of help from a woman who was executive somewhere, who said she also cried when she was angry, but who developed a technique that consisted of, when she was angry and started crying, saying to the person I was talking to, ‘You’re probably thinking I’m crying because I’m sad.
But I'm angry."
And then, he continued.
I thought it was brilliant.”
Tears are allowed as an escape valve for anger in part because they are essentially not understood.
One of my clearest memories in one of my first jobs in a male-dominated office, in which I began to cry with an indescribable rage, was that an older woman grabbed me by the back of the neck, a distant superior who had always caused me a slight fear, and drove me to the hollow of the staircase.
“Never let them see you crying,” he said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think that you are sad and that they will comfort you if they come to you.”
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his presidential candidacies.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was picked up on an off-marriage adventure on a ship named Monkey Business and retired from the presidential race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, thought there was no reason why she could not consider running for president.
“It wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” I laughed 30 years later.
"There were already seven candidates in the race and the last one they needed was another.
They called it “Blanca Snow and the Seven Dwarfs.”
Because the campaign was advanced, he was delayed in raising funds, so he swore he would not enter the race for the presidency unless he was able to raise $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She found that some of her supporters contributed $1,000 to male candidates would only contribute $250.
"What do you think, I have a discount?" he asked.
When she made her speech to announce that she would not present a formal campaign, she was overcome by the emotions (of gratitude to the people who supported her, of frustration with the system that made it difficult to raise money and address the voters instead of the delegates and of anger at the existing sexism) that were left speechless.
“You’d think I’d have a nervous breakdown,” Mrs. Schroeder recalled about how the press reacted to her.
“You would think that Kleenex was my sponsoring company.
I remember thinking, what are you going to write on my gravestone?
"Chorou?"
How the U.S.-China Trade War May Be Positive for Beijing
The initial bombings of the U.S.-China trade war have been deafening and, although the war is far from over, a distancing between countries may prove beneficial for Beijing in the long run, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump issued the first warning earlier this year recording key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation came this week with new tariffs affecting the equivalent of $20 billion, charging half of the items coming to the United States from China.
Beijing has repeatedly counter-attacked in the same way, the most recent raising tariffs from five to ten percent by $60 billion in U.S. goods.
China has promised to imitate U.S. measures and it seems unlikely that the world’s second-largest economy will immute in the short term.
To get Washington to bounce back, it would be necessary to yield to its demands, but to publicly bow to the United States would be much more shameful for Xi Jinping, China’s president.
Still, experts claim that if Beijing knows how to play its cards correctly, the pressures of the trade war with the United States could favour China in the long run by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a swift political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions necessary to initiate an economic crisis in both countries is actually much more dangerous than previously recognized,” said Abigail Grace, an Asia-centered researcher at the Center for New American Security, a center of study.
Syria is "ready" for refugees to return, says foreign minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is seeking help to rebuild the country devastated by a war that has lasted more than seven years.
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem declared that the country's conditions are improving.
“Today, the situation on the ground is much more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by the terrorists to restore normality.
Now all the necessary conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country that they had to abandon due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and their livelihoods are given.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Another six million people are still living in the country and need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would be grateful for the help it can receive to rebuild a country that is devastated.
But he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid from countries that supported the uprising.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup defeating the U.S. team by a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at the Le Golf National club located on the outskirts of Paris, France.
It is the sixth consecutive U.S. defeat in Europe and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn reached the 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who was the one who offered the most battle during the tournament, sent the ball to the water in the 16th hole of Par 3, losing his game against Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer shined in all his series, becoming one of only four players to achieve a 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament was implemented in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was defeated 5&4 by the worst-ranked player of the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen, from Denmark.
The world's top-ranked player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2&1 to Englishman Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
A veteran with eight Ryder Cups played, Spanish Sergio García became the European player with the most wins of the tournament, with 25.5 points.
“I don’t cry often, but today I can’t help it.
It was a tough year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for selecting me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to be able to get the cup back.
The important thing is the team, and I’m happy to have been able to help,” García said after the European victory.
He passed the testimony to his compatriot John Ram, who managed to defeat American golf legend Tiger Woods by 2&1 in Sunday's singles game.
"It's amazing how proud I am today to have defeated Tiger Woods, and I grew up watching him play that boy," Rahm, 23, said in a statement.
Woods lost his four games in France and now has a 13-21-3 record in the Ryder Cup.
This is a strange statistic for one of the best players of all time, a 14-majors winner, just behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had trouble staying on the streets throughout the weekend, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-caliber golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk said after his team's frustrating performance: "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning, the Europeans were in trouble.
We're fighting.
I took my hat off to Thomas.
He is an excellent captain.
The 12 players played very well.
We will reorganize, work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee and move forward.
I love these 12 boys and am proud to be a captain.
It's to take the hat off.
They were superior.”
Red tide information: Concentrations are decreasing in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
According to the latest report from the Florida Wildlife Conservation and Fisheries Commission, there is a general reduction in red tide concentrations in parts of the Tampa Bay area.
According to the said commission, increasingly uneven outcropping conditions are being observed in the areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and in the counties of Collier, which may mean that concentrations are being reduced.
The red tide extends approximately 210 km from the coast from the northern Pinellas counties to the southern Lee counties.
Concentrations can be found 16 km off the coast of Hillsboroug County, but in fewer places than last week.
The red tide was also found in Pasco County.
