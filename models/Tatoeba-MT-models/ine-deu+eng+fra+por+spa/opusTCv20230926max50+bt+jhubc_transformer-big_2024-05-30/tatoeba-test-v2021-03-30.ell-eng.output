I'm greedy.
I often have nightmares.
They're all dying.
John has two sons.
He's still here.
Australia is a fantastic country.
Someone poisoned me.
Tell her I'll do it.
Mary spends most of her time in the library.
This is better than any other bag in this store.
I like horses.
Agreed.
How much is four by six?
I hugged Tom.
When were they born?
I have to go to the bank in the morning.
Tell Tom to shave his hair.
You think Tom did it?
We didn't play well.
Tom was hungry.
Tom lent me his bike.
Tell them we don't want to go.
She's been tracked.
I had nothing to do.
We're both very hungry.
We have a lot of friends.
I don't think I'm ready for the exam.
Mary responds to the teacher's question.
They'll fix it.
We don't have school tomorrow.
Rome was not built in a day.
I like to dance. I like to dance.
Everything's gonna be fine.
Why didn't you come?
Tell them we're here.
We need you.
We had no secrets.
Why do you learn French?
I've got a green shirt.
You're a lot faster than me.
Tom is now living in Australia.
Look at me and listen to me.
You want me to tell him?
Give it to Tom.
Peter loves Jane. He loves Jane.
Keep smiling. Keep smiling.
I refuse to allow that to happen.
Oh, good morning.
Do you like the juice?
You guys seem disappointed.
Tom knows everything about them.
Did you sleep at all?
Tom's a crazy kid.
That's right.
We laugh a lot.
Tell me what you're getting at the exams.
I don't think two languages are enough.
Can you lend me your car for tonight?
Where exactly did you put him?
Her daughter is a nurse.
I think we should tell them.
You should be grateful for that.
Tell him to come see me.
Tell him not to come.
I'm going to church by car.
You're much smarter than me.
Who's left?
Where exactly did you put it?
Write everything down.
Germany is in Central Europe.
I'm shy.
Tom's not laughing.
Amy's coming home at 3:00.
- I showed him my room.
The man wants to know the truth.
She went home.
Tom doesn't want to learn French.
I'm not ready yet.
Tom noticed that Mary was wearing a new gown.
I'm unemployed.
I'm not gonna lose her.
I'm trying to be happy.
Tom's teaching me French.
You're asking me to stay?
Find Tom.
Are you sure you want to go with Tom?
Tom couldn't understand Mary's joke.
Tell them I'm innocent.
I don't like raw fish.
Sit down.
You got anyone?
He's a high school Jutsu student.
You'll see.
I'm not happy with that.
They lost again.
Tom would do anything for you.
Is he okay?
What is the title of your new book?
Are you kidding me?
Could I find out where you work?
Can anyone explain it to me?
Who's that?
We need to tell him.
His jokes really kill me.
You've paid too much.
Are we sure we want to hire Tom?
We want to do it right.
I ate the meat.
Flowers and trees need clean air and water.
They have wine.
How can we find Tom?
He says he still loves me, but I don't believe him at all.
We painted the house green.
The time and place of the meeting are closed.
Tom's here.
How are things in Boston?
I've been promoted recently.
Millie doesn't drink water.
There are exceptions.
I love the flowers. I love the flowers.
They won't talk.
Tell him I'm here
Don't play here.
Please, close the door.
Garlic is good for health.
I wonder if Tom forgot to tell Mary he had to do it.
What would you tell her to do?
She's kissing him.
Tom said he didn't want to eat anything.
I'll stop.
Tom was working in Australia.
You're competitive.
I fainted.
I wish I wasn't Canadian.
What shines is not gold.
I've asked Tom to play the guitar.
My phone's ringing.
He threw his dirty clothes on the floor.
Are you a journalist?
Tom's a head taller than I am.
Where can we buy it?
It's 2:30 now.
Everybody knew you.
This book is yours.
Tom knew who was in his house.
Where's the oven?
You betrayed me.
We loved them.
You're not my father.
You're not Canadians.
Who's that?
Tom forgot his suitcase on the train.
They killed our cattle.
My name's not Kuzey.
I saw the girl.
We're still in Boston.
Try it out.
The phone's ringing.
Tom lives in Boston.
Thomas lives in a community of hippies.
The water's hot.
You need to hide.
I'm already working.
She likes to run.
Tom didn't want to touch it.
It was an emergency.
You're wearing expensive earrings.
Is anyone here?
Tom's the only Canadian here.
Tom's gonna live.
It was too late.
These aren't fish.
That's a phrase.
We need more volunteers.
Are you really a Canadian?
People today attach more importance to popular culture than in the past.
Tom's not my friend anymore.
It's very clean.
Do you know when they'll be back?
It's easy for Tom.
Can you help us to translate this text?
Did you dye your hair?
Did Tom see you?
We're in love.
I walk every day.
Tom didn't want to play poker.
I have to go to school.
Did you shoot him?
We might need a few.
This is a proposal.
How'd you spend the holidays?
Tom didn't tell me his secret.
We invited them to dinner.
I'm here, do we have a guest?
I'll warn you.
I'll try to find you.
What's your name?
I'm also unemployed.
Tom's house has been completely destroyed.
Tom's got Mary.
It's from France.
Why are you mad?
Tom was born in Boston.
Do you want to buy a home in Germany?
They're not happy.
Do you know who he is?
Did you watch baseball on TV last night?
Mary took a picture of her mother with her cell phone.
I wanted to die.
It does the same to me whether he comes or not.
I don't understand English.
It's not a matter of money.
Would you like to see them?
You destroyed him.
We learned to fly like birds and swim like fish, but we forgot how to live like humans.
I've learned a lot.
We don't trust strangers.
Tell her I'm busy.
I'm not gonna be late.
We need to find out what happened.
Try not to think about it.
I want you, Tom.
Let me clarify my position.
I've never stopped loving Mary.
You're not welcome here.
He's not there.
You're 18?
I want to do sports.
Tom was alive.
Thomas's phone rang, but he ignored it.
Can you teach me French?
The price was outrageous.
A little bit.
Where's your friend?
Do you know any Greek myths?
He's in his 40s.
What time are you leaving?
Tom gave Mary a lexicon of French.
The captain welcomes us to the ship.
She went with him.
Why aren't you here today?
He tried to throw her with love poems.
I'm married.
Tell them to help me.
The text is not read.

Wouldn't you go to Australia to build stores?
What do you call that?

We stayed three nights in Boston.
I'm starting to find you tiring.
I don't want to wait that long.
Tom's wearing gloves.
The letters were written by the girl.
Somebody yelled.
He didn't go to the lake.
He speaks fluently French.
I'm taller than you.
Did you lose your proof?
Are you afraid of losing your money?
Tell them to do the same.
Do you know when Tom's coming back?
Tom doesn't have red hair.
Can I borrow your headphones?
Why are you so happy today?
I'm impartial.
I think Tom's drunk.
Tom's your teacher.
The news made him happy.
We were the enemy.
Who's got it?
We have nowhere to go.

He convinced the teacher.
I thought Tom liked the riddles.
I don't have any money with me.
He'll be watching you.

Tom painted pink on the wall.
We're very busy.
Stronger, please.
You're mine.
Please breathe through your nose.
The company canceled the plan.
“Fire!” he shouted.
He worked hard.
I don't come here very often.
I'm gay.
You're easy-going.
Tom's not a hero.
I'm glad I was able to help.
Tom wasn't the one who killed Mary.
These keys are not mine.
That was the last client.
Do you like white wine?
They made a mistake.
I say it and I say it again.
Turn on the radio.
Tell them to come home.
I don't like spiders.
I couldn't sleep.
You're learning Chinese?
There's a lot of money.
That's not gonna happen again.
Russia is big.
The teacher is friendly.
You ruined it.
I'm sorry, I can't sit for long.
I'm a Harvard graduate.
Tom died before his son was born.
Look what I can do.
There's nothing you can do.
I don't want you to tell her.
Tom has a friend who lives in Boston.
What brings you here?
I made sure I was asleep.
I won't lose!
It's a good investment.
The snow made it difficult to see.
Don't apologize.
Thomas bought something for us.
He's got a little house.
The girl has a white horse.
Tom's a little jealous.
I still want to marry you.
Now it's your chance.
You can choose any book you want.

It's Anita's house.
Tell her it's urgent.
He likes to play football.
How old were you when you left Australia? <0xE2><0x86><0x92>

I'm going to Athens.
Yeah, I know.
I burst into tears.
He talks like a trucker.
When do you read?
He hasn't answered yet.
Where's the money?

Why do you hate Canada so much?
I can't lie to him.
I'm from Norway.
Is this a horse or a stag?
I'm grateful for what he's done.
I'm a little tired, too.
Are you sure you can't imagine things?
Don't apologize.
He's walking slow.
Come with us.
No one wants to take responsibility.
Is his father a Japanese?
Attention, please!
Are you sure you pressed the last button?

What time do they start?
I'm stuck now.
I'd think about it.
Tom's from australia.
Where do you want to eat?
That would never happen in Boston.

They didn't know me.
I'll fight.
We all know what Tom did.
Tell them you're not ready.

Who cares?
Tell me what you want.
First of all, God

He'll be back in a few days.
I lied to you.
Who's missing?

All the guests are gone.
Who killed Tom? Who killed Tom?

Come out. Come out.
I wish I had been born Canadian.
You're impatient.
You're impatient.
What did you promise to do?
I didn't participate in the discussion.
Please note: In English and we exclude nationalities, days of the week, and languages.
Tom loved me.
You were all guilty.
I trust you.
Wouldn't you go to Australia to build shops?
How many times have you kissed Tom?
My name is Cyril; I am glad to meet you!
He's got nice legs.
His current behavior confirms what we assumed.
You'll eat.
The problem is that you are not Canadian.

Is he coming?
Tell us where to go.

Do you feel tired?
"It's still shallow, isn't it? My feet are still sticking to the bottom." "It's a fairly shallow beach. Yotsuba, you're still getting to the bottom, right?"
I left for London.
I love dogs. I love dogs.

What are you reading?
All right, thank you.
I'm the only one who can save you.
Where's a bakery?
Tom owed Mary money. He owed her money.

Where's your house?
Tom wrote a lot of poems.
They've voted.
He's the one who wrote the book.

You're still alive.
I'll never forget this night.
I don't know if I have time.
I hope to see them.
I'm not going to reveal her secrets.
Mary responds to the teacher's question.
Tom said that he thought I looked impressed.
I get drunk at least once a month.
I want to eat some cheese.
He shot her.
I can't look up that word in the dictionary, I don't know the Arabic alphabet.
He answered the question.
The problem is, you're not Canadian.
I'll be in the car.
What is the title of your new book?
He lives in London.
I missed the last two lessons.
I'd like you to give me an explanation.

I'd like to cancel my ticket.
Who taught you French? Who taught you French?
You're very attractive.
Come in, please.

Don't do anything you'll regret.
This book is too small.
I was very, very hungry.
Run! Run!
They all started to run.
When's Tom reading?
We're gonna kill you.
You're old enough to do it on your own.
"What would you like?" "I'd like a dog."
You're working hard.
Tom wants to live in Boston.
It's actually a nice theory. The only disadvantage I think it has is probably common to all philosophical theories. It's wrong.
Why am I not surprised by that?
I was in Boston in october.
I wasn't at that meeting.
He spends a lot of money on shoes.
Tom's decided to leave Boston. He's not here.
I'm good at keeping secrets.
I'm really mad right now.
I thought you were a Japanese woman.
There's a lot of noise here.
Who's seen you?
They're bigger than her.
Please repeat what I'm saying.
You don't need a friend.
Europe is a continent.
I wonder why Tom didn't talk to Mary.
Language is the vehicle of thought.
Do you really believe these stories?
Mike's the tallest of the three.
Did you ask them to wait?
She's crying.
It'll work.
I'm assuming you're Canadian.
Yeah, I know.
Is Tom gonna die?

I accidentally met her at the store.
Tom is trying to learn French.
Tom has decided to go to Boston.
Don't you remember them?
I'm coughing.
Tell them I'll do it.
Do you have the source code?
Tell him your theory.
These apples are big.
I want soup.
Here you go.
Where did you get the key?
Might that not be right?
Tom can't stand the hot and wet summers here, so he went to the mountains.
Bill, give me a call tonight.
I will help in any way I can.
Please, tell me what you think.
Tom's waiting for you.
He's Italian, isn't he?
She gave it to me.
I'll pay you.
He had a lot of porn magazines in his room.
Let's leave her alone.
I just got back from Australia.
Tom was very friendly.
You're drunk!
Thomas is a wealthy man. He's a rich man.
Tell us about Tom.
Oh, thank you.
You're awake?
Algeria is very different from the United States.
It was not a pleasant experience.
He's teaching us French.
You're so beautiful you don't need a mesh.
Why do you want to go to Turkey?
He ran as fast as he could get his feet.
I like to fish. I like to fish.
I don't like those sweets.

I'm feeling younger again.
Tom ate an orange.
You're the expert.
Tell him I'm ready.
I have an appointment with the doctor.
Oh, yes.
It's true!
Can I use your phone, please?
He's from Greece.
Sometimes I understand you.
Tom was singing.
I love the taste of mushrooms.
Tom hated Mary.
Where can I buy tickets?
I was so hungry.
- When's your birthday?
I'm not your enemy.
I asked Tom to sign the papers.
Save them.
Tom didn't want to touch it.
I brought you something.
I pretended I was asleep.
Our teacher is a real asshole.
Tom wasn't ready to talk about it.
We tortured them.
Tom was quite impressive.
Mary is cautious with strangers.
We'll shoot.
Excuse me.
Where's the exit?
It was dark when I got home.
Life is hard.
Who's Tom talking about?
Your father won't buy it.
Tom pushed the door.
This is where I live.
I hope you'll call again.
Are you sure I'm the only Canadian here?
Speak slower.
Put the book on top of the others.
The bird is in the sky.
Tom has hired Mary.
Mike, how's it going?
Tom married a Canadian woman.
Tom says he's going to Boston in October.
You want me to tell him?
You saved us.
You're texting them?
Can I borrow a pencil?
We only have three choices.
The moon is behind the clouds.
You need to talk to Tom.
Tom worked in australia.
I want money.
Tom's snoring.
Do not turn off the light.
He was very happy.
Thomas was obviously unhappy.
Aren't you a teacher?
Tell him we're busy.
Tell her to help us.
Tom insisted on it.
Thank you, you're fantastic!
Will Israel attack Iran? <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
I like to laugh.
I was washing my shirt.
I'll talk to you later.
Eating slower will help you feel more fuller.
I'm French.
We forgot that you don't like pizza.
Yesterday I woke up early.

His answer was no.
I understand them.
You're still alive.
How old is he?

I'm not very good at that.
I was hoping to see Tom.
We are all Canadians.
Tom made some mistakes on the test.
Tom's gonna cook.

I was so mad.
I get it.
Honestly, I don't like it.
Tom's going to obey.
Were you alone?
We need more drivers.
I think you're on the right track.
It makes me laugh.
I'm at a friend's house.
Have you slept at all?
I thought it was a bad dream.
We know what the problem is.
It seems unfair to me.
I'm Mexican, I speak spanish fluently.
I have a special relationship with my aunt.
I just need your help.
Tom wanted me to learn French.
What are Tom's chances of winning?
Tom doesn't need a lawyer.
You speak spanish?
You're weak.
Where's the paper?
He went home on foot.
Tom's gonna cry.
Where does he live?
When are you coming?
We're ready to help.
Are you all set?
Tell them not to come.
It's not expensive.
The knife on the table wasn’t sharp enough to cut the meat, so I used my knife.
Is that your car?
I kissed her.
Tom arrived here last night. I'm sorry.
Who asked you that?
We flew from Boston to Chicago.
Is this where the bus stops?
Stop him! Stop him!

Tom lost all of his money.
What are you gonna tell Tom?
Tom has something to tell you.
How many hours did Tom work yesterday?
Why are we poor?
Tom's naked in the middle and up.
I hope they find Tom.
I'm expecting you from the two of them.
Bring them with you.
Give me your money, please.
What can you say in English?
French is not an easy language at all.
It's not my fault.
Can you answer that?
I have to be there before seven.
How many oranges did Tom eat?
"What do you want to know?" "Everything."
Tom insisted on helping Mary.
Tom's graduating in October.
Tom's gonna help Mary.
Close the window before you go out.
I wasn't at his funeral.
I didn't think it would be that easy to do.
Hold on a second.
Tom's gonna catch Mary.
Tom ignored Mary's advice.
Tom has decided to go to Boston.
Are you sure you don't want me to talk to Tom about this?
I'm your doctor.
Look at that tall building.
The city has changed a lot since then.
These are ours.
Our team has good players.
I always put my team first.
I have a lot of friends living in Boston.
That's not a fish.
Emilia does the homework she has.
I like that kind of music.

I'd like to help you.
I didn't like it.
The cherries are red.
We were both very, very thirsty.
Why did you paint the bench red?
Tom and Mary were still good friends, though.
Do you speak a language other than English?
Tom's too slow.
How often do you eat out?
I'm 19 years old.
When's your birthday?
Did you know Tom well?
I was in the right place at the right time.
Are you sure you pressed the last button?
It's not hard to learn English.

Tom ignored Mary's.
When did you buy it?
Let him go. Let him go.
We want to create the least disturbance possible.
We were born on the same day.
You're indecisive.
She promised me she'd come.
That wasn't necessary.
If you can read this, then you can speak a language.
Everybody agrees.
I survived.
Tell her to come here.
I've always dreamed of going to Australia.
You can wait here.
I laughed a lot.
When I first met her, she was about 30.

I speak french.
Can I borrow your headphones?
