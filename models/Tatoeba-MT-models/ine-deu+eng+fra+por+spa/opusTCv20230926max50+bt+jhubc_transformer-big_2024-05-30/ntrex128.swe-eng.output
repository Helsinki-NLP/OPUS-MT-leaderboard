A.M. in Wales is worried about "appearing like a puckon"
Some AMs, members of the National Assembly of Wales, are confused about a proposal to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The proposal comes after plans to change the name of the National Assembly to the Parliament of Wales.
People across the political spectrum are worried about being mocked.
An AM for Labour said his group was concerned because "it rhymes with Twp and Pwp".
For readers who can’t speak Welsh: Twp means dumb in Welsh and pwp means bajs.
An AM for Plaid said the group was generally "dissatisfied" and has suggested other options.
A conservative Welshman said his group is "open" to the name change, but pointed out that it was a short step from the MWP to Mupp.
In this context, W is pronounced in Welsh similar to the letter U in English in Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently compiling legislation for the name change, said: "The final decision on what members of the Assembly are to be called is, of course, up to the members themselves."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which found strong support for calling the Assembly the Welsh Parliament.
On the title of AM, the Commission proposed Welsh Parliament Members or WMP, but the MWP was most supported in a public consultation.
AM apparently proposes other options, but problems with reaching a consensus can cause problems for Presiding Officer Elin Jones, who is expected to submit draft legislation on the change within a few weeks.
The legislation for the amendments also includes other changes to the way the assembly works, including rules for disqualifying an AM and the design of the committee system.
They are allowed to vote on what they should be called when they debate the legislation.
Macedonia holds referendum to change country's name
On Sunday, voters will vote on whether to change the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The referendum is an attempt to end a dispute that has been going on for decades with neighbouring Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted on the neighbouring country’s name representing a claim to its territory and has repeatedly protested its attempt to become a member of the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov opposes the referendum on the name change and has said he will ignore the result.
But supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is the price they have to pay to join the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's Clocks Silence When Harlem Churches Meet Trouble
“The older people I’m talking to say there was a bar and a church in every corner before,” Adams said.
"Now there is neither or."
He said it's understandable that the bars are disappearing.
“People are socializing differently nowadays,” he said.
“Bars are no longer like the area’s living room, where people go on a regular basis.”
Concerning the churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of assets will not be enough as far as the leaders expect and that "sooner or later they will end up in box one again".
He also pointed out that churches can be replaced by apartment buildings with owner-occupied apartments filled with people who do not help remaining churches.
"The absolute majority of people who buy apartments in the buildings will be white," he said. "This will eventually lead to the closure of all the churches, because those who move into the apartments are unlikely to become members of the churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis – Metropolitan Community 1870, St. Martin’s a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation moved out in the 1930s.
A black congregation that had a nearby church took over the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black congregation led by Pastor John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of stores on 125th Street, a shopping street in Harlem, who refused to hire or promote black people.
The building was severely damaged in a fire in 1939, but when Pastor Johnson's congregation planned the renovation, they also built the bell tower.
Pastor David Johnson, father Johnson’s son and successor at St. Martin’s, proudly called the music play the “clocks of the poor.”
The expert who played the clock game in July had a different name for it: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also pointed out that it was the world’s first clock game played by a black musician – Dionisio A. Lind, who went on to the larger clock game at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Mr. Merriweather, St. Martin's didn't replace him.
The events of the last few months at St. Martin’s are a complicated history of architects and contractors – some employed by the laity of the church, others by the episcopal diocese.
The church council – the assembly’s governing body consisting of laymen – wrote to the foundation in July, expressing concern that the foundation would “try to transfer the cost” to the church council, even though the church council had not been involved when the foundation hired architects and contractors.
Some members of the congregation complained of a lack of transparency from the Diocese.
Shark injures 13-year-old who dives for lobster in California
On Saturday, a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy who appeared after lobster in California on the first day of the lobster season, according to officials.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m., near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB TV in San Diego that he had been diving with his friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy calling for help and paddled there with a group of others to pull him out of the water.
According to Hammel, at first he thought the boy was only happy to have found a lobster, but then he realized that the boy shouted, "I've been bitten!"
"I've been bitten!"
When Hammel reached the boy, he noticed that his entire clavicular bones had been torn apart.
"I called out to everyone to get out of the water. 'There's a shark in the water!'" said Hammel.
The boy was flown to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and his condition is reported to be critical.
It is unclear what kind of shark it was.
Bathing captain Larry Giles told the media that a shark had seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but that it had been determined that it was not a dangerous shark.
Giles also said the victim had traumatized his upper torso.
Access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas was blocked for 48 hours for investigative and security reasons.
Giles mentioned that there are over 135 sharks in the area, but that most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's enters the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's takes care of Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with department store-like beauty courses with beauty specialists.
As part of a significant push into the UK beauty market of <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion, which continues to grow despite the decline of the fashion and household market, the larger beauty courses will be tested in 11 stores across the country and implemented in more stores next year if they are successful.
The investment in the beauty market is part of the supermarket’s efforts to fill the shelves previously occupied by televisions, microwaves and household products.
Sainsbury’s said it plans to double its beauty offering to up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Existing ranges from L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees will also get more space with highlighted areas, such as in stores like Boots.
The chain is also re-launching its boutique makeup brand so that most of the products are vegan – which is increasingly demanded by young customers.
In addition, Fragrance Shop will test booths in two Sainsbury’s stores – the first booth opened in Croydon in southern London last week and the second will open in Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Shopping online and the tendency to buy smaller amounts of food every day in local stores means that supermarkets have to do more to attract customers.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury’s, has said that their stores will look more and more like department stores in an attempt to fight cheap stores like Aldi and Lidl with more services and products than food.
Sainsbury’s has Argos booths in hundreds of stores and has also acquired a number of Habitat booths since they bought both chains two years ago, which they say has increased food sales and made acquisitions more profitable.
The Supermarket’s previous attempts to give the beauty and pharmacy departments a facelift failed.
Sainsbury's tested a partnership with Boots in the early 2000s, but the partnership ended after a dispute over how the proceeds from Boots' sales in supermarkets would be distributed.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury’s sold its pharmacy business with 281 stores to Celesio, which owns the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
They argue that Lloyds would play a role in the plan by adding an expanded range of luxury skin care products, including brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury’s commercial manager, said: “We have given our beauty salons a new look and feel to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained employees who can advise customers.
Our range of brands has been designed to meet every need, and with an appealing environment in smooth places, we are now an attractive beauty destination that challenges the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones 'Rased' After Holly Willoughby Withdraws <0xC2><0xA3>11 Million Deal
Dragons Den-star Peter Jones is "raging" that TV presenter Holly Willoughby is pulling out of a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn’t have time with their Truly brand, with casual clothing and accessories.
Their activities have been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand.
This Morning presenter, 37, announced his decision on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has made Dragons Den star Peter Jones furious by pulling out of their lucrative lifestyle brand at the last minute – to focus on their new deals with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones was "shocked" at a tense meeting at his business empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire on Tuesday when the TV favorite admitted that her new contract - worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million - meant she could no longer focus on their brand Truly, with leisure clothing and accessories.
The business has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand and was expected to double Willoughby’s estimated fortune of <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, announced that she was leaving Truly on Instagram, Jones flew to one of her holiday homes.
A source said: “Truly was clearly Holly’s top priority.
That would be her long-term future for decades to come.
Her decision to withdraw shocked everyone involved.
No one could believe it happened on Tuesday, so close to launch.
There's a warehouse full of goods ready for sale at headquarters in Marlow."
Experts believe that the This Morning presenter’s decision to withdraw could cost the company several million dollars due to significant investments in everything from pillows and candles to clothes, as well as the risk of further delays in launching.
This could be the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby started Truly with Capp 2016 and Jones, 52, took the role as chairman in March.
The couple are vacationing together and Jones owns 40% of Baldwin’s TV production company.
Willoughby will become brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of "I'm a Celebrity" on ITV.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We are not commenting on his business."
“Tough talk, and then we fell in love.”
He joked that the media would criticize him for a comment that some would consider "unworthy of a president" and for being so positive about North Korea's leaders.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said in a "newspaper vote":
“I have not given up anything.”
He said Kim wants a second meeting after Trump celebrated their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step towards North Korea’s nuclear disarmament.
But negotiations on nuclear disarmament have stalled.
More than three months after the meeting in Singapore in June, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told leaders at the U.N. General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea does not see a "corresponding response" from the United States after North Korea's first steps in disarmament.
He noted that instead, the United States continues to impose sanctions designed to maintain pressure.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech to his supporters.
“North Korea is doing great,” he said.
“We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a great relationship.”
He said his attempts to improve relations with Kim have had positive results – an end to rocket tests, liberating the hostages and returning the remains of U.S. soldiers.
And he defended his different way of talking about the relationship with Kim.
“It’s so easy to behave like a president, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to get into this crowded arena, we would have around 200 people here,” Trump said.
Tsunami and earthquake devastate island in Indonesia, hundreds die
After the earthquake in Lombok, for example, foreign NGOs were told they were not needed.
Despite the loss of over 10 per cent of Lombok's population, no state of emergency was declared, which is required for international assistance.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they have been very clear that they are not asking for international help, which complicates the whole thing," Sumbung said.
Rescue the children gathers a team to go to Palu, but it is still unclear if foreign personnel can work there.
Mr Sutopo, the agency’s spokesman, said Indonesian officials assessed the situation in Palu to determine whether international organizations should be allowed to participate in the aid work.
Given Indonesia's constant earthquakes, the country is still sadly unprepared for the wrath of nature.
Tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, but they are rare on other coastlines.
The absence of a tsunami warning sound in Palu, despite the fact that a warning had been issued, probably contributed to the loss of life.
Even under perfect conditions, it is a challenge to travel between the many islands of Indonesia.
Natural disasters further complicate logistics.
A hospital ship that has been docked in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it takes at least three days to reach the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo focused on promises to improve Indonesia’s worn-out infrastructure in his election campaign and has spent large sums on roads and railroads.
But lack of funding has plagued Mr. Joko's administration ahead of next year's election.
Mr Joko is also plagued by persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where the Muslim majority has adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands lost their homes when Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets with machetes, bows and other primitive weapons.
Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge wins last minute against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League loss to Chelsea with a goal in the 89th minute at Stamford Bridge in London on Saturday.
Sturridge got a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 meters from Chelsea's goal when his team lagged behind 1-0.
He transferred the ball to the left and scooped a kick against the away pole.
The experiment flew high above the target area towards the upper right corner of the net.
The ball finally fell over Kepa Arrizabalaga's hopes and ended up in the net.
"I was just trying to get in a position to access the ball and players like Shaq are always playing forward as much as possible, so I was just trying to give myself as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante approaching and didn't think about it so much but just kicked."
Chelsea led 1-0 after the first half after a goal in the 25th minute from Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The blue striker gave a pass back to Mateo Kovacic, spinning off near the midfield and sprinting to Liverpool's side.
Kovacic made a quick give-and-go at the midfield.
Then he got a sovereign kick that brought Hazard into the target area.
Hazard ran away from the defense and got the ball in the net at the away pole with a left-footed kick past Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy at 15:00 on Wednesday.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League in London at 15:00 on Thursday.
Tsunami death toll in Indonesia rises to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, according to the country's disaster agency early on Sunday.
Many people were reported to have been trapped in the debris of buildings that collapsed in the 7.5 earthquake that struck Friday and triggered waves of up to six meters, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said at a news conference.
The city of Palu, with over 380,000 inhabitants, was full of rushing buildings that collapsed.
Police arrest 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after woman was stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been launched after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old was found at 7:55 a.m. with a knife wound at Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have asked people in the area who saw or heard anything to appear.
Criminal Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "We are at an early stage of the investigation, but I ask anyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead and saw or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I also ask anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have filmed something with a car camera to contact us because they may have information that is crucial to our investigation."
A police spokesman has confirmed that the woman who was found lives in Birkenhead and that the body was found inside a property.
During the afternoon, friends who think they know the woman have arrived at the place to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigation is underway and the police will inform the victim's immediate relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews has just tried to get into his apartment, but police said no one is allowed to enter or exit the building.
He became speechless when he found out what had happened.
Residents of the building have been informed that it takes several hours for them to get back in.
A police assistant told a man that the whole area is being treated like a crime scene.
A weeping woman appeared at the scene.
She says "it's so terrible" over and over again.
At 2:00 p.m., there were two police cars inside the lockdown and another just outside.
A number of police assistants stood inside the lockdown with an overview of the apartment building.
Persons with information are requested to send a DM to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 and enter log 247 from 30 September.
Parliament statue of Cromwell latest victim of quarrel over rewriting history
A ban would be poetic justice for his Taliban-like destruction of so many of England’s cultural and religious artifacts performed by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But Cromwell Society called Mr. Crick's proposal "crazy" and "trying to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable that the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside the Westminster Palace would be drawn into the ongoing debate about removing statues."
The iconoclasm during the English Civil War was neither ordered nor executed by Cromwell.
Cromwell might have been sacrificed for what his ancestor Thomas had done 100 years earlier.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft’s magnificent representation of Cromwell shows the view of the 19th century and is part of the historiography of a man who many believe should still be praised.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than now, believe that Cromwell defended Parliament against pressure from outside, in his case from the monarchy.
If this is a correct representation is the subject of an ongoing historical debate.
But the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has undoubtedly affected the development of our nation, and Cromwell is a well-known person who represents one side of the matter.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve to be praised and celebrated.
Killer Pig Kills Farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only by his surname Yuan, was found dead with a fractured artery and covered in blood in a stia on the market in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to inject vaccines into pigs in a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He reportedly traveled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that the door to a pig lane nearby was open.
He said there was a big pig in the pigsty with blood on its mouth.
A forensic investigation confirmed that the 250 kg pig had killed the farmer, according to the report.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and twisted," the cousin, identified by the surname Wu, told Guiyang Evening News.
A surveillance camera filmed Yuan as he came to the market to feed his pigs at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday.
His body was found an hour later.
The pig that killed the farmer did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig had been locked up to avoid further attacks while police collected evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and market officials are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
It is rare for pigs to attack humans, but this has happened before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts and seriously injured the man.
Ten years earlier, a 300-kilo-pound pig pushed a farmer in Wales against a tractor until his wife frightened it away.
When a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are normally not aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a “catalyst.”
“They’re just playful.
They're very inquisitive and they don't want to hurt anyone.
You just have to show them respect,” he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa for widespread heavy rain to the southwest of the United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa becomes weaker as it travels over cooler waters off Mexico’s northern coast.
But Rosa will bring flooding rain to northern Mexico and the southwestern United States in the coming days.
Rosa had a wind speed of up to 135 km/h, Category 1, at five o'clock EST on Sunday and was located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to travel north on Sunday.
As Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula as a tropical storm on Monday, it will force deep tropical moisture north into the southwestern United States.
Pink will bring up to 25 cm of rain in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then tropical moisture that interacts with the approaching trough will create widespread heavy rainfall in the southwestern United States in the coming days.
Locally, 2.5–10 cm of rain will cause dangerous floods, mudflows and possibly landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical humidity will lead to 5–7.5 cm of rain per hour in some places, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Up to 5–10 cm of rain is expected in some locations in the southwestern United States, especially in large parts of Arizona.
Sudden flooding is possible with rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the spread of tropical rain.
It is absolutely not recommended that anyone go out in the desert on foot when tropical rain is expected.
Heavy rain can turn canyons into flooding rivers and thunderstorms lead to strong local winds blowing around the sand.
The approaching trough brings locally heavy rain to parts of the southern California coastline.
It is possible with a total over one cm of rain, which can lead to mud flows and steep roads.
It would be the first rainfall in the area during the rainy season.
Some scattered tropical rainstorms will approach Arizona late on Sunday and early on Monday, before the rain becomes more widespread later on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to Four Corner on Tuesday and continue through Wednesday.
October can mean intense temperature changes throughout the United States, as the Arctic cools down but the tropics remain warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic temperature changes over short distances.
There is a good example of dramatic temperature differences in central America on Sunday.
That's nearly ten degrees difference between Kansas City in Missouri and Omaha in Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa.
In the coming days, the remaining summer heat will try to spread again.
Large parts of the central and eastern United States are expected to have a warm start in October with around 30 degrees from the Great Plains to parts of the northeastern United States.
New York can get 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would be around five degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast suggests a high chance of warmer temperatures than the average in the eastern United States in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh’s interrogation
More than 20 million people watched Thursday’s arresting testimony from Brett Kavanaugh, nominated for the Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual assault that allegedly took place in the 1980s, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, the political stalemate continued and the normal broadcast was interrupted for Friday’s last-minute twist – Arizona Senator Jeff Flake’s deal with the FBI where they had a week to investigate the accusation.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she is absolutely sure that Kavanaugh taunted her when he was drunk and tried to take off her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh gave a passionate testimony and said that he is absolutely sure that it did not happen.
It is likely that the number of viewers on Friday was higher than the 20.4 million stated by Nielsen.
They counted the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN; Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The number of viewers was not immediately available to other TV networks that showed the hearing, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen often has trouble counting people looking from the office.
In comparison, there are as many spectators as for a football match in the final game or the Oscars.
Fox News Channel, whose hosts have shown strong support for Kavanaugh’s nomination, had the most viewers with an average of 5.69 million during the day-long hearing, according to Nielsen.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was in the spotlight during Friday's drama.
After the Republican office issued a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS filmed protesters yelling at him as he tried to take a lift to a hearing with the Judiciary Committee on Friday morning.
He looked down on the floor for several minutes while the protesters shouted at him, as shown in live broadcast by CNN.
“I’m right in front of you,” said one woman.
“Do you think he’s telling the truth?”
They also said, "You have power when so many women are powerless."
Flake said his office had issued a statement and before the elevator doors were closed, he said he would have more to say after the hearing with the committee.
The TV networks broadcast live several hours later when the Judiciary Committee voted on whether to pass Kavanaugh’s nomination to a vote by the entire Senate.
But Flake said he only intends to do so if the FBI investigates the allegations against the nominee next week, as minority Democrats have demanded.
Flake was partially persuaded by his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and several senators afterwards, Flake made his decision.
Flake's decision had a major impact, as it was clear that the Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
UK Prime Minister May accuses critics of 'political games' over Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May has accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union for "political games" about Britain's future and to undermine the nation's interest in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK on 29 September 2018.
In another interview next to her on the front page of the newspaper, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson continued his attack on her so-called Chequers Brexit plan, saying that the proposal for the UK and EU to collect each other’s customs duties was “completely unreasonable.”
Wayde Sims Shooting: Police Arrest Suspect Dyteon Simpson for LSU Player's Death
Police have arrested a suspect in the shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and imprisoned for murder, police in Baton Rouge said.
The authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson and the police said the Sims lost their glasses in battle.
Police found the glasses at the scene and found Simpson’s DNA on them, according to CBS subsidiary WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, the police said he admitted that he shot and killed Wayde.
His bail was set at $350,000, according to Advocate.
The East Baton Rouge Parish coroner released a preliminary report Friday that said the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The police thanked the Louisiana State Police Escape Force, the state police justice lab, the Southern University police and residents of the area for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU’s athletic director Joe Alleva thanked the local police for their “split and pursuit of justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
The 1.98-meter-long forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "broken" and "shocked" by Waydes' death.
"You're worried about things like this all the time," Wade said.
Volcano spits ash over Mexico City
Ash from the volcano Popocatepetl has reached the southern part of the capital of Mexico.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity had been detected in the crater and they recorded 183 emissions of gas and ash over the course of 24 hours.
The center detected several mules and tremors.
Pictures on social media showed thin layers of ash on windscreens in areas of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noted increased activity in the volcano 72 km southeast of the capital since a 7.1-magnitude earthquake in central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists on the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after independence protesters collided with riot police as thousands took part in rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarizing vote on secession.
A group of masked separatists held back by riot police threw eggs and colored powder on them, leading to dark dust clouds on streets that are usually full of tourists.
Fighting also broke out later in the day and police used their batons to stop them.
For several hours, the independence groups shouted "never forget, never forgive" while the Unionists shouted "long live Spain".
14 people were treated for minor injuries caused by the protests, according to local media.
The mood is still tense in the region, which longs for independence a year after the first October referendum, which was considered illegal by Madrid but was hailed by Catalan separatists.
An overwhelming majority voted for independence, but participation was low when most anti-secessionists boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured in violent clashes last year when police tried to stop the vote at polling stations in the region.
Independence groups camped during the night on Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place anyway, but was forced to take another route.
The 68-year-old electrician Narcis Termes took part in the separatist protest with his wife, saying he no longer believes that Catalonia will become independent.
“Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying for joy to be able to vote, but now we’re stuck,” he said.
Despite a decisive but marginal win in regional elections in December, Catalan independence parties have had a hard time keeping up the momentum this year, as many of their most well-known leaders live in self-imposed exile or are in prison awaiting trial about their role in the organization of the referendum and the subsequent independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in support of police on her mobile phone, said the conflict had been sparked by politicians on both sides.
“It’s getting more and more exciting,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who has been in detention since the end of last year, announced that he intends to run for the European Parliament elections next year.
"Candidacy for the European Parliament is the best way to condemn the return of democratic values and the subjugation we have experienced from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men Arrested After Driving Into Houses
Three men – 33, 34 and 39 – have been arrested after a car was driven into a house in Londonderry repeatedly.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent, around 19:30 BST on Thursday.
Detective Bob Blemmings said the gates and the building itself were damaged.
An armrest may also have been fired at the car.
Menga gives Livingston 1-0 to Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured the win
Livingston shocked the Rangers and sentenced Steven Gerrard to his second loss in 18 games as manager for the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's strike turned out to be the difference when Gary Holt's side was split second with the Hibernian.
Gerrard’s side still hasn’t won a away win in the Premiership this season and will face Hearts, with eight more points, next Sunday.
Before that, Rangers will welcome Rapid Vienna to the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston extends his winning streak to six games – head coach Holt has still not experienced a loss since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses out on opportunities for cross-visitors
Holt's team should have taken the lead long before they scored; their straightforwardness gave the Rangers all sorts of problems.
Scott Robinson broke through but dragged his performance across the goal, and then Alan Lithgow could only shoot wide after slipping in to measure Craig Halkett's nicking across the goal.
The home team was content to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing they could attack in certain games.
And that’s how the final goal was made.
The Rangers gave up a free kick and Livingston took advantage of an opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson collaborated to give Menga a chance, which made goals from the middle of the goal area.
At that time, the Rangers had dominated the ball, but the home team's defense was impenetrable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was left largely alone.
The same pattern continued in the second half, but Alfredo Morelos forced a rescue from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was denied by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor's feet and Lithgow shot wide from another of Livingston's determined games.
Crossings constantly entered Livingston’s target area and were handled without problems. Two penalties – after Halkett’s challenge by the trader Glenn Middleton and one by hand – were dismissed.
"Fenomenal" from Livingston – analysis
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Arena
Fantastic performance and results for Livingston.
Each one was outstanding and continues to exceed expectations on the way up.
Their playing style and staff have barely changed since they returned to the top level, but Holt deserves the honor of having galvanized the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was outstanding and led a skillfully organized defense, and Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall in full swing straight through.
But the Rangers lacked inspiration.
They've had their moments under Gerrard, but they didn't live up to the standard.
Their last ball didn’t hold the ball – they only opened the home side once – and it’s kind of a wake-up call for the Rangers, located in the middle.
Erdogan receives a mixed welcome in Cologne
Saturday invited smiles and blue skies (September 29th) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany ate breakfast together in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany – to repair relations between the NATO allies.
They have fallen apart on human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city has the world's largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Police claimed they prevented 25,000 spectators from gathering outside the mosque for security reasons, but many supporters gathered nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters – many of them Kurdish – also made their voices heard and condemned both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to welcome him to Germany.
The dueling protests show the divided opinions about a visitor who is considered a hero by some German Turks and condemned as a one-violent ruler by others.
Road accident in Deptford: cyclist dies in car crash
A cyclist has died in a collision with a car in London.
The crash took place near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford in southeast London, around 10:15 BST.
The driver stopped the car and the nurse was called there, but the man died on the spot.
The crash comes a few months after another cyclist died in a contagion accident on Childers Street, about 1.5 km from the crash on Saturday.
The Metropolitan Police said they were trying to identify the man and notify his immediate relatives.
Roads have been blocked off and buses have been rerouted and drivers are asked to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six guards injured in turmoil
Six prison guards have been injured in riots at a high-security men's prison, according to the Prison Office.
The riots broke out at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 9:30 BST on Sunday and are still ongoing.
Specialized "tornado guards" have been called there to deal with the unrest, involving eight prisoners on a wing.
The guards were treated on site for minor facial injuries.
A spokesman for the Prison Service said: “Specially trained prison personnel have been sent there to handle the ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and are clear that those behind this will be referred to the police and may receive extended prison sentences.”
HMP Long Lartin holds over 500 prisoners, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison director was being treated in hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, the police were called to the prison to deal with serious unrest in which personnel were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with flooding (areas with drought may benefit)
It’s rare for tropical low pressures to reach Arizona, but that’s exactly what is likely to happen early next week when Hurricane Rosa’s remaining energy pulls out across the desert in the southwestern United States, with the risk of sudden flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings for sudden floods for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona and into southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to travel directly over Phoenix on Tuesday, and bring with it rain late on Monday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix said in a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or low pressure status within 320 km of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 65 km of the Arizona border.
The latest National Hurricane Center models predict 5–10 cm of rain, with isolated amounts of up to 15 cm in Mogollon Rim, Arizona.
Other parts of the desert in the southwestern United States, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to receive 2.5–5 cm of rain with a risk of up to 10 cm.
In areas without the risk of sudden flooding, Rosa’s rain can be a blessing, as the region is affected by drought.
Floods are very serious, but some of the rain is likely to be of benefit as the southwestern United States suffers from drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, just over 40 percent of Arizona suffers from at least extreme drought, the second highest category, weather.com reported.
Hurricane Rosa will first travel across the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, still with hurricane strength on Sunday morning with a maximum wind speed of 135 km/h, is located 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and travels north at 20 km/h.
The storm hits cooler water in the Pacific Ocean, calming it down.
It is therefore expected to reach the landmass of Mexico as a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
Parts of Mexico may receive heavy rain, which poses a significant risk of flooding.
“A total of 7.5–15 cm of rain is expected from Baja California to northwestern Sonora, with a risk of up to 25 cm,” weather.com reported.
Rosa will then travel north across Mexico as a tropical storm and reach the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical low pressure, which will then travel through Arizona and into southern Utah late Tuesday evening.
"The greatest danger from Rosa and its remaining energy is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the deserts of the southwestern United States," the National Hurricane Center said.
The rain is expected to lead to life-threatening sudden floods and clay flows in the desert, as well as landslides in mountainous terrain.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with a knife wound in Somerset.
The teenage boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, around 4:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital and the condition is reported to be "stable".
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, police in Avon and Somerset said.
The police are asking anyone who may have filmed what happened to the phone to come forward.
Trump says Kavanaugh "suffered, the wickedness, the anger" of the Democratic Party
“A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the Democratic Party’s ruthlessness and scandalous tactics,” Trump told supporters in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had "suffered from the wickedness, anger" of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying Christine Blasey Ford's accusation that he sexually abused her decades earlier when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified before Congress about his accusation.
The president said on Saturday that “the American people saw the brilliance and the quality and the courage” of Kavanaugh that day.
“A vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to confirm one of the most skilled legal senses of our time, a lawyer with a first-class history of serving the public,” he told his supporters in the audience in West Virginia.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's nomination when he talked about the importance of Republicans voting in the upcoming midterm elections.
“We are five weeks from one of the most important choices in our lives.
“I’m not a candidate, but I’m a candidate,” he said.
"That's why I'm going around fighting for sovereign candidates."
Trump said Democrats are trying to “resist and prevent.”
The first crucial vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place by Friday, according to information to CNN from an assistant to a senior Republican leader.
Hundreds of dead in earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, number rises
At least 384 people died, many were swept away when giant waves crashed onto the beaches, when a major earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, according to authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday when up to six meters high waves crashed against the beach in the twilight, sweeping out many to a safe death and destroying everything in their way.
The tsunami occurred after an earthquake of 7.5.
"When the tsunami warning came yesterday, people stopped on the beach instead of running away immediately, and they fell victim to the tsunami," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia's BNPB disaster agency, told a meeting in Jakarta.
"The tsunami was not alone, but dragged cars, barges and houses with it. It hit everything in its way," Nugroho said. He also said that the tsunami had travelled on the high seas for up to 800 km/h before hitting the coastline.
Some climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
Around 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 facilities in Palu.
Aerial photographs released by the disaster agency show that many buildings and shops are destroyed, bridges are distorted and have collapsed, and a mosque is surrounded by water.
The coastal city was still hit by aftershocks on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area with a population of 2.4 million.
The Indonesian Agency for Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the amount of energy released in the massive earthquake on Friday was 200 times the amount of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
The city is located at the end of a long, narrow bay, which may have made the tsunami bigger, according to the agency.
Nugroho described the devastation as “extensive” and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels have collapsed.
Dead victims were found under the rushing of collapsed buildings, he said, and 540 people were injured and 29 are missing.
Nugroho said the casualties and injuries could be even worse along the coastline 300 km north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the earthquake's epicenter.
Communication from Donggala "was completely paralyzed without any information," Nugroho said.
"There are over 300,000 people living there," the Red Cross said in a statement, and its staff and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
"It's already a tragedy, but it could get much worse," they said.
The agency was criticized on Saturday for failing to inform that the tsunami had struck Palu, but authorities said the waves had appeared by the time the warning was issued.
In an amateur video shared on social media, a man upstairs in a building is heard shouting frenzied tsunami warnings to people on the street below.
Within minutes, a wall of water crashes against the beach and sweeps away buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately authenticate the video.
The earthquake and tsunami led to a massive power outage that cut off all communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to rescue.
The military has begun sending cargo flights to Jakarta and other cities, according to authorities, but evacuated people are still in dire need of food and other supplies.
The city’s airport has been opened for relief work and remains closed for other traffic until October.
President Joko Widodo planned to visit facilities in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia exceeds 800.
It's very bad.
Employees from World Vision in Donggala have taken to Palu where they seek shelter under tarpaulins in the yard outside the office, but they saw devastation along the way, according to Mr. Doseba.
"They said they saw many destroyed houses," he said.
It's very bad.
Assistance teams have begun assistance work, but some complained that foreign aid workers with extensive expertise were prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, supplies and staff from abroad can only be used if the state of emergency is declared after a disaster.
This has not yet happened.
"It's still a regional disaster," said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“When authorities say it’s a national disaster, we can let in international aid, but that status has not been announced yet.”
When the second night fell in Palu after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, relatives and friends of missing persons still hoped that their loved ones would turn out to be the miracles that light up bleak natural disasters.
On Saturday, a small boy was rescued from a sewer.
On Sunday, rescue workers rescued a woman who had been trapped under a ruckus for two days with her mother’s body beside her.
Gendon Subandono, Indonesia’s national screen-flight team coach, had trained two of the missing screen-flights ahead of the Asian Games, which ended in Indonesia earlier this month.
Others who were stuck at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
“As a screen flying veteran, I have my own emotional burden,” he said.
Mr Gendon said hours after the screen planes heard that the Roa Roa Hotel had collapsed, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the Palu participants attending the beach festival.
But his messages got only one grey buck, instead of two blue ones.
“I think that means the messages weren’t delivered,” he said.
Thieves take $26,750 during ATM refill at Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's employee filling up an ATM at Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from Newport police.
The driver of the car had emptied an ATM at the entertainment facility and would deliver more money, police officer Dennis McCarthy said in the message.
While he was busy, "another man jumped up behind Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money to be delivered.
Witnesses saw several suspects flee the scene, according to the press release, but police did not specify how many were involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about the perpetrators should contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rappers change their name to Ye
The rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
He announced the change of name on Twitter on Saturday, saying, “The creature that is formally known as Kanye West.”
West, 41, has been called Ye for a long time and used the nickname as the title for his eighth album, which was released in June.
The name change comes before his participation in Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande in the program, who canceled for "emotional reasons" according to the creators of the program.
Ye is an abbreviation of West's current professional name, but he has also said that the word has a religious meaning for him.
"I think 'ye' is the word most used in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," West said earlier this year when he was talking about the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
"So I am you, I am we, we are.
It went from Kanye, which means ‘the one’, to just Ye – a mirror of our good, our evil, our confused, everything.
The album is like a mirror of who we are.
He is one of a number of well-known rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs has previously been called Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers to be called Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who previously collaborated with West, has previously written his name with and without hyphens and uppercase letters.
Mexico's AMLO vows not to use military against civilians
Mexico’s newly elected president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use the military against civilians now that the country is approaching the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students.
Lopez Obrador promised at Tlatelolco Plaza on Saturday that he would “never use the military to oppress the Mexican people.”
Troops fired weapons at a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, killing up to 600 people during an era when left-wing student movements took root in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has vowed to support young Mexicans with monthly grants to students and by opening more free public universities.
He has said that unemployment and inadequate educational opportunities attract young people to criminal gangs.
The U.S. Should Double AI Financing
Now that China is becoming more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount it spends on research in the field, according to inventor and AI user Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comment comes after several parts of the U.S. government have made statements about AI, despite the fact that the U.S. does not have an overall formal AI strategy.
China presented its plan last year with the goal of becoming a leader in AI innovation by 2030.
“It would be a good start to double the budget for AI research, given that all other countries are so far behind the United States and we are looking for the next breakthrough in AI,” Lee said.
A double budget could double the chance of the next major AI breakthrough being made in the U.S., Lee told CNBC in an interview earlier this week.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published earlier this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China’s most prominent AI companies – Face++.
At Carnegie Mellon University in the 1980s, he worked on an AI system that beat the top-ranked U.S. Othello player, and later served in the management of Microsoft Research and was the CEO of Google’s China division.
Lee mentioned earlier technology competitions from the U.S. government, such as the Robot Challenge from the Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked what would be next to be able to identify future visionaries.
In the United States, researchers often have to work hard to get funding from the government, Lee said.
“It’s not China that takes the academic leaders from us, but the companies,” Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired leading figures from universities to work on AI.
Lee said new immigration policies could also help the U.S. with AI innovation.
“I think green cards should be offered automatically to PhD students in AI,” he said.
The State Council of China issued its development plan for the next generation of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
In China, the National Natural Science Foundation provides grants to individuals at academic institutions like the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute money to researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center to bring together partners from industry and academia, and the White House announced the formation of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And earlier this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative they call AI Next.
NSF currently invests over $100 million a year in AI research.
U.S. legislation that would create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not made any progress in several months.
Macedonian referendum on renaming
Macedonia's people voted in a referendum on Sunday to change the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia", which would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece that has hampered the country's attempts to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a province called Macedonia, claiming that the name of its neighbor in the north is a requirement of its territory and has therefore prevented Macedonia from joining NATO and the EU.
The two governments concluded an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the name change would undermine Macedonia’s Slavic majority identity.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign has raised doubts about whether the minimum participation required for the referendum to be considered valid will be reached.
The question on the ballot in the referendum is the following: "Are you for NATO and EU membership with the approval of the agreement with Greece?"
But supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is worth changing its name if it allows Macedonia, one of the countries formed when Yugoslavia split, to join the EU and NATO.
"I am here to vote for the future of our country, for young people in Macedonia so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because that means safer lives for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
The referendum is not binding, but enough Members of Parliament have said they intend to follow the result in order for it to be considered decisive.
The change of name requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
According to the State Election Commission, no irregularities had been reported at 13.
But the turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters voted.
"I vote for my children, we belong in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, who voted in the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko are voting in the Macedonian referendum on the country’s name change, which would open the way for NATO and European Union membership, in Strumica, Macedonia 30 September 2018.
Outside the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, arranged a small stage and placed chairs in front of the tents set up by those boycotting the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads in the air, not sneak in through the back door," Kavardarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they do not welcome us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of a Euro-Asian integration."
According to Prime Minister Zaev, membership in NATO would lead to much-needed investment in Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of over 20 percent.
"I think the absolute majority will vote yes, because over 80 percent of our citizens are for the EU and NATO," Zaev said.
He said a "yes" result would be a "confirmation of our future."
According to a survey published on Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Policy Survey, between 30 and 43 percent of voters planned to vote in the referendum, which falls below the minimum required participation.
According to another survey conducted by Telma TV in Macedonia, 57 percent of participants planned to vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent of them said they would vote yes.
In order for the referendum to count, 50 percent of registered voters plus one vote must be counted.
If the referendum fails, it will be the first serious setback for the Western-oriented government's policy since it took over in May last year.
Manchester City's Sergio Aguero makes his way through Brighton's defense to score goals
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling beat Brighton's proposal in Manchester City's 2-0 win at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England on Saturday.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy when he scored in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker received a pass from the midfield at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran between Brighton's three defenders and set out on the open field.
Aguero was surrounded by four green jerseys.
He got around a defender and ran away from several others at the edge of Brighton's target area.
Then he pushed a pass to Sterling to the left.
The English forward used his first kick in the goal area to return the ball to Aguero, who used his right foot to beat Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot in the right side of the net.
"Aguero has problems with his feet," City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about him playing for 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored goals in that moment.”
But it was Sterling who gave Sky Blues the initial lead in the Premier League match.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball deep inside Brighton's area at that game.
He sent a nice kick along the left side to Leroy Sane.
Sane took a couple of kicks and led Sterling to the far pole.
Sky Blues forward kicked the ball into the net the moment before it got out of reach.
City meets Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany at 12:55 on Tuesday.
Scherzer wants to play against the Rockies
The Nationals have been eliminated from the playoffs, so there was no reason to force one to start again.
But competition-focused Scherzer wants to throw on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies, which are a match ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West, still have a chance at the final game.
The Rockies got a wild card slot with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but are still looking for their first division title.
“We’re playing about nothing, but we can get a chance to rub the rubber in the knowledge of the atmosphere here in Denver with the audience and that the second team would play at a higher level than any other team I would face this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to be there?”
The Nationals have not announced their starter for Sunday yet, but according to reports, they are inclined to let Scherzer throw under the circumstances.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th start, warmed up in the bullpen on Thursday and would throw on his normal rest day.
Washington's right-handed pitcher is 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 200 2/3 innings this season.
Trump Speaks in West Virginia
The president indirectly referred to the situation surrounding Brett Kavanaugh, who is nominated to the Supreme Court, when he talked about how important it is for Republicans to vote in the upcoming midterm elections.
"Everything we've done is at stake in November.
We are five weeks from one of the most important choices in our lives.
This is one of the big, big ... I’m not running, but I’m running. That’s why I’m going around fighting for sovereign candidates,” he said.
“You see a terrible, terrible group of radical democrats, you see it happening here and now.
They are determined to take back power whatever is needed, you see their wickedness, their awfulness.
They don't care who they have to hurt, who they have to drive over to take over power and control. That's what they want, power and control. We're not going to let them get it."
Democrats, he said, are fighting to “resist and prevent.”
"You've seen it in the last four days," he said, calling the Democrats "angry and evil and terrible and false."
He mentioned Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, who sits on the Senate Judiciary Committee, which was met by high-profile spectators.
"Do you remember what she said?
“Did you leak the document?”
"Hey, hey, hey?
No, no, no, I’m expecting a ...’ It was really bad body language, some of the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Labour is no longer a broad church.
They don’t tolerate people who say what they think.
When momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, I was hardly surprised.
After all, I am the latest in a series of Labour MPs to hear that we are not welcome, just because we say what we think.
My colleague, Joan Ryan, was treated in a similar way when she stood up against anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on the security of the nation, on Europe – ironically similar topics for which Jeremy criticized former leaders.
In the announcement of the meeting with Nottingham East Labour on Friday, it said that "we want the meetings to be welcoming and productive".
For most of my eight years as Labour’s local MP, the GC meetings on Fridays have been just that.
But unfortunately now many meetings are not, and the promise of "friendly, more cautious" politics has long been forgotten, if ever it even started.
It has become increasingly obvious that divergent views are not tolerated within the Labour Party, and every opinion is judged on the basis of whether the party’s leaders accept it.
This began shortly after Jeremy became the leader, when colleagues I previously thought had a similar political outlook that I expected I would make a complete reversal and take positions that I would otherwise never have agreed to – whether it was about national security or the EU’s internal market.
Every time I speak in public – and it doesn’t really matter what I say – there’s a tide of obsession on social media that demands that I be fired, criticises mid-politics and says I shouldn’t even be in Labour.
And this doesn't just affect me.
In fact, I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments directed at me are mostly political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of these colleagues when they face a stream of sexist and racist insults every day but never give up.
One of the biggest disappointments with this era’s policy is the level of insults now considered normal.
Jeremy Corbyn argued last week that Labour should promote a culture of tolerance.
But in reality we are no longer this broad church, and with every distrust and change in the rules of selection, the party becomes increasingly narrow.
I've been given a lot of advice over the past two years about flying under the radar and not being too straight forward, so "it's going to be okay".
But that’s not why I became a politician.
Ever since I joined Labour as a schoolboy 32 years ago, provoked by thatcher’s government’s negligence that literally collapsed my elementary school classroom, I’ve been trying to fight for better public services for those who need it most – both at the local level and as a government minister.
I have never hid my political views, and that includes the last election.
No one in Nottingham East can in any way have been confused by my views on policies and topics where I disagree with the current leadership.
To those who promoted the call on Friday, I just want to say that when the country goes towards a Brexit that will hurt households, businesses and public services, I don’t understand why anyone would want to waste time and energy on my loyalty to Labour’s leaders.
But my main message is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituency – both Labour members and others: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no amount of threats of dismissal or political convenience will prevent me from doing what I believe is best for all of you.

Ayr 38-17 Melrose: Oslagna Ayr at the top
Two last-minute attempts may have distorted the result a bit, but there’s no doubt that Ayr deserved to triumph in this wonderfully entertaining Tennent’s Premiership match.
They are now at the top, the only undefeated side of the ten.
Ultimately, it was their superior defense, as well as their ability to take chances, that gave the home team the win, and coach Peter Murchie has every right to be satisfied.
"We have been tested during our matches so far and are still unbeaten, so of course we are happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, "Ayr deserves it, they took better chances than us."
Grant Anderson's attempt in the 14th minute, which was converted by Frazier Climo, gave Ayr the lead but a yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, who was let in by the Warriors for the match, allowed Melrose to let the numbers speak and Jason Baggot made an unconverted attempt.
Climo extended Ayr's lead by a penalty, and at the end of the first half he scored and converted a solo attempt to give Ayr a lead of 17-5 in the break.
But Melrose got a good start in the second half and Patrick Anderson’s attempt, converted by Baggot, reduced the lead to five points.
It then became a long wait after a serious injury for Ruaridh Knott, who was carried by the plane, and after the restart, Ayr increased the lead again with an attempt by Stafford McDowall, who was converted by Climo.
Ayr's acting captain Blair MacPherson was then given a yellow card, and Melrose again forced the extra man to pay with an unconverted attempt by Bruce Colvine, at the end of a period of hefty pressure.
But the home team recovered and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card for tackling Climo without the ball, McPherson made a touch down from the penalty line-out behind Ayr's mouth.
Climo converted, which he did again almost immediately after the restart, after Kyle Rowe collected David Armstrong's box kick and sent out flanker Gregor Henry for the home team's fifth try.
Still Game star seems ready for new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game star Ford Kiernan seems ready to step into the restaurant industry after it was discovered that he has been nominated as CEO of a licensed restaurant business.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the BBC's popular series, which he writes and plays in along with his longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
Duon has announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the series' last, and Kiernan seems to be planning ahead of Craiglang's life.
According to official records, he is the CEO of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment, but a source on Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan wanted to get into Glasgow's "blooming restaurant industry."
"The sea belongs to us": Coastless Bolivia hopes the court opens the way to the Pacific again
Sailors patrol a rig-covered naval headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings have a sea blue flag.
The fleet's bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon bear the motto: "The sea belongs to us.
It is our duty to recover it.”
In coastless Bolivia, the memory of the coastline lost to Chile in a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century is still strong – and so is the longing to sail again on the Pacific Ocean.
This hope is higher than it has been for decades now as Bolivia awaits a ruling from the international court on October 1 after five years of deliberation.
"Bolivia has the drive, an atmosphere of unity and peace, and clearly awaits the result with a positive attitude," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the decisions of the international court on large screens across the country, hoping that the court in The Hague will judge in favor of Bolivia’s demand that Chile, after years of irregular discussions, have to negotiate with Bolivia to allow them a separate outlet to the sea.
Monday’s decision is also of great importance to Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic native president who faces a controversial fight for re-election next year.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe it is incredible that the court is judging in favor of Bolivia, and that not much would change even if it did.
The UN court, based in the Netherlands, does not have the right to allocate Chilean territory and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible discussions.
The fact that the decision is announced only six months after the final arguments suggests that the case "was not complicated," said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And the last four years may have hurt rather than promoted Bolivia’s chances.
"The issue of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
She argues that Morales’ aggressive rhetoric has tarnished Chile’s remaining benevolence.
Bolivia and Chile will eventually continue the discussion, but it will be extremely difficult to do so after that.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, did not consider that the Court's decision had been taken unusually quickly.
Monday will give Bolivia “a unique opportunity to start a new era for relations with Chile” and a chance to “stop 139 years of differences of mutual benefit,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents – used the issue of the sea as a political crutch.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific,” he said.
“The decision is a chance to realize that we have to move on from the past.”
North Korea Says Nuclear Disarmament Requires Trust in U.S.
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says the nation will not disarm its nuclear weapons until they can't trust Washington.
Ri spoke to the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to deliver on the promises made during a summit in Singapore between the two rival leaders.
His comments came as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be on the verge of solving the stalemate of nuclear diplomacy more than three months after the meeting in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it is a “dream of desire” to continue sanctions and U.S. protests against a statement ending the Korean War will ever tame North Korea.
Washington is hesitant to agree to the statement without Pyongyang first launching significant nuclear disarmament.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want another summit.
But there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang really intends to get rid of an arsenal of weapons that the country probably sees as its only chance to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion shows reveal latest line huge headscarves on the way to shops near you
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or completely block the sun, we have the right thing for you.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne have unveiled a range of crisp, oversized headwear for their SS19 collection on the catwalk, which dazzled the style icons of Paris Fashion Week.
Incredibly impractical hats have taken over Instagram this summer, and the designers have sent off their eye-catching creations on the catwalk.
Valentino’s main creation was an excessively beige hat with a feather-like wide hat board that completely took over the models’ heads.
Other oversized accessories included jewel-clad watermelon, a wizard’s hat, and even a pineapple – but they’re not meant to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of bizarre worms, in due time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful worms had sewn together lips and resembled Hannibal Lecter rather than haute couture.
One creation resembled a wetsuit with a snorkel and dive mask, and another looked like a molten glass skirt.
And if you continue that tremendous courage, you're lucky.
Fashion experts predict that the huge hats may be on their way to stores near you.
The oversized hats come shortly after La Bomba – the straw hat with a 60 cm braid that has been seen on everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The iconic brand behind the incredibly impractical hat that has taken over social media sent out another great creation on the catwalk – a straw beach bag that was almost as big as the model in the swimsuit that held it.
The terracotta raffia bag, with raffia fringes and a white leather handle, excelled in the Jacquemus La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect to see big hats and beach bags in stores next summer – the designer has had such an impact that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for oversized accessories.”
John Edward: Language Skills Crucial to Global Citizens
Scotland’s independent schools maintain outstanding academic achievements and this continued in 2018 with yet another set of outstanding test results, reinforced only by individual and collective progress in sports, arts, music and other community engagements.
With up to 30,000 students in Scotland, the schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best possible service to their students and their parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare their students for further education, their chosen careers and their role as global citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement customized curricula, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and in demand topics in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it goes to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, it goes to his heart.”
It’s a powerful reminder that we can’t just rely on English when we build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
This year’s test results show that language is at the top of the list, with the highest number of approved results in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages received A in the final exam Higher Grade.
Data, collected from SCIS 74 member schools, showed that 72 percent of students studying Mandarin received an A in Higher Grade, and 72 percent of those studying German, 69 percent of those studying French and 63 percent of those studying Spanish also received an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages that crucial skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages as subject choices are now considered as important as natural sciences, engineering, engineering and mathematics on curricula in independent schools and beyond.
A 2014 survey conducted by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills found that employers had difficulty filling their vacancies for various reasons, with 17 percent attributed to a lack of language skills.
That said, language skills are becoming increasingly necessary to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more and more future jobs requiring language skills, these skills become necessary in a globalized world.
Regardless of your career choice, they will have a real advantage in the future if they have adopted a second language.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically gives a multilingual person a competitive advantage.
According to a survey of more than 4,000 British adults published by YouGov in 2013, 75 percent answered that they could not speak a foreign language well enough to hold a conversation in it, and where French was the only language that totaled a two-digit percentage (15 percent).
That is why it is so important to invest in language education for our children.
Being able to speak multiple languages, especially those used in developing countries, gives your child a better chance of finding a meaningful job in the future.
In Scotland, each school will teach different combinations of languages.
A number of schools will focus on the more classical modern languages, while others will teach in languages considered most important for the UK by 2020, such as Chinese or Japanese.
Regardless of your child’s interest, there will always be a number of languages to choose from within independent schools, with teachers who are specialists in this field.
Scottish independent schools strive to provide a learning environment that will prepare children and give them the skills needed to succeed, no matter what the future holds.
In a global economic environment, it is undoubtedly languages that continue to be crucial for the future of the country, so it must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should really be considered as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to Scotland’s youth.
We have to do it.
John Edward is the head of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron makes Lakers debut in San Diego on Sunday
The wait is almost over for fans looking forward to seeing LeBron James make his debut for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in Sunday’s first game of the season against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But how many minutes he plays has not yet been determined.
"There will be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' pre-season schedule.
“I don’t need pre-season games at this stage of my career to get ready,” he said.
Trump's West Virginia campaign event, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is holding his first campaign event tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is Trump’s first out of five scheduled appearances next week, including events in places he has huge support, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
Pending a confirmation vote of his candidate for the vacancy of the Supreme Court, Trump aims to build support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans risk losing control of Congress ahead of the upcoming November election.
What time is Trump’s West Virginia rally tonight and how can you watch it online?
Trumps Wheeling, West Virginia promotional event is scheduled for 19:00, tonight Saturday, 29 September 2018.
You can watch Trump's West Virginia rally online below via live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to address this week’s hearing of Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who became tense after allegations of his sexual assault, with an expected delay of the Senate vote of up to a week while the FBI’s investigation into the case is ongoing.
But the primary purpose of these events is to help Republicans get some meat on their legs before the November election.
President Trump said that these five rallies next week aim to “engage volunteers and supporters as Republicans seek to protect and expand the majority in the Senate and House of Representatives.”
“Congressional control is so important to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we enter the hectic campaign period,” a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters.
The night's event, scheduled at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, can attract fans from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract the attention of Pittsburgh's media," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state where he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who has slipped behind in the opinion polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to get there to try to give him an increase in opinion polls,” said Simon Haeder, a state scientist at West Virginia University.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA fights to keep hopes alive for Sunday’s singles
After three one-sided sessions, the party competitions on Saturday afternoon could have been what was required for this Ryder Cup.
The swinging pendulum of the moment is a completely invented sports concept, but something that players really believe in, and more than ever before facing competitions like these.
So what momentum is it about now?
"They had a six-point lead and now it's four, so we're wearing it as a little momentum, I guess," Spieth said.
Europe has the advantage, of course, of a four-point lead with twelve more to win.
The Americans, as Spieth says, feel like they have a little wind in the sails, but they have a lot to encourage from, not least in the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and combed home three points out of four each.
Spieth has been sharp from tee to green and precedes with good example.
The win streak skyrocketed even higher as his round continued and he lowered a crucial putt to take the game four all-square when he and Thomas had lagged behind with two after two games.
His putt who won them the match at 15 met with a similar roar, with the conviction that the American team is not yet out of the game.
"You really have to dig deep and worry about your own match," Spieth said.
That’s all that these players have left.
18 holes to victory.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, Ryder Cup’s indisputable story.
Europe's strange but adorable couple is four out of four and now nothing can go wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't make a bogey on Saturday afternoon and they also avoided bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back nine on Friday morning.
These achievements and audience reactions state that they are the players to strike on Sunday and there is no more popular player who could comb home a potential European victory when the sun sets over Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both, at the same time in different holes.
However, it is too early to speak of a European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson briefed the process with Sergio Garcia, the morning fireball hero, along with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on front nine plunged the Spaniards and the Swede into a hole they never even came close to crawling out of.
On Sunday, however, there is no one to help you out of the hole.
Fireball and foursome are so fascinating to look at from close up because of the interaction between the couple, the advice they give, the advice they don’t give and how a strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team so far and taken a significant lead for the last day, but this foursome session also showed that Team USA has a fighting zeal that some, especially on the US side, had doubted.
Europe takes the lead with 10-6 in Ryder Cup last day
Europe will have a strong lead on the last day of the Ryder Cup after coming out of Saturday’s four-ball and foursomes matched with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
The inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led with two victories over a besieged Tiger Woods and combed home a total of four points at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn’s European team, who fought to keep the cup they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an American team that never really got started during this morning’s 3-1 fireball.
The United States offered more resistance in the foursome and won two games, but that was not enough for victory.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points from Sunday's 12 singles matches to keep the cup.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row while he and Molinari, dubbed "Molliwood", after a sensational weekend are just the second pair to win four points from their first four matches in Ryder Cup history.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in fireball, they beat an exhausted Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with an even more emphatic 5&4.
Woods, who beat himself through two games on Saturday, showed evidence of single moments of brilliance, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 games in four-ball and foursome, and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, rested during the morning fireball and returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes for a 2 & 1 win over Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - ranked 1st and 3rd in the world.
Europe didn’t have wind all the way, but it was a nice, windy day just southwest of Paris.
Three-time winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They combed home the win by 2 & 1 over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in four-ball and later returned to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4 & 3 in foursome after losing the two opening holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history has a team come back from a four-point downside in the singles, however, Furyk's side only needs a draw to keep the cup.
After being second best for two days, it seems like a counterattack on Sunday can be difficult to get through.
North Korea says it will "never" disarm unilaterally without confidence
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions deepened their mistrust of the United States and it was not possible for the country to unilaterally surrender its nuclear weapons in such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Organization’s Annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken “significant steps in the past year to show its benevolence,” such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling nuclear test facilities, and vowing not to proliferate nuclear weapons and nuclear weapons technology.
"However, we do not see any corresponding response from the United States," he said.
"Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances there is no chance that we will unilaterally disarm ourselves first."
While Ri repeated well-known North Korean complaints about Washington’s opposition to a nuclear-power approach divided into stages that would lead to North Korea being rewarded as it took gradual steps, his statement seemed significant, as it did not reject a previous unilateral nuclear weapons solution made entirely like Pyong.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, in which Kim vowed to work towards "denuclearization on the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea's security.
North Korea has sought a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the US has said Pyongyang must first denuclearize.
Washington has also declined negotiations to ease tough international sanctions against North Korea.
“The U.S. insists on ‘settlement first’ and increases pressure through sanctions to achieve its purpose through coercion and even opposes the ‘declaration of ending the war,’” Ri said.
“The notion that sanctions can get us on our knees is a dream come true for those people who lack knowledge of us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions deepen our mistrust.”
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump that U.S. leaders highlighted at the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the minister pointed to three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: “If the party on this nuclear disarmament issue were South Korea and not the United States, the Korean Peninsula’s nuclear disarmament would not have come to such a standstill.”
Yet the tone of Ri’s speech was dramatically different than last year when he told the UN General Assembly that North Korea’s future ability to reach the U.S. mainland by missiles was inevitable after “Mr. Evil President” Trump called Kim a “missile man” on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to “completely destroy” North Korea, praised Kim for his courage to take action for disarmament, but it said much work remains to be done and that sanctions must remain until North Korea is disarmed.
On Wednesday, Trump said he did not have a time frame for this, saying that “whether it takes two years, three years or five months,” does not matter.
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that "enforcement of the Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously and without fail until we realize a complete, definitive, verified disarmament."
The Security Council has unanimously strengthened sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to stifle funding for Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri in connection with the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying progress had been made, but North Korea accused him a few hours later of making "gangster-like demands".
North Korea promised a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle a missile facility and even a nuclear power plant if the U.S. took “equivalent action.”
He said Kim had told him that the "corresponding measures" he sought were security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and are moving toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard Students Take Courses to Get Enough Rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has prompted all PhD students to improve their sleep habits in an attempt to combat the growing macho culture of studying through caffeine-filled “dips.”
An academic study found that students at the world’s leading universities are often unaware of the very foundations of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, designed the course, which he considers to be the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after talking about the impact sleep deficiency had on learning.
“At the end of it, a girl came up to me and said, ‘Why can’t I know this until now, in my last year?’
She said no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep – which surprised me, he told The Telegraph.
The course, which was organized for the first time this year, explains to students the importance of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, as well as improve their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university’s health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students suffered from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The one-hour course includes a range of interactive tasks.
In part of the course there is an image of a student room, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, trainers and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, how athletic performance is affected by lack of sleep and the importance of good sleep habits.
In another part, participants will learn how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression and cancer.
A map of the campus, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that it will not change the behavior of students immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know — just as you have the right to know about the health effects of choosing to smoke cigarettes,” added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride in being “worthy” still exists, he says, adding that modern technology and ever-increasing pressure on students meant that sleep deprivation was a growing problem.
Ensuring that you have enough sleep, of good quality, should be the student’s “secret weapon” to combat stress, fatigue, and anxiety, he said – even to avoid weight gain because insomnia puts the brain in a state of hunger and makes them constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course and has read one of his courses last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course was an eye-opener and inspired him to campaign for a campus-wide course.
He hopes that the next step is to ask all doctoral students to complete a similar study program before they begin their studies at the high-performing institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students consider setting an alarm for when to go to bed and when to wake up and be aware of the damaging effects of “blue light” emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can cause you to turn the clock, leading to insomnia problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goals lower Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another loss today when Dolly Menga's strike sent Steven Gerrard's uneven side to a 1-0 defeat in Livingston.
The Ibrox side was looking to take home their first victory on the road since February's 4-1 triumph at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team delivered Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as manager to leave his team eight points behind Ladbrokes Premiership leader Harts.
Many beat to seven minutes before halftime and the Rangers never managed to level the score.
While the Rangers are now falling to sixth place, Livingston climbs to third and is just behind the Hibernian on goal difference.
And there may be more problems at stake for the Rangers after lineman Calum Spence had to be treated for a head injury after an object was thrown from the far end.
Gerrard made eight changes in the semifinals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, went with the same Livi 11 that took a point from Hearts last week and he would have been delighted with the way his well-murdered game outshined opponents each time.
The Rangers must have dominated, but Livingston did more with the ball control they had.
It should have become a goal as early as two minutes into the game when Menga’s first pass dropped through Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor’s goal, but the midfielder missed his big chance and shot outside.
A free kick in the depths from Keaghan Jacobs then reached team captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow only reached the back pole.
The Rangers took control of the match, but there seemed to be more hope than belief in their game during the last third of the match.
Alfredo Morelo certainly felt that he should have had punishment when he and Steven Lawless collided, but Judge Steven Thomson waved away the Colombian's call.
The Rangers managed to score only two goals in the first half but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly easily took Lassana Coulibaly's nickname and a tam kick from Ovie Ejaria.
Liv’s opening shot in the 34th minute may have gone against the spirit of the game, but no one can deny that their knockout deserved it.
Again, the Rangers failed to deal with Jacob's permanent situation.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher matched Scott Robinson, who remained calm and chose Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard acted at the break when he switched Coulibaly to Ryan Kent and the switch gave almost immediate effect when the outsider hit the ball to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly ran off his line to block the attempt.
But Livingston continued to get his opponents to play exactly the kind of game they like, with Lithgow and Halkett sweeping up long pass after long pass.
Holt's side could have strengthened his lead in the final stage, but McGregor managed to stop Jacobs before Lithgow nodded outside the corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton had another late penalty claim when he was beaten by Jacobs, but again Thomson looked away.
Almanac: The Inventor of Geiger Counter
And now a page from Sunday's almanach: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today ... the day when the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the manicure called Geiger Meters.
Geiger meters have since become a cornerstone of science and are also major figures in pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", starring the seemingly unlikely cowpoke scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
“What in the world is that?”
Rogers: "It's a Geiger meter, which is used to locate radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you put on these headphones, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms emitted by the radioactivity in the minerals.
Evans: "Yeah, it's popping now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" cancer cells
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" cancer cells and kill them
Vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize cancer cells as part of treatment
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient and modifying them in the laboratory
They can then “see” a protein common to many cancers and then be re-injected.
A trial vaccine shows promising results in patients with various cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize cancer, saw her ovarian cancer cells disappear for over 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient and modifying them in the laboratory so that they can “see” a protein common to many cancers called HER2, and then re-injecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “promotes the growth of several types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, lung and colon cancers,” explained Prof Berzofsky.
A similar method of taking immune cells from patients and “teaching” them how to target cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West supported Trump by wearing a MAGA cap, after his SNL appearance.
It didn't go so well
Kanye West was kicked out of the studio during Saturday Night Live after a flamboyant appearance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run for office in 2020.
After performing his third song for the evening, called Ghost Town where he wore a Make America Great cap, he rallyed against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
“So many times when I talk to a white person they say, ‘How can you like Trump, he’s racist?’
“Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago,” he said.
SNL began the show with a sketch by Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on the sexual assault charges made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not aired, the playback of West's social media post was uploaded by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock was trying to do West with the post.
West had also complained to the audience that he had been harassed backstage for his headscarf.
"They bullied me backstage.
They said, "Don't go out there with that cap on."
They bullied me!
And then they say I fell low,” he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to sink low too?" and said that he would "put on my supermancape, because that means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try it with love.”
His comments attracted more burop at least twice from the audience and employees from SNL seemed embarrassed, Variety reported. One person said, "It got dead quiet in the studio."
West had come in as a late replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller had died a few days ago.
West confused many with his appearance of the song I Love It, dressed in a Perrier Bottle.
West received support from the head of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest souls: THANK YOU FOR STANDING ON YOURSELF WITH THE MOBB."
But the host of the talk show, Karen Hunter, tweeted that West simply "was himself and that's absolutely wonderful."
“But I chose not to reward anyone (by buying his music or clothes or supporting his ‘art’) who I think embraces and spreads an ideology that is harmful to my society.
He's free.
We are there, she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and said he was now "the creature formerly known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows in Diddy's footsteps, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Snoop Dogg has called himself Snoop Lion and, of course, the late music legend Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist who was formerly known as Prince.
Convicted of attempted murder after being stabbed in a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defendant is expected to meet at the Belfast Magistrates Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the prosecutor.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington beats toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his sword-wringing role as Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the actor, 31, has spoken negatively about the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that such roles on the screen mean that young boys often feel that they have to be tough to be respected.
In a statement to the Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believes "something has gone wrong" and questioned how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity during the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his co-star in Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he feels "quite strongly" to address the problem.
"I personally feel pretty strong, right now - where have we gone wrong with masculinity?" he said.
"How have we raised men with regard to the problems we see now?"
Kit believes that TV may be partially responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to its highly masculine characters.
He continued, “What is innate and what is learned?
What is taught on TV and on the streets, which makes young boys feel that they have to be in a certain way to be a man?
I think that’s really one of the big questions of our time – how do we change that?
It is clear that something has gone wrong for young men.”
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not make any Game of Thrones sequels when the series comes to an end next summer, saying he is "ready with battlefields and horses".
From November, Kit will be playing in a re-recording of Sam Shepard’s True West, which is the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he thinks meeting his wife Rose was the best experience from Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife thanks to the series, so that’s how it gave me my future family and my future life,” he said.
Rose played Ygritte, in whom Kit's character Jon Snow falls in love, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie’s family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has reported an increase of 14% in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people have been affected in the country, health authorities say.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new cases were transmitted via sex and marked a change from previous years.
Traditionally, HIV spreads rapidly through certain parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people infected with HIV in this way had been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health authorities said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people from year to year.
HIV infection through intercourse is an urgent issue in China’s LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be widespread.
Because of the country’s conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will sooner or later marry women.
Many of the infections are due to insufficient protection during intercourse in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged universal access to HIV medicine as part of efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies staff leaked GOP senator's data, citing "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
U.S. Congresswoman Maxine Waters on Saturday condemned allegations that one of her employees posted personal data on three Republican U.S. senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that these claims were spread by right-wing extremist websites.
“Lies, lies and more reprehensible lies,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The released information reportedly contained home addresses and telephone numbers of Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online Thursday, posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate panel hearing on the allegations of sexual assault against the nominated Supreme Court candidate, Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came sometime after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites like Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was associated with Water’s office and released the information about a member of Water’s staff, Hill reported.
"This unfounded claim is completely false and an absolute lie," Waters continued.
“My staff – whose identity, personal data and security have been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations – were in no way responsible for the leak of this information.
This unfounded claim is utterly false and an absolute lie.”
Water’s statement quickly received criticism online, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is angry," Fleischer wrote.
“This suggests she doesn’t have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn’t do, they shouldn’t be angry.
They must not be defiant.
They are not allowed to question the motive of the contestant.
They have to be calm and alert.”
Fleischer seemed to try to compare Water's reaction to Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, whom critics accused of appearing angry during Thursday's interrogation.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who ran for Waters in the middle of his term, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"Great for true," he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said her office had warned "appropriate authorities and law enforcement entities of these fraudulent claims.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators will be exposed," she continued, "and that they will be held legally responsible for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to all of my employees."
Johnny English Strikes Again - powerless spy parody by Rowan Atkinson
It is now tradition to look for Brexit meanings in every new film with British tilt, and the same seems to be true for this re-recording of the latest Johnny English action comedy – a series of spy parodies that kicked off in 2003 with Johnny English and got new life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will sharp satire about how obviously bad we are become the nation’s new export commodity?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English with the rubber face has got his license to fuck to business renewed for the second time - his name signals more than anything that he is a wide comic creation intended for cinema audiences even in non-English speaking countries
Of course, he is the crazy secret agent, who despite his bizarre claims of smoothie glamour has gotten a little bit of Clouseau, a pinch of Mr Bean and a measure of the guy from the opening ceremony to the 2012 London Olympics.
He is also originally based on the traveler and international mystery man Atkinson once played in the now-forgotten Barclaycard TV ads that create chaos wherever he goes.
There are one or two great moments in the last JE movie
I loved it when Johnny English approached a helicopter dressed in a medieval armor and when the rotor blades briefly hit his helmet.
Atkinson’s talent for physical comedy appears, but the humor feels rather low-key and strangely superfluous, especially since the “serious” movie brands like 007 and Mission Impossible themselves now offer comedy as an ingredient.
The humor feels like it’s adapted for children instead of adults and for me, Johnny English’s weird behaviors aren’t as inventive and focused as Atkinson’s silent film bravado in the role of Bean.
The constant topic is now that the UK is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated Britain’s super-secret web network of spies, revealing the identities of all Britain’s agents out on the field, to the agent of service’s great discontent – an extremely small role for Kevin Eldon.
It will be the last straw for a prime minister who is a pompous and hard-working figure, already suffering from a complete collapse of her political popularity: Emma Thompson does her best with this quasi-Teresa-May character but the script doesn’t offer much to work with.
Her intelligence adviser informs her that when every single active spy is busy, she must employ someone who has retired.
And that means the native Johnny English in his own high person, now employed as a teacher in some wealthy institution, but offering unofficial lessons in the art of working undercover alongside.
English was sent back to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and reunited with his former longtime sidekick Bough, again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a submarine captain, a jolly-hockey sticks-roll where Vicki Pepperdine is close to being wasted.
So Batman and Robin are back after everything went so horribly wrong at Her Majesty's Secret Service and encounter Olga Kurylenko's beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister will fall hard for the charismatic tech billionaire, who claims he can solve Britain’s computer quarrel: the unfortunate Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of far-fetched performances: dressed as waiters, they set fire to a flashy French restaurant; they create chaos as they smuggle themselves aboard Volta’s luxury boat; and English unleashes pure anarchy as he tries to use a VR headset to get acquainted with the inside of the Volta’s house.
There is certainly a lot of work behind the latter sequence, but despite the fact that the film is both charming and fast-paced, it has an air of children's TV around it.
Quite moderately everything.
And as with the other Johnny English films, I can’t help but think: Can’t the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that matches his talent?
Labour denies drafting a plan to allow Britons to work a four-day week but get paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a radical plan that would require the British to work a four-day week - but get paid for five.
The party wants business leaders to hand over savings made through the Artificial Intelligence (AI) revolution to workers by giving them an extra day off.
It would see employees enjoy a three-day weekend – but retain the same salary.
According to sources, the idea would “fit” with the party’s economic agenda for the benefit of the workers.
Switching to a four-day week has been approved by trade union Congress as a way for workers to benefit from economic change.
A senior Labour official told The Sunday Times: A review of the policy is expected to be published before the end of the year.
“It will not happen in one day, but a four-day working week is an endeavor that fits the Party’s attitude to balancing the economy for the benefit of the worker as well as the Party’s overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, even the party The Greens, which promised a four-day working week during its 2017 election campaign.
However, this objective is not endorsed by Labour as a whole.
A Labour spokesman said: "A four-day working week is not the party's policy and it's not something the party agrees on."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week’s Labour Conference to communicate his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from “faceless leaders” and “sniffers” at state-owned companies.
The shadow chancellor’s plans also mean that the current shareholders in water companies cannot get back their full effort, because a Labour government can make “reductions” because of what they perceive have been wrongdoings.
He also confirmed plans to place employees on boards of directors and create so-called Inclusive Ownership Funds where 10% of the private company’s equity is transferred to its employees, who then receive annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy talk about whether the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh could change their views
The FBI’s investigation of charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least a week, raising the question of whether the agency’s investigations could cause some Republican senators to change their stance on the matter.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI would be able to reveal anything that would cause them to change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open than his South Carolina counterpart.
“Of course,” Kennedy said.
"I said when I entered the hearing, I have spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, that the claim came out, and I said, "Have you done it?"
He was determined, convincing, unambiguous.”
Graham's voice, however, seems unshakable.
"I've already decided on Brett Kavanaugh and that would take a dynamite charge," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And everyone she names couldn't verify it.
That was 36 years ago.
I don’t see anything new changing.”
What is Global Citizen Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that features an enormously impressive array of stars performing and an equally impressive mission; to combat world poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people march to Central Park’s Great Lawn, not only to enjoy artists like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the event’s real goal: to combat extreme poverty by 2030.
According to a 2012 statement, the Global Citizen Festival is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to fight poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the event (if you weren’t ready to pay for a VIP ticket), concert guests would perform a series of tasks, or “actions” such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, calling or otherwise meaningfully helping to raise awareness of the goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been with 12 years left to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a genuine way to convince people to act, or is it just about so-called “clictivism” – people who feel they are making a real difference by signing an online application or writing a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has recorded more than 19 million “documents” from its followers who fought for a variety of goals.
It states that these actions have contributed to spur world leaders to announce commitments and policies equal to more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements arising from its actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid out or funded.
The group estimates that the assets collected so far have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments are The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership between investors and actors committed to “helping children develop to their full potential,” promising to give Rwanda $35 million to help fight malnutrition in the area after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from global citizens.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens, just like you, we can make social injustice as malnutrition is a footnote in history,” Ullman told the crowd at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 measures were taken that require the UK to improve the diet for mothers and children, the government announced funding for the project, Power of Nutrition, which includes diet programs targeting 5 million women and children.
In response to one of the common questions on his website: "What makes you think we can fight extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen replied: "It will be a long and difficult road - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are some of the artists performing at this year’s events in New York, hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The US could use its fleet in a "blocked" to prevent Russian energy exports, says the interior minister
The government can “if necessary” resort to its fleet to prevent Russian energy operators from entering the markets, including in the Middle East, U.S. Home Secretary Ryan Zinke has revealed, cited by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia’s involvement in Syria – especially where it operates at the invitation of the legitimate government – is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
“I think they are in the Middle East because they want to sell energy, just like they are in Eastern Europe, in the southern parts of Europe,” he said.
And according to him, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"The United States has the ability, with our fleet, to ensure that the seaways are kept open and, if necessary, to apply blockades, to ensure that their energy does not reach the market," he said.
Zinke spoke to the participants of the event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group calling itself the “Energy Consumer Voice” in the United States.
He compared Washington’s approach to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they are really the same.
"The economic alternative to Iran and Russia is more or less to exploit and replace the fuels," he said, while referring to Russia as a "land of the day" with an economy that is dependent on fossil fuels.
The statement comes after the Trump administration has aimed to increase exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, to replace Russia, the far cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump said made Berlin a “prisoner” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
They argue that Washington’s opposition to the project is driven only by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position was backed up by Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industry organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has urged the United States to stay away from EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I strongly dislike that a third party is disrupting our energy supply," Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), said after a meeting between Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will take a "decent thinker" if she is to run in the 2020 presidential election, says Massachusetts Senator
Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would take a "decent thought" about her participation in the presidential election following the US midterm elections.
During a town hall meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider running as a candidate.
“It’s time for women to get to Washington and fix our broken government and that includes a woman on top,” she said.
"After November 6th, I will take a lot of thought into running for president."
Warren weighed in on President Donald Trump during the town hall meeting and said that he "took this country in the wrong direction.
“I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing for our democracy,” she said.
Warren has been free-thinking in his criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court candidate, Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, “Of course, we need an FBI investigation before we vote.”
However, a vote released on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren’s own supporters did not believe she would run for office in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of "probable" Massachusetts voters said the senator should not run, according to a survey conducted by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported the candidacy.
The survey showed more support for a candidacy by former governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent for a potential candidacy and 48 percent against.
Other high-profile Democratic names discussed regarding a potential 2020 candidacy include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision in January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin cites Track Palin’s PTSD at Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
“What my own son is going through, what he’s going through now when he’s back, I can relate to other families who have experience of PTSD and part of the trauma our soldiers are returning with,” she told the audience at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said of his son and other war veterans that "they come back like other people, they come back hardened, they come back and wonder if there is respect for what their colleagues, soldiers and airmen and all other members of the military have given to the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, attempts to prevent a report of domestic violence and drunken gun possession, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, as well as the District of Columbia, support questioning a new asylum policy
Arton states and the District of Columbia support a lawsuit aimed at a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gang-related violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and the district filed a friend-of-the-court application on Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker challenging the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions case filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against the policy has not been disclosed.
She said her partner "and his violent gang members sons" abused her, but U.S. officials refused her asylum application on July 20.
She was imprisoned in Texas.
The states’ lawyers supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, countries that produce a large number of asylum seekers, as nations facing major problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy amended a 2014 immigration decision that allowed illegal immigrants to seek asylum to flee domestic violence.
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal, and international law."
“Federal law requires that all applications for asylum be judged on the basis of specific facts and circumstances that apply to the claim, and such a provision is contrary to that principle,” the friend-of-the-court report said.
Lawyers further argued in the report that policies that deny immigrants entry harm the U.S. economy, arguing that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and “deliver the necessary workforce.”
In June, Justice Secretary Jeff Sessions ordered asylum judges to no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence.
"Asylum is available to those who leave their homeland because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political opinion," Sessions said when the policy was announced on June 11.
Asylum was never meant to alleviate all the problems – even all the serious problems – that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as death toll doubles in hunt for survivors
For the survivors, the situation seemed increasingly bleak.
"It feels very tense," said 35-year-old Risa Kusuma, who comforted her feverish boy in an evacuation center in the city of Palu.
"The ambulance picks up dead bodies all the time.
“Clean water is a scarce thing.”
The residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes, rooting through water-damaged possessions and trying to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, which were damaged in the 7.5 earthquake, were overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered from a broken back and shoulder, rested outside the Palu's Army Hospital, where the patients were treated outdoors due to continued strong aftershocks.
With tearful eyes, he said that the violent earthquake shook the room on the fifth floor of the hotel he shared with his wife and daughter.
“We couldn’t escape.
I was pushed into the ruins of the wall, I think," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife screaming for help, and then it got quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they are safe.”
U.S. ambassador accuses China of "bullying" with "propaganda ads"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in a U.S. newspaper about the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to China Daily paying a supplement to the Des Moines Register — the state’s best-selling newspaper — after accusing China of trying to participate in the U.S.’s 6th congressional election, something China denies.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in U.S. elections marked what U.S. officials told Reuters was a new phase in a escalating campaign from Washington aimed at putting pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to use advertising to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in an escalating trade war with increased tariffs on each other’s imports.
China’s retaliatory tariffs early in the trade war were designed to hit exporters in states like Iowa who support Trump’s Republican Party, according to Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and the former longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had harmed U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in a debate article in Sunday’s Des Moines Register, “is now doubling the bullying by posting propaganda ads in our own free press.”
“The Chinese government uses America’s beloved tradition of free speech and free press to spread propaganda by publishing paid advertisements in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“In contrast, in the newspaper kiosk on the street here in Beijing you will find a limited number of dissenting voices and will not see any true reflection of the different views that the Chinese people may have about China’s troubled economy, as the media is iron-handedly controlled by the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers nobbed the offer to publish" his article, although he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans scare off female voters ahead of midterm elections through Kavanaugh fiasco, warns analysts
With many top Republicans defending Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh facing multiple allegations of sexual assault, analysts have warned that there will be a setback, especially from women, during the upcoming election.
Feelings about this have been extremely high, and most Republicans have already shown where they stand in the election.
It can’t be turned back the clock,” Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University’s Maxwell School, told The Hill in an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts Senator Jeff Flakes (R-Arizona)'s final attempt at an FBI investigation will be enough to calm angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow and not in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn on Friday, according to the Washington, DC newspaper.
On Friday morning, the demonstrators chanted "November is Coming!" as they demonstrated in the hall of the Senate building when the Republicans controlling the court committee chose to go ahead with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will go to the ceiling," Stu Rothenberg, a neutral political analyst, told the news site.
"People say it's already been high, it's true.
But it could be higher, especially among still indefinite female voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18- to 29-year-olds, who, although they don’t like the president, often don’t vote.”
Even before Ford’s public testimony on sexual assault charges against the nominated Supreme Court candidate, analysts suggested a backlash could follow if the Republicans pushed through the confirmation.
“This has become a mess for the GOP,” Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said earlier last week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not just about the committee’s vote or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh gets through, it’s also about how Republicans have handled this and how they’ve treated her,” Guy Cecil, head of Priorities USA, a group helping democratic election campaigns, told the news channel.
But Americans in general seem to be divided over who they should believe in following the testimonies of Ford and Kavanaugh, and the latter seems to be the one they believe most in.
A new opinion poll from YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believed Ford’s testimony, while 35 percent said they definitely or probably believed Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh likely or definitely lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford, as well as those from at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reported to The Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh violently attacked her at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court exposed her genitals while attending a party during their time as students at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a startup that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The technology legend’s latest project, Inrupt, is a company based on Berners-Lee’s open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people access which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt is "world domination".
“We have to do it now,” he said of the startup company.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid’s technology to allow people to create their own “personal online data store” or a POD.
It can include contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It’s as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify are all available in one browser at a time.
What is unique about the personal online data storage is that it is entirely up to the user who can access what type of information.
The company calls it “personal empowerment through data.”
The idea with Inrupt, according to the company’s CEO John Bruce, is that the company should bring resources, processes and appropriate skills to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some software developers to work on the project, and a group of volunteer coders.
As of this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking to “Facebook and Google about whether to introduce a complete change where all business models are put on the top of the line overnight.
"We're not asking them for permission."
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt’s mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new web created by Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he established the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality in recent months.
During the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm very optimistic about this new era on the web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Priest rewarded with Victoria Cross during the First World War is celebrated
The only priest in the Church of England to be awarded a Victorian Cross during the First World War is now celebrated in his hometown 100 years later.
Lt. Col. Reverend Bernard Vann received the award for his actions during the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt on September 29, 1918.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and was never told that he had been awarded the most prestigious award of the British military.
A memorial was discovered by his two grandchildren during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "brilliantly symbolic" that the stone would be revealed exactly 100 years after his grandfather was awarded the prize.
According to the London Gazette, Lt. Col. Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin on 29 September 1918 "through a very thick fog and under heavy fire from field and machine guns."
He later rushed up to the line of fire and led the line forward with "great courage" before he alone decided the battle.
Lt. Col. Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 - just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "something I know I could never live up to, but something I'm very humble about."
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid a wreath after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he "felt very honored to play a role in the parade" and added that "the courage of a true hero is demonstrated by the support that will be given by many people".
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206 and got to see Greta Gris instead
Imagine this, you’ve stayed up all night to see Bellator 206 just to be denied to watch the main event.
The show from San Jose featured 13 matches, including six on the main card and was shown live at night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to meet each other, the British viewers were surprised when the show suddenly changed to Greta Gris.
Many were little impressed after they had stayed awake until the early hours of the morning to watch the game.
A fan on Twitter described the program change to a cartoon children’s program as “a sick joke.”
“It was the government’s decision that the content wasn’t appropriate so early in the morning, so they had to switch to children’s programs,” said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the broadcast.
"Great gray, yes"
Bellator CEO Scott Coker said they will work on their scheduling to better include UK viewers in the future.
"I think we will be able to find a solution in terms of the replay," Coker said.
“But it’s six in the morning on a Sunday there and we won’t be able to solve this until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Trust me, the change of program upset a lot of people.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical error.
In fact, it was a state issue.
I can promise you it won't happen next time.
We're going to show five matches instead of six - as we normally do. We took water over our heads in our quest to satisfy the fans.
It is an unfortunate situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley Feel ‘Underlying’ Due to Sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he felt inferior to his comrades during his upbringing because of his sexuality — but that also encouraged him to become successful.
The 24-year-old said he didn’t realize he wasn’t like everyone else until he went to high school.”
Speaking on the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about gay rights to give others "hope".
He also said he cared less about winning the Olympics after becoming a parent.
The show’s regular host, Kirsty Young, has taken a few months off due to illness.
During his one-time appearance on Laverne's first show, Daley tells how he felt "less host" than others during his growing up, because "it wasn't socially acceptable to like boys and girls."
He said, “This feeling of feeling less valued and feeling different has been a real source of the power and strength to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he was “someone,” he said, so he didn’t betray everyone when they eventually found out about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a high-profile advocate of LGBT rights and took advantage of his appearance at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to persuade more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he took the floor because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without restrictions and wanted to give others "hope".
The three-time world champion said his love for a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "came as a surprise."
Daley married the 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, but he said the age difference had never been a problem.
“When you go through so much at such a young age” – he attended his first Olympics at age 14 and his father died of cancer three years later – he said it was difficult to find someone of the same age with similar life experience.
The couple became parents in June to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said his "whole life perspective" had changed.
“If you had asked me last year, it was just about winning gold,” he said.
“But you know, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
My gold medal is Robbie.”
His son bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept that he was going to die and one of the last things he had asked was if they got their tickets to the 2012 London Olympics – where he wanted to sit on the front row.
"I couldn't tell him: you won't be able to sit on the front row dad," he said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing and it wasn’t until he had actually stopped breathing and he was dead that I finally admitted he wasn’t invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
“I just knew this was what I had dreamed of all my life – diving in front of a home audience at an Olympic arena, there was no better feeling,” he said.
It also inspired his first choice of song – Proud by Heather Small – a song that had followed him to the Olympics and that still gave him chills.

Mickelson out of shape on the bench during Saturday's Ryder Cup
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but then he must fix the form to avoid an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who played for the 12th time in a row, was benched by captain Jim Furyk for Saturday’s fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being at the center of events, as he has often been for the United States, the five-time winner spent his day between acting heylock and practicing on his game in the hopes of having a chance to show off his ability.
He has never been the sharpest of drivers, not even at the top of his career and the 48-year-old is not in shape in front of the tough course at Le Golf National, where the long ruffle often misses hard.
It is not only the track that deters, in the ninth match on Sunday Mickelson faces champion Francesco Molinari, who together with novice Tommy Fleetwood won all four matches this week.
If the Americans, who are 4 points below in front of the 12 singles matches have wind in the beginning, Mickelson's match could be absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in his player, not because he could say much else.
"He fully understood the role he had today, gave me a slap on the back and put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
“His self-confidence is not wrong.
He is a celebrity and he has contributed so much to these teams in previous seasons and over the past week.
I didn’t think he would be able to play two games.
I thought he could do more, but now it's the way it is, and we'll be content with it.
He wants to be out there, just like everyone else.”
On Sunday, Mickelson breaks Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup matches played.
It could mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that never quite lived up to the heights of his individual results.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, but Furyk said his presence brought other qualities to the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, quick, he likes to joke with people and he's a good guy to have on the team," he explained.
"I also think the younger players thought it was fun to play against him this week, which was fun to see.
He brings in so much more than just games.”
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the great leadership could soon be a mere memory
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a significant lead in last-day singles in the Ryder Cup can quickly turn into an unpleasant experience.
Dane made his debut in the 1997 game at Valderrama, where a team under Seve Ballesteros held a five-point lead over the Americans but ultimately won by the least possible margin with the score 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2- 131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"You'll be reminded that we led big at Valderrama, we led big at Brookline where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won with difficulty," said Bjorn (pictured) after seeing the 2018 class win 5-3 both Friday and yesterday and lead with 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So history will prove to me and everyone on the team that this is not over.
Tomorrow we will give everything.
Go out and do everything right.
This is not over until we see the point on the board.
Our goal is to try to win this trophy and that is where our focus lies.
I’ve been saying it all the time, I’m focusing on the 12 players that are on our side, but we’re well aware of what’s waiting on the other side – the best players in the world.”
Björn was pleased with his players' performance on a tough golf course and added: "I would never do this myself.
Tomorrow, new challenges await.
Tomorrow, it’s the individual achievements that apply and that’s a completely different thing.
It’s fun to be out with a partner when it’s going well, but when you’re out there on your own, your golfing abilities are fully tested.
That’s the message you need to convey to the players, to get the best out of themselves tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind you and he must also go and get the best out of himself.”
Unlike Björn, opponent Jim Furyk will want the players to perform better individually than they did as partners, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who combed home three points out of four.
Furyk himself has been on both sides of major reversals during the last days of a competition, both in the winning team in Brookline before he ended up as a loser when Europe drove "Miracle at Medinah".
"I remember every fucking word of it," he said in response to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 captain, had gathered his players for the last day.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but we would like to go out as fast as at Brookline, as at Medinah.
When the pace starts in one direction, there will be a lot of pressure on these intermediate matches.
We did our setup and placed the guys we wanted to, you know, create some magic tomorrow.”
Thomas was given the task of trying to lead the match and faces Rory McIlroy in the top match, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter face the other Europeans in the top half of the order.
"I joined this group of guys in this order because I think it's enough all the way," Bjorn said of his single choices.
Germany's new warship postponed again
The newest German fleet frigate would have been launched in 2014 to replace Cold War-era warships, but it will not be launched until at least next year due to faulty systems and high costs, local media reported.
The commissioning of the “Rheinland-Pfalz”, the escort ship for the brand new Baden-Wuerttemberg frigates, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the Die Zeit newspaper citing a military spokesman.
The ship should have joined the fleet already in 2014, but the problems that arose after the delivery were fatal to the ambitious project.
The four ships in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class commissioned by the fleet in 2007 will replace the aging Bremen frigates.
They will contain a powerful cannon, a range of air defense and sea target missiles, as well as some smuggling techniques, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signature.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to station the newest frigates for up to two years without contact with home ports.
But continued delays mean that the groundbreaking warships – which allow Germany to project power abroad – are already obsolete when put into operation, Die Zeit writes.
The fateful F125 frigate created headlines last year, when the German fleet officially refused to put the ship into service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the fleet returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but German media reported a number of important "software and hardware failures" that rendered the warship worthless if used on a combat mission.
Software deficiencies were particularly important as Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors - only half of the crew of older frigates in the Bremen-class.
It was also found that the ship has a significant excess weight, which leads to impaired performance and limits the Navy's ability to carry out future upgrades.
The 7,000-tonne Rhineland-Palatinate is believed to be twice as heavy as similar ships used by the Germans during World War II.
Apart from faulty hardware, the entire project price tag - including training of the crew - will also become a problem.
It is said to have amounted to a staggering <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion ($3.6 billion), compared to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion at the start.
Problems affecting the newest frigates are becoming particularly important in light of the recent warnings that Germany’s naval power is decreasing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliamentary defence committee, admitted that the fleet is actually "beginning to lack fully equipped vessels".
The official said that this was a growing problem, as old ships were dismantled but no replacement ships were provided.
He regretted that none of the frigates in the Baden-Württemberg class could join the navy.
The National Trust listens to the bat’s secret life
New research conducted on a property in the Scottish Highlands aims to reveal how bats use the landscape in their hunt for food.
We hope that the results will shed new light on the behaviour of unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study, conducted by researchers at the National Trust for Scotland, will follow southern and dwarf pipistrells as well as brown long-tailed and Daubenton bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key locations around the property to track bat activities throughout the season.
NHS personnel and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of bat sounds and which species do what.
A habitat map and report will then be produced to create a detailed area picture of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, Nature Conservation Advisor for NTS, hopes that the results will reveal which areas of habitat are most important to bats and how they are used by each of the species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work such as creating meadows and how best to maintain forest areas for bats and other related species.
Flea-mouse populations in Scotland and the United Kingdom have declined significantly over the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work affecting habitats and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, as can aircraft and certain chemical treatments of building materials as well as attacks from house cats.
Bats aren't actually blind.
But because of their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use sophisticated eco-localization technology to find insects and obstacles in their flight path.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 acres of land around the country, takes bats very seriously.
The organization has ten trained experts, who regularly conduct surveys, inspect livestock and sometimes carry out rescue operations.
The organization has also established Scotland’s first and only dedicated bat reserve on the Threave Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland’s ten bat species.
Property manager David Thompson says the property is the ideal area for them.
"Here at Threave we have a good area for bats," he said.
“We have the old buildings, lots of veteran trees and a variety of favorable habitats.
But there is a lot about bats that are still unknown, so the work we do here and on other properties helps us understand more about what they need to thrive.
He stresses the importance of looking for bats before performing maintenance in real estate, as it is possible that the accidental destruction of a single nest could kill up to 400 females and young, and possibly wipe out an entire population.
Bats are peaceful and it is illegal to kill, disturb or disturb them or destroy their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer of the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to help.
She said, “We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species we don’t know how their populations are feeling.”
Ronaldo rejects rape conviction while his lawyers threaten to sue German newspaper
Cristiano Ronaldo has called the rape allegations against him “fake news” and says people “will market themselves” using his name.
His lawyers will sue the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The Portuguese and Juventus forward have been accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, at a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
He allegedly paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
In a live Instagram video, Ronaldo turned the reports down as “fake news” when he spoke to his 142 million followers, just hours after the claims were reported.
"No no no no no.
What they said today was fake news," the five-time Ballon d'Or winner told the camera.
“They want to market themselves by using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be known by using my name, but that's part of the job.
I’m a happy man and all is well,” said the player, smiling.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over allegations, which they have called “an unauthorized reporting of suspicions of privacy,” according to Reuters.
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for “moral damage to an amount corresponding to the seriousness of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years.”
The alleged incident allegedly took place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga went back to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her anally, according to documents filed at the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and told her that he was "99 percent" a "good guy" betrayed by the "last percent".
According to the documents, Ronaldo had confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was with consent.
Mayorga also claims she went to the police and took photographs of her injuries at a hospital, but later agreed on a settlement because she felt "fear of retaliation" and was worried about "being humiliated in public".
The 34-year-old says she is now trying to cancel the settlement as she continues to be traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged assault, and this summer he moved to the Italian giant Juve in a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million deal.
Brexit: Britain 'will forever regret' losing car manufacturers
Britain “would regret it forever” if it lost its status as a world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, Business Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it was "worrisome" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, they would temporarily cease production at the factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need an agreement," Clark said.
The Japanese automaker announced that the effects of delays at the border in the event that no deal is concluded could result in job losses.
The Burnaston plant – which manufactures Toyota’s Auris and Avensis – produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the EU.
“My opinion is that if the UK leaves the EU by the end of March, we will see production stoppages at our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, CEO of Toyota at Burnaston.
Other UK automakers have communicated their concerns about leaving the EU without an agreement on how cross-border trade will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW says it will close its Mini plant in Oxford one month after Brexit.
The main problems with what automakers say are risks to the supply chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line is run on a “just-in-time” basis, with parts coming every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and EU for cars ordered.
If Britain leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, it could lead to border disruptions, which the industry says could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a day’s consumption in stock at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, and hence production would be forced to stop.
Clark said May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is "exactly calibrated to avoid border checks".
"We need a settlement. We want the best deal that allows, as I say, not only success at the moment to be appreciated now, but for us to seize this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's Today program.
“The statements from not only Toyota but other manufacturers are that we absolutely need to be able to continue what has been a very successful set of supply chains.”
Toyota could not say how long production would be stopped, but in the longer term warned that increased costs would reduce the plant’s competitiveness and eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is the leader of the Unite union at the factory, said his members are increasingly worried: "My experience is that these jobs will never come back.
A government official said: "We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, White House says
Donald Trump’s meeting with Assistant Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “delayed for another week” as the fight against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special adviser Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian interference in the election, relations between Trump and Russia, and the president’s potential obstruction of justice.
Whether Trump will fire the deputy justice minister, thereby jeopardizing Mueller’s independence, has been fueling Washington’s quarrels for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of wearing wiretapping equipment to record conversations with Trump as well as the possibility of ousting the president via the 25th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But on Monday he went to the White House, and reports of his resignation emerged.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the U.N. headquarters in New York, was announced, to be held on Thursday.
Trump said he would "prefer" not to fire Rosenstein but then the meeting was delayed to avoid a conflict with the Senate Legal Committee hearings where Kavanaugh and one of the women who have accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation of allegations against Kavanaugh, further delaying a full vote in the Senate.
Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, spoke to Fox News on Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "A date for it has not been set, it can happen this week, or a one-week postponement given all the other things happening at the Supreme Court.
But we’ll see, and I always like to keep the press updated.”
Some reporters would dispute that claim: Sanders has not had a press conference from the White House since September 10.
Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the lack of press conferences was not due to anything disliked by TV reporters who "play for the gallery", although she said, "I agree with the fact that they play for the gallery."
She then said that direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
"The president holds more questioning sessions than any president before him," she said, adding without citing evidence: "We have looked at these figures."
Conferences will still take place, Sanders said, but "if the press gets the chance to ask questions directly to the U.S. president, it's infinitely much better than talking to me.
We try to do this often and you have seen us do a lot in the last few weeks and it will replace press conferences, and you can then ask questions directly to the President of the United States.”
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Solo press conferences are rare.
In New York this week, the president may have shown why, with spontaneous statements and sometimes bizarre appearances in front of the gathered reporters.
Minister of Health writes to EU staff at NHS Scotland regarding concerns about Brexit
The Minister of Health has written to EU staff working in Scotland’s NHS to express the country’s gratitude and desire for them to remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, MSP, sent a letter less than six months before Britain withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already undertaken to cover the cost of dismissed status applications for EU citizens working in the country's decentralised public sector.
In the letter, Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on withdrawal have continued, ahead of decisions expected to come in the fall.
But the UK government has also stepped up its preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know that this must be a very worrying time for all of you.
Therefore, I would like to reiterate how much I value the efforts of each employee, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU, and the rest of the world, provide valuable experience and expertise that strengthens and improves healthcare work and benefits the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we really want you to stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie undergoes acute surgery after suffering a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christion Abercrombie underwent an emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in Saturday's 31-27 loss to Vanderbilt Commodores, Tennesseans' Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred just before halftime.
"He came to the sideline and just collapsed," Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sidelines before he was placed on a stretcher taken out for further evaluation.
A representative from Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was operated on at the Vanderbilt Medical Center hospital.
Harris added that "there is no data on the type/amplitude of the injury yet" and Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a redshirt second-year student, is in his first season with Tennessee State after a transfer from Illinois.
He had a total of five tackles on Saturday before leaving the match, giving him a seasonal total of 18 tackles.
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp duty when buying a property in the UK
Foreign buyers are allowed to pay higher stamp duty when buying property in the UK, and the extra money is used to help homeless people, according to the Tory party’s new plans
The measure will neutralize Corbyn’s success in attracting young voters
The increase in stamp duty will apply to those who do not pay tax in the UK
The British Treasury expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher stamp duty when buying property in the UK. The extra money will be used to help the homeless, which will be announced by Prime Minister Theresa May today.
The measure will be seen as an attempt to neutralise Jeremy Corbyn’s success in attracting young voters with promises of more affordable housing and targeting high-income beneficiaries.
The stamp tax increase will be levied on individuals and companies that do not pay taxes in the UK, and the extra money will give a boost to the government's effort to combat homelessness.
The additional tax is added in addition to the current stamp duty, including the higher levels introduced two years ago on holiday homes and homes purchased for rent. It can be up to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance believes that the measure will withdraw up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year.
An estimated 13 percent of newly built properties in London are bought by people living outside the UK, which drives up prices and makes it harder for first-time buyers to get a foot in the housing market.
Many wealthy areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become ghost towns due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new show comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a stamp tax cut to help more young people buy their first home.
He accused major construction companies of keeping prices up by buying up land without using it, and urged Theresa May to refrain from quotas on affordable housing to resolve Britain’s “sad housing situation.”
Jeremy Corbyn has launched a striking range of proposals for housing reforms, including rent ceilings and an end to evictions without the tenant’s guilt.
He also wants to give municipalities more opportunity to build new homes.
Theresa May said: “Last year I said that I would devote my time as prime minister to restoring the British dream that life will be better for each new generation.
This means solving the problems of the housing market.
The UK will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
But it can’t stand when it’s just as easy for people who don’t live in the UK, and even for companies based abroad, to buy homes that are too hard-working residents in our country.
Too many people’s dream of owning a home has become a distant dream, and homelessness is still an unworthy fact.”
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to train Scotland"
Sunderland leader Jack Ross says his “final goal” is to someday become Scotland’s coach.
The 42-year-old shooter looks forward to the challenge of bringing the club to life from northeast England, which is currently in third place in League One, three points from the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after leading St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I played a game in the B national team and that’s all,” Ross told BBC Scotland’s Sportssound.
“But when I grew up, I watched a lot of Scotland at Hampden with my dad, and it has always attracted me back.
But that chance can only come if I manage to run a club.”
Ross's coaches include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former leader of Alloa Athletic says he was not worried about succeeding such established names in such a large club. He has previously declined offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“Right now, I’m judging success by the answer to the question ‘can I get this club back to the Premier League?’
This club absolutely belongs in the Premier League, given its structure and talents," he said.
“It’s not easy to get there, but I would probably only see myself as successful here if I could get the club back there.”
Ross has only been a coach for three years, after a period as an assistant coach at Dumbarton and a 15-month stay as a member of the Hearts coaching team.
Then he helped Alloa get back from relegation to the third division, lifting St Mirren from being close to relegation to becoming the winner of the championship title the following season.
Ross says he is more satisfied now than ever during his playing career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably a roadblock," he recalls, referring to when he took command of Alloa.
“I really thought leadership was the right thing for me, in a completely different way than playing.
It sounds strange, because I had good results and could live nicely on it. In addition, I had some great successes.
But playing can be tough.
There is a lot to go through every week.
There is still stress and pressure at work for me, but to exercise feels absolutely right.
I’ve always wanted to exercise and now I’m doing it. I feel better than I’ve ever done in my whole adult life.”

A survey shows that the perfect time to take a beer is 17:30 on a Saturday
The summer heatwave has meant increased revenues for the country’s struggling pubs, but the restaurant chains have gained more pressure.
Figures showed that pub and bar groups increased sales by 2.7% in July, but restaurant revenues fell by 4.8%.
Peter Martin of CGA, who compiled the figures, said: "The continued beautiful weather and the fact that England remained in the World Cup longer than expected meant that we saw a similar pattern in July compared to June, when the pubs went up by 2.8%.
The decline in restaurant turnover by 1.8% in June only worsened in July.
Pubs and bars that mainly offer drinks showed the absolute best result with figures for the same period last year that had gone up more than the restaurants had gone down.
Pubs offering food also had a hard time in the beautiful weather, although it wasn't as dramatic as for restaurant owners.
People seem to just want to go out and have a drink.
The outbreak in managed pubs and bars increased beverage sales by 6.6% that month, and food sales decreased by 3%."
Paul Newman of RSM, a service and entertainment analyst, said: “These results are a continuation of the trend we’ve seen since the end of April.
The weather and major sporting events are still the most important factors when it comes to sales in the supermarket.
It is no surprise that restaurant groups still face difficulties, although a decrease of 4.8% per year in sales is particularly difficult to manage in addition to ongoing cost pressures.
The long hot summer could not have been more unpleasant for companies driven by food sales. Time will tell if the more moderate temperatures we have had in August give some much-needed respite."
The overall increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened establishments, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the fact that fewer new brands are now being launched.
Coffer Peach Tracker, an industry sales monitor for the UK pub bar and restaurant industry, collects and analyzes data on the progress of 47 active groups with a total turnover of over <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion, and is an established benchmark in the industry.
One in five children has secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents
One in five children, sometimes as young as 11 years old, have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers
A survey of 20,000 students in high school and high school shows an increase in the number of fake Instagram pages
The result has increased concern that it is sexual content that is posted there
20% of students said they had a “main account” that they showed to their parents
One in five children, some as young as 11 years old, create social media accounts that they keep secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 students in high school and high school showed a rapid increase in the number of "false Instaaccounts", a reference to the Instagram image sharing service.
The result has sparked concern that it is sexual content that is posted there.
20% of students said they have a clean “main account” that they can show their parents, and so they also have private accounts.
A mother who stumbled across her 13-year-old daughter’s secret side found a teenager who urged others to “violate me.”
According to the study, conducted by the organisations Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters and Headmasters Conference (HMC) of independent schools, 40% of children between the ages of 11 and 18 had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having private accounts.
HMC Chairman Mike Buchanan said: “It is worrying that so many teenagers are attracted to creating places on the Internet where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" on the board of the Scottish Athletics Association
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the Board of Scottish Athletics as an external board member at the Governing Body’s Annual General Meeting.
Doyle is Scotland’s most acclaimed athlete, and President Ian Beattie describes the election as an outstanding opportunity for those who lead the sport to benefit from her broad experience at the international level over the past decade.
“Eilidh has gained great respect throughout the Scottish, British and international sports world, and we are sure that athletes in Scotland would benefit greatly from her becoming a member of the board,” Beattie said.
Doyle says: “I would like to be a voice for the athletes and I hope I can contribute and help lead the sport in Scotland.”
The American, who won 200 metres and 400 metres at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, has a total of four Olympic gold medals and is now an expert commentator on the BBC. He lost the ability to go after a mini-stroke.
He tweeted: “Today, a month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that time would tell if I would recover, and to what extent.
It’s been hard work, but I’ve completely recovered, learned to walk again and now I’m doing mobility exercises!
Thank you for all the encouragement!”
Advertising for breast pumps comparing mothers with cows shares internet
A company that sells breast pumps has caused disagreements on the internet with an ad that compares breastfeeding mothers to cows being milked.
To highlight the launch of what is said to be the “world’s first silent portable breast pump,” consumer technology company Elvie has released a music-inspired commercial with humorous appeal to showcase the freedom the new pump gives mothers who pump breast milk.
Four real moms dance in a yard full of cows to a song with lyrics like, "Yes, I milk myself, but I don't have a tail" and "If you didn't know, this is not a yurt, but tits."
“Pump out, pump out, I’m feeding the babies, pump out, pump out, I’m milking the ladies.”
But the commercial, which has been published on the company’s Facebook page, has caused controversy on the Internet.
The film has received 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, and has met mixed reactions from viewers. Many say that it sheds light on the "phases" of the dairy industry.
"A very bad decision to use cows to promote this product.
Just like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to be able to produce milk, but their babies are taken away from them just a few days after birth.”

Another commented: “You understand that it’s traumatic for both mother and child.
But of course, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their children?”
Another one adds: "What a reality-turned-advertising film."
Others defend the film, and a woman admits that she thinks the song is "hysterically funny."
“I think this is genius.
I would have gotten one if I was still breastfeeding.
Pumping made me feel like a cow.
The commercial is a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
This is a brilliant product,” someone wrote.
Another commented: “This is a fun commercial that appeals to moms pumping (often at work or in the toilet) and feeling like ‘kissing’.”
This is not a film that praises or condemns the dairy industry.”
At the end of the film, the women reveal that they have all danced with the discreet pump stuffed in their bra.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the fact that many women who pump milk say they feel like cows.
But the Elvie pump is completely silent, has no cables or tubes and can be worn discreetly in a breastfeeding bra, giving women freedom to move, hold their babies and even go out while pumping.
Ana Balarin is a co-owner and ECD at Mother, and she says, “The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between women pumping breast milk and dairy cows, we wanted to shed light on breast pumping and the challenges with it, while showing in an entertaining and easily recognizable way what an incredible sense of freedom the new pump brings.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump has created headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the catwalk wearing clothes by designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a tent camp near the border in Texas
The number of detained migrant children has skyrocketed even though the number of people crossing the border each month is relatively unchanged. This is partly because the hateful rhetoric and harsh policies imposed by the Trump administration have made it harder to place the children among referees.
In the past, most reference persons themselves have been paperless immigrants, and fearful of putting their own opportunities to stay in the country at risk by declaring themselves willing to accept a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential reference persons and other adult members of the household would be required to provide fingerprints, and that the data would be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior immigration and customs official, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied to be referees for single minors.
The Authority later confirmed that 70% of those arrested were not previously known to law enforcement authorities.
“Almost 80% of those who are themselves reference persons or family members of reference persons are illegally in the country, and a large proportion of them are criminal aliens.
So we continue to persecute these individuals,” Albence said.
In order to deal with children’s cases more quickly, officials have introduced new rules that require some of them to appear in court within a month of their detention, rather than after 60 days, as was previously the practice, according to staff at the facilities.
Many of them are present on video link rather than in person to bring their claim for legal status before an immigration judge.
Those who are not considered entitled to protection are deported quickly.
The longer children are detained, the more likely they are to suffer from anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent outbreaks or escape attempts, according to staff at the facilities and reports that have come from the system in recent months.
Proponents say concern rises at larger facilities like Tornillo, where signs that a child is having it harder are more likely to be ignored, due to the size of the facility.
They add that if children are moved to the tent city without getting enough time to prepare emotionally and say goodbye to friends, the trauma many are already struggling with can worsen.
Syria demands immediate withdrawal of US, French and Turkish “occupation forces”
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also urged Syrian refugees to return home, despite the war in the country being in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also deputy prime minister, said the foreign forces are illegally on Syrian soil, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and "will be handled accordingly."
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he told the General Assembly.
Moualem stressed that "the war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, and millions have left their homes.
He said the government in Damascus would continue to "fight this sacred battle until we have liberated all Syrian territories" both from terrorist groups and "all illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, primarily training and advising both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the ground in the war-torn country.
Regarding the refugees, Moualem said the circumstances were good for them to return home, accusing "certain Western countries" of "spreading irrational fears" that enable refugees to stay away.
"We have urged the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate their return," he said.
“They’re politicizing something that should be a purely humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no help for reconstruction in Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say a fresh agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold of Idlib has created an opportunity to move forward with political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement halted a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian troops against the province, which has three million inhabitants.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement had “clear deadlines,” and expressed hope that a military intervention would target jihadists, including fighters from the Al Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, which “will be wiped out.”
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon convene the first meetings of a new committee consisting of government members and members of the opposition, in order to make a draft post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem laid down conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying that the group's work would be limited to "review of the articles of the current constitution", and warned of interference.
Why Donald Trump Will Win a Re-election
With that logic, Donald Trump would win the 2020 re-election unless his presidency ends prematurely through state law and scandal, which many liberal viewers probably hope.
In what would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic finale of a presidency ever!”
At the moment, there are no signs that the audience is tired.
Since 2014, viewership has more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN, and is almost three times higher, 1.6 million, on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at best broadcast time, an increase from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen. MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has topped the lists for cable channels with as many as 3.5 million viewers on major news nights.
“This is like a fire that people are drawn to, because it’s something we don’t understand,” said Neal Baer, who runs the show for ABC’s drama “Designated Survivor,” which is about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack has destroyed the Capitol.
Nell Scovell is a longtime comedian and has written "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club".
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver said he would vote for Donald Trump.
Why? she asked.
"He said, 'Because he makes me laugh,'" Nell Scovell told me.
In the chaos there is an entertainment value.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the Washington report can determine the future of the legal case on abortion, Roe vs. Wade, whether immigrant families can be reunited and the prosperity of the global economy.
Turning off is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Still, it goes beyond being an informed citizen when one suddenly sits and watches for six hours on an expert panel debating Bob Woodward’s use of “deep background sources” for his book Fear, Paul Manafort’s bomber jacket of ostrich leather for $15,000 (“a large garment filled with hybris,” Trump’s hybris inside the Washington Post).
I will never look at Super Mario the same way again.
“Part of what he does that makes it feel like a reality show is that he comes up with something every night,” said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of ‘Pawn Stars’, about the Trump campaign’s rotating cast and daily intrigue.
If you miss a single episode, you end up behind.
When I spoke to TV producer Mr. Fleiss this week, it was sun and 27 degrees outside his house in northern Kauai, Hawaii, but he was sitting and owling inside and watching MSNBC while recording a broadcast from CNN.
He could not resist, not when Brett Kavanaugh was to be brought before the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court lay in the balance.
“I remember when we did all those crazy programs in the past and people said, ‘This is the beginning to the end of Western civilization,’” Fleiss told me.
“I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turned out they were right.”

Money from outside flows into the smoothest race ever ahead of the midterm elections
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th congressional district is receiving a lot of money; it is thanks to a restructuring of a congressional district that two members have now competed for the same seat.
This recently-circuited suburban district of Pittsburg is represented by Democrat Conor Lamb, who took his place in another district at a special election last spring.
Lamb campaigns against another member, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th District of Pennsylvania, which largely overlaps the new 17th District.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January ruled that the old districts were unconstitutionally altered in favor of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district has caused a campaign funding dispute between the major party economic divisions, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a familiar name in Pennsylvania after a narrow win in a broadly guarded special election in March to Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
That seat had been held by a Republican for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts had given the Democrats a certain lead.
The United States considered punishing El Salvador for China support, but then backed
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with some resistance from Washington.
Donald Trump had a heated meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017, and had a hotel in Panama, until the partners dismissed the Trump organization’s leadership team.
U.S. State Department officials decided to call home the heads of the U.S. embassies in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of "newly made decisions not to recognize Taiwan anymore," U.S. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
However, only sanctions were planned against El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including drug control and development and financial support.
The proposed sanctions, including reduced financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have hit the Central American country hard with its high unemployment and murder statistics.
As the internal meetings progressed, U.S. and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focusing on security and economic prosperity to follow up on a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step in the right direction to prevent migrants from moving to the United States.
But in mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, effectively putting a stop to considerations of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence will now speak at the conference, which will now take place in mid-October. It is a sign of how important the presidential administration considers the meeting, the diplomats said.
And the three U.S. envoys returned in silence to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new harsh messages or punishments from Washington.
A White House spokesman for John Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate, which were described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal deliberations against the promise of anonymity.
Their statements were confirmed by an outside analyst close to the administration who also spoke anonymously.
Study the history
The next inevitable step could be Special Investigator Robert Mueller’s report on Donald Trump’s alleged abuse in court, which is now available in public records.
Mueller is also reported to be directing his investigation into whether Donald Trump’s campaign cooperated with Russia in its attacks on the U.S. election.
If Congress changes the majority, Trump will be held accountable to that assembly just as he prepares to run for office once again, and perhaps finally before a citizen jury.
There are many uncertain factors in this, and I do not want to say that Trump will inevitably fall, nor his colleagues in Europe.
We all have to make different choices, on both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect how long the fight can be.
In 1938, German officers were ready to stage a coup d'état against Hitler, if only the Western countries had resisted him and stood behind the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed, and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of bloodshed that followed.
History revolves around such decisive events, and the unrelenting progress of democracy is either accelerated or slowed down.
Americans are now facing several of these crucial events.
What will we do if Donald Trump fires Assistant Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls what will happen to Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been in trouble ever since this newspaper reported that last year he was supposed to have proposed to secretly record the president, and speculated that he would not be fit for office.
Rosenstein says the Times report is not true.
“How should we respond if the FBI investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete or unfair, or if he is allowed to appear in the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual abuse and false testimony?
And above all, will we in the midterm elections vote on a congress that holds Donald Trump accountable?
If we fail in these trials, democracy faces a dark period.
But I don’t think we will fail, because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew and was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassador’s residence.
She survived, immigrated to the United States, and 60 years later she sent me out to light the Sabbath candles on the table decorated with the chopsticks.
With that as a legacy, how could I be anything but optimistic about the future?”

Graham Dorrans in the Rangers is optimistic about the meeting with Rapid Wien
The Rangers welcome Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that winning against the Austrians after the impressive Spain match against Villarreal, which ended tied earlier this month, will put them in a strong position to qualify from Group G in the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance for the season, until the 2-2 match against Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use the result as a springboard against greater success.
"It was a good point for us, because Villarreal is a good team," says the 31-year-old.
"We went into the game in the belief that we could get something, and left with a point.
We could have gotten it in the end, but overall it was probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half. We came back in the second half and was the better team.
Thursday will be an important day in Europe.
Hopefully we can get three points, but it will be a tough match. They got a good result in their last match, but if we have the audience with us, we can certainly move forward and get a good result.
Last year was very tough, with everything that happened to my injuries and the changes in the club, but now we have a good feeling.
The team is good and the guys have fun, the training is good.
Hopefully we can move forward now, put last season behind us and do well.”
Women sleep poorly because of fear of retirement savings
Although the participants in the survey had a clear picture of how they want to be cared for, few spoke to their family members about it.
About half of the people who participated in the nationwide study said they had talked to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10% said they had talked to their children about it.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they don’t take the step and talk about it,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
Here's how you can start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family for care if you don’t talk about how you want it in time.
Work with your counselor and your family and discuss where and how you want care. Your choices can have a big impact on the costs.
Get help from your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you find a way to pay for the costs.
Your choices of long-term care funding may include a traditional long-term care insurance solution, a hybrid life insurance solution with cash value to cover costs, or self-insurance with your own funds, if you can afford it.
Establishing legal documents: Avoid legal disputes from the beginning.
Establish a health care authority, so that you can appoint a trusted person to oversee your medical care and ensure that the health care professional follows your wishes, if you become unable to communicate.
Consider also a power of attorney for your finances.
You then choose a trusted person who can make financial decisions for you and make sure that your bills are paid if you are unable to do so yourself.
Don’t forget the details: Imagine that you have an elderly parent who ends up in an emergency medical condition and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Write down such details so that you are ready.
“It’s not just the economy that’s at stake, but who are the doctors?” asked Martin.
“What medications are these?
Who takes care of the dog?
Make sure you have the plan ready.”
Air rifle fired several times in Ilfracombe

Police described the shooting, which took place around 02:30, as a "single incident".
The victim did not see his attacker.
The injuries are not life-threatening, and the police are urging witnesses to contact them.
Category: Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the city of Palu in Indonesia on Friday. Officials say the death toll is expected to rise.
Communications have been shut down, and rescue personnel have not yet been able to obtain any information from the Donggala management area, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu after the disaster.
Here are some facts about Palu and Donggala, located on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi province, and is located in a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi. The city's population was estimated at 379,800 people in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala is a management area stretching along more than 300 km of the northwestern coast of Sulawesi.
The administrative area, which is an administrative region under a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
The pillars of the economy of the province of Central Sulawesi are fisheries and agriculture, in particular the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but it is mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times over the past century, according to Indonesia’s disaster management authority.
In 1938, more than 200 people were killed by a tsunami that destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
Also in 1996, western Donggala was hit by a tsunami that killed nine people.
Indonesia is in the circum-Pacific seismic ageing, often affected by earthquakes.
Here are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake off the western coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra on December 26 triggered a tsunami affecting 14 countries. 226,000 people died along the coasts of the Indian Ocean. More than half of them were in Aceh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake on the Richter scale struck south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami that hit the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck near the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands outside Sumatra. A tsunami of up to ten meters was triggered. Dozens of villages were destroyed and around 300 people were killed.
2016: A ground earthquake struck the Pidie Jaya management area in Aceh and caused destruction and panic, as people were reminded of the devastation caused by the deadly earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
This time, no tsunami was triggered, but more than 100 people were killed by collapsed buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok. More than 500 people died, most on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings, and thousands of tourists were temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of abuse.
Palin, a 29-year-old from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, a domestic violence complaint, and opposing the arrest, according to a report released Saturday by Alaska State Police.
According to the police report, he took the phone from a female acquaintance who tried to call the police and report the alleged crimes.
Palin is detained in Mat-Su detention and is being held on bail of $500 to be paid if the suspect violates the bail conditions, according to the TV channel KTUU.
He appeared in court on Saturday and declared himself "guaranteed not guilty" when asked to disclose his stance, according to the TV channel.
Palin is suspected of three Class A minor offenses, meaning he can be jailed for up to a year and fined $250,000.
He has also been charged with a Class B case of minor offences, which is punishable by a day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time Palin has been charged with a crime.
In December 2017, he was charged with violence against his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged crime.
The case is now being dealt with by the Alaska Veteran Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, alleged domestic violence and alleged possession of weapons under influence in connection with that incident.
His girlfriend accuses him of hitting her in the face.
Sarah Palin received criticism from veteran groups in 2016 after she linked her son’s violent behavior to post-traumatic stress syndrome, which stemmed from his military service in Iraq.
Earthquake and Tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds of dead
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia on Friday.
The earthquake, which measured 7.5 on the Richter scale, triggered a tsunami and has destroyed hundreds of homes.
Electricity and communications are low, and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck just outside central Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
Movies that show when it hit are now circulating on social media.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal Prosecutors Claim Rare Death Penalty for New York Terrorist Suspect
Federal prosecutors in New York are demanding the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York terrorist attack that killed eight people. It is a rare punishment that has not been executed for a federal crime in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a rental truck from the construction and interior design chain Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bike path along the West Side Highway on lower Manhattan, beating down pedestrians and cyclists in his path at the attack, which took place in October.
In order to justify a death sentence, prosecutors must prove that Saipov “intentionally” killed the eight victims and “intentionally” caused serious bodily harm, according to the statement of intent on the death penalty filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both charges may result in a death sentence, according to the court document.
A few weeks after the attack, Saipov was indicted by a 22-point federal jury, including eight cases of murder in support of patronage, often used by federal prosecutors in cases of organized crime, as well as abuse and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required “extensive planning and intent,” prosecutors said, while describing the way Saipov conducted it as “disgusting, cruel and inhumane.”
Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused family and friends to Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco injury and loss.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The Southern District of New York has not filed a lawsuit demanding the death penalty for a decade.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers, but was finally sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York was in 1953. The married couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being convicted of spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The couple were both executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a Uzbek citizen, showed, according to court documents, a lack of repentance in the days and months following the attack.
According to police, he told investigators he was satisfied with what he had done.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities that he was inspired by the attack after watching IS movies on his phone.
He also asked to set up the IS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He has pleaded not guilty to the 22 charges in the indictment.
David Patton is one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov. He stated that they are "of course disappointed" with the prosecutor's decision.
“We believe that the decision to apply for the death penalty instead of agreeing to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole if the defendant pleads guilty only prolongs the trauma these events have caused for all involved,” Patton said.
Saipov's team of defenders had previously asked prosecutors not to demand the death penalty.
MEP from Tories says NIGEL FARAGE should be held accountable for Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the people's army" today during a protest at the Tories conference.
The former UKIP leader said politicians must "feel the heat" of EU skeptics when one of Theresa May's own MPs suggested he would lead the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MEP Peter Bone said at the Birmingham march that Britain would have already "goed out" if Nigel Farage had been Brexit minister.
But the challenge that Theresa May faces in getting the deeply divided supporters to reconcile has been exacerbated by EU-positive Tory members, who have joined a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is struggling to keep his compromise plan, the Chequers Agreement, alive under attacks from Brexit supporters, people who want to stay in the Union and the EU itself.
Her allies have insisted that she should push and try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the backlash, forcing EU skeptics and the Labour Party to choose between her package solution and "chaos".
Bone said at a mass meeting organized by the Leave Means Leave organization in Solihull that he wanted to "swallow the Chequers deal".
He suggested that Nigel Farage should have been made equal and given responsibilities in the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been at the helm, we would have been out at this time," he said.
Peter Bone, who represents the Wellingborough district in parliament, added: “I will stand up for Brexit, but we have to wash up the Chequers deal.”
He clarified his opposition to the EU and said: "We have not fought a world war to become subjects.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Bone dismissed claims that public opinion had changed since the 2016 referendum: "The idea that the British would have changed and now want to stay is completely untrue."
Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkyns from the Tory Party was also on the march and spoke to the journalists. "I just want to say, 'Prime Minister, listen to the people.'
The Chequers agreement is unpopular with the public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular with the party and with our electorate workers who are out on the streets and make sure that we are elected.
Leave the Chequers deal behind and start listening."
And she added a sharp message addressed to Theresa May: “Prime Ministers are allowed to keep their jobs when they keep their promises.”
Nigel Farage said at the meeting that politicians must "feel the heat" if they would fail the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
"Now it's about the trust between us, that is, the people, and the political class," he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit, and we’re here today to say to them, ‘We’re not going to let you get away with it.’”
Speaking to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make our political class, which is close to betraying Brexit, feel the heat.
We are mobilizing the people’s army in this country that gave us victory in Brexit, and we will not rest until we have become an independent, self-governing and proud Britain.”
At the same time, EU supporters marched through Birmingham and then held a two-hour mass meeting in the city centre.
A group of activists waved banners with the text "Tory members against Brexit" after the group launched this weekend.
Labour MP Lord Adonis of the House of Lords mocked the Conservatives for the security problems they encountered with a party app when the conference opened.
“It’s these people who say they can have IT systems in place and all the technology for Canada plus plus the plus deal, for frictionless borders and free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
"It's a clean dad.
There is no good Brexit,” he added.
Warren is planning a "decent thinker" about running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will take a "decent thinker about running for president" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that the Democrat from Massachusetts spoke about his future at a town hall meeting in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren has often criticized President Donald Trump, and is now running for re-election in November against Republican State Representative Geoff Diehl, who was deputy chairman of Donald Trump’s 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
She has been the subject of speculation that she might take on Donald Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th city council meeting with voters since Donald Trump took office.
One person asked her if she planned to run for president.
Warren replied that it was time "for women to go to Washington to repair our broken government. That means a woman on top."
One person arrested for the shooting of basketball player Sims from LSU
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, announced on Saturday that a suspect had been arrested for the killing of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
Police in Baton Rouge announced that Dyteon Simpson, 20, had been arrested at a press conference at 11:00 a.m. for ET.
They had released a film of the shooting on Friday to help identify a man seen in the pictures.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot dead near Southern University’s campus early Friday.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head and eventually died of this," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday via the news site 247 sports.
Wayde walked between them to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted that he had been at the scene and had a gun, and he admitted that he had shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken to police custody in East Baton Rouge.
The Sims were a junior player, 198 cm tall and grew up in Baton Rouge. He played in 32 games with 10 starts last season, and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 returns per game.
Grand Prix of Russia: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world championship title after team order gave him victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it was clear that Mercedes' team orders would play a major role in the race.
Bottas got a good start and nearly hung Hamilton on dry as he defended his position during the first two laps, inviting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went into the depot first and let Hamilton drive into the back of the clump, which should have been decisive.
The Mercedes went into the depot a lap later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton went ahead after some wheel-to-wheel-action where the Ferrari driver reluctantly left the inside free with the risk of bidding in place after a double stroke to defend himself in the third corner.
Max Verstappen started in the back row and was seventh at the end of the first lap on his 21st birthday.
He then led a large part of the race and held on to the tyres to reach a quick goal and drive over Kimi Raikkonen and become four.
In the end, he came in the depot on the 44th yard but failed to increase the pace during the remaining eight yards when Raikkonen went up in fourth place.
It’s a difficult day, because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and was a real gentleman who let me by.
The team has done an exceptional job and got a one and a two," Hamilton said.
Really bad body language
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a mass meeting on Saturday for insisting she has not leaked the letter from Christine Blasey Ford in which Brett Kavanaugh, nominated for Supreme Court judge, is charged with sexual assault.
The president, who spoke at a mass meeting in West Virginia, did not directly address Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee; instead, he commented that what was going on in the Senate showed that people were "evil, nasty and lying."
"The only thing that could happen and the nice thing that has happened in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry, mean, nasty and lying," he said.
“You see press releases and leaks and then they say, ‘No, I haven’t done it.
I haven't done it.'
Do you remember?
Did you leak, Dianne Feinstein?
Do you remember her answer? 'Have you leaked the document?' 'Oh, what?'
Oh, no.
I haven’t leaked it.”
Wait a minute.
"If we've leaked... no, we haven't leaked anything," he added, imitating the senator.
The letter detailing Ford's allegations against Kavanaugh was sent to Feinstein in July, and leaked in September, but Feinstein denied that the leak had come from her office.
"I have not obscured Ford's allegations, I have not leaked her story," Feinstein told the committee.
"She asked me to keep this confidential, and I kept it confidential, as she wished."
But her dementia doesn't seem to fit the president, who during Saturday night's meeting commented on it like this: "I'll tell you one thing. That was really bad body language.
She may not have done it, but that was the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
The president continues to support the Supreme Court candidate, who has been charged with sexual offences by three women, and he suggested that the Democrats used the charges for their own purposes.
“They are determined to take back power by all necessary means.
They don’t care who they hurt, who they have to drive over to get power and control,” the president said, according to the digital news site Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars-Belfast Giants 5-3
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Belfast Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars atoned for Friday's Elite League loss to the Belfast Giants by winning the return match 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Belfast Giants were given an early two-goal lead by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie signed for the home team before Dwyer re-established the leadership of the Belfast Giants.
Francois Bouchard signed for Dundee before two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory.
It was the third loss in the Elite League for the season for Adam Keefes team, who came from behind and beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth match of the season for the two teams, and the Belfast Giants had won the previous three games.
Dwyer's opening goal came in the fourth minute at 3:35 on assist from Kendall McFaull, and David Rutherford gave assist when Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In the intense first period, Sullivan brought the home team back into the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt delivered to Cownie who received at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Belfast Giants were in the lead at the first break when he scored his second goal for the evening at the end of the first period.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard once again received a power play goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran worked together to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time in the match at the end of the second period, and he secured the win with his team's fifth half through the final period.
The Belfast Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will play at home against Milton Keynes at their next game on Friday.
Air traffic controllers die because hundreds of people on one plane could escape from earthquake
A flight attendant in Indonesia is now being hailed as a hero after he died when he made sure that a plane with hundreds of people on board could lift safely.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a major earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday and triggered a tsunami.
Heavy aftershocks continue to plague the area and many are trapped in the hurricane in the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues fleeing for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the wildly swinging control tower at the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport in Palu.
He stayed to ensure that Batik Air’s flight 6321, which was then on the runway, could lift safely.
Then he jumped from the control tower when he thought it would collapse.
He later died in hospital.
The spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australian television channel ABC News.
“We arranged for a helicopter from Balikpapan on Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived at Palu.
We are delighted to hear this,” he added.
At the same time, authorities fear that the death toll could rise to more than a thousand people. The country's emergency relief authority says access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The death toll is expected to continue to rise as there are still many bodies left in the ruins, and many have not been reached," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
Up to six meters high waves have destroyed Palu, where a mass funeral will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are flown in with aid and supplies.
The 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, told Sky News: “Every minute an ambulance arrives with dead bodies.
There is scarcity of clean water.
Mini-markets are looted everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is struggling to help survivors, but we don’t know what they will face from there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could be much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask all of you to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to the evacuation.
“Are you ready?”, according to CNN.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok, killing more than 550 people.
Airplane crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says a man is missing after a plane crashed in a lagoon
The airline responsible for the plane that crashed into a lagoon in Micronesia in the Pacific now claims that one man is missing. Earlier it was said that all 47 passengers and crew had escaped from the sinking plane and were safe.
Air Niugini said in a press release that a male passenger was still missing on Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately answer questions about more details about the passenger, such as his age and nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water as it attempted to land at the airport on the Chuuk Islands.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday and that their condition was stable.
It is still unclear what caused the crash and what the course of events looked like.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon without reaching the runway.
Some witnesses believed the plane slipped past the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane flew in very low.
"It's extremely good," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and others managed to wade through waist-deep water to the emergency exits on the sinking plane.
He said the cabin crew panicked and screamed, and that he had a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said seafarers working nearby to develop a shipyard also helped in the rescue work by using an inflatable boat to drive people ashore before the plane sank in the 30-metre-deep water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network shows that 111 people have died in accidents with airlines registered in Papua New Guinea in the last two years, but Air Niugini has not been involved in any of them.
Analyst draws a timeline for the night when a woman was burned alive
The prosecution on Saturday concluded its pleadings in the second trial of a man accused of burning a woman in Mississippi alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett spoke for hours as an expert witness on intelligence analysis.
He explained to the jury how he had used cell phone lists to puzzle the 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers' movements the night she died.
Rowlett said he had received location information from several cell phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, contradicting his earlier claims, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the records showed that his cell phone was with Chambers’ cell phone during the time period he said he had been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford testified Saturday that he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "lies, because my truck was in Nashville."
Another contradiction was that Tellis stated that he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Cell phone records showed that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that some time after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' text messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"He wiped her out of his life," Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its final speech on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to be handed over to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip-hop?
A hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed of Bristol believes that hip hop has come far from its origins in political messages and to attack social issues.
They want to go back to the roots and make conscious hip hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently received a boost in the UK through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
A black man again?
A New York babysitter sues a couple for dismissal after a "racist" text message
A babysitter in New York is suing a couple for discriminatory termination after receiving an erroneous text message from her mother, who complained that she was "a black again".
The couple denies that they would be racist and compare the mood to "extortion".
Two-child mother Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman expressed horror when she realized that the new nanny Giselle Maurice was black when she arrived on her first working day in 2016.
“NEEEEEEEEEEE, NOT A BLACK AGAIN,” Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a text message to her husband.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Giselle Maurice, twice.
After realizing her mistake, Plasco-Flaxman was "bad at it" and fired Maurice, claiming that their former nanny, who was African-American, had done a bad job and that instead she expected a Filipino woman, according to the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for a day's work and sent home in a taxi.
Now she is suing the couple for compensation for the dismissal. She is asking for compensation on the order of $ 350 per day for the job she was initially hired to do, which would be for six months and where she would live with the couple. However, she had no contract.
"I want to show them that you don't do that," she told the New York Post on Friday, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple dismissed the accusations that they were racists and said the only direct thing was to terminate Giselle Maurice’s employment. They were worried that they would not be able to trust her when they had insulted her.
"My wife had sent her something she didn't mean.
She's not racist.
We are not racists,” Joel Plasco told the New York Post.
“But would you entrust your children to someone you would have been rude to, even if it was by mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Seriously speaking."
Plasco compared the mood to "extortion" and said his wife would give birth two months later and was in a "very difficult situation".
"Should you give in to such a person?
It’s not very nicely done,” added investment banker Plasco.
The trial is still ongoing, but public opinion has quickly condemned the couple on social media and criticized them for their behavior and reasoning.
Paddington Publishers Didn't Think Readers Could Relate to a Speaking Bear, Reveals New Letter
Paddington author Michael Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was adopted, commented on the letter: "It's hard to imagine what it was like for a person who first read it before it was published.
It’s very funny, given what we now know about Paddington’s great success.”
She told that her father, who had worked as a cameraman at the BBC before he was inspired by a little toy bear to write the children's book, had been optimistic when his work was rejected. She added that the 60th anniversary of the first edition was "bitterly sweet" after his death last year.
She describes Paddington as a "very important member of our family", adding that her father was proud in silence of his final success.
“He was pretty quiet of himself, and not a boastful person,” she said.
"But Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a child who succeeds at something. You become proud of the child even if it's not you who has achieved it yourself.
I think he saw Paddington's success a bit like that.
Even though it was his creation and his imagination, he always gave Paddington his own glory.
My daughter was going to die, and I had to say goodbye on the phone
When she landed, her daughter had been rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where the doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"Nad called regularly to say that it was really bad, and that you didn't expect her to get well," said Mrs Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then I got a call from Nad saying that she was going to die in two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "I love you so much, Tashi, my darling.
I'll be with you soon.
I'm coming to you.
The medicines that the doctors had given her to keep her heart alive slowly went out and left her body.
She had died shortly before and now everything was extinguished.
I just had to sit there and wait and know that all this happened.
I couldn’t bark or scream or cry, because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to get together.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now grieving the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, who were completely unaware of the difficult trial she was going through.
“Nobody knew about it,” she said.
"I bowed my head, and my tears ran all the time.
It’s hard to explain, but on the flight I felt an overwhelming compassion for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Lamenting women set up postcards to prevent suicide on bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones due to suicide work to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have set up cards on a bridge in Wales with inspiring messages and phone numbers that you can call for support.
Sharon Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he began suffering from depression, and took his life when he was 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel as bad as I do every day,” she says.
Sharon Davis is 45 years old and lives in Lydney. She tells that her son was a promising chef who had a contagious smile.
"Everyone knew who he was because of his smile.
They said his smile illuminated the room.”
But he stopped working before he died, because he was "in a very dark place."
Tyler’s brother, who was 11 at the time, was the one who found his brother when he killed himself in 2014.
Sharon Davis says, “I worry all the time about the consequences.”
Sharon Davis created the cards “to let people know that there are people you can go and talk to, even if it’s a friend.
Don't sit still, talk about it."
Kelly Humphreys, who has been friends with Sharon Davies for years, has lost her partner for 15 years, Mark, a time after his mother's death.
“He hadn’t said he felt depressed or depressed or anything,” she says.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed that he behaved differently.
On Christmas Day, he was at the bottom, and when the kids opened their Christmas presents, he had no eye contact with them or anything."
She says his death was a very hard blow to them, but they have to get through it. "It tears up a wound in the family.
It's breaking us.
But we must all continue to fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future is at stake when the FBI opens an investigation
"I thought if we could achieve something similar to what he asked for - an investigation that is limited in time and scope - maybe we could get some agreement," Flake said Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would be "divided" due to deeply rooted party differences.
Why did Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate the case?
Their reluctance depends entirely on the timing.
If the Republicans make a bad choice, as is expected, they will be greatly weakened in their attempts to get the man they want elected to the country's supreme court.
George W. Bush has picked up the phone and called senators to influence them to support Kavanaugh, who worked for Bush in the White House and through him met his wife Ashley, who was the personal secretary of George W. Bush.
What happens after the FBI presents its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are now 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear if Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break the deadlock and confirm his election to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean jumpers "declines" under Kim
The number of North Koreans leaving for South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from South Korea’s reunification ministry, says 1,127 people dropped out last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park says tougher border controls between North Korea and China as well as higher fees for human smugglers are important reasons.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
The vast majority of North Korean jumpers are finally offered South Korean citizenship.
According to Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee via China, which has the longest border with North Korea and whose border is easier to cross than the heavily guarded demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two states.
China sees the dropouts as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often sends them back by force.
The North-South relationship, which is technically still at war with each other, has improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks focusing on the ongoing negotiations on nuclear disarmament.
This happened after the historic June meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed in general terms to work for the Korean Peninsula to be nuclear-free.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed U.S. sanctions for the lack of success since then.
"Without confidence in the United States, there is no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances we can absolutely not disarm ourselves unilaterally first," Ri said in a speech at the U.N. General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he is unfit to serve in the Supreme Court
The minority leader in the House, Nancy Pelosi, called Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was temperamentally unfit to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi’s comments came in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help thinking that if a woman had behaved like this, she would be called 'hysterical'," Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh became emotional when he denied the allegations of sexually abusing Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotionally touched, and from time to time he almost screamed and his voice stalled as he talked about his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats on the committee, saying the accusations against him were a “grotesque and coordinated character murder” organized by liberals angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not serve in the Supreme Court because it showed he was biased against the Democrats.
"I think he disqualifies himself with his statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi hesitated when asked whether she would try to bring Kavanaugh to federal court if he were elected, and whether the Democrats would get a majority in the House of Representatives.
“I can say this – if he doesn’t tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he’s not only unfit to sit in the Supreme Court, but also to work in the court he’s on now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Washington D.C. Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that she, as a Democrat, was concerned about what decisions Kavanaugh might make against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe v. Wade abortion case, as he is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation queries, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would change certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
It is not the time for a hysterical and biased person to sit in court and expect us all to applaud," Pelosi said.
Women have to stand out.
It is a just criticism, months and years of anger boiling over, and she cannot get it out without crying.
“We cry when we get angry,” Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's unusual. Do you think?"
And she continued, "I got good help from a woman who was CEO somewhere. She said she also cried when she got angry, but had developed a technology that meant that when she got angry and started crying she said to the person she was talking to, 'You might think I'm sorry because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then she continued.
I thought it was brilliant.”
Tears are allowed to get the outlet of anger partly because they are often misunderstood fundamentally.
One of my clearest memories from one of my first jobs in a male-dominated office, where I once cried with indescribable anger, was that I was taken in the collar by an elderly woman. There was a cool boss that I had always been a little scared of, and she dragged me into a stairwell.
“Never let them see you cry,” she told me.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you’re sad and they’re happy that they managed to push you.”
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Hart was caught with an extramarital affair on a boat called Monkey Business and withdrew from the campaign, a very frustrated Schroeder felt that there was no reason not to investigate the idea of running for president himself.
“It wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” she said with a laugh to me 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates. The last thing they needed was one more.
Someone called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Since she was late, she lagged behind with the fundraiser, promising not to enter as a candidate unless she got $2 million.
It was a project doomed to fail.
She discovered that some of her supporters who gave $1000 to men only gave her $250.
“Do you think I’m getting a discount?” she asked.
When she announced in a speech that she would not launch a formal presidential campaign, she became so overwhelmed by emotions, gratitude to those who had supported her, frustration about the system that made it so difficult to raise money and target voters rather than delegates, and anger at sexism, that the voice stalled.
"You could have thought that I had had a nervous breakdown," Schröder recalls about the reactions of the press.
"You could have thought that Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, 'What are they going to write on my gravestone?'
'She's crying?'"
Why the U.S.-China Trade War May Be Good for Beijing
The opening streak of the US-China trade war was deafening. The war is far from over, but the rift between the countries could benefit the Chinese government in the long run, according to experts.
U.S. President Donald Trump fired the first warning shot earlier this year by coating key Chinese exports such as solar panels, steel and aluminum with tariffs.
The most significant escalation came this week, with new tariffs on goods worth $200 billion, meaning in practice half of all goods entering the United States from China are customs-coated.
Beijing has always responded with the same coin: recently, US goods were dumped at a rate of between five and ten per cent for $60 billion.
China has promised to match the actions of the United States. The world's second-largest economy is unlikely to step down in the foreseeable future.
To get Washington to back down is to bow to demands, but to crawl publicly for the United States would be far too embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts believe that if Beijing plays its cards right, the press from the US trade war can provide positive support to China in the long term, by reducing the mutual dependence of the two economies on each other.
“A swift political decision in either Washington or Beijing can create conditions for economic panic in either country, and it’s actually significantly more dangerous than viewers have previously wanted to admit,” said Abigail Grace, research assistant with a focus on Asia at the Center for New American Security.
Syria "ready" for returnees, according to the foreign minister
Syria says it is ready to accept voluntary returnees and calls for help to rebuild the country, which is in ruins after the more than seven-year war.
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country are now improving.
"The situation on the ground today is more stable and safe, thanks to our successes in combating terrorism," he said.
The government continues to build up the areas that have been destroyed by terrorists, in order to restore normality.
There are now all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they were forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
An additional six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian aid.
According to Al-Moualem, the Syrian regime would welcome help to rebuild the destroyed country.
But he stressed that it does not accept conditional support or assistance from countries that have supported the uprising.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europa has won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating Team USA with the finals 16.5 vs 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six times in a row on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won again when the Danish captain Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rns team achieved the 14.5 points required to defeat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who had to fight hard for most of the tournament, ended up in the water at the score of the 16th hole pair 3 lane, losing to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari shined in all rounds and became one of four players who have ever made 5-0-0 since the tournament's current format was introduced in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was knocked out 5 & 4 by the European team's lowest-ranked player, Thorbj<0xC3><0xB8>rn Olesen from Denmark.
The world's highest-ranked player, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 & 1 against Ian Poulter of England, who may have made his last Ryder Cup.
Spanish Sergio Garcia, a veteran with eight Ryder Cups behind him, became the tournament’s most successful European ever with 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a tough year.
I am so grateful that Thomas chose me and believed in me.
I am so happy, so happy to win back.
It's about the team, and I'm glad I could be of help," said one touched Garcia after the European team's victory.
He handed over the relay stick to his compatriot John Ram who defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in singles on Sunday.
"What an incredible pride, to be able to beat Tiger Woods. I was raised to look at him," said the 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all his four matches in France, and now has the score 13-21-3 for his career in the Ryder Cup.
A strange statistic for one of the world’s best players ever, who has won 14 major titles, which has only been surpassed by Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA struggled all weekend to find a fairway, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-class golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk said after the team’s disappointing performance: “I’m proud of these guys, they’ve fought.
It was time this morning when we raised the temperature in Europe.
We took the fight.
Hat off to Thomas.
He's an amazing captain.
All his 12 players played really well.
We're going to regroup, I'm going to work with the U.S. PGA Tour and our Ryder Cup committee and we're going to move on.
I love these 12 guys and am proud to be the captain.
You have to bow and bow.
They played better than us.”
Algae blossoming: holdings are declining in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report from the Florida Fisheries and Wildlife Commission shows a general decrease in algae bloom concentrations for parts of the area around Tampa Bay.
According to the Commission, uneven blooms are reported in the areas around the major municipalities of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier, which may indicate reduced levels.
The algae bloom extends along more than 20 miles of the coast, from northern Pinellas to southern Lee.
Spots can be seen about a mile and a half out into the sea outside the major municipality of Hillsborough, but in fewer places than last week.
Algae blooms have also been observed in the municipality of Pasco.
Mean concentrations in or off the coast of Pinellas have been reported in the past week. Off the coast of Hillsborough low to high concentrations, background concentrations to high concentrations in Manatee, background concentrations to high concentrations in or off the coast of Sarasota, background concentrations to medium or high concentrations in the mountains.
Reports of respiratory irritation continue to come from the major municipalities of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier.
There were no reports of respiratory irritation in northwest Florida last week.
