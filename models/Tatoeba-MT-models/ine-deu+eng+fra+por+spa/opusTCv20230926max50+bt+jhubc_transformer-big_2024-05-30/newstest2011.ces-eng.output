What does he do? <0xC4><0x8C>SSD in Prague does not know Voldemort or the confectionery
The new councillors of the capital from the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD will apparently have to overcome a certain language barrier in order to understand their old colleagues from the ODS in the Prague Council and in the representative office.
The newspaper Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz "tried" the members of the new council of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, as they know the notorious slang, which was created in the city hall during the last years, when Prague was ruled by the current coalition partners.
The coded dictionary, introduced by the Prague political creampie during the previous era of Mayor Pavel Bém, describes some of the most famous figures, situations and cases in the metropolis.
Surprisingly, the new councillors did not understand the familiar concepts very well.
At least that's what he says.
"Who is Voldemort?"
"I really don't know."
"I'm more of a novice in Prague politics," Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Kauck<0xC3><0xBD>, a cultural advisor, responded to the test of the "Kmotrov" dictionary.
Regardless of the political veteran, the councilman Karel B<0xC5><0x99>ezina reacted in the same way.
Like the term "golf pit."
"It's the only expression you present to me that I sometimes use."
"I generally don't recognize any other slang."
From the dictionary, the terms of which the newspaper Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz published this year in June before the ODS election congress, the editorial team selected six examples, mainly those that are notoriously associated with the Prague magistrate.
The Socialists were supposed to explain the terms "Voldemort", "the biggest golf hole in Prague", "go to the confectionery", "the bull neck", "the betrayal of the capital" and "float".
Three of the councillors agreed with the quiz, the fourth - Antonín Weinert, who is to head the Prague school in the future - first promised an interview, but later did not answer the phone.
Fifth Councillor Petr Dolínek immediately refused the test.
"I'm not dealing with these issues at all, and I'm not going to judge how civil democrats are entertaining."
"I am now dealing with how we will understand each other within our programs," he said.
As it has already been said, Councillor Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Kauck<0xC3><0xBD> would not have recognized in the title above that it is an influential entrepreneur and friend of the expressor Bém Roman Janou<0xC5><0xA1>kov.
"Voldemort" says nothing to Kaucky and the only term he correctly guessed in the test is "the largest golf hole in Prague".
"It's the Blanka Tunnel," Kauck<0xC3><0xBD> says, and immediately adds, "But I know it more from the newspapers."
"I'm going to have to pay for a language course," he jokes.
The golf pit as a tunnel Blanka is not only deciphered by matador Karel B<0xC5><0x99>ezina, but also by environmental councillor Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Plach<0xC3><0xBD>.
Both social democrats then know who Voldemort really is, and Luke the Poor is also familiar with where to find this character - guessing the meaning of the term "go to the confectionery store" .
"I think that means going to some Prague enterprise," is Shy near the revelation that it is the headquarters of Janou<0xC5><0xA1>k companies.
Similar to B<0xC5><0x99>ezina, he recalls that he drew knowledge from newspapers rather than using such a dictionary.
In social democracy, according to the test participants, there is no such run-of-the-mill glossary of slang terms.
"I've worked with colleagues, but it looks like we don't really have that."
"We call each other names, sometimes abbreviations and abbreviations of names are used," says Petr Hulínsk<0xC3><0xBD>, the president of the Prague <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, whose parties call him Hulda.
"In school I was called B<0xC5><0x99>íza, but I don't know if my colleagues call me that," admits Karel B<0xC5><0x99>ezina.
Diník Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz has tried the name and it works.
Council Weinert is for the parties Grandfather or less friendly Grandfather, representative Miroslav Poche, who warned himself of frauds in sponsoring the party before the elections, has the nickname "Igrá<0xC4><0x8D>ek" for some colleagues.
Nicknames are also the only thing that the Social Democrats admit in their internal speech.
Hulínsky said Hulda did not like to hear, but the newspaper Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz recorded another nickname for this Prague president.
The "Doctor of Penal Law" recalls that Petr Hulínsk<0xC3><0xBD> received his JUDr. degree at the Bratislava Police Academy.
The government wants to limit the torture of "witches", published a brochure
Women declared witches in Burkina Faso share several common traits.
They belong to the older generation, they are not able to engage in work for health reasons, they are free and have no children.
The one who becomes a witch is sent to isolation so as not to threaten the rest of the village.
"This fate is very seldom attained."
“Young healthy women don’t give up, either, because they help at work and give birth to children,” describes a nun who is taking care of more than a hundred women in a special house in the capital of the West African state of Burkina Faso, which their community has expelled from its ranks.
The local government has now decided to take action against the unusual "social measure".
She has published an information booklet to help limit witch hunts.
It has a hook.
"More than 70 percent of adults in Burkina Faso cannot read," Die Standard newspaper noted.
Accusations of witchcraft are common in other African countries.
In Ghana, which is neighbouring Burkina Faso, Amma Hemma, 72, died last week after three women and two men tortured her, poured petroleum and set her on fire.
The BBC reported on the case.
The perpetrators say it was an unfortunate coincidence.
According to their version, the woman was burned with oil, which is used for ritual anointing.
It was reported that he had been fired after the group wanted to “expel the evil spirit” from the woman.
The isolation of "witches" is supported by people regardless of the level of education achieved.
The newspaper Der Standard quoted a forty-two-year-old businessman from Burkina Faso: “Devouring human souls has always posed a danger,” he said.
While in Burkina Faso the government is trying to mitigate the witch hunt, in Gambia last year the president himself participated.
“After the death of his aunt, Gambian President Jammi launched a massive hunt for witches who were supposed to be involved in her death and try to use black magic to kill the president himself.”
“He called on shamans from nearby Guinea to help him, who, accompanied by police, soldiers and the president’s personal security, were forcibly taking randomly selected men and women from Gambian villages to the president’s farm in Kanilai,” Amnesty International said in a statement.
At the farm, prisoners had to drink herbal spirits with hallucinogenic effects, which in addition caused intestinal and kidney problems.
Two prisoners did not survive their stay on the farm.
After international pressure, nearly a thousand prisoners were released.
Bakal's tenant: Burning in fireplaces, higher rent signed
An elderly undercover man stepped out of the door of the RPG client center Byty "uhlobarona" Zden<0xC4><0x9B>k Bakala, the largest private owner of rental apartments in the Czech Republic.
Under his arm he carried a file and in it new lease contracts for three apartments: his own, his daughter and his son, who is in execution of punishment.
The deregulation has raised the rent for all three.
Instead of 3,500 per month, the son will pay 4100 crowns for a 2+1 second category apartment from next year.
"And there is no hot water there, and it must be melted by petrama," the man pointed at his son's new covenant, on whose signature he had full power.
"But I signed it," he explains half angry and half resigned.
The civil association BytyOKD.cz, which has labeled the new rental conditions as "incorrect and immoral," advises tenants not to sign new contracts and wait until December 7, when they will publish instructions on how to deal with them.
But the man just waves his hand over it.
"One says it, the other says it," he whispered.
Austria is becoming a major deregulation laboratory.
After the New Year, the vast majority of apartments that have not yet been rented in the Czech Republic are waiting.
Therefore, we decided to visit the “laboratory” in person.
The Haví<0xC5><0x99>ov waiting room RPG is one of four in Ostrava and on Tuesday at nine in the morning it is already full.
Right next to the door is a security guard from the security agency and a call-out device.
"Lease 2011", the special button on its touch screen is lit.
One tap, and he'll get a paper with a number out of the machine.
You can't even read "157" and your number is already beeps on a large display under the ceiling of the waiting room.
In half a second, you're in line.
After a while, an older couple comes to ask about the rental, but the influx in the waiting room obviously does not concern the new rentals at all.
Most people have come to solve common problems as before - requests for repairs, insurance events and the like.
In Ostrava, letters with new lease agreements are received in mailboxes by the tenants of most of the 44 thousand apartments of the RPG portfolio from about mid-November.
RPG Apartments in letters proposes to them an increase in rent by 15 to 38 percent.
A special bar for new rentals was opened at the customer center on November 18th.
"It's been running for over a week, so it's still running," the workers answer behind the counter after a moment of hesitation when the client introduces himself as a journalist.
Deregulation and Bakal's former mining apartments are a local hot topic.
Before the elections, the Deputy Speaker of the Parliament and the native of Ostrava Lubomír Zaorálek from the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD took him quite noisily, and even now the local newspapers are full of him.
"Twenty years after them, I want a new floor."
"They didn't even change the other board in the toilet," the man mentioned at the outset said.
Most so far, according to the workers, retirees come to see if they get a discount from the rental if they sign in time, as the RPG in the special offer promises them.
Half discount on February rent will also be given to other tenants who sign the new contract by December 15.
However, the "deregulation" gap is not overwhelming.
"Of yesterday's 360 clients, there were only about 40 to 50 people because of the 2011 rent," the employee estimates behind the counter.
The RPG proposes individual contract negotiation on the web and on its boards where necessary.
However, if both parties do not agree on the lease, it will have to be determined by an independent court.
"It's not about threatening, it's about information about the only possible and perfectly legitimate legal process," the RPG said in a statement.
"No one will be judged here," thinks one of the RPG Apartments workers, and the man on the street in front of the client center gives her part of the truth.
“I have 13,000 pensions and I have 5,000 left to eat, I don’t have to judge myself,” he says.
The workers, however, will soon be destroyed.
"We'll see."
"Mr. Zaorálek is telling them in the media not to sign, so people are probably waiting," he thinks.
The regulation of rents ends in most of the Czech Republic with the New Year 2011 and according to RPG Apartments, their increase is an economic necessity.
"The existing rent does not even reach the amount necessary for the simple maintenance of the housing stock," Pavel Klime<0xC5><0xA1>, director of the residential portfolio of RPG Byty, recalls that, according to the owners of the houses, the main reason for the negligence of the housing stock is due to the anger of the tenant.
While in five years between 2005 and 2010, RPG rentals could invest four billion in apartments, in four years from 2011 to 2014, it is expected to be 5.2 billion.
The large screen hanging at the ceiling opposite the padded seats of the animal waiting room so far repeats some red highlighted information.
"An increase in rent in 2011 of 15% and less affects 31,200 apartments, that's more than 90% of RPG apartments."
"And it will always be the most about 7.50 CZK per square meter and month," it will appear on the screen.
Only 400 apartments in the RPG portfolio will have a 38% increase in rent.
"In these cases, this is an increase from an extremely low amount of CZK 19.66 per square meter," RPG warns.
With 2,600 apartments, the rent will remain the same next year.
RPG Bytes promises that the deregulation will not throw out the lease jumps, but will be distributed within four to eight years.
In addition, it adds another commitment: all the money from the rental increase (see graph) the company will return to the apartments, mainly for thermal savings - new windows and insulation.
They should be given preference to people who sign a contract to increase rents.
The offices also include a kindergarten, the architects understood.
The Avriopoint administrative building in Brno is the new headquarters of Arch.Design.
No one would expect to also hide a mini-school with everything that belongs to it - with colorful walls, imaginative furniture, a pile of toys and even a miniature playground on the outdoor terrace.
Since October last year, children of Arch.Design employees can visit it.
The design and architecture company Arch.Design, from whose studios a number of important Brno buildings were built, has been counting on space for its corporate mini-school since the first drawings of the Avriopoint building.
It employs nearly 90 people, mostly of baby boom age, and it was important for women designers and architects to be able to return to work quickly.
Along with the possibility of short-term work, the kindergarten is a benefit that Arch.Design offers to its employees as part of the social program.
Builders and architects have the opportunity to combine demanding jobs with childcare.
The mini-school was invented by Arch.Design employees and, with the support of management, they managed to obtain a grant from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The company’s mini-school is financed from the European Social Fund through the Operational Programme Human Resources and Employment and the State Budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to the grant funding (subsidy of CZK 2, 8 million), they were able to purchase equipment and equipment and to provide qualified personnel and operations for two years.
After the financial grant (2 years) has been exhausted, Arch.Design is obliged to operate a mini-school at its own expense for 3 years.
The preparation of the project took one year and the request for a grant was greatly aided by the company Economy Rating.
Care is provided by qualified staff, the children are taken care of all day by a nurse and a teacher of the school, so children can go to kindergarten without age restriction, but most of them are older than 3 years.
Since it is a "mini-school", only 5 children can be present at the same time, but during the day there are even more.
The operation of the kindergarten is flexible according to the needs of the parents and the children of all employees have the same right to use the kindergarten regardless of the hierarchy of positions in the company.
Although it is an individual education and care, the program fill in the undergraduate school is comparable to the framework program of pre-school education.
Not only do children play here, but they are also provided with quality instruction - from basic knowledge to preparation for school benches, English is also taught.
The class is equipped not only with toys, stimulating games, but also a computer that children can use.
The presence of young children directly in the company creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can check their child at any time and eliminate stressful situations with delayed picking up children from kindergartens away from their parents’ workplace.
Parents can make more productive use of their working hours.
It is not surprising that an employee-employer relationship is naturally formed here.
Arch.Design has thus become one of the Czech companies that offer a significant benefit in recruiting new employees, are family-friendly and through this program has strengthened personal marketing.
The house of bones fascinates even after 100 years. Look into Gaudí’s interiors
The roof looks like the back of an ancient lizard, the staircase resembles the back of a dinosaur, and the balconies are open fish mouths.
Such is the house Casa Batlló in Barcelona by the Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí.
Due to its organic shapes, the house earned the nickname House of Bones from the locals.
Organic shapes, wild colors, unusual use of stone, fragments of tiles and mosaics, a facade reminiscent of scales and ubiquitous soft curves, all typical of the Art Nouveau of Antoni Gaudí.
The front of the house plays with dream lines, delicate colors and textures reminiscent of nature and animals.
With detailed observation, geometry, rhythm and precisely thought-out order can be seen.
At night, the entire facade of the houses sounds even more dramatic, it is illuminated so that the impression of the glow of colors is further enhanced.
Winding and twisting of shapes to the same extent appears in interiors.
Wood in the waves copies window frames, railings, decorative elements of the door, cuckoo and railings.
The Batlló House, located in the Eixample district on the busy shopping street Passeig de Gràcia 43, was built in 1877 by the architect Emilio Sala Cortese.
The reconstruction took two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, the wealthy industrialist Josep Batlló, originally insisted on demolishing the old building and building an entirely new one, but soon accepted Gaudí’s idea of an unusual and cheaper reconstruction.
Casa Batlló, however, was not designed by Antoni Gaudí himself.
The architect Josep Maria Jujol collaborated with him.
It was on his design board that decorations for the representative apartment of the property owner and the use of mosaics on the facade were created.
A number of other artists and artists have also worked on the facade.
The joint work on the Casa Batlló project started with the successful collaboration between Jujol and Gaudí.
Jujol participated in the construction of Gaudí's Casa Milá and Güell Park, which contains other Gaudí's works.
From the locals, the house immediately after completion earned the nickname "House of Bones" thanks to its organic shapes.
Others, due to the specific mechanism of opening the windows, began to call it the "home of the living room".
It is also said that on the top of the building is depicted the sword of St. George, patron saint of Catalonia.
Hidden religious motifs also contain other sculptural elements of the building.
Gaudí in the house designed for his time a unique central heating system with ventilation vents and typical fireplaces.
Bizarre may seem their forty-five-degree slope.
In his work, Gaudí absolutely did not respect the building regulations of the time and did not allow himself to be bound by them.
At the beginning of the construction, he received a building permit from the city, but the data on the planned reconstruction were so vague that two years later, when the city council was completed, it was confounded and asked for repairs.
For example, councillors were troubled by the fact that the building interfered with the pillars and the public pavement.
There has never been a remedy, on the contrary: just fifteen days after the call of the city district, Josep Batlló applied for (and successfully obtained) permission to rent the two highest floors of the building.
The owner himself moved to the lower floors.
In the gallery on the second floor there was a communal lounge and on the third floor there was a bedroom and a private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented jewelry store.
The entire six-storey house crosses the stairs, which can be climbed up to the roof terrace itself.
The fundamental elements of the reconstruction were the abolition of all right angles and straight lines and their replacement by curved walls.
Gaudí also worked with the modern concept of connecting spaces.
The social part can be fully connected by opening the living room doors and a larger company can communicate comfortably without maintaining the privacy needed for more intimate conversations.
In addition to the new facade, the house with Gaudí’s reconstruction also acquired unconventional roofing and two additional floors.
Gaudí’s play with light, blue and white glazed tiles, with which the inner courtyard is lined, and lanterns, is also impressive.
The game of two colors provides maximum light in all floors of the house.
It was enough to simply bet on the principle that white reflects light more than dark, which on the contrary absorbs the sun's rays.
The Casa Batlló, which was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2005, can be visited by anyone.
On the first floor of the house is the most spacious and the most profitable apartment made available to the public.
The owners decided to take this step only in 2002, on the occasion of the celebration of the one hundred and fiftyth anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
The tours continued as they found it to be a very advantageous undertaking and in addition they extended the tours to common areas and lofts, including a roof terrace.
Admission to the monument is certainly not negligible, it is 16.50 euros and students, pensioners, groups and holders of tourist cards have a 20% discount.
The sum significantly exceeds the price of admission to other Gaudí buildings in the city.
If you want to taste the real atmosphere of a house with dragon towers, you need to quickly scramble with one of the inhabitants of the zinják and visit him directly at home.
How to choose a mattress and a grid: women have different requirements than men
Not the glorious frame of the bed, but the quality of the laying area, that is, the mattress and the grid, give the foundation of a really good bed.
However, they must be harmoniously complemented to suit a specific user.
When choosing, it decides a lot of things, from weight, height, age, health condition and sex of the owner.
The type of interior in which the mattress and grid are made is also important.
A typical example?
For example, for weekend cottages, where they do not sink regularly, latex mattresses are not suitable, because they "heat" more slowly.
In addition, they have a significantly higher weight than standard polyurethane mattresses.
In this case, it is necessary to rotate them regularly.
Because if they do not have a lot of air ducts in the core, and they are still lying on a hard plate, they retain moisture: mold could also appear under them.
The choice also depends on the habit.
Those who have spent a long time abroad, where very high mattresses with a softening layer are often used, will hardly feel good on a low and hard surface.
"Maybe all the hockey players who came back from the NHL were complaining about not sleeping here."
"On their bent shoulders, heels and hips they needed mattresses with a softening layer of lazy foam."
"These are also recommended for people with diabetes who have a disorder of the nervous system, so they do not absorb "information" from the joints and skin," explains Sylva Hadamcziková, who specializes in upholstered furniture.
For many hockey players, but also for other customers, she was looking for a mattress with linen foam years ago.
"Today it's okay, suitable mattresses have Tempur, Italian Magniflex, but also Czech Tropico."
You don't have to be an NHL fighter to appreciate lazy foam.
This "miracle" works simply.
It optimizes its stiffness and shape according to the absorbed heat or adapts to your warm body.
Nothing pushes you, you will not turn around at night like after a hard fight.
You'll just get a better night's sleep.
Lazy foam also serves as a protection against diarrhea.
When choosing the size of the mattress to your height, add the length of the foot, which is about 21 to 34 cm.
A man and a woman with a height of about 180 cm need a bed of 210 to 220 cm.
The minimum width for one should be 90 cm for double beds, thus a total of 180 cm.
For single beds, for example, singles, at least 120 to 140 cm is recommended.
For convenience and a possible visit.
"Otherwise, the rule for the width of the bed is simple: when lying on your back, you should have your hands comfortably slightly folded in the elbow," advises Ing. Helena Prokopová, technician of the Department of Pads and Decorators, who is already working on the issue of healthy sleep and ergonomics of the wreath.
For a double bed, everyone needs their own grid and mattress, but here, be careful when buying to adjust the height of the mattress.
Otherwise, there will be nothing but to mount the grids to different heights, but you may not be able to do this at every frame of the bed.
Foam mattresses should be at least 14 cm high, types with a spring skeleton at least 15, of which at least three centimeters count on the forming and crucible layer.
"When you touch your hands or get stuck on a mattress, you definitely can't feel the springs," Helena Prokopová warns.
Each mattress requires a certain type of grid.
The upholstered beds, where the mattress and mattress are like siamese twins, have nothing to do in the bedrooms.
The mattresses are poorly ventilated, it is not possible to wash their cover, which is already common today.
And since we usually sweat out 0.2 to 0.75 liters of sweat per night, it is clear that after five to seven years the mattress will start to resemble one large (and clogged) mesh.
That is why experts reject advertising slogans about the lifespan of mattresses up to 25 years, or even lifetime guarantees.
But everything has its buts.
And so the advice from the dealers: for mattresses with a width of 120 or 140 cm of hygiene and work, do not give up the removable coating, but rather add a mattress protector, which you can easily remove and wash.
Although mattress coatings are commonly produced throughout the circuit, so after unlocking we get two parts (for washing and the size of the washing machine very important!), nevertheless, handling in larger types (and in one person) when shooting could resemble a lightweight wrestling in the ring.
Do you have a hardboard in your bed?
Never! Never!
Maximum for a bed intended for one night visits.
However, if you don’t already have any air holes on the board, use a mattress with a spring skeleton and a height of at least 15 cm with springs in bags (including Taschenfederkern) and a chip layer.
Polyurethane mattress does not belong to such a substrate.
Latex or sandwich mattresses (e.g., a combination of latex and coconut) will be suitable for non-layering lamella grilles with 14 to 18 lamellae, but you will always pay for grilles with more lamellae, 28 or more, where the lamellae in the hips are doubled and their stiffness can be adjusted.
The positioning lamella gratings do not include mattresses with a spring skeleton, because they do not react to positioning.
In addition to adjusting the rigidity of the slats, the so-called shoulder cradle can also be used.
It is a special slat fitting that allows you to push, or even tilt the slat so that the sleeping arm is nicely "punched".
For men who have "shoulders over the whole back", definitely an important thing.
Even the manufacturers of mattresses, who in the "men's" began to use the softening zone in the shoulder area, remember it already.
They also remember women - they in turn give them a softer surface in the places of the hips.
For the most demanding customers, wing or plate gratings with so-called multi-torsion bracing are designed.
The pressure breaks down to several points and the voltage decreases.
However, be careful, once you use the right mattress and grill the wrong pillow (large and "charged"), most of the "plus" disappears.
The basic rule is simple: the pillow should support the head and the tips should only touch the shoulders so that the shoulder muscles can be relaxed.
As a suitable size it is recommended 50 x 60 cm, which they prefer, for example, in Scandinavia.
When lying on the side, the pillow should equal the height of the shoulder (along with the shoulder cradle or a softened zone in the mattress).
Modern mattresses have something in common with the original strawberries filled with grass.
In fact, their manufacturers are increasingly using natural materials or at least additives.
The trend is also in mattress bio.
The raw materials from which the polyurethane foams are produced are replaced by natural oils, such as legumes and soybeans.
It is the soybean that is used by all known producers.
"Being in a mattress means that the core is made of a material of purely natural origin," explains Petr Va<0xC5><0xA1>í<0xC4><0x8D>ek from Tropico Plus.
Natural substances are also used in the production of mattress covers, one of the first was aloe vera.
But you can also enjoy microcapsules to release the fresh scent of forest or lavender.
There is also a division for men and women.
While a man "cools" a plant extract from birch so that the mattress cover absorbs heat and cools the body, women, on the other hand, "melt" the covers.
The extract from red peppers increases blood circulation, making the weaker sex warmer.
Today's favorites?
A mattress made of cold foam (it has larger pores with a damaged cellular structure, it is thus more breathable than ordinary polyurethane and offers even better elasticity.
The combination of different rigidities of cold foam and "lazy" foam creates multi-zone mattresses that know exactly where the head, hips and heels should be.
For a high-quality mattress you will pay from seven thousand crowns and above.
Those who meet the health parameters, have a lower VAT rate, are taken as health aids.
In the Czech Republic, Gumotex was the first to achieve this advantage.
Saving on a mattress and grill is not easy.
Sometimes you can take advantage of, for example, the actions of manufacturers or sellers who offer two mattresses for the price of one.
For example, the Magniflex brand offers a Duofreeze mattress with a Memory foam sewn into the cover for 11,990 crowns.
The second one can be purchased free of charge.
The era of lazy or viscoelastic foams with open cellular structure and high density started with the "cosmic" rate of Tempur material.
It was originally created as a material for NASA, because during launches, astronauts were exposed to enormous overload.
Tempur softens in the warm, in the cold, on the contrary, it strengthens.
It adapts perfectly to the warm human body and distributes its pressure optimally.
It is therefore ideal against the formation of diarrhea, but also for increasing sleep comfort.
Viscoelastic foams are used not only on mattresses, but also on medical products, such as special pillows under the feet, which relieve the feet and the venous system.
Domestic manufacturers use, for example, Eucatherm C or Twinsaver foam and the like.
Human-monitoring devices want more and more parents, they want to take care of their children
Fear of one’s own child brings more and more people to the idea of GPS surveillance.
The system originally created for searching for cars can also track the movement of people, and thus help in cases such as the disappearance of nine-year-old Anika Janatková.
The device is now about the size of a box of syrups, but soon it can only be as big as a watch.
A number of people were frightened by the case of the missing Anika and began to look for ways to better protect their children.
Even at the cost of violating their privacy.
“We are trying to tell everyone that this is not espionage, but another means of reducing the likelihood that a tragedy will happen,” says Petr Pilin from Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of surveillance equipment to the Czech market.
"I admit that in some cases such devices may be misused, for example when they are put in the bag of someone who does not know about it, but we have not yet encountered such a case."
"Mostly customers actually buy it for safety reasons," Pilin added.
According to him, the child should always know what purpose the "box" serves and how it is used in case of an emergency.
Child psychologist Dana Bo<0xC4><0x8D>ková points out that if a child does not want to wear something similar, he will simply get rid of it.
“Even very young children show great creativity in how to intentionally lose some things when they don’t want to be under control.”
"A lot of expectations have been raised by parents in the past, but mobile phones can be turned off just like these tracking devices," says Bo<0xC4><0x8D>ková.
It is also questionable whether such a device would actually help in the event of an attack.
"When it comes to a prepared abduction, the perpetrator will almost always ensure that the child does not have any electronics that could reveal his or her location."
"Now it's a phone."
“When they start expanding their tracking devices, they’ll be looking for them, because their sales will certainly be supported by massive advertising.”
“In such a case, criminals will always be one step ahead of the police,” says the psychologist.
However, he admits that a similar device can help in the event of a sudden attack by a pedophile.
According to Robert <0xC4><0x8C>ech of RC Monitoring, which offers tracking services for both cars and people, even if the tracking device is immediately destroyed after the attack, its presence can help.
"The device can be set to send a position regularly after a certain period of time."
"If it is damaged, at least the last position of the person concerned will be available."
"Dearer devices have built-in tilt meters, so even if a person just slipped and remained motionless, the device will immediately send a warning with a position indication," says Czech.
According to him, a similar service can also be taken by smartphones with navigation, where it is enough to upload special software.
The problem with the current tracking units is that they are either devices similar to the size of box pendants for sirens or smaller mobile phones.
There is always a risk of losing them.
According to Pilin from Macro Weil, this is why devices that look like ordinary digital watches are now being tested.
"This will have the biggest advantage in the fact that the potential aggressor may not know the tracking device at all."
"Or he only recognizes them after some time, and that can give the police extra time," he adds.
Whether tracking devices evolve into bracelets or pendants, they will still use the same technology used for car surveillance.
This is a combination of position detection via GPS (which uses conventional auto-navigation) and a mobile phone function that reports the current position of the car.
The army has the ignition cords to envelop the Czech Republic. But it will last only two years
The Czech army has purchased 445 kilometers of ropes to launch explosives.
Last year, the Ministry of Defense added 224 kilometers of ropes to the warehouses.
The army has stockpiles for 225 years.
The problem is that the durability of the strings is two, maximum four years.
The army bought the flammable cords from the stock company STV Group, a.s. for 40 million crowns.
In justification for the purchase of such a huge amount of MF ignition cords, the General Staff today decried that soldiers consume 60 kilometers of ignition cords per year in training.
However, from the calculations of military pyrotechnicians, which MF addressed TODAY, it follows that then all generals, officers of the military command, secretaries or housekeepers would have to undergo a very intensive pyrotechnic training every year.
Defence Minister Alexandra Vondra and Army Commander Vlastimila Pick are not excluded.
Only in this way could the annual consumption of the army of sixty kilometers of matches be justified.
That's the length of 25,000 explosions.
And even if it were, the army's stockpiles would have been enough for more than a decade.
On the contrary, if it were true that the basic training of each new professional would be limited to a maximum of two meters of flammable cords, as experts say, then the army has secured supplies for the mentioned 225 years by fresh purchase - even with the increased consumption of engineering or special units.
Soldiers of the Rapid Deployment Brigade have recently personally complained to Minister Vondrovi that they have almost no ammunition in handguns, so the shootings due to the need for money are also limited.
Not to mention the lack of underwear.
"I don't think they're buying so many matches from us again and again."
"But it's their decision, and they certainly know what it will be for them."
"For us, the army is a good customer, which we as businessmen try to meet," says STV Group business manager Jan D<0xC4><0x9B>ck<0xC3><0xBD>.
Ministry of Defense spokesman Jan Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek justifies the hundreds of kilometers of purchased cords and that the army will have supplies of this "munition" for at least ten years.
Jan D<0xC4><0x9B>ck<0xC3><0xBD> from STV Group, however, speaks only of the four-year life of the incendiary and police or military pyrotechnics even only of two years.
"The four of them could be in perfect storage," says one of them, who, as a soldier, does not want to disclose his name because of criticism of the army.
After the lifespan, each ammunition must be carefully tested to see if it is still reliable and does not threaten the lives of the soldiers.
However, these tests are not free and cost extra money.
Another argument from the ministry is a quantitative discount on 445 kilometers of ignition cords.
"It cost us sixty percent less than last year's delivery of two hundred and forty-four kilometers," a spokesman for Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek said.
Just for comparison: the annual consumption of firearms by police pyrotechnicians, who eliminate ammunition from World War II or here after the Soviet army, has not exceeded 1,500 meters for several years.
And the police always order only enough to consume this ammunition before it expires.
It has proven itself for the safety of pyrotechnicians, and can also obtain more modern, and therefore more reliable types of cords.
The Ministry of Defense is already having considerable difficulty in liquidating tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the Warsaw Pact, when the Czechoslovak army was preparing to deploy on the Rhine.
The Czech one, according to pyrotechnicians, which MF addressed TODAY, expects the same problem in a few years: it will liquidate hundreds of kilometers of old matches, which today "lacino" buys.
To this day, I still draw on the contacts I have gained through the competition.
The winning place in the competition Trader of the Year helped Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Pytl<0xC5><0xAF>n to sell the franchise of his hotel.
The winner of the last year of the Trader of the Year competition was the twenty-eight-year-old businessman Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun from Liberec.
His success story is like a movie.
Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun liked to travel.
And abroad he realized that in Liberec there is a lack of quality accommodation at a reasonable price.
From savings from foreign brigades and using a bank loan, he bought a semi-destroyed house with five apartments.
The fact that he was still a student of the third year of college at the time was a great courage.
"The ratio between the quality and the price of accommodation at the time did not give me to try to do something about it," says Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun.
The first renovated apartment began to be rented to foreign workers.
All the profits were invested back into the house, which gradually turned into a pension with 54 beds.
Since then, he has gradually managed to open four guesthouses, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of over 300 beds in all categories of accommodation in Liberec.
The most comfortable of these was until recently the four-star Pytloun design hotel.
This year, however, there was another one, just as good.
"We have just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov u Tisé, where we have sold our franchise concept and other interested in the Pytloun hotel franchise are reporting," says the number one trader last year.
"And in this sale of the license to operate the hotel, the winner of the Trader of the Year competition was a big part of it," adds Pytloun.
The victory brought him greater fame and popularity in Liberec and its surroundings.
"People recognized me on the streets, they often congratulated me and I have to say it was nice," he recalls.
Participation in the competition is definitely recommended to anyone who is trying something.
There is no need to win, all visibility is good.
He says he still draws on contacts and acquaintances that he might not otherwise have.
"With some of the ones I met thanks to the competition, I started trading on a regular basis."
The fame associated with success, according to him, has affected almost every employee.
And he has about 70 of them.
"I see greater loyalty and pride in them to be involved in something that has gained universal recognition."
"It's not just my personal success, it's the result of the good work of all of us together."
"Only my name is put in the foreground," says Luká<0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun today.
I wish my successor a quieter year than we had at Farmet
The euphoria of victory was quickly replaced by the effects of the crisis.
However, thanks to the aim of the winner, Farmet has worse times.
Last year, the owner of Farmet, Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F>ársk<0xC3><0xBD>, won the prize for first place in the last year’s Vodafone Company of the Year competition in the Slavic House.
The jury then appreciated the effort through which it built a company with a stamilion turnover from a small tool workshop in <0xC4><0x8C>eská Skalica.
“I can say that the award encouraged not only me but all of my co-workers and increased our confidence to compete with the competition,” said the winner.
At the beginning of the history of Farmet there was a desire to do something useful.
And so, when the state offered Karl <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F>ársk<0xC3><0xBD>’s father to rent a small workshop as compensation for the communist property seized, he did not hesitate for a long time, he refused a career in the company where he worked at the time, and with a few friends around his father they founded a company on plastic bathtubs.
Soon after, they began to specialize in plant oil presses.
After 18 years, it has become the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in Central Europe.
The company gained greater awareness among the non-professional public after its success in the competition through the media.
“Not only have our customers started to perceive the Farmet brand significantly better, but also foreign partners have started to appreciate that they are working with a company that has achieved greater success in their country,” says Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F>ársk<0xC3><0xBD>.
Last year, however, Farmet was not only a sign of euphoria from victory.
The award was based on the company’s economic performance until 2008 and only partially from 2009.
And 2009 was the hardest year for the sale of mechanical goods.
There was a crisis that hadn’t hit citizens that much yet, but companies were already stopping their investment projects and starting to restrict the purchase of new machines and technologies.
"This situation, of course, hasn't escaped us either."
"Revenues fell by 40 percent, we had to limit production and there were redundancies," explains Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F>ársk<0xC3><0xBD>.
A viable company needs to be able to take such unpopular measures from time to time.
But they managed to keep the company profitable, albeit smaller than before the crisis.
However, what they have not discounted at Farmet is an investment in research and development.
"We have built a research and training centre with grants, we have strengthened the presentation at international fairs, we have won the main awards in domestic exhibitions," says <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F>ársk<0xC3><0xBD>.
Everything indicates that the crisis is behind them.
Revenues are growing again, and with them the number of new employees.
"I wish the new winner a pleasant feeling of victory, but in a calmer atmosphere," says Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F>ársk<0xC3><0xBD>.
A survey that removes nonsensical regulations
The Absurdity of the Year survey is the fourth part of the entrepreneurial bidding.
Some nonsensical regulations have already been repealed.
The infamous winner of the next year of the Absurdity of the Year poll became the obligation to carry documents on the office, which are also accessible to officials online.
More than a third of the less than 4,000 voters voted.
For example, the administration of social security required a paper statement from the trade register, even though the official can obtain it with two clicks of the mouse.
Thanks to the survey, that will change.
"The Czech Social Security Administration will no longer require an extract from the commercial register during checks with insurance payers," said CSSZ spokeswoman Jana Bura<0xC5><0x88>ová.
Enlighten yourself on all the regulations and regulations that companies and entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic must comply with, and the nonsensical abolish them in the sense of the Absurdity of the Year competition.
This is the fourth part of the entrepreneurial campaign organized by the Economic Newspaper this year and is increasingly popular among the public.
If last year about 3,000 voters took part in the vote, this year there were almost 4,000.
And no wonder, the various legal obligations that only serve to delay the business, there is still enough and enough.
"We are at the leading places in the world in the number of ladders for tax recognition," says Karel Havlí<0xC4><0x8D>ek from the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises and Traders of the Czech Republic.
Simplifying business has become a proclaimed goal for all governments in recent years.
Compared to the world, however, the situation in the Czech Republic does not improve much.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic ranked 74th in terms of business conditions, eight times worse than last year.
The Absurdity of the Year competition was first announced in 2006 and is held annually according to the same scenario.
Anyone can register administrative and bureaucratic nonsense every year from April to the end of September, when the competition is closed.
The web address www.firmaroku.cz is used for registration. After that, the organizer of the competition selects seven candidates for the "anticenum" and lets the public vote on it during October on the website www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
The absurdity that gets the most votes wins.
This year’s survey included more than a hundred, more precisely 105 regulations and regulations lacking meaning.
The tips were sent by entrepreneurs, but also by trade unions and journalists.
Among the "finalists" of the competition, among the nominees was, for example, the requirement that cars for the maintenance of highways and highways pay tolls, or that entrepreneurs with twenty employees, two offices and two toilets paint every two years.
The list of this year’s seven proposals is published on the website of the competition.
The announcement of the competition, which always takes place at the beginning of November on Wenceslas Square in Prague, is part of the hapenning, which is regularly attended by personalities of political and social life.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodová, Director of the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises and Traders of the Czech Republic, or Petr Ku<0xC5><0xBE>el, President of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic, attended the summit of the competition.
"Economic prosperity cannot work where the state is throwing sticks at entrepreneurs, so my goal is to abolish at least three dozen paragraphs every year, which today only unnecessarily complicate business," said Minister of Industry and Trade Martin Kocourek.
Trying to break nonsensical regulations doesn’t sound empty.
In 2007, people were most troubled by the obligation of the entrepreneur to report three days in advance to the trade office in the place where the permanent establishment is located, the intention to go with a stand to the exhibition or pilgrimage.
This obligation was abolished by an amendment to the Trade Act.
The second most voted duty in 2007, which was to report to the Labour Office for its foreign employee a business trip of up to 30 days, was removed by the so-called Green Card Act.
And a third of all good.
In 2009, it was absurd to order physiotherapists to have a large mirror, a refrigerator and two escalators in the office.
This was mitigated this year by a decree of the Ministry of Health - the obligation to have a refrigerator has fallen out.
New category recognizes socially responsible companies
Environmental, humanitarian, educational or sports projects will be evaluated.
This year’s fifth edition of the Hospodá<0xC5><0x99>ské novin competition is a category called Responsible Company of the Year 2010.
The mission of this competition is to promote a reasonable and fair business.
“We want to support companies that take into account the impact of their business on the environment and support socially responsible activities,” says Patrik Bartholdy, regional manager of the mobile operator, Vodafone, which is the announcer and guarantor of the competition as well as in the case of the Rebel of the Year competition.
For this year’s first year of this special subcategory of Vodafone Company’s main competition in 2010, companies have signed up for the competition, for which success in business is not the only long-term goal.
The story of each of them is very inspiring and would be published for a separate article.
Although the subject-matter of their activities is diametrically different from each other, support and respect can be considered as common denominators of their efforts.
In one case it concerns, for example, disabled people and elsewhere, for example, personal problems or the health of their own employees.
Among the fourteen finalists across the Republic was, for example, the Prague software company Et Netera, which supports the creation of informal sports teams among employees, who then participate in a series of tournaments in different sports.
Another example of a responsible company from the Pardubice region is the company Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main contributor to the foundation fund sponsoring disabled children for seventeen years.
The paper mill in Pod<0xC4><0x9B>brady, which has more than 70 percent of its employees with disabilities, has been awarded the title of Responsible Company of the Central Bohemian Region and in the Vodafone Company of the Year competition, it ranked third in the region.
MiRyz Soft, the accounting firm that introduced flexible working hours, also won at Olomouc, reduced to an average of 35 hours per week, but without a proportionately reduced salary.
The jury also awarded her the title because she prefers to buy from Czech producers, promotes civic activities in the nearby area and saves the environment.
"We are trying to recycle as much as possible so that our business and our administration have as little impact on the environment as possible," explains Managing Director Milu<0xC5><0xA1>e Ryznarová.
Responsible IT company Enlogit from <0xC3><0x9A>stí nad Labem, in turn, thinks about the health of its employees and has provided them with ergonomic chairs and keyboards for each laptop, supports their work from home and at its corporate events uses catering services provided by a local protected workshop.
"In addition, we support the Foundation Man in Need, which specifically helps the local Roma community," says company representative Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Such<0xC3><0xBD>.
Last but not least, it is also worth mentioning the activity of the company Laundry and Cleaning from the Karlovy Vary region, which contributes to its employees in the form of premium bonuses on their pension supplement.
"In our country, we make contributions to food, transport, qualifications and recreation," says Josef Strapá<0xC4><0x8D> from the Bruntal construction company Czasch, a winner in the Moravian Silesian region.
All regional finalists of the Vodafone Company of the Year competition were automatically registered in the Responsible Company of the Year category, who answered the questions of the questionnaire attached to the application and sent it to the organizers by 15 August at the latest.
Incorrectly completed or incomplete answers in the questionnaire were then excluded from the evaluation by the organizer.
"Unless the representatives of the competing company answered the questions, they could not participate in the Responsible Company of the Year competition, but they are not disqualified from the Vodafone Company of the Year "main" competition."
"It is not possible to register for this competition alone, as this is the main category of the Company of the Year competition," explains Karel Goldman from the Bison & Rose organising agency.
At the Land Fund in Pilsen, police arrested in a public competition
The anti-corruption police arrested in the building of the Land Fund in Pilsen in recent days.
<0xC5><0xBD>elizka detectives deployed local entrepreneur in the media sphere and real estate trader Lubo<0xC5><0xA1>i G.
It allegedly attempted to manipulate the current public tender to settle the refund claims so that the land offered in the competition would attract a specific interested party.
He was supposed to pay Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. half a million crowns for it.
"In the meantime, I can only confirm that the police are prosecuting one person for a misdemeanor offence in public procurement and in a public tender," Pilsen Attorney General Antonie Zelená said, adding that further details regarding the ongoing investigation cannot be provided.
The 34-year-old businessman was released after 24 hours.
The extent to which it may have influenced the competition can only be speculated, given the minimum amount of official information.
A spokeswoman for the Lubomíra <0xC4><0x8C>erná Land Fund told Prva that policemen were actually arrested at a separate workplace in Pilsen during a public competition.
"It was about the client, not our employee," she said.
According to <0xC4><0x8C>erná, the tender has the correct title "Call to submit an offer of entitlements to transfer of land under the Land Act" and takes place when more eligible applicants are interested in the proposed land.
"These persons shall, within the framework of the call, offer a higher value of their refund claims to be settled by transfer than the declared value of the land."
"According to the claims offered, the order of the acquirers will be determined and the Land Fund will then transfer the land to the person who offered the highest claims," the fund's spokeswoman explained.
Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. apparently had information about who signed up for the call, and since he himself is also an eligible person, since he bought a number of refund claims, he offered the applicant for the land that he would not participate in the competition.
Apparently, he's been collecting his leave for it.
That would explain why he had such a large amount of money in custody.
Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. had high-standard contacts at PF in Pilsen in the past.
He appeared in the case of former head of the PF Václav Sankot, who was prosecuted for issuing in the replacement restitution of the land on which a decision on the location of the building had already been issued.
At that time, for example, Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. acquired land for the construction of public transport from the fund, specifically in the place where the access road to the Borská Pole industrial zone was to be built.
Later he very conveniently exchanged it with the magistrate for a house in the very historical center of the city, which had a much higher value.
At that time, the town hall had to do so, because otherwise, blocking the land would endanger the construction.
Households will pay hundreds per month for housing
From January onwards, households will have to pay extra not only for all types of energy, but also for water and livestock, heat supplies, and somewhere rents will increase.
As a result, families will have to withdraw up to hundreds of kronor a month from their wallets more than they currently do.
Electricity will cost up to 4.6 percent, gas will be about 2 percent more expensive, up to a tenth of what you have to pay for water supplies in some cities, and many will also encourage central heat supplies.
The cost of electricity in homes should go up by a hundred kroner a year than it does now.
At the same time, electricity prices have been reduced by all the major suppliers, which is to blame for a significant increase in support for the production of energy from renewable sources, in particular photovoltaics.
Gas will cost slightly, but at a time when people are drowning the most and thus have the highest consumption.
Hence, he must also count hundreds of crowns extra per year.
While electricity and gas are going to cost across the republic, the change in central heating prices varies from place to place.
The increase in prices is mainly planned by larger municipalities.
For example, households in Pardubice or Hradec Králové will pay for central heating by about 50 kronor per month from January, and families in Liberec will pay more than 1000 kronor per year.
The residents of Prague, in turn, are threatened with more than 9% of the cost of water and livestock, in the event that the city increases rent from infrastructure.
If the rent does not change, the Toasted will pay 6.8 percent.
However, the price in Prague will still be among the lowest in the entire republic.
In northern Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, water and livestock prices are expected to rise by 7.4 percent.
For example, the price of rent in 450,000 rental apartments, where regulation has ended since January, could rise significantly.
For example, CPI Byty, which owns about 2,500 apartments in <0xC3><0x9A>stí nad Labem, intends to increase the rent by up to one hundred percent from January.
Those who will not agree to the new amount of rent, intend to put the company to court.
Regulated rents, which are paid by people in roughly 300,000 apartments, could rise by up to ten percent next year.
Czech children get drunk with fernet and rum. Beer is out of fashion, it works slowly
Fernet, rum, vodka, exceptionally a better brand of whiskey stolen from parents.
These are drinks after which drunkards, who were not even fifteen years old, usually end up in the care of doctors.
There are no exceptions to children who are repeatedly treated in the hospital.
This results from the experience of doctors who encounter similar cases on the income of children's departments of hospitals.
"Some beers or wines are completely unfamiliar, because it takes a long time to get drunk with them."
"The trend is definitely hard alcohol," said Lud<0xC4><0x9B>k Pelikan, the primary child department of Ho<0xC5><0x99>ovice Hospital in central Bohemia.
"If they manage to pull a bottle out of Daddy's closet, it's whiskey, otherwise it's fernet and vodka."
"Vodka has the advantage of being poured into the juice, and it doesn't feel that much," the principal explained.
And he is also given the truth by the spokesperson of the Motol Eva Jurin University Hospital.
"Most often it's fernet or rum."
"This is modern alcohol today, especially in primary schools."
"In some cases, it was a plum that they brought home," Jurina said.
According to Pelican's primary, 13 or 14-year-olds are a relatively common phenomenon at hospital admissions.
Prior to Ho<0xC5><0x99>ovice, where he has been active since this year, he worked for ten years in pediatrics in Motola, where ambulances transport schoolchildren from a wide area.
"There was a girl who slept with us about four times."
"She started her career at the age of twelve, when she was brought to us with 3.5 milliliters of extra alcohol in her blood in combination with ecstasy," the doctor described the particularly serious case.
"She was at an exhibition in Hole<0xC5><0xA1>ovice for a dance party."
"Interestingly, her mother didn't find it strange that she didn't know about her daughter for 48 hours," the mayor said.
It is the disinterest of parents or even their considerable tolerance for drinking their own offspring that is considered the main cause of growing childhood drunkenness.
However, it is not possible to talk about dependence in the true sense of the word in children, according to experts.
"The term alcoholic means a multi-year chronic dependence on alcohol with all the phenomena that belong to it, and this is not the case in children."
"For those who drink alcohol repeatedly, it is more likely to be characteristic of a misguided family-social background," said Pelican.
According to a spokesman for Jurina, about 40 drunk children were hospitalized at Motola pediatric clinic this year by mid-November.
However, only those with severe intoxication who had to stay in the hospital will get to the statistics.
Children’s drunks who take their parents home after an outpatient treatment, or are transported by the police, do not count at all.
In addition to the cases where children just sit after school and drink a bottle of corn, there are three seasonal fluctuations that can be relied on, according to Pelikan: the witch, New Year's Eve and the end of the school year.
"It either drinks up the grief of the wrong testimony or, on the contrary, celebrates the beginning of the holidays."
"But I saw seven children's drunkards at the reception at the same time," Pelikan said.
A drunk who spends the night detoxifying under the supervision of doctors is paradoxically at an advantage over one who suffers an unpleasant hangover at home the next day.
Morning headaches caused by dehydration and glucose deficiency will trigger irrigation infusions with glucose and nutrients that the body lacks.
"They're actually better off because they've got a good night's sleep and nothing hurts."
"They're only confused about where they are," Pelikan admitted, sometimes spoiling the patients' pleasant mood by at least listing the costs of their treatment.
Transportation by ambulance and hospitalization in an emergency bed will cost tens of thousands of crowns.
"I sometimes used it as an educational tool when I was calculating how much their drunkenness cost to those children and that they could also spend the whole summer on the brigade to make money on that one party," Pelikan added.
However, health insurance companies do not have access to regression proceedings in which they would recover treatment costs from parents in cases of children’s drunks.
Two L-159s are in foreign hands for the first time in Spain
Two L-159s, out of a total of five, for which the Czech Ministry of Defense replaced the Casa C-295M transport aircraft, flew on Tuesday to Seville, Spain, where the aircraft manufacturer Casa - EADS - is based.
This is the first time that machines of this type have appeared in the possession of someone other than the Czech army.
So far, they've only been abroad for exercises or demonstrations.
This is a two-seater version of the L-159T1, which was previously operated by the Czech army and which was airworthy.
The remaining three machines are single-seat L-159.
These are currently preserved in Aer Vodochody and the trade broker - the company Omnipol - took them over last week.
When the planes are physically fired from Vodochod, according to Jan Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek from the press department of defense, it is not yet known.
"The L-159 single-seat aircraft for the shift were allocated from long-term stored aircraft, without any further deposits and investments from the Ministry's departmental department."
"The two-seater L-159T1 has been replaced in its current condition and shape," Právu Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek said.
He added that the army will not be left without two-seat aircraft, as the ministry signed a 200 million crown contract with Aer Vodochody in May 2009 to rebuild four unnecessary L-159 machines into two two-seat machines.
One new aircraft was taken over by the army in July, the other will be taken over by the end of this year.
According to Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ko, EADS has committed to deploying the aircraft into the arms of some of the alliance countries.
"The contract clearly states that the customer of the L-159 aircraft is EADS and will serve to train pilots from NATO countries."
"It is therefore a matter for the customer how they will implement this thing," said Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
The Spanish military, for example, was not interested in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159s for one Casa aircraft and the purchase of three more for 3.5 billion crowns was approved last year by the government of Mirko Topolánek.
The Ministry of Defence did not submit a tender for the purchase and contacted EADS directly.
The defense leadership at the time argued that the exchange would support future exports of the L-159 abroad.
The Czech army bought 72 machines from Aer and uses only 24, the rest they would like to sell.
The purchase of the Casa aircraft will probably also have a legal effect.
The European Commission has sued the Czech Ministry of Defence in the European Court of Justice because it had to select aircraft on the basis of a pan-European tender and not by contacting a single manufacturer.
The army has already taken over three Casa planes, the last one should arrive at Prague’s Kbely airport within fourteen days.
A longer index than a ring indicates a lower risk of cancer
Men who have an index finger longer than a ring are at a lower risk of developing prostate cancer.
This is the surprising conclusion of a study published Wednesday in the British Journal of Cancer.
This may be related to the level of the male hormone testosterone.
“Our results show that the relative length of the finger can serve as a simple test of prostate cancer risk, especially for men under 60 years of age,” said Ros Eeles, a professor at the University of Warwick’s Institute for Cancer Research.
The finger could help determine which men should be tested for prostate cancer, particularly in combination with genetic risk or other risk factors, such as family health stress, Eeles said.
In the period 1994-2009, colleagues in the UK followed more than 1,500 patients with prostate cancer and more than 3,000 healthy men at the same time.
More than half of the study participants had a shorter pointer on their right hand than a ring.
They had the same chance of prostate cancer as 19 percent of those whose fingers were the same length.
However, in the case of those who had an index finger longer than a ring, this risk decreased by 33 percent, for men under sixty, it decreased by even 87 percent.
The ratio of the length of the two fingers - formed in the prenatal period - apparently reflects the different levels of sex hormones to which the baby is exposed in the uterus.
Less testosterone corresponds to a longer indicator.
Previous research has shown that it is testosterone that promotes growing prostate cancer.
The leading Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences Professor Václav Pa<0xC4><0x8D>es told <0xC4><0x8C>TK that he knew about this study, but did not think that the relationship between the length of the fingers and the cancer was "completely proven".
Czech Republic is under snow, D1 and D5 are closed
The Czech Republic, like most of Europe, is covered in snow on Thursday morning.
There is mostly snow on the roads and sidewalks, and roadmen have been driving in many places all night long.
In the morning, the D5 motorway between the 89th and 93rd kilometers in the direction of Rozvadov is closed due to several accidents of trucks and passenger cars and the D1 is also located near Brno in the direction of Prague.
This was reported by the Central Motor Club’s (<0xC3><0x9A>AMK) dispatcher.
On the 91st kilometre there was a truck crash, on the 93rd kilometre two trucks collided, the accident required injuries.
A number of cars also ended up in the trench.
The problems are also on the D1 motorway on the 185th kilometer in the direction of Prague.
Two trucks collided there.
Drivers should drive just behind Brno on the 190th kilometer or drive through Brno and then drive on the 182nd kilometer on K<0xC3><0xBD>valce.
Several kilometers of columns are formed there.
Also on the D11 motorway there is an accident, right on arrival in Prague.
In Prague lies a layer of several centimeters of snow, the thermometers show minus seven degrees Celsius.
Columns of cars are created, for example, on Proseku, <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>rboholská is also blocked.
The safest means of transport is the metro.
Trams are delayed, for example, on the route between Charles Square and Peace Square.
The Prague Crisis Staff is scheduled to meet again at 8 a.m.
Railways and airports are also facing problems.
The Czech railways had to cancel seven fast connections because of the snow.
For example, the route from Prague to Kralup or from Prague to Beroun has problems.
Passengers should check the current situation.
Ruzyne Airport was closed from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Wednesday.
Most roads in southern Moravia are already accessible, but only with increased caution.
In Vy<0xC5><0xA1>kovsk there are three side roads, in Brn<0xC4><0x9B>nsk there are snow tongues and in Blanensk it is necessary to pass some roads in the above-mentioned snow chains.
One of the most affected areas was Vy<0xC5><0xA1>kovsko.
So far there are closed roads: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Ku<0xC4><0x8D>erov and also <0xC5><0xA0>aratice - Mile<0xC5><0xA1>ovice.
The milling machines will need to be deployed until they are stretched.
It is not yet possible to estimate when they will be transposed.
Caution should be exercised in the White Carpathians.
On roads that are only maintained by inert dripping for nature protection, there is up to a five-centimeter layer of snow, the <0xC4><0x8C>TK said.
In the Czech Republic, between two and ten centimeters of snow fell, the most rainfall in northern Bohemia, often up to 18 centimeters.
In the Moravian Silesian region, about 15 centimeters of snow fell.
The snow in the Czech Republic is gradually stopping.
The U.S. military has a new “smart weapon.”
The U.S. military has deployed a new “smart” weapon in Afghanistan, known only under the code-name XM-25.
The generals hope that the new automatic rifle will affect the conflict there with the Taliban and "change the game" in their favor.
A new weapon is kind of like a small super-accurate cannon.
Its projectiles are guided by a laser with an accuracy of several meters.
Special rounds of 25 mm, developed for this rifle and containing high explosive explosives, actually function as small grenades.
Ammunition can be programmed to explode not only when hitting a target, but at any point in its ballistic trajectory.
They can therefore be used against an enemy that hides behind an obstacle, behind a wall or in a trench.
Shora is usually unprotected, and when the deadly rain of steel shards touches it, it can put it out of the fight.
According to Richard Audett, who was involved in the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first infantry weapon to use "smart" technology.
"The soldier basically treats it by finding a target, sending a laser beam to it, which determines the distance, so he gets a specified intentional point, adjusts the direction according to it, and presses the tap."
"Let's say you measured 543 meters."
"When you press the trigger, the weapon is charged and fired at a distance of 543 meters plus minus one, two or three meters," Audette said.
400 jobs will be relocated
Fujitsu is moving its subsidiary from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
400 employees will move their jobs from the existing administrative building at Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park in July next year.
Japan’s Fujitsu Group moves its subsidiary from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As the giant in the field, which specializes in computers and their maintenance, announced on Wednesday, in July of next year, 400 men and women will move their jobs from the previous administrative building at Marienbader Square in Bad Homburg to Astro Park, which is a large administrative complex in Lyonska Street, in the Niederrad district of Frankfurt.
According to a spokesman for Fujist, another 100 jobs from the group, which are currently divided in the region, should be moved there in the near future.
The rental offer was very attractive and the large offices in Astro Park are said to be more suited to the work methods of the employees.
Also in Bad Homburg, Fujitsu was only rented.
Bernd Wagner, managing director, said: “In Frankfurt-Niederrad we found a central headquarters with excellent infrastructure.”
An excellent connection to the airport is very important for a global company like Fujitsu.
The recent move of an important company within the region has sparked the joy of the winners and the disappointment of the losers.
Markus Frank (CDU), Frankfurt’s chief economic adviser, said that this has succeeded in gaining a “global player”.
It is said to be a “fantastic expression of trust in this location.”
Fujitsu is fit for the city, settlement is an important impetus for Niederrad.
The mayor of Bad Homburg, Michael Korwisi (Greens), regretted Fujitsu's decision.
The city was reportedly informed in time by the management of the company of his intention.
"Of course, we offered our help to the company," Korwisi said.
Friendly contacts, however, could not change the difficulties of the computer manufacturer with the landlord in Marienbader-nám<0xC4><0x9B>stí.
As a result, there were decisive economic reasons.
It is now a matter of avoiding a long absence in such a prominent place.
"I hope the owner and landlord of the building will be cooperative."
The house on Rathaus Square, which was used by Fujitsu until now, and the neighboring "Kleine Vertikale" were among the most discussed construction plans of the spa town ten years ago, along with the other buildings on Marienbader Square.
Between the station and the town hall arose as a joint project of the city and the private designer of the so-called city entrance, which was criticized on the one hand for the massive construction of the areas that previously served as parking spaces and at the same time also for the height of the buildings.
In 2001, the investment consulting and rating company Feri, the manufacturer of software for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, as well as the manufacturer of computers Fujitsu, which was still affiliated with Siemens at the time, moved into the house.
The buildings used by Fujitsu were acquired jointly by Frankfurter Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen-Gruppe and Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund in 2006 and sold to Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid after a year.
The Fujitsu Group in Tokyo is the third largest IT provider in the world.
For example, it offers computers and servers to companies and also takes care of the necessary service.
The Rhine and Mohan branch is one of the largest in Germany, but the largest number of Fujitsu employees is in Munich.
From Bad Homburg, a subsidiary of Fujitsu Technology Solutions is moving to Frankfurt-Niederrad, and other subsidiaries in this location will be Fujitsu Services and a company called TDS.
In the administrative building Astro Park was rented for this purpose 7000 square meters.
In the complex - its name draws attention to the stellar plot, which is twenty years old, is also home to, among others, the central union of the electrical and electronic industry.
Amazon shuts down the server - threats against Assange
WikiLeaks is getting in the way.
Amazon has shut down the detection platform on its servers.
It is possible that this happened under political pressure after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic orders.
WikiLeaks founder Assange is reportedly staying in the UK.
Wikileaks, the platform for detection, is getting under increasing pressure in the United States.
Internet activists have lost access to their current home server in America and are now looking for an internet home in Europe.
Meanwhile, prominent U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman has called on other countries and businesses to boycott WikiLeaks.
And WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who is on the Interpol wanted list, is expected to stay, according to one newspaper post in the UK.
"Wikileaks is no longer on Amazon."
"Free speech in the country of the free," activists said in a short news release on Twitter on Wednesday.
Recently, Amazon downloaded WikiLeaks documents from its servers.
Internet activists have used Amazon Web Service (AWS) to publish secret diplomatic records to manage a high number of accesses to documents.
WikiLeaks tweeted: “Okay – we’re now spending our dollars on employing people in Europe.”
When Amazon has such a problem with freedom of expression, “they should stop selling books.”
Amazon stopped using its servers for WikiLeaks after allegedly investigating Senator Joe Lieberman's co-workers, CNN reported on Monday.
The chairman of the Senate House Defense Committee threatened to boycott Amazon, the Guardian reported.
"I wish Amazon had taken this step earlier, given the earlier release of classified information on WikiLeaks," the senator said.
Lieberman, meanwhile, called for the platform to be prevented from using servers in other countries as well.
"Wikileaks is acting illegally, ruthlessly and recklessly, putting our national security at risk and endangering life on the planet," the senator said in a statement.
“No responsible company – whether American or foreign – should help WikiLeaks in its efforts to disseminate stolen material.”
WikiLeaks founder Assange, who is wanted by Swedish authorities on suspicion of rape, is on the list of wanted by Interpol.
According to a report in the London newspaper "The Independent", a 39-year-old Australian is staying in the UK, Scotland Yard is said to know the exact location.
The Internet activist has always described the investigation in Sweden as the intrigue of his opponents.
WikiLeaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson said there were threats.
"There have even been calls for the assassination of Julian Assange."
That’s why Assange rightly fears for his safety, Hrafnsson said.
The founder of WikiLeaks is still in hiding.
Hrafnsson apparently responded to statements from North America.
In America, former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, called for the person responsible for publishing on WikiLeaks to be charged and executed for treason.
In Canada, one adviser to the head of the government, Stephen Harper, said on television - ironically, apparently, Assange should be "killed" and Obama could use a "target plane".
In the meantime, a verbal shootout broke out between the White House and Assange.
U.S. President Barack Obama’s spokesman Robert Gibbs called it “ridden and absurd” that Assange had called for the resignation of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton if she was responsible for recently published spying calls on diplomats.
“I’m not quite sure why we’re interested in the opinion of one person with a website,” Gibbs said.
"Our foreign policy and interests of this country are much more important than its website."
The U.S. government is now extensively investigating the security of its databases.
The special commissioner was appointed by the deputy director of the Center for Counter-Terrorism Measures, Russell Travers, the White House said.
Travers has become responsible for developing “necessary reforms in the structure” that are necessary after the release of messages from the embassy to WikiLeaks.
The White House also wants to review the ways in which the entire government is exchanging and protecting information.
The U.S. government has also announced that it wants to take care of the safety of dissidents and activists if they should be put in danger due to publication on WikiLeaks.
"We did everything we could to get in touch with them," Foreign Ministry spokesman Philip Crowley said.
"We're ready to protect them, if necessary."
Ice Cream University
At the "Gelato University" near Bologna, ice cream confectioners are preparing for a better season.
The basic course for future ice cream makers, which lasts three days, is of great interest and visitors come from all over the world.
Where does the ice cream come from?
From Gelatiere and from Gelataio.
Gelatiere, a Czech ice cream maker, produces the cream according to all the rules of Italian ice cream art.
Gelataio takes a scoop of ice cream out of the cooling box, sweeps it into a chip and sells it.
To find out, you do not have to drive to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But if you want to know more about ice cream, you can’t avoid the “Gelato-University” of the Italian company Carpigiani.
In 2003, an ice cream machine manufacturer set up an ice cream university to ensure that the ice cream from his machines corresponded everywhere to the high Italian ideals.
The basic course for the future Gelatieri, which takes three days, is of great interest and visitors come from all over the world.
However, there are also several days of special courses on chocolate ice cream and practice in your own ice cream shop.
Some yearn for a new career in their Midlife-Crisis, others dare to the thin ice of their vague desires.
This time it is 40 participants from 19 countries on all continents - from Brazil to Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, an art teacher from California, loves the Slow-Food movement and would like to offer a quality European product in the industrial Ice-Cream country in the future.
Anke from Berlin is a business consultant and would like to start her own business after years of stressful work.
Two young Egyptian women dream of opening an ice cream shop in Cairo.
One man from Malta and one from Brazil want to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars - and a Canadian woman in the house of Julia came because her children love Italian ice cream.
Maestro-Gelatiere Luciano Ferrari will first explain to the participants the ideal properties of the perfect ice cream.
Decisive is not only good taste, but also silky softness and good consistency.
Luciano will not forget during his training on the southern and patriotic cherry on the cake: "Italian Gelato is simply the best - and then this includes a notable dose of romance."
The first step of production seems to be quite simple.
Luciano puts the basic ingredients milk, ice cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers in a large mixer, which heats everything with an electronic program to 85 degrees and then immediately cools to four degrees.
Then he turns the machine with a faucet and leaks out the pasteurized white basic cream, the basis of all kinds of milk ice cream.
Immediately, the lecturer is overwhelmed with questions: Is it possible to make ice cream only from natural substances without a stabilizer?
How can a man experiment on his own?
Luciano warns, let yourself be carried away by the spirit of time into the unknown.
Whoever talks about ice cream "only from natural ingredients" has apparently also used stabilizers - mostly a natural product, such as guar flour from guar grains.
Of course, it is possible to make ice cream even without stabilizers, but it must be sold within a day, otherwise it will crash and the customer will eat the ice grains themselves.
Certain variations of the base material are allowed.
It will be more tense with aromatic essences.
Maestro Luciano distinguishes the taste of ice cream by the ingredients that are bought in the supermarket either in the fruit department or in the sweets department.
In addition, there are pills and creams.
"Suppliers will try to impose a lot of flavored ingredients on you."
"But you should just experiment."
Either with fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or with ice cream from white basic matter, which turns eggs into yellow cream and cocoa into a base for all sorts of chocolate temptations.
Participants are now allowed to participate in the ice cream machine course.
Luciano lets them always make four different types of vanilla, chocolate, coffee and hazelnut ice cream - either with or without eggs in the basic material, with more or less vanilla flavour or other natural ingredients.
The same experiment will be done with fruit ice cream.
More aromatic substances, more fruit puree - due to the taste it is not always better.
Peanut ice cream may not taste more peanuts when it contains more peanuts.
The most popular kiwi ice cream is made by a group that will use more fruit, less water, and a little less stabilizer.
Only when a balanced mixture picks up the right taste of Gelato, says Luciano.
Making ice cream is a purely numerical task: If a peach puree with a lot of sugar is used, the share of sugar in the basic recipe must be reduced.
For lemon ice cream, you need an extra serving of sugar.
Luciano removes the device that determines the sugar content of the fruit (the winemakers measure the grape must).
Fortunately, the tables make the numbers easier.
Making ice cream no longer requires as much physical exertion as before.
It does not only help the device for the automatic production of basic matter.
There is also a device that simultaneously mixes the finished ice cream mixture into the cream and cools to minus temperature.
Despite all the automation, we do not avoid small accidents.
The Brazilian Gustavo will get himself and his colleagues dirty from top to bottom with fruit puree when his huge mixer gets out of control.
"In every course," believes Maestro Luciano, "it's only a matter of time before something like this happens."
Auditors in double light
The European Food Authority (EFSA) is associated with an industry that experiments with genetic plants.
This accusation has now been made by a group of experts called Testbiotech, which considers itself an independent institute for estimating the consequences of biotechnology.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we've documented it well," Testbiotech chief Christoph Then said on Wednesday in Munich.
Harry Kuiper, the head of the EFSA Group of Experts on Genetically Modified Plants, and another EFSA expert have had a contract with the Ilsa Lobbying Union for several years.
It is funded by companies such as Monsanto, Nestle and Bayer.
Kuiper has played a decisive role in EFSA’s control regulations for genetic plants and is thus in a clear conflict of interest, criticizes Then.
The EFSA regulations are said to be consistent in whole paragraphs with the Ilsa documents and thus carry a manuscript of the industry, which should be checked by the Parma office in Italy.
This is the second time that Testbiotech has pointed out a conflict of interest.
Recently, a senior manager from EFSA transitioned without supplements or a transition period to the Swiss agrarian group Syngenta - and thus changed sides.
The Central German Radio (MDR) also recently revealed the EU Control Office’s staffing link with the industrial lobby, sparking interest from both the Ministry of the Environment and EU Members.
In the meantime, EFSA cannot recognise a conflict of interest.
It works with all serious data, that is, also those from the industry, if they are of high professional quality, is stated in one statement.
Experts working for EFSA are not required to have no contact with the industry.
But he has to prove it.
Kuiper admits his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (ILSI) in the USA.
It describes itself as a neutral forum of experts in science, industry and politics – among other things, for assessing the risk of biotechnology without a lobbyist contract.
Independent experts such as Then have criticized that genetically modified plants are currently allowed in animals without any feeding attempt, and that the reaction of genetic plants to environmental impacts is not being tested.
“We want to know what, for example, genetically modified corn in the field will do,” says Then.
The current practice is only to test isolated proteins and not the entire genetic plant, which does not provide reliable results.
"If they are not looking for risks, how could they be found?" Then asks the plaintiff.
Angelika Hilbeck agrees with this.
She has been studying genetic engineering since 1994 and is currently working at the Technical University of Zurich.
In this field, the industry is trying to influence or discredit critical scientists as much as in the US, now also in Europe.
Therefore, there are hardly any scientists who are not connected to the corporations.
Studies that are critical to society are usually not published.
“Industry controls security research,” Hilbeck said.
Trace of stones
Uli Gsell also bought some, a total of about 400 kilograms.
On Monday night, he stood in front of the train station in Stuttgart, a tube on his back.
There was a demonstration.
It was snowing.
The story is known: In September, the excavators arrived and began to tear down a large piece of the north wing.
The world in Stuttgart was no longer the same: Thousands demonstrated against S21, the billion-dollar reduction of the railway station.
When construction was halted, most of the wings lay in ruins.
Broken into 6000, 7000 pieces.
Crailsheim limestone, a soft coarse stone used in 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, 43 years old.
He secured a few of these pieces.
"These stones are relics."
"He mustn't disappear."
It says, "Cheap and poor stone, simple and original."
When one cut out, it smelled like cigarette smoke.
He doesn't know what to do with the pieces.
The stones have time.
Uli Gsell, too.
A trail of stones from Stuttgart leads to the forest near Tübingen to the former ammunition depot of the French army, where Manuel Rongen built his stone empire.
A 44-year-old man trades old stones.
He bought all that came into being during the collapse of Stuttgart.
"It would be a disgrace if they were to dump in the gravel or disappear into the landfill," he says in his office, a wooden building that used to be a guardhouse.
He said he was being harassed and threatened when it was reported in all the newspapers in September that he had bought the remnants of the North Wing from the company that was carrying out the demolition.
But he talked to the S-21 opponents all day.
And he explained to them that he could not be at all behind the demolition.
And when that happens, it’s the most sensible thing to do if the stones continue to be used.
Then he took about 200 S-21-opponents each about 80 kilograms heavy block, the price per piece 6.50 to 14 euros.
As a reminder, some also hope to return it when rebuilt.
Rongen bought 500 tons, loaded 25 large trucks.
About half are still in the woods, the rest have been sold for a long time.
Gardeners, landscape gardeners, home builders.
They came from all corners and pulled out what was in the trunk and the trailer.
The controversy stones of Stuttgart have long been transformed into "walls" or as the edges of weed beds.
"This stone is actually nothing special," Rongen says.
"If it weren't for the political push."
He gets into his off-road car and goes on a ride through his 20-hectare kingdom.
He studied law first, interrupted his studies, then biology, then became interested in computers, and eventually became a stone merchant.
And a lover of stones.
It has 40,000 tons of stones stored.
It weighs its treasures from all over Germany.
He says he's the biggest old stone dealer in the republic.
Brakes.
In the snow lies an artistically crafted sandstone.
"Once they belonged to the Marien-Brücke in Dresden," he says.
Sandboxer from Labe, yellow, warm, is thrilled.
"My favorite stone."
We continue on the way up through the forest.
It points to the pile: red sandstone, formerly part of the station in Karlsruhe.
Go on.
"Nice travertine."
Once upon a time, these blocks belonged to the Neckarstadion in Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow lie stones and stories, Cannstatt-travertine from the police headquarters in Stuttgart, red granite from the Sankt Blasien temple, tuf from the hospital in Heilbronn.
What work, what effort, what sweat.
When Rongen thinks of how the stones used to be broken by hand and transported using simple folding machines and bullfighters, he becomes completely respectful.
"It would be a scandal if something like this were to break down."
He wasn’t rich, not very rich at all.
But the stone dealer now employs 14 people, and in addition, stonemasons, one sculptor, one blacksmith, one glassman and one gardener settled in the woods.
"We work hard, but it's satisfying," says the one who evaluates the rest.
In the near future, he must go to Cologne.
The stones will also be saved.
The Battle of Talents for High Potentials
There are a lot of people at the snack.
16 students squeeze at sandwiches with salmon, tomato soup and sweets.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the Volkswagen car manufacturer invited engineering and design students to the workshop.
Together with the VW developers, they are here to talk about the car of the future – and just so by the way, to get to know Volkswagen.
Many companies are trying to succeed in the race for the smartest heads, as is the case with VW, and are betting on cooperation with universities.
Their mission is to recruit the most gifted graduates in the auditoriums as soon as possible, before they get into the job market and others will be interested in them.
Since universities do not issue any lists of their students’ successes, companies are trying to discover and acquire exceptional talent in practice-oriented projects.
At TU Braunschweig, the automotive group is trying to attract talent the next day.
One young lady from the personal department distributes pencils, rubber teddy bears and VW logo boards.
It tells promising young talents about internship programs, student jobs and suggests them ways into the group.
Nico Selle from TU Braunschweig takes care of the project together with VW.
They see benefits for both sides: "Students will get in touch with the industry and gain experience."
"VW can simultaneously meet students, get to know interesting candidates closer, and reconsider who would be a good fit as a co-worker."
Such cooperation, according to Selle, is not uncommon.
But the news is that it is so openly fighting for students.
"Otherwise, it was a more substantial professional project," Selle says.
The fight for fresh graduates will probably be even harder.
In many industries, companies are no longer able to select their employees from long-standing pools of candidates.
On the contrary, they must seek and endeavour to attract particularly highly skilled workers.
Above all, graduates of engineering fields have an excellent negotiating position.
According to the Association of German Engineers of the VDI, 40,000 engineering positions remained vacant in October.
And according to the VDI forecast, the so-called lack of engineers will still grow.
Roman Dykta, an audit and consulting firm at KPMG, goes on a hunt for talent.
It organizes challenging Recruiting-events, such as KPMG-Race, a kind of modern treasure race in which participants must find a path according to the GPS coordinate.
The company plans to send eight promising students to the U.S. next year.
Participants can also visit KPMG’s offices and get to know the company.
In advance, it is decided in two selection rounds who will participate.
Only Crème de la Crème from many interested ones will fly to the USA.
In the fight for High Potentials at universities, according to the Decree, increasingly tough laws will apply.
"We want to make our race different from the others."
"A simple sailing trip was too little for us."
Looks like Dikta's talent hunter is in luck.
"We stayed in touch with all participants of a similar event last year."
"Some will be leaving school soon and are planning to apply for a job with us," he says.
In addition to direct addressing on campus, especially small and medium-sized companies present themselves classically in the labor markets.
"We are trying to contact graduates at professional exhibitions."
"Like Intersolar," says Sitha Stübe, head of the solar technology manufacturer's HR department Solarworld.
The Bonn-based company employs around 1,500 people in Germany.
Stübe knows the problems with young workers.
There are currently 35 positions listed on the company’s website.
"Currently, it is difficult to occupy vacancies."
“It costs a lot of time and money,” he says.
Another option is contact via professors at universities.
Solarworld cooperates with various universities, such as the University of Freiberg.
"Professors inform us that it is possible to do an internship or write a diploma thesis."
The solar specialist does not organize any expensive advertising events.
Instead, the company tries to attract other advantages: personal atmosphere, low hierarchy and easy communication.
"Big companies often can't offer it," says Stübe, head of staff.
Money has not played a major role in finding work for a long time.
Flexible working hours, childcare or good procedural options are other crucial factors.
Solarworld ranked 55th among the 100 best employers in Germany in a study by the Great Place to Work Institute.
The Institute compiles an annual list of the best German employers.
In addition, co-workers are asked how satisfied they are with their work and working environment and monitor the framework conditions of employees.
The head of Stübe’s personal department hopes that the placement will bring her points for job seekers.
“I believe that interested parties are particularly informed about the external evaluations of a potential employer,” he says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler from the German Employer Branding Academy advises companies that want to build a good reputation as an employer with a long-term strategy.
They advise their customers to be more authentic.
And, according to Mr. Kriegler, this means, above all, internal measures.
“The best way to make yourself visible as an attractive employer is through your own employees,” he says.
This is professionally called internal employer branding, i.e. the promotion of an employer in the market within its own employees.
"Satisfied employees are the best ambassadors."
When a company takes good care of its people and they identify with the company, then they will advertise themselves to their employer among friends and acquaintances.
"It's like a string game," Kriegler says.
Obama stops new oil drilling
Over the next few years, no new oil wells will be drilled off the coast of the U.S. state of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico.
The government in Washington issued a corresponding ban – thus finally repealing earlier plans.
New drills are also banned off the Atlantic coast.
Interior Minister Ken Salazar said on Wednesday.
The reason for the strict ban, which should apply for at least the next five years, is the explosion at the drilling tower "Deepwater Horizon" in April.
Prior to this disaster, which cost the lives of eleven employees and led to the largest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama signaled to the pressure of the opposition and industry his willingness to allow new drills in the eastern Gulf.
Proponents are trying to reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil supplies.
To this day, it is not clear who is responsible for the devastating oil disaster in the Gulf.
At the center of criticism is the British energy group BP, which is facing billions of requests.
The Commission of Inquiry commissioned by Obama is due to submit its findings in December.
In October, Interior Minister Ken Salazar lifted the ban on drilling since the explosion.
Subsequently, various oil companies submitted applications for new drilling plans.
Obama and Salazar want to prevent a similar disaster with stricter controls and strict security regulations.
At present, the control authority is being fundamentally reformed, which has drawn attention to itself with many corruption allegations.
At the same time, Obama announced that he would abolish lucrative tax evasion options for oil and gas companies.
The industry now openly warns that tighter regulation will substantially reduce the volume of oil mined in the bay.
"Government plans are the biggest brake on the growth of the gas and oil industry," BDO said in a recent survey, ahead of a drilling ban on Wednesday.
The American Energy Alliance also complains of uncertainty in the industry: “No one knows exactly what the regulation will change.”
Investments in new mining projects are shifting to appeal - at the expense of growth.
The Ogoni area burned
The water in the rivers is oil-brown, it smells like a pump: billions of liters of leaked oil have destroyed nature in the Ogoni region of Nigeria.
People feed on theft, corruption and illegal cooking of oil.
Celestine Akpobari thinks so.
"Don't worry," the environmental activist calms journalists: "Today you'll get enough oil mud in front of the lens."
A 37-year-old Nigerian was watching an attempt to photograph a boy barking across his chest with water surrounded by smudges: the scene works in a water glow with rainbow colors almost beautifully.
The fact that brown oil clots are floating beneath the surface is not visible.
Previously, she collected enough shrimp in containers here, says Esther Bad on the banks of the Bodo-Jetta River.
In the meantime, the slowly flowing water has become completely dead.
Five years ago, a huge amount of oil was poured into a huge wet area from a broken pipeline.
Fishermen from the nearby town of Bodo must paddle for at least six hours to get into the waters where there are fish: the Ogoni area, located in the heart of the Niger River Delta, is one of the worst infected areas in the world.
On the way through the river mangrove marshes with lots of side streams, the full range of the trigger is still visible.
The engine on the boat cooks brown porridge instead of light water, and whoever immerses his hand in the water pulls out the oil fingers.
The roots of mangroves stem from the ground like black bars of licorice, rarely occurring palms leave their leaves sadly hanging.
We are in vain looking for a flock of birds that are commonly found in wet areas: As soon as the engine on the boat is silent, there is a ghastly silence in the former paradise, where it smells like a pump.
"What's going on here is ecological warfare," says sadly Celestine Akpobari: "We live in constant fear of health."
The comparison with war is justified.
The Ogoni settlement area is a battlefield that has been fought for several decades: more than 60 years ago, the first conquerors from Europe came here, here in the 1980s, the first resistance was formed with the later executed writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, here the company Shell had to produce for the non-stop in 1993.
To this day, the company is not allowed to return to the Ogoni area: while the entire area of the three-size delta is exploited daily in Switzerland with more than 5,000 mining drilling and 7,000 kilometers of pipelines of more than two million barrels of black gold, the oil field in the Ogoni area is laden, for the Group the situation is not too stable.
Every few hundred meters, steel-framed water bars like bizarre statues: "Christmas trees", so too gently they are called heads of drill holes.
They're 50 years old, most of them rusty.
At any moment, such a drilling hole head breaks, says Akpobari, and then a constant stream of oil flows into the water.
Experts estimate that more than two billion liters of oil have leaked into the ecosystem in the delta in 50 years: Every year, the amount of oil leaked into the sea near Alaska during the Exxon Valdez supertanker crash 21 years ago - one of the largest environmental disasters in human history.
There is controversy as to who is responsible for the ongoing environmental disaster.
While Shell labels sabotage and organized oil theft as more than 90 percent of pollution, environmentalists say the cracking heads of wells and leaky pipes are the main cause.
Shell requires much less security regulations in Nigeria than is the world’s custom, US scientist Richard Steiner said in 2008: “Only the number of malfunctions in leadership is several times higher than elsewhere.”
In a place that looks like an abandoned, oil-soaked workshop under the open sky, they emerge from the mangroves of the figure: they are completely naked and up to the neck from the oil.
Under one of the many barrels that are partly connected by the pipeline, partly arbitrarily scattered over the ground, a fire burns: the illegal small refinery.
The oil is heated in a barrel over the fire for several hours, explains Michael, the group’s leader.
First, it leaks out of the pipeline into the catching pot of gasoline, later drops at the end of the kerosene pipeline, and finally the oil.
In this way, Michael and his four associates produce up to four barrels of 300 litres a day: “We’ll make 34,000 Naira” – about $22.
Delta residents are exploiting a chronic fuel shortage in the largest oil-rich state in Black Africa.
Nigeria owns only one refinery.
The ridiculously low price of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>40 per litre of diesel can still be passed on by illegal producers: because they have free raw materials.
It comes from the "bunkers" that connect to the pipelines everywhere in the Ogoni region: according to experts, the country loses at least 16 million liters of oil per day in the entire area of the Niger River Delta.
But only a negligible fraction of the provisionally stored raw material is illegally refined: the largest proportion will be filled by organized criminal networks, which include politicians and senior military officials, into tankers and sell it on the world market.
The debate over whether the disaster was caused by residents and their interventions or a lax way of production, activist Akpobari considers purely academic.
“If oil companies were not considered to be intruders, and if they were not so completely destroying the fishermen’s life, there would be no sabotage, no theft and no illegal refineries.”
In the meantime, Ogoni’s relationship with Shell is so badly damaged that only the company’s departure is considered: “Maybe other nations like the Chinese will prove to be better.”
Michael is worried.
"It's high time you disappear," says the muscle maker.
"Soldiers can come at any moment."
If a special military unit finds them, they're not in danger of imprisonment, they're in danger of a painful bribe.
Also soldiers, who mostly come from the north of the country - like all Nigerians - want to profit from the raw materials.
"The then-cursed thing has taken our country to the bottom in all respects," Akpobari says.
Investigators have discovered a dangerous structural defect in the A380 engines
The A380 obviously has a major safety flaw.
Investigators found a possible structural error during the inspection of the emergency landing machine, which could lead to a "catastrophic engine failure".
Qantas has filed a lawsuit against the engine manufacturer.
Qantas passengers were apparently more fortunate in an emergency landing in early November than previously known: the Australian Aviation Safety Authority found a major safety flaw in the engines of some A380 aircraft in its investigations - and now warns of a possible construction error.
Perhaps the fault would have serious consequences: cracks due to wear and tear could occur on one oil connection, the ATSB said in a statement published on Thursday.
This could lead to a "catastrophic engine failure".
These are engines manufactured by Rolls-Royce in 20 aircraft of the A380 series.
Among them is the Qantas Airbus, which had to make an emergency landing in Singapore on November 4.
The Australian airline has now taken legal action against the British turbine manufacturer.
She has filed a reasoning complaint with the Australian Federal Court in Sydney, which allows further legal action against this company.
Qantas CEO Alan Joyce said his company would seek compensation for the incident in early November.
During the engine fire, parts loosened and damaged the support surfaces.
Rolls-Royce said it was burning oil.
After this event, up to 40 engines must be replaced worldwide.
Australian investigators have announced that they will conduct further safety tests with giant aircraft equipped with the engines involved.
The safety recommendation is the result of cooperation with Rolls-Royce, said ATSB spokesman Martin Dolan.
The lack of security was considered important enough for all concerned to be informed.
After an emergency landing of the Qantas aircraft, the airline left its A380 fleet on the ground for several weeks.
Singapore Airlines has left three of its eleven A380s temporarily on the ground.
Lufthansa has replaced the A380 engine as a safety measure.
The two-story aircraft is the largest passenger aircraft in the world.
National snowfall creates chaos in the transport sector
Germany all in white: it snowed almost all over the country overnight.
There is chaos on many roads, trains and airplanes are interrupted.
At least three people died in traffic accidents.
Winter freezes Germany: Almost the entire republic fell into the snow at freezing temperatures on Thursday night - leading to traffic chaos in many places.
In the north and east, there is up to 15 centimeters of snow in some places.
Transportation is severely restricted on several motorways and many roads.
On the A7 near Flensburg, the road service was still in operation, but could not cope with the newly rolled snow.
There was also a strong wind over the Baltic Sea.
The Federal Office for Navigation and Hydrography (BSH) awaits a stormy flood with a water level of 1.2 meters above normal on the Baltic Sea coast in Schleswig-Holstein this morning.
The snowstorms have caused considerable problems on highways and state roads in Saxony.
According to bad weather headquarters Meteomedia, therefore, in Saxony Switzerland, the level of alarm on violets was the highest level at all.
Partly there was 30 centimeters of new snow, strong and fresh winds caused windstorms.
There were several trucks and passenger cars left over there at night.
Also in Saxony-Anhalt, police authorities have reported major problems on the roads.
On A2, wind and snow caused slow traffic and congestion.
There was snow on the A4 and A9.
According to the German Railway, there are major problems in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and northern Bavaria.
The main problems are snow on the tracks, rolled trees on the tracks or broken top lines and bends.
In Saxony, long-distance traffic from Leipzig to Nuremberg had to be stopped.
One ICE had to stop at Saalfeld in Durr<0xC3><0xAB>s.
165 passengers were given woolen blankets, food and drinks by firefighters and rescuers on the train.
The snow wind rolled across the road.
Many flights have been cancelled at major German airports because of the snowy winds.
According to a spokesperson, the flight information centers have already reported cancelled flights from Munich.
Frankfurt nach Mohanem has been cancelled for 40 years, according to Fraport’s spokesman.
The maintenance of the roads is in continuous operation.
Although few passengers remain unaccompanied at the airport, 400 field beds are ready for them.
There were accidents on many roads on Wednesday evening.
A truck driver was killed in a train collision at a railway crossing in eastern Holstein.
The driver was slightly injured.
A similar accident occurred near Nuremberg due to the snow-capped road: a truck was also caught on the railroad crossing because the vehicle was stuck.
The driver's dead.
Four passengers were injured on the train, leaving the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg closed until morning.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died after turning around on a slippery road near Aschaffenburg with her car.
However, meteorologists have good news: the snow will remain in the form of light drought, and therefore it will rise even in light winds.
But the wind will fade.
Only by the Baltic Sea will there be rapid winds with the strength of the winds.
But it will be a big winter - locally up to minus 15 degrees.
Deutsche Bank seeks buyer for twin towers
Deutsche Bank wants to say goodbye to its sign: according to one newspaper post, the bank is looking for a buyer for two towers with offices at its headquarters in Frankfurt.
The property could be worth up to 500 million euros.
Deutsche Bank has just renovated its headquarters: the twin towers in Frankfurt’s banking district have been modernized; in the meantime, the bankers have been allowed back to their old jobs.
But now the financial group apparently wants the renovation costs back - and is looking for a buyer for both skyscrapers, the Financial Times Deutschland reports, referring to the spokesman.
The speaker did not specify the reasons for the planned sale.
"We are still exploring whether it makes more sense to own or sell a property and then rent it again," he said.
With this, the largest credit institution in Germany is once again giving up its corporate headquarters after a short period of time.
The bank did not take over the twin towers until mid-2007 for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>272 million from its own fund investors and subsequently renovated them costly.
The energy conversion swallowed up about 200 million euros, according to data.
The sale would probably bring a lot of money to the bank.
Experts in the field estimate the value of the towers renamed "Greentowers" in the meantime at a price of around 500 million euros, according to the newspaper text.
The spokesman said it was unclear whether the building would be sold back to the fund or to an independent investor.
Thousands mourn for dead miners
More than 10,000 people honored the memorial of overflowing miners in New Zealand who were declared dead after several explosions in the mine.
We still haven't been able to rescue the dead, because the security situation in the shaft is still complicated.
Almost two weeks ago, there was a massive explosion at the Pike River Mine near the town of Greymouth.
29 miners between the ages of 17 and 62 were rolled up in the mine.
The probe was launched into the shaft, where the accident occurred, but it did not reveal any trace of life.
Due to high concentrations of toxic gases and subsequent explosions, rescue forces could not descend for safety reasons.
After the second strong detonation, authorities and experts assumed that the miners no longer had any chance of survival.
He was still unable to rescue the dead.
Now they honored the memory of the dead relatives and friends.
Ten thousand people gathered in Greymouth, the southern island of New Zealand, for sunny weather.
They were silent for two minutes.
29 tables, helmets, lamps and the names of the miners were erected to honor the monument of the overgrown miners.
Also pictures and personal items such as clothes and surfboards found their place here.
On state government buildings, flags floated on half-heaps.
New Zealand hoped that miners would come back to the surface from “the depths of the earth,” New Zealand Prime Minister John Key told attendees at the memorial event.
"But they never came home."
"He can't say goodbye to his son until he sees his corpse," said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was swept up in the mine.
In addition to the Prime Minister and relatives of the victims, several foreign diplomats also participated in the memorial event.
British and South African miners were also involved in the explosion on 19 November.
Rescuers started by extinguishing a fire inside a coal mine on the southern island of New Zealand.
Once the toxic gases are dissolved, it will begin to cool the high temperatures inside the mine, police President Gary Knowles told reporters.
To hell with you, warriors!
Is horror suitable for an art cinema?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn tries to cross the old boundaries again with his combat epic "Walhalla Rising".
What kind of audience did Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn think of when filming Walhalla Rising?
A captured Viking one-eyed warrior (Mads Mikkelsen) frees himself from his torturers and kills his opponents with almost supernatural force - it sounds ideal for young male spectators who are looking for bloody actions, because our hero does not help his heroes through cruel methods.
On the other hand, One Eye, as it is actually called, will not say a word throughout the film, and the other characters will say at most one or two sentences or let themselves be dragged down to painful dying screams.
Otherwise, it is silent and roaring in the terribly beautiful hilly landscape of Scotland, which offers a backdrop to the world of the Vikings about a thousand years ago.
The film is ideal for adult cinema enthusiasts with an interest in existentialism and very quiet camera footage.
It’s good when the film has more target groups, it’s just a pity when they exclude each other.
Director Winding Refn, after filming his wild and stylized trilogy of drug dealers "Pusher", is considered a Danish version of director Quentin Tarantino, but stoically resists to bring his works closer to the mainstream with either humor or less brutality.
Most of the fans of art cinema seem to be dissuaded by the spraying brains and guts everywhere.
The fans of the action movies will no later than the moment when the One-Eyed One embarks for freely explainable reasons with a group of violent Christian missionaries ships to Jerusalem and remains hanging for eternity in the windless and fog before apparently adding the team to America and there.
It is therefore not surprising that in Germany "Wallalla Rising" did not get to the cinema and now it was released only on DVD.
It’s a pity mainly because of the beautiful shots, but also because behind the special facade, places up to the broken blood, hides an exciting cinema that deserved some attention.
This film is not about dialogues or an exact story, everything is an atmosphere, a feverish dream that has become a film.
And that's not an escape for the viewer.
Refn does not give him a moment of relaxation and slowly chokes him with his frosty shots and bleak hypnotic soundtrack, but above all the indescribable hatred that flows from the hearts of the characters.
Only a little blonde boy who helps One-eyed keeps something like innocence, everyone else is driven by anger.
Of all, the most one-eyed hero whose motives will never be explained, who becomes a time for enemies and transitional allies a warrior from hell, perhaps an envoy of the devil.
It is a form of destruction, but perhaps only for the corrupt.
Walhalla Rising is a mysterious film that can be hated and admired, for anger, excitement and admiration.
An experience.
Mysterious Earthworks
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has issued a new warning about a secret nuclear program in Syria.
But the country refuses to express itself - and will not allow controls.
Around midnight on September 5-6, 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 fighter jets attacked a mysterious square building in Syria.
It stands on the banks of the Euphrates; the nearest major city is 30 kilometers away and is called Dair as-Saur.
Its name appears in documents from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) when it comes to a reactor that was allegedly built by Syria with the help of North Korea in this square hidden in a valley that turns away from the current.
According to a report by the US foreign secret service CIA in late April 2008, the reactor, also known as the nearby village of el-Kibar, would be well suited for the production of plutonium - from which nuclear weapons can be built.
The technology of the 1950s is no different.
The CIA presented a video with unfocused satellite images.
Using computer animation, she clarified where the reactor components could have been before the destruction, which is supposed to be a reduced copy of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear center.
In addition, there were also submitted photos that showed the building close up or even from the inside.
The reactor was shortly before launch, but still without fuel cells.
Today, after more than three years after the bombing, we do not know much more than at the time, even the puzzles have grown even larger over time.
Former U.S. President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that before the attack, the CIA was pretty sure that Syria was building an al-Kibar reactor, but had virtually no evidence that there was an “active nuclear weapons program” in the country.
Some intelligence agencies in Europe are even more cautious and speak only of an “alleged reactor” even though they consider the CIA’s presentation to be “true.”
They lack clear evidence, as does the IAEA.
Asked how sure he was of the reactor, a senior U.N. diplomat said in the summer that the IAEA had “enough material to ask questions”.
The suzerainty of the allegedly "unused military buildings" was quickly cleared by the Syrians and the terrain was also properly aligned.
However, in June 2008, an IAEA team led by former Chief Inspector Olli Heinonen in al-Kibar managed to find traces of human-made uranium.
In addition, the IAEA received satellite photographs of commercial vendors through a member state just after the attack, which should be more accurate than those presented by the CIA.
Unfortunately, these shots are not on the market, because they are exclusively purchased by an unknown customer - perhaps Israel.
Therefore, the IAEA cannot confirm their authenticity.
Syria has always claimed that it has never had a secret nuclear program or built a reactor.
Uranium comes from Israeli weapons, Damascus said.
But this was refuted by the IAEA after the analysis of particles.
Since then, Damascus has refused to discuss the matter - as well as satellite footage.
In addition, he forbade the auditors a second inspection in el-Kibar and access to the debris of the bombed building.
Israel is silent as well.
"We will never comment on this," Ehud Olmert, Prime Minister at the time, said in a statement.
The investigation has been going on since June 2008 and is “growing into a serious problem in view of the credibility of the agency,” as a senior Western diplomat at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna admitted – a serious breach of the nuclear-weapon-ban treaty that the IAEA is pursuing.
The IAEA considers three more facilities to be “functional” with the alleged reactor — and unlike it, they still exist.
The auditors have not yet indicated which devices they are, what their function is or why they are suspected.
According to the Süddeutsche Zeitung, the IAEA internally refers to it as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, derived again by nearby cities.
The Independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (ISIS) identified these objects and found on satellite images a complex of buildings, which is probably one of the suspected objects.
Apparently, it is located inside or in the immediate vicinity of a military base - precisely for this reason, Syria is refusing access to these three sites by the IAEA.
In Vienna, it was reported that the Syrians were afraid of the so-called fishing expedition – that the IAEA would be sent in advance to the US to locate military bases.
Nuclear detectives have been alerted to the device by the U.S. Secret Service.
The IAEA has records, as well as satellite images, that material was being transported here and there between these three places and the Euphrates Square.
In Vienna, a senior Western diplomat said at least one of the facilities should be "in connection with fuel production".
However, there is "no evidence of sensitive activities", i.e. uranium enrichment and new processing; processes that are necessary for the production of nuclear weapons.
The reactor type is powered by unenriched uranium.
But where the uranium came from and where plutonium would later be detonated on a bomb, there are only probable estimates of these central questions.
It is also not known whether debris that could hide important traces is stored in these three places.
As if hundreds of freight trucks had disappeared from the surface of the earth, no one seems to have any information as to where that sucker got.
Just a few kilometers from al-Kibar and on the other side of the Euphrates, the al-Tibni salt mine, which had Syria inspected in 1998 as a suitable depot for radioactive waste, is considered unlikely by the IAEA.
Former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley put it in contact with the reactor in one satellite image analysis for the renowned Jane's Intelligence Review magazine.
Images from space, however, show that after the IAEA requested access, Syria carried out all suspicious groundwork and removed large containers.
It could have been a coincidence, but it didn't help clarify the suspicion.
In addition, diplomatic circles say the IAEA has spent many months drafting a plan for auditors that would allow Syria to keep any military secrets — only that effort shows how much interest the auditors have.
Damascus, meanwhile, also rejected the proposal.
If even a year ago Western diplomats in Vienna reassured that the reactor was destroyed and therefore the thing was not burning, for several months now US Ambassador Glyn Davies has been talking about so-called special inspections, which is one of the toughest means the Vienna nuclear control authority has to enforce.
The head of the IAEA, Yukiya Amano, who would have to propose inspections, although he has already talked about "the options I am looking forward to in the future", but is hesitant so far.
This choice poses a great risk: on the one hand, it requires a majority on the IAEA Governing Council, and many of the 35 countries represented have no interest in escalating.
On the other hand, as one diplomat points out, “What happens if they don’t find anything?”
Love in Time of War
Since Angelina Jolie started working on the still unnamed directorial firsts in the summer, problems have arisen.
She wrote the script herself, it is a love story of a woman from Bosnia and a man from Serbia.
Much more is not known yet - but it also causes restlessness.
It is said that the woman, who is a Muslim, falls in love with a Serbian man who raped her during the war in Yugoslavia.
The Bosnian women's unions immediately protested, so the planned shooting from Sarajevo to Hungary quickly moved.
In the meantime, the film has been filmed in Hungary and is in post-production, but it is still being protested in Bosensk.
Bakira Hasecic of the Organization of Women War Victims wrote through the UN-organization to help refugees UNHCR Jolie and called for a meeting with the actress, the Bosnian newspaper reported now - Jolie is also the UN-organization ambassador to help refugees.
She is not exactly diplomatic - she offered women a meeting weeks ago in Hungary, but they refused.
The meeting must take place in Bosnia, Hasecic said.
In the camps where rape took place, love stories did not take place, and Jolie's attitude towards the victims reveals enough about the script.
Her organization therefore recommended that the UN aid organization for refugees release Jolie as an ambassador, the Guardian reported.
What scenes did Jolie write?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which had her script read out, allowed the filming after a small hiatus in Sarajevo - it is not entirely clear why Jolie did not come.
The young author emphasizes that she does not follow any political intentions in her film, that she has devoted great effort to the conflict in Yugoslavia, that she wants to show the terrible consequences of the war and give room to all parties involved.
Due to the content, it remains unclear.
There is another version of the film on the Internet that sounds really different: lovers knew each other before the war began and they will meet again when she, like a Bosnian Muslim, is dragged into a Serbian camp where he serves as a guard.
Which really sounds quite different than "the rape victim falls in love with his torturer."
The fact that Jolie really starts before the war - is true.
Jolie argues that pressure is being exerted on her, which “is not fair and is based on misinformation.”
Now the hackers from Hollywood can free her: by illegally publishing her script on the Internet, as they have done many times.
Nothing but gone.
It's good for the Irish again tonight.
Not a trace of sadness.
The home team dominates the power over its guests from Sweden, Finland and the USA.
Fans shout joy at the sound of loud music, with ass feet.
Bailey-Pub in South Yorkshire Cork is boiling as players throw tennis balls over a distance of three meters into beer mugs – and they hit each other.
"Beer pong" is called the bizarre theater and it is possible to win 500 euros as a winning prize and in addition tickets to Las Vegas at the World Beer Pong Championships in January.
Cian Tanner is a calm guy; this screaming beer game and a restrained informatician, it doesn't fit very well together.
Yet a 26-year-old man tries to have fun, to distract himself from the difficult question of what the future will bring.
His plan is not to play passion in Las Vegas, he is going for an interview in January in New Zealand.
"It makes me feel so weird," he says.
"It's so far away and I don't have a job there yet."
Still: His girlfriend is already waiting for him in Auckland - "immediately got her dream job as Eventmanager, maybe it's a good sign," says the young man and smiles.
Because of the bad prospects at home, two of Tanner’s three siblings have tried their luck abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin now has a position as an IT consultant in London.
The boys leave: As with the Tanners, it looks like in many families on the island.
100,000 Irish will leave the country in the near future, according to experts from ESRI’s Science Institute for Economic and Social Affairs in Dublin.
By 2015, there will be 200,000 immigrants.
For such a small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants, this is a significant loss.
If the predictions are confirmed, there will be a similar wave of emigration to that experienced by Ireland in the 1980s.
After a decade of upswing that brought great prosperity to the Irish, discontent is now spreading again.
The economic crisis is especially devastating to young, educated Irish, who have so far experienced only a rise.
The loss of jobs and social decline seemed absurd in these boom years.
Everyone was in need, the money was over.
Meanwhile, three out of ten women and men under the age of 30 are out of work.
In the Irish Times, there are many letters from readers complaining: "In Ireland, everything comes from the hill."
“There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers – but whoever can, they’re going away and our country is losing an entire generation.”
"Please let the last one go out."
Law student Leanne Caulfield, the president of the Irish Students' Union, sees the future as black because the government is said to be lying and offering young people no prospects for the future.
“They are cutting the minimum wage, but they have no strategy to create new jobs,” says the 20-year-old.
She observes her classmates wandering from one unpaid practice to another.
Her biggest concern is that she will have to move out on her own in four years.
"This idea is sad and depressing."
Men like Stephen McLarnon try to see the subject positively.
McLarnon organizes "WorkingAbroadExpo", an exhibition that offers a comprehensive service on the topic of work abroad.
"For beginners in the job market, working abroad is an excellent opportunity to take the first steps to the career ladder," says the manager.
On his website there are photos of surfers in Australia and skiers on a snowboard in Canada.
The message is clear: to work abroad is not galleries, but freedom and joy.
Sean O'Donovan has known about what it's like to build something somewhere else for six months.
Because the 29-year-old engineer had no jobs in Ireland, he is now employed with 15 Irish colleagues on construction in Germany.
He's building a fashion house in Gelsenkirchen.
In January, he will continue to Hanover or Berlin for another project.
In the meantime, O’Donovan rarely gets home because he works in extra shifts so he can repay the home loan.
"The situation is sometimes really a little crazy," he says, when for the first time in a long time he crosses the threshold of his own house.
“I’m making money in Germany for a house in Ireland where I’m not at all.”
He laughs in disgrace and walks in cool rooms.
A small house stands in a good neighborhood with maintained gardens, in the entrances there are large expensive cars parked.
O'Donovan bought the house with his sister four years ago for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>380,000 - 100 percent financed by a loan.
"It was a crazy time, simple money was without a lot of questions," he says.
Is he worried it might not work out well with the loan?
O’Donovan thinks for a moment, pours out the hot tea and says, “I don’t have children to feed and I’m young; even if everything goes wrong, I can start over.”
A construction engineer doesn't like the cries he hears so often now.
"No one needs to starve - our situation is not as dramatic as it was before on this island," he says.
“Working abroad for a while, it’s not the worst thing that can happen – maybe then we’ll just feel like Irish.”
He laughs and then tells about his father, who left England during the last economic crisis.
"After seven years he was back and life went on in Ireland, quite simply."
Cian Tanner likes this idea.
Keep an open future and just wait for life to unfold elsewhere.
He has also been working in London for several years and why shouldn’t it be good for him and his girlfriend in New Zealand as well?
But there's one more thing that worries him these days: he's celebrating his 27th birthday in Dublin on Friday.
She's afraid she might turn up for a farewell party.
"Mostly no emotion," he says and drinks a lot of beer.
"Goodbye, that sounds worrying."
"Well, let's call it a party, quite simply, with a few friends, a few drinks, a few games."
The Common Practice of Democracy
The support for democracy in Latin America is growing, as is the support for private entrepreneurship.
Criminal activity is more worrying than unemployment.
And Brazil considers many regions to be more influential than the United States.
These are some of the results of a recent Latinobarómetro survey conducted in 18 countries and published exclusively in The Economist.
Since the survey has been conducted regularly since 1995, it can monitor changes in attitudes across the region.
This year’s survey, which took place in September and early October, dominates two related issues.
The first is that Latin America has a pretty cheerful mood.
The second is to increase the stability of attitudes towards democracy and its key institutions.
Support for democracy in several countries on the Pacific coast of South America has increased significantly (see Table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has averaged 6% per year since 2002, support for democracy has increased from a minimum of 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
It also grew in Mexico, where the economy recovered after a deep decline in production last year.
But only about half of those surveyed in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous regions, are Democrats in their beliefs, bringing down the regional average (see Chart 2).
Around 44% of respondents across the region expressed satisfaction with how democracy works in practice in their country, the same number as last year, but compared to 2001, when it was 25%, this is a large increase (Figure 3).
Around 34% said they trust the House in their country and 45% trust the government, again the same numbers as last year, but this is a big difference compared to 2003 (17% and 24%).
Ten years ago, the economic crisis in Latin America undermined democracy.
Support emerged during the global financial crisis probably because many Latin American countries suffered only a short recession and enjoyed a strong recovery.
In addition, a stronger social security network has helped protect the poor.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty rose only slightly in 2009 and dropped again to 32% this year.)
However, the mood varies in a wide range from country to country (see Figure 4).
Brazil’s strong economic performance and the popularity of its resigning president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, are reflected in a widely accepted sense of progress.
This situation is rarer in Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more severe and the state of violent crime worsened.
For the second time since surveys began, more respondents across Latin America see crime as the most important problem rather than unemployment (see Chart 5).
Approximately 31% say either themselves or their close relatives became victims of crime last year, but that’s a drop from the 38% figure from last year and is also the lowest since 1995.
Massive economic performance is reflected in growing support for private entrepreneurship and the market economy: approximately 71% of respondents across the region say private entrepreneurship is essential for development, up from 56% in 2007 (see Chart 6).
About 58% agree that the market economy is the only system that will allow their country to develop, this percentage has risen from 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela have the same opinion (and 80% there support private business), although their leftist president Hugo Chávez expropriates many private companies.
Brazil is the country that has a leading position in the area, as mentioned by 19% of respondents (compared to 18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, compared to last year unchanged) and Venezuela (9%, compared to 11% last year)
However, the United States is considered the most influential respondent country in Mexico and much of Central America, with Venezuela enjoying success in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
Criticized Elections
No one expected the general election in Haiti on November 28 to be perfect.
But they were much worse than outsiders trying to help the affected country to be afraid.
Elections meant polling ballots and repeated voting, ballots scattered across channels, broken polling rooms, and intimidation.
The polling station is open after hours of delay.
Many Haitians, including many displaced by the January earthquake, roamed around trying to figure out where to go to vote.
Some of them eventually gave up.
More than a dozen presidential candidates, including several presumed forerunners, shouted that it was a fraud and called for the election to be cancelled.
Protests, some of them of a violent nature, spread throughout the country.
However, Edmond Mulet, a senior UN official in Haiti, said "it was a pretty good choice in many ways."
Observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community cautiously said they “do not believe that these irregularities, however serious, did not necessarily have to cancel the process.”
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral body, whose opposition votes are due to René Préval, the unpopular resigning president and his candidate Jude Célestin, is to announce the preliminary results on 7 December.
The expected decisive battle is scheduled for January.
All election hopes are not lost.
Two leading opposition candidates, Michel Martelly, a rapper and Mirlande Manigat, a former first lady, have stepped down from their original call to invalidate the vote.
But the problem may arise if Mr Celestin, who has little or negligible support among voters, is labeled by the electoral commission as having achieved a decisive battle.
Due to the ongoing cholera epidemic and the more than 1 million people still living in tents after the earthquake, there were fears that voter turnout would be low.
In the end, many Haitians wanted to vote, but because of disorganization, they were prevented from doing so.
Approximately 250,000 identity cards, which are necessary for voting, remained undistributed shortly before the elections.
There's a lot at stake.
Donors see the choice of a legitimate and popular government as a crucial step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And it is clear that the Haitians are going to do it themselves.
At the top of the center
In the weeks of her sudden widowhood, Argentine President Cristina Fernández is benefiting from public sympathy, when her popularity has increased from 20 to more than 50%, the highest level since she was elected in 2007.
Yet turning this success into a successful campaign for a second term in next year’s election may depend on the grieving Ms. Fernández giving up the uncompromising nature of her late husband, predecessor and political partner Néstor Kirchner.
And on these signs everything will be based.
Mr. Kirchner, who continued to pursue economic policy even after his wife successfully became president, was in the habit of making budgets that underestimated tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the first couple to spend additional income at will.
Mrs Fernández’s government lost a majority in Congress last year.
But the opposition split and was further destabilized by Mr. Kirchner's death from a heart attack on October 27.
Some members of the ruling Peronist political movement joined Ms. Fernández.
But after chaotic sessions (which involved facing and blaming the government for corruption), Congress failed to approve the 2011 budget.
"I'm not going to argue," the president said.
The 2010 budget will now also apply to the next year, with the president having more space to spend at will.
The economy is overheating: growth is likely to be up to 9% this year.
The official rate of inflation now reaches 11.1%, but many private estimates and unions speak of a figure approaching 30%.
Mr. Kirchner, who took office in 2003, when Argentina was suffering from economic collapse, prioritized growth and poverty reduction rather than controlling inflation.
He refused to negotiate with the IMF, burdened the private sector, and cleared INDEC, a statistical agency that has agreed to monitor official inflation statistics.
Can President Fernández now mitigate this policy?
It called for negotiations between private companies and trade union leaders.
And its officials say they want to limit wage growth to 18% next year.
The economy was supported by the rise in world prices for exports of Argentine agricultural products.
But inflation was disrupted by growth based on a major devaluation in 2002.
This may be the reason why President Fernández announces that she wants to restore Argentina’s financial ties to the rest of the world.
Earlier this year, the government signed an agreement with bondholders who had previously refused to restructure the debt that Argentina failed to pay in 2001.
President Fernández is now facing a deal with creditor governments, which are grouped in the Paris club, to which she owes about $6.7 billion.
Kirchners has always insisted that this fact is not under the IMF’s control, as is customary.
But last month Amado Boudou, the economy minister, announced that the fund will provide “technical assistance” to design a new national consumer price index that will be reminiscent of the introduction to the INDEC cleanup.
It is not yet clear whether President Fernández will want to remain in politics after the end of her term of office, when her husband is no longer on her side.
If he wants to stay, he needs to get the support of a middle class who is tired of kirchnerism.
At the time of the return of the Argentines from their summer vacation in March, the wave of sympathy will fall.
If she wants to win another election, she will have to decide whether it will not be necessary to quietly renounce the many opinions that her husband has held in politics.
Half an incentive for China
Taiwanese voters are closer to the mainland.
What does Taiwan think of its big brother across the sea?
More than 7.5 million voters, 70% of them eligible, voted for mayors and city councils in five counties on November 27, which can be considered a broader assessment of President Ma Ying-jeou.
President Ma himself is a representative of the sentiments that prevail to the land and have a strong foothold in business relations, including the partial free trade agreement, in the largest alignment of relations with China since 1949.
Mr. President passed Ma's test, but only tightly.
Although his Kuomintang party (KMT) ended up winning three out of five mayoral offices, it was unable to win by a majority of votes.
In addition, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which is in favour of greater independence of Taiwan, won nearly 50% of all votes against 45% of the KMT party.
If it were a presidential election, then President Ma would be in trouble.
Since he was elected two years ago, his party’s share of votes has fallen by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP party was in city councils together with the KMT.
The elections took place like most of the Taiwanese elections, which included noisy election trucks and mass gatherings with flags of sparsely dressed girls.
There was even a compulsory mysterious attempted assassination.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chan, honorary chairman of KMT, was agitating for KMT candidates on the eve of the election.
The man in the crowd shot young Mr. Lien straight over his face, wounded him and killed the spectator.
Bizarrely, it was not determined whether the soldier intended to injure Mr. Lien or settle a dispute with the candidate.
In any case, Tsai Ing-wen, head of the DPP, claims that the shooting influenced the election, suspicion falls on the DPP and leads voters towards the KMT.
Perhaps the only big winner of the campaign was China.
It was remarkable how the question of the land itself remained in the background.
Instead, the candidates discussed plans for state housing construction and job creation.
Taiwan usually enjoys its de facto independence and hates China’s military threats.
KMT tends to avoid ties to the government in Beijing.
But this time, the DPP has also refrained from arousing anti-Chinese attitudes.
It is a response to the fact and the realization that Chinese trade is essential to Taiwan’s economic survival.
President Ma, for his part, confirmed that China’s policy is acceptable to most of Taiwan.
The government in Beijing is expected to continue commercial bribery, along with its strategy to lure Taiwan back into the herd.
China did not waste time sending a negotiator to Taipei to host a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
Of course, they would also like to see political integration, but in order.
It will be better to wait until after the 2012 presidential election.
In any case, the DPP party has discovered itself.
Two years ago, she was at the wrong level: her former leader, Chen Shui-bian, was sent to prison on corruption charges.
The president in 2000-08 was a stormtrooper and advocate of clear independence.
But under the leadership of Ms. Tsai, a new generation has evolved, which is moderate and the DPP is working hard to attract experts and young people.
Ms. Tsai was nominated as a DPP candidate for president, such as Su Tseng-changem, who held office under Mr. Chen.
Their party is now doing everything to show that they can also cooperate with Beijing.
Ms. Tsai has published plans for research institutes that serve as a contact point between the DPP and China, provided that their negotiations can take place without preconditions.
Ms. Tsai told the Taiwanese public that her party represented a "trustworthy alternative" to Mr. Ma's unbridled approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems to be angry at this shift.
In a statement issued from his cell, he said that the DPP candidates would do better if they insisted that Taiwan is a separate country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, a pragmatist, not to run for president.
But even without Mr Chen’s intervention, the DPP will fight for a choice among potential candidates.
KMT is entitled to search for its own people.
Mr. Ma’s assessments were poor, despite the overwhelming pace of economic growth; KMT candidates did not want to go with him in the campaign.
Its unpopularity seems to be based mainly on unemployment and the deepening gap between the rich and the poor.
A KMT spokesman says he is reorganizing his cabinet, as well as local branches.
Strongly enforced proposals to support Taiwan for friendly relations are limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese citizens see economic integration with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent publicist, "a point from which there is no return has already passed."
Grammy nomination: Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is a surprise in the category of best new artist
Speech at the request of the president and the people must legally observe.
Esperanza Spalding, a 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer chosen by President Obama to perform at the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize ceremony, is ranked as one of the Grammy Awards’ surprises this year with a nomination for Best New Artist.
Since Spalding has been a celebrated figure on the jazz scene since her album "Esperanza" was released in 2008, the nomination came a little late, but this is in line with Grammy rules, where the artist is not allowed to release more than three albums before "the public identity of the artist is established."
Her ambitious 2010 album "Chamber Music Society" certainly marked a step forward, and thanks to her carefree vocal style and agile hands with elements of pop, funk and Latin influences, we can talk about Spalding as a success, which in 2003 she recorded for Norah Jones.
Elsewhere, Grammy jurors rightly award the Vijay Iyer Trio's "Historicity" album in the instrumental album category, an exciting, refreshing ride on the album that was a hot favorite last year.
Iyer will compete against seasoned saxophonist James Moody's "Moody 4B" and keyboardist John Beasley's "Positootly."
Trombone Shorty, a New Orleans favorite and frequent guest on HBO's "Treme" has been awarded in the current jazz category, which is otherwise favored by the albums of Stanley Clarke, John McLaughlin, and Jeff Lorber.
Wild group Darcy James Argue's Secret Society with steampunk knowledge has won several well-deserved accolades in the category of large ensembles, when the chamber jazz ensemble Childs Ensemble was in competition and the still daring Dave Holland, whose live album with the octet "Pathways" has created a beautiful base of kapelu as an example.
Grammy nominations: Michael Daugherty, Steve Mackey lead in classical music category
Nominations for classical music have a wide range of musicians and composers from all over the world at the 53rd annual Grammy Awards.
The lead in the nomination is Michael Daugherty and his "Deus Ex Machina" for piano and orchestra, with five points, and Steve Mackey with his album "Dreamhouse", an eclectic orchestral work, with three points.
Among the nominees with a connection to Southern California appeared Estonian composer Arvo Pärt and his Symphony No. 4 "Los Angeles", a work that was ordered through the Los Angeles Philharmonic and debuted at the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
L.A.-based composer Avner Dorman and his Mandolin Concerto also have a chance to win an award.
Nominations in classical music are divided into 13 categories, which include orchestral, opera, choir and solo recordings.
The Classical Music Producer of the Year category has five nominees, including Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
Nominations for the classic album were given to Bruckner and his Symphony No. 3 and 4 from the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty and his "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" from the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey and his "Dreamhouse" from the Boston Modern Orchestra Project; and the "Synergy Orchestra" by the Chicago Orchestra.
As for the opera category, the nominees are Berg and "Lulu" from the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasse and "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" from Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariaho and "L'Amour de Loin" from the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin and "The Enchanted Wander" from the National Orchestra.
Composers nominated for a Grammy for contemporary songs include Pärt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina," Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatamente Plus," Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer."
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 premiered at Disney Hall in January 2009 at a performance recorded by the L.A. Philharmonic under the tune of Esa-Pekka Salonena.
It is called "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to former oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who is imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman and "Mandolin Concerto" was nominated for instrumental performance by the soloist with the orchestra.
The L.A. composer said he wrote a 15-minute work specifically for mandolin actor Avi Avital, who performed at a concert with the New York-based Metropolis Ensemble.
"I wrote it using tones from the Middle East and many North African rhythms," Dorman said in a phone conversation.
Conductor Pierre Boulez, 85, received a nomination in the category of orchestral performance, for conducting the Chicago Symphony while recording Stravinsky's works.
Instrumental soloists who received the nomination include pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; organist Paul Jacobs; violinist Julia Fischer; and harpsichordist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
Among the nominated vocal soloists this year, only women were represented, namely Anne Sofie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchon, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the classic transition category, soprano Jessie Norman won a nomination for her recording "Roots - My Life, My Song."
Planned Mosque in Temecula Receives Approval from Planning Commission
The planned mosque in Temecula received unanimous support from the local planning commission after more than five hours of often passionate public witnessing.
Critics have attacked a project that promotes terrorism and will lead to a trade suspension.
However, the jury decided on Wednesday night that the new religious center is in compliance with local laws and will be aesthetically impressive.
"Many good people have come to support this project - Christians, Jews, you will remember," Hadi Nael, president of the Islamic Center in Temecula Valley, said Thursday morning.
"I'm very proud of that as an American citizen."
"It means that justice always wins."
“The opposition is minimal,” he added.
"Those who are against only shout loudly."
"We have really great people in our valley."
Negotiations began at six o'clock in the evening and lasted almost until midnight, when most of the time was spent discussing with people who were for or against the center. These votes were evenly distributed, reports Press-Enterprise.
Discussions continued on the newspaper's website.
"America no longer exists," one comment appeared.
"We are Planet of the Apes with the Statue of Liberty falling into the sand."
"America has slipped."
The planned Islamic Centers also sparked protests in other parts of the country, including near Ground Zero, the site of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attack on New York.
In Temecula Valley, Imam Mahmoud Harmoush condemned the violence.
His religious community of approximately 135 families had lived in Riverside County for years without an incident, but he wanted more and more space than the storage space he rented along with the filtration system manufacturer.
The new 24,943-square-foot Mediterranean-style mosque will also have two minarets and will grow to a height of 43 feet.
It should occupy an area of 4.32 acres on Nicolas Road, about three kilometers east of Chaparral High School.
Opponents can still refer the project to the city council.
Microbes with arsenic resistance increase the possibility of new types of life on Earth or elsewhere
The discovery of a strange bacterium that can use arsenic as one of its nutrients expands the space for finding new forms of life on Earth and possibly beyond.
Researchers have discovered an unusual bacterium here on Earth and claim it is a sign that life has possibilities that stand beyond the main elements that have been considered and basic.
"This organism has a dual ability."
"It can grow either through phosphorus or arsenic."
“This fact is very strange, but it’s not evidence that it’s some form of truly ‘alien’ life,” said Paul C. W. Davies of Arizona State University, co-author of the report, which appeared on Thursday in an online edition of the journal Science.
For a long time, it was considered essential for life the six main elements - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur.
However, scientists have found that bacteria found in Mono Lake, California, are able to continue to grow after arsenic is replaced by phosphorus.
"You start to wonder what else is possible," said Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University, co-author of the report.
This finding is significant for the search for life beyond Earth because researchers need to be able to recognize life and know what life may look like, Anbar said.
The study focuses on microbes found on Earth.
However, a report about this novelty published to be discussed, which did not reveal the details of the finding, has sparked widespread speculation on the Internet that the report reveals the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
It's not like that.
The discovery "shows that other planetary organisms may be able to exploit other elements that drive biochemistry, and that a set of elements that we consider 'standard' may not be so absolutely necessary for life," explained Charles Cockell, professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute, Open University, in Milton Keynes, Great Britain.
Cockell wasn't part of the research team.
"This work is unusual because it shows the replacement of one element by another in basic biochemistry and biochemical structure," Cockell added.
It wasn't a coincidence.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of NASA's Astrobiology Institute, who led the study, focused on Mono Lake because it exhibits high levels of arsenic.
Arsene and phosphorus are chemically very similar elements, so she considered that a microbe that is exposed to both elements may be able to replace one by another.
"Arsenic is poisonous mainly because its chemical behavior is very similar to phosphorus."
"The result is that organisms can very hardly separate these elements from each other."
"However, arsenic is so different that it doesn't work as much as phosphorus does. When it gets into the body, it starts working in biochemical processes," Anbar explained.
Scientists collect bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and expose them to an increasing concentration of arsenic, which bacteria are able to adapt and grow.
Microbes grow better under the influence of phosphorus, but since they can also survive with arsenic substitution, the possibility that a form of life that uses arsenic may appear naturally increases, either on Earth or on another planet or moon where arsenic is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, an assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, said that the idea of arsenic being replaced by phosphorus is not new, but there was never an example to prove it.
Arsene was more common in earlier times on Earth, she said, and so scientists speculated that it could have been used by earlier life forms.
"This suggests that there could have been other ways to create life, not just the way it was created in the early Earth period," said Foster, who was not part of the Wolfe-Simon research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Ministry of Energy and the National Institutes of Health.
Remaining stolen dogs found in Compton
The remaining two of the four exhibit dogs that were stolen from the Bellflower Motel were found, Los Angeles County Sheriff reported Thursday.
Four show dogs - two akitas and a Welsh pembroke corgis - disappeared on Tuesday when someone stole a 2006 Chevrolet Express van in which they spent the night at the Bellflower 6 motel, authorities said.
Two dogs were discovered on Wednesday afternoon and the remaining two dogs later on Wednesday evening, said Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Police Department.
"The good news is that the dogs are fine," Whitmore said.
"They're in good condition."
"They were handed over to their rightful owners."
Whitmore refused to say exactly where the dogs were found, at what location, nor did he share detailed information regarding their findings.
"The investigation is still going on."
"We don't want to talk about it," Whitmore said.
"We follow the rules."
The dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, were not reached to comment on the case.
They were delighted when their two shares found themselves in a shelter in Downey on Wednesday afternoon.
Sheriff's deputies found a van and two dogs separately in Compton.
Akita Trace, a three-year-old dog named Trace and a 10-month-old female named Didi, were uninjured, authorities said.
But Bunny and Peter, the Welsh Corgi Pembroke Rickard and Peek, who planned to take part in regional competitions this week on behalf of their Japanese owners, remained undetected until their discovery late on Wednesday.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, are in town this weekend to take part in the AKC/Eukanuba National Championship at Long Beach, where they plan to show Trace.
The other dogs were to compete in other competitions scheduled in the days leading up to the AKC/Eukanuba show, Peek told The Times on Wednesday.
Southern California is just one stop on a couple’s nearly monthly dog show trip.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked into the motel.
They often sleep in motels and park their car in front of the room window.
They also took three dogs - a puppy boxer, Parson Russell terrier, and a Brittany ochre - who stayed with them in a motel room.
Akita and Pembroke Welsh corgis left in the car where it was supposed to be colder.
They opened the windows a little so that the dogs had enough fresh air in the car.
Peek and Rickard reported a car theft at 6:00 a.m. on Tuesday.
Peek said he'd offer a reward to anyone who brought them to the missing dogs, and the dogs had microchips implanted to identify them.
It was unclear on Thursday whether the awards would be given.
The lion is ready to yell again now that the restructuring of MGM is getting final approval from the court
After 18 months of turmoil and uncertainty, MGM finally got the green light to start over.
A federal insolvency judge in New York on Thursday officially blessed a “pre-packed” plan by creditors to settle about $5 billion in debt to clear the way for an 86-year-old entertainment company focused on producing and producing movies and television shows.
Thursday’s ruling that the plan meets U.S. bankruptcy requirements leaves MGM with no legal hurdles to restart Spyglass Entertainment founders Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become the lead executives of the slimming studio.
The number of employees will drop to about 320 out of the original more than 400.
MGM will not suddenly emerge from Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase agrees on the planned financial resources allowing a $500 million loan to fund new MGM operations and production.
Now it is a merger with an investment bank, which itself needs $75 million and funding is expected around mid-December.
The study’s restructuring process began in May 2009, when investment bank Moelis & Co. was hired to advise management on how to solve its finances as management struggled to afford interest payments of $300 million a year.
That August, President Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former Enron CEO and turnover expert known for his work for Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Attempts by Moelis and Cooper to solve the financial problems of MGM and the 140 creditors of the study took much longer than expected.
After several months of discussions, the parties agreed to sell the company by the end of 2009.
Although the auction attracted several bidders, none of them were willing to pay $2 billion plus the finances demanded by the creditors.
In the spring of this year, everything was back on the drawing board and the MGM team began working on the restructuring plan. After months of discussion and internal disagreements, the plan was finally approved by the creditors at the end of October.
When MGM officially stands up from bankruptcy in the coming weeks, Moelis and Cooper receive multi-million dollar bonuses for their work.
Moelis & Co., which has already received $1.2 million, will receive a payment of $9.5 million.
Cooper’s companies, who collect $375,000 a month for their services that run the company, will receive a reward for success, the so-called “success fee” of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production at MGM, which released only one film this year, and put together a proposal for seven or eight films to be released in early 2012.
They are also planning to participate in the funding of two films, the book "The Hobbit", to be produced together with Warner Bros.
The studio needs to negotiate a special loan of between $265 million and $275 million to finance its share of the two films, which will be directed by Peter Jackson.
Investor Carl Icahn, who owns approximately 18% of MGM’s debts, sought the opportunity to merge the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, in which he is the largest shareholder.
However, recent negotiations between the two companies have not resulted in an agreement.
Technological toys that will keep your gift budget in balance
This year’s leading candidate is the most amazing iPad toy, followed by the video game system. But in both cases, it is a significant intervention in the gift budget.
Suppose that for the price of one iPad, you can buy five BMX wheels for $99, and one Kinect game costs as much as 10 beads swings or about 48 Play-Doh cups.
But there is a way to keep your gift budget in balance.
I recently visited three national toy retailers – Wal-Mart, Toys “R” Us and BJ’s Wholesale Club – and watched what electronic toys I could buy for less than $80.
It was immediately clear that Moore’s law was working; this year’s tech toys have far more energy, at the same prices, if not slightly lower, than in previous years.
While there have been relatively few new toys with affiliate sites, the two most famous toys of this type, Webkinz and Club Penguin, offer more.
The number of toys with button batteries, as well as toys with rechargeable batteries, is increasing.
Here are a few recommendations.
(All prices listed are from Toys "R" Us, except as otherwise indicated.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, from 3 years old) are stuffed animals that sing when you press their belly.
At one press, the animal releases a tone, and the second press begins to create a song.
If you buy more than one, they will sing together and harmoniously.
Warning: Once you start chewing, you can’t stop.
The best choice in the combination of singing and dancing is Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price, $60, from 2 years)
Last year, I borrowed a 14-inch animated doll from Elmo Live technology, which can play Simon Says and also can walk a month thanks to its innovative folding leg with locking wheels.
Children test Mickey's dance instructor toy, although their parents complain of a lack of volume control.
If you are a child of the 80s, you may remember Alphie, one of the first computer educational toys.
He's back, (Hasbro/Playskool, $40, for children from 3 years), with a backpack full of quiz cards that are designed to turn car driving into fun with a self-correcting, funny workbook.
If you are looking for a smartphone for your child, here are three independent alternatives.
VTech's MobiGo ($60, for children from 3 to 8 years) is the cheapest easy-to-use version, with a qwerty keyboard, although games don't have as effective tutorials as Leapster Explorer ($70, for children from 3 to 12 years), the first significant change in the Leapster range from Leapfrog, with a more recent one.
No version is compatible with older units.
iXL by Fisher-Price ($90, for children 3 to 7 years) uses iTunes-like system to introduce games and e-books and has an SD card slot that allows you to view family photos.
And finally, Scrabble Flash ($30, Hasbro, for children from 8 years) is a set of five cubes that are not larger than a box of matches, each of which has an LED display.
The goal is to create words by placing cubes in a row before time runs out; it’s great for competing in improvised wordmaking.
More and more toys have at least some kind of online connection.
Two Webkinz and Club Penguin toys were represented at the highest level in the toy stores.
If you want to buy your child an online toy from Club Penguin, you can choose, for example, Disney Club Penguin 2" Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, $5, for children from 6 to 12 years), which contains a coin with a hidden code.
When you activate the code online, your child will receive enough credits in the Club Penguin store for any two items.
This could include, for example, roller skates or an animal Puffle.
A little bigger than your toothbrush’s brush is the Hexbug Nano (10$, for children over 5 years), the latest in a series of button-battery microrobots.
The beetle moves quickly on 12 vibrating silicone legs in random direction.
It's fun when you make a maze out of cubes and watch if he manages to find a way out.
It is also very durable.
Ours was able to fall off the kitchen table and even spend some time in the mouth of our dog.
Implementation of more subtle police controls in China
As a city military instructor, Tang Shenbin walked around the square, strictly controlling his orders and issuing orders half-voiced with military authority.
He wanted female members – Chinese powerful urban enforcers, feared and despised for their harsh actions and their love of violence – to convey a certain impression of the deafness of those around them.
"Stand up straight!"
"Hurry up!"
Show them, whispering quietly, "how pretty girls look!"
Four very young girls in white gloves and the same olive coats and pants came to the attention.
Four pairs of black shoes are sorted as per rule.
The four headgears fit perfectly on the hair, which are perfectly tied with blue and white ribbons.
"Personally, I think they look average," Mr. Tang said bluntly.
"The models are nice."
More than one government has attempted to revive the image of city overseers in China.
One city ordered that new brewers have a university education.
The province of Guangdong has changed gray-green uniforms to purportedly more attractive blue.
Wuhan in central China replaced blunt glances with strong armaments: In 2009, a report said that 50 officers surrounded the truck with snacks and stared at the owner firmly until the home salesman packed up and left after half an hour.
Xindu, a city district with 680,000 inhabitants in Chengdu, chose surgery as the main picture.
Since 2003, the district has supplemented its city police with 13 women, who were selected specifically according to their appearance, symmetry and youth.
The aim is to show not only the rough side of the police but also the softer, feminine side.
Unfortunately, Scarlett Johansson herself would have trouble getting into secret Chinese city groups.
Critics would argue for good reason.
Unlike the police, these police officers are only allowed to enforce a city decree, impose fines and other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese media are usually capturing a different reality.
In January 2008, police inspectors from Hubei Province beat an unattended spectator to death after he used his cell phone to film how they began their action in protesting against the landfill.
Last year, a training of police officers was held in Beijing, a manual for this training was stolen and placed on the Internet. The manual included, among other things, a description of how to effectively beat the perpetrator without blood marks.
This year, a melon dealer in Shanghai got into a fight with five police officers and suffered an injury to the left part of his brain.
A video game full of violence, which can be downloaded online, shows Chinese police officers attacking street vendors.
"Chengguan frightened the government," China Daily, the national edition, lamented last year after another discussion about tactics.
On the paper was "really thorough cleaning."
Skeptics say this approach is not enough.
After the county advertised an interest in eight new female police officers in October, The Beijing Evening News looked at the question of whether women have real responsibilities or are just distractions.
The answer seems to be a bit of both.
The district demanded female candidates aged 18 to 22 with a good figure and "five facial features in the right proportion."
Adepts should have a height higher than their average - that is, more than 1.6 meters.
Service at age 26 is compulsory.
Officials say work is mentally overwhelming for women over the age of 25.
“Their image is an important thing,” one unnamed police officer said on Rednet.com, as if on a government website.
"Candidates must first demonstrate external qualities, which then determine others, including height, weight, facial features, etc."
Then comes a series of nature and "internal qualities".
Women are like flower vases, he said, adding, "Besides being vases, they will also have other responsibilities."
Zheng Lihua, deputy director of the district city administration, does not agree much with this description.
But he pointed out that demands for height are also common in China for other jobs, both sexes.
As well as the requirement for symmetrical facial features.
Which means that the issue of good looks is the subject of discussion among the Chinese.
Health disability or mutilation will certainly not apply.
"He can't allow a lame or a backyard man to serve here," Mr. Zheng said.
"His image would not be good."
Liu Yi, who guards Baoguang Square near the monastery, is 22 years old, faces like apples and a gently shaped mouth.
She does not think that the emphasis on her appearance could have a sexist character, she said.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asked with an ironic look.
Her collaborator with the mines, 21-year-old Xu Yang says "Our task is to represent the image of the city."
They have no objections to their limited performance, they said, because their career ambitions are greater than just pushing traders into the streets where they can carry out their activity.
Every morning, the group faces more than a dozen marketers who run on foot or on wheels and try to sell as many dumplings and bowls of tofu as possible before they are evicted.
"Mr. Wang, you must leave."
"We have told you so many times!" said Miss Xu, as the merchant began to run away, and for a time left his wheel with a noodle cart.
Police officers describe their duties as more monotonous than strenuous.
“Every day is basically the same,” said Huang Jing, 20, who studies in her free marketing.
"Great routine."
One of the reasons is that female police officers do not have the authority as their male counterparts to seize the goods from vendors.
They can only threaten to report the fact to their male leaders.
The tendency is then to protect them from the sudden public displays of hostility to the official apparatus that are common throughout China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province, rioted after false rumors spread that police had killed vendors.
More than ten police officers or officers were injured at night; 14 government vehicles were turned over or ignited.
So far, Xindu has escaped such violence.
But peace can hardly be guaranteed.
Just two blocks from the quiet Baoguang Square, where police guards guarded the street that morning, more than 50 people gathered at the corner of the street.
Police seized a motorcycle that was being repaired on the sidewalk instead of inside the store, as required by the regulations.
The owner of the bike could cry as he wished.
A 15-minute walk in front of the policeman, facing furiously, with elbows against the vehicles and quickly away with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, the coordinator attached to the male group, stayed behind, his white badge turned to hide his name.
Like female police officers, coordinators are men over the age of 40 who no longer have an auxiliary role.
Unlike them, they are not trained in the maintenance and smoothing of the image.
"Sometimes we fight verbally."
"Sometimes we fight physically," Mr. Li said factually.
"It's usually the public that starts with it."
Prosecutors won't blame Senator Ensign
Prosecutors at the Justice Department cleared Senator John Ensign of a criminal charge related to his affair with a former campaign adviser and his efforts to secure a lobby, lawyers told the senator on Wednesday.
The decision ends the most serious legal threat Mr. Ensign, a Nevada Republican, faced and who, until the time of the scandal, was considered a possible Republican presidential candidate for 2012, his affair getting into national headlines and damaging his career.
Mr Ensign’s office said he was “certainly pleased” with the decision that followed nearly a year of investigation.
The senator could still face disciplinary proceedings at the Senate Ethics Committee.
Mr. Ensign's lawyers said the Justice Department "informed us that Senator Ensign will no longer be the target of the investigation and that he has no plans to bring further charges against him in this matter."
The Ministry of Justice declined to comment on the case.
The decision was a surprise to many ethical lawyers outside the Department of Justice who argued that there was serious evidence that Mr. Ensign was preparing a violation of the federal lobbying ban.
Interviews, emails and other documents published in October 2009 in the New York Times reported that Mr. Ensign helped Douglas Hampton, one of his assistants, secure a lucrative lobby that was supposed to lead to Mr. Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, being silent about the senator's relationship with her.
Mrs. Hampton used to work as a treasurer in the Ensign campaign.
Mr. Ensign has contacted a number of political supporters to find a job for Mr. Hampton and to support their views after they hired Mr. Hampton to lobby for them, so much so that the documents and interviews state.
Since Hampton was until recently Mr. Ensign's assistant, he was barred from lobbying his former employer or Senate for a year.
Ethics experts claim that the unusual settlement of Mr. Ensign and Mr. Hampton, who were friends before the affair, appeared in conflict with the ban on lobbying.
From the evidence released, "it turned out that this is a clear case of preparation for a violation of the law," said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defending clients who are being investigated by the government.
While Justice Department officials refused to explain the reasons for the decision in Senator Ensign's case, Mr. Brand and other ethics lawyers said the ministry is cautious about political lawsuits after a large number of failures, including a decision by Steve to suspend the lawsuit last year.
Federal prosecutors “clearly concealed the weapons,” said Melanie Sloan, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a law group that filed several complaints against Mr Ensign in the case.
"This basically indicates that high-ranking government officials are not subject to the laws," she added.
Paul Coggins, Ensign’s chief lawyer, said he was called by the Attorney General of the Department of Justice on Monday and then the next day, and told him that the Department found no charges against his client.
Mr. Ensign's defense team is working with prosecutors to convince them that the senator, as his office reiterated in a statement on Wednesday, "acted in accordance with the law."
Mr Coggins refused to clarify the legal arguments he had submitted to the public prosecutors.
"I am not pleased to portray the details of my discussions with the Department of Justice except that we think they made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Electoral Commission decided to stop investigating a separate complaint in which the ethics group alleges that the payment of Ensign Hampton’s parents in the amount of $96,000 violated the federal electoral law.
The election commission said it did not have enough evidence to prove that the money meant nothing but a gift.
One company for which Mr. Ensign helped Mr. Hampton find a lobbying job was NV Energy, the main Nevada company that had long supported the senator.
An email from December 2008 showed that after Mr. Hampton began acting as a lobbyist in the company, Mr. Ensign's chief of staff, John Lopez, was communicating with Mr. Hampton and telling him that he had "bushed" the Department of the Interior about the subject under discussion.
Mr. Ensign also attended lunch with Mr. Hampton and another Nevada client, Allegiant Air, and called on the Minister of Transport to arrange a meeting on behalf of the airline after hiring Mr. Hampton for lobbying work.
When the news of the affair first appeared last year, Mr. Ensign apologized to his constituents and resigned as the fourth Republican leader in the Senate.
After months of stagnation, Mr. Ensign told reporters two weeks ago that he was planning to participate in a third term in the Senate.
In a report that Mr. Ensign is no longer the target of a criminal investigation, his spokeswoman Jennifer Cooper said the senator hopes the ethics committee will quickly follow the Justice Department and close the entire investigation.
"Senator Ensign is looking forward to continuing his hard work on behalf of the people of Nevada," she said.
Cheshire appeals to Twitter
In the courtroom, half a dozen of them wrote.
Minute by minute, reports of a horrific testimony were sent via Twitter.
In the end, the defense says more than 140,000 Twitter posts dealt with raping and tying children to beds in a house that was on fire.
On Thursday, the trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted of killing three Cheshire, Connecticut, family members, was scheduled to take place and the death penalty, which the jury voted for, was officially terminated.
But Mr. Hayes' lawyers have already appealed to the court with requests and arguments that the court would likely employ for years.
One of the most provocative is that the intense reporting of the process – including the widespread use of Twitter’s main reporters – created a “circus atmosphere” and this widespread, immediate penetration of information with outrageous details then led the jury to make a public decision in terms of influence.
This claim could force the judge to consider whether, with the advent of new technologies, new rules in the courtroom would also be required.
“As I experienced in this review, I think there is a real danger that the inclusion of new technologies in the courtroom is affecting the rights of fair trial for individuals,” said Thomas J. Ullmann, Chief Advocate for Mr Hayes.
The trial judge Jon C. Blue of the state Supreme Court briefly dismissed the allegations regarding the ruling from last week and that the media was "closely checked" and that there was no evidence to suggest that the jury acted under the influence of the public.
But this is probably not the last word in this case.
For decades, the courts have recognized that reporting on notorious cases can raise questions about the fairness of the trial.
In a 1966 court order, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the conviction of Cleveland chiropractor Dr. Sam Sheppard for the murder of his wife, when in his decision he said that in the case of Sheppard vs. Maxwell, the media trial was a "carnival atmosphere".
Some believe that this crime was an inspiration for the TV show and the film "The Refugee".
Some lawyers said the appeals courts, which reviewed Hayes’s judgment half a century later, might be surprised by the argument that new rules might be necessary to determine how to communicate from the courtrooms, which was not the case with Dr. Sheppard.
"There is a general reason to worry about the impact of the new media" in highly watched cases, said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School who studied the death penalty in Connecticut and wrote a report that said it was carried out arbitrarily.
Professor Donohue said that some judges may be overwhelmed by the idea that restricting direct communication from courtrooms can make the process more fair.
The Twitter case is just one of many outlined Hayes lawyers who would have been able to argue for years to delay execution.
Prosecutors also argue that Mr. Hayes’ case may have been preconceived when Judge Blue refused to allow him to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them criminal photos of terror in the selection of the jury.
Some of the jurors said they were horrified by the photos of the victim, who became Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her daughters Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11.
Advocates say they also reject the constitutionality of the death penalty, claiming that the judge wrongly dismissed a jury that was critical of prosecutors and that his decision wrongly put more pressure on the verdict and directed the jury to think about the weekend.
The jurors were not separated.
But their arguments about the impact of the scope of the process can attract the greatest interest.
They objected to the verdict last month that the case dominated the Connecticut news and was discussed during the election campaign by the candidates for governor and the U.S. Senate.
They argued that the media was constantly invigorating the flames of emotion in the case.
“The daily influx of media, cameras and reporters before the court,” the lawyer wrote, “was something that has not yet been seen here in New Haven, and it may also be a national rarity.”
Their focus on Twitter’s actions is controversial.
In the interviews, some journalists argued that the immediate reporting was more outrageous than the reports cited later, and in their view, the judiciary should guide the scope of further trials.
But some lawyers have called for appeals courts with common arguments that social and technological changes require court adaptation.
Mr. Hayes' lawyers are pursuing this right.
In their archives, they referred to the Supreme Court’s 1966 ruling in Dr. Sheppard’s judgment because of the breadth of the process and wanted to clarify the requirement that new media require new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "represents the case of Sheppard versus Maxwell in the 21st century."
Can politeness overcome the abyss?
After the campaign, which was remarkable for its offensiveness and negativity, a small amount of politeness appeared in Washington this week.
Is this the first glimpse of genuine cooperation between the two political parties or just an illusory moment before a swift return to the party struggle in the capital?
Tuesday's talks by President Obama and parliamentary leaders have not brought any major findings on key issues that need to be discussed during the session.
In any case, however, it was a polite discussion discussing the differences of opinion between the two parties, as well as defining their joint responsibilities, rather than another empty episode of party politics.
The Wednesday public meeting of the Presidential Deficit Commission was also civilized, despite the political differences that remain between the members.
It seems clear that the close interaction for several months has built mutual respect, which goes beyond the ideological gap that still divides the members.
And it is quite difficult to say that a new era of cooperation has begun.
Both sides are now in probation – probing each other’s signs of collegiateness and compromise, while trying to assess the limits of public opinion and electoral patience towards a renewed party war.
Therefore, the Tuesday meeting and its subsequent evaluation by the participants was also conducted with a minimum of demands or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too vast and too deep to suggest a rapid change in the conditions that have prevailed here for the past two years.
Whether it’s a matter of taxes, expenses, health care or rights, both sides are miles away.
However, the November election was prepared by Washington at least quickly.
“It’s not a question of whether regulatory issues have changed,” said Pete Wehner, Bush’s administrator, now at the Ethics and Public Policy Center.
“They are inevitable after the election.
Elections stirred up the emotions of the parties and then they quieted down.
It's good."
On several issues, especially those to be discussed at the meeting, Republicans and Democrats have little chance of finding a solution.
Bush’s tax cuts have expired at the end of the year and no one considers it favorable.
Both sides want to find a way to protect some or all, permanently or temporarily.
Just like the likely compromise on unemployment benefits simply because Republicans can’t see how they support tax cuts for the wealthy while denying unemployment benefits to the unemployed.
After Tuesday's White House talks, there is already more optimism about a possible agreement on these issues, along with the ratification of the new start-up treaty.
But William Galston of the Brookings Institution warns that successful cooperation on critical issues will not necessarily lead to a two-party relationship when the 112th Congress convenes in January.
Rather, a period of disagreement is likely, or even inevitable, he said.
“After doing the things that need to be done, psychology will return to one of the confrontations in the short term,” he said.
Wehner also expressed skepticism – which is largely widespread – that politeness will lead to real cooperation.
"I look at all the events between now and 2012 as a shadow box, when the main events take place in 2012," he said.
The reasons are largely related to the formation of a new Republican majority in the White House and the tea parties voters who helped create it.
Republican leaders now face the danger of exaggeration, knowing they must behave according to their promises and must cut government spending and repeal the new health care law.
These lines of support are clear in the initial responses to the deficit recommendations, which include reforming the tax code and raising certain taxes, increasing the retirement age and reducing spending.
Joint Presidents Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken on one of the most difficult tasks in Washington and are, in their view, to develop the pressure of the deficit question to the public agenda in ways that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes in the 18-member committee to be able to present their plan as an official recommendation and thus fight to get as close to that number as possible.
The biggest opposition is among the elected officials in the jury, who propose that in the case of financial issues we have, at least today, a small foundation or willingness to compromise.
Galston predicts two phases in the battles between the White House and parliamentary Republicans.
The first will begin next year in the form of party conflicts, when Republicans will call on Obama to address budgets, taxes and health care, followed by a period of greater party cooperation.
What will cause the shift?
The public opinion.
There’s plenty of evidence that despite the bias in the last election, most Americans still want to see two sides working together.
If it could go to the heel, as it was in 1995, then both sides will be watching the reaction of the public very closely.
Anyone who is threatened with a reduction in votes is likely to change course and seek a compromise.
This can be an optimistic view of things.
Partisanship and orientation are greater today than they were in the mid-1990s, and it turns out that there has been a greater ideological gap between Obama and parliamentary Republicans than there has been between Republicans and Bill Clinton.
At the same time, activists on both sides see 2010 as a prelude to more important elections in 2012.
Based on this reality, the courtesy that has appeared this week would welcome many Americans.
But it will cost a lot of effort on both sides to find common ground on the issues that still divide them.
U.S. document reveals Moscow as a haven of corruption
The management of the city is in the hands of a “cleptocracy” and this continues to be part of the bribes and protection bribes coming on its way to the Kremlin, the US embassy in Russia said in a February tape.
Both the police and the Federal Security Service are largely holding protective wings that help explain the high cost of living in Moscow.
They collect money not only from legal businesses but also from organized criminal groups.
Every layer of bureaucracy – which Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called the “vertices of the office” – will take its own when the money starts to move up the ladder.
The record, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was published on Wednesday via WikiLeaks on their website.
The record is based on the sources whose names have been edited.
The record was written at a time when Yuri Luzhkov was still mayor and accuses him of a large share of corruption.
It was recalled in October by President Dmitry Medvedev, but since then we can only see minimal changes in the cleanliness.
Luzhkov and his wife Yelena Baturina, who owns a prominent construction company, have consistently denied corruption charges for many years, and have won several lawsuits on false charges for such allegations.
In September, he told the Russian TV station when asked about proven evidence of corruption: "It's crazy, it's dirt, it's shit."
The Russians believe with absolute conviction that if their society is corrupted, it will turn out to be a vote.
It is unusual, however, to encounter such details in such a way, in the embassy report, and it is also unheard of for diplomats from foreign countries to do so.
“Moscow’s city government and its connection to criminal elements have led some to call it ‘dysfunctional,’ and confirm that the government operates more as a kleptocracy than as a government,” the report says.
"Criminal elements enjoy the so-called 'krysha' (a term from the world of crime and the mafia, which literally means 'roof' or protection), provided by the police, the Federal Security Service, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Ministry of the Interior and the Office of the Prosecutor, as well as everywhere in the government bureaucracy.
Analysts have also identified a three-stage structure in Moscow’s criminal world.
"Luzhkov is at the very top."
"The Federal Security Service, the Department of the Interior and the militia are in the second grade."
"And finally, at the lowest level, there are ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors."
“It’s an inefficient system in which criminal groups fill vacancies in some areas because the city doesn’t provide some services.”
The report says the FSB is taking money from the largest companies and the police are targeting smaller companies.
One source said, "Owners of stores in Moscow realize that it is better to get protection from the FSB or the Ministry of the Interior (rather than from organized criminal groups), as they not only have more weapons, resources and strength than criminal groups, but they are also protected by law."
"For this reason, protection from criminal gangs is no longer in the pipeline."
The record says that while the withdrawal of money is complex, the protection itself can already have trouble; even those who pay can sometimes be arrested.
For those who do not pay quickly enough, their shops are closed under various pretexts.
Medvedev spoke on several occasions about fighting corruption, but admitted that he had made little progress.
The embassy report speaks of men taking suitcases, presumably loaded with cash, to the Kremlin itself.
“In his fight against corruption, Medvedev must rely on bureaucrats,” said Georgy Satarov, director of Moscow’s Indem research team, in a recent interview.
“It’s part of this bureaucracy.”
"It is not part of the political class, because in Russia there are no longer political classes."
Without politicians, without opposition, without power-sharing, corruption is inevitable, he said.
Indem estimates that corruption in Russia costs more than $ 300 billion a year.
The country ranks 154th in a recent survey on the global perception of corruption by NGO Transparency International (countries are ranked from least to most corrupt).
The revelation of the U.S. embassy’s report, which appeared in Moscow only late in the evening, certainly did not provoke the Russian government’s enthusiasm, although only to the extent that Luzhkov may be blamed for Moscow’s shortcomings, it may be an opportunity for the Kremlin to argue on the issue.
Speaking to CNN with Larry King, Putin said the documents released by WikiLeaks may have been forged and reacted furiously to statements that U.S. diplomats call him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
"The truth about the whole matter is that it's about our mutual cooperation, which is an important factor in domestic policy in this country," he said.
"But to be honest, we didn't think it would be done with such arrogance, with such pressure, you know, so unethically."
Veterans of the Khmer Rouge are forced to deal with the past
In a heavily lit concrete classroom with dirty and peeled walls, the director of Anlong Veng High School recalled the man who built it, the leader of the Khmer Rouge Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves Ta Moka."
"He was a good leader and took care of his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42.
Known as a "slaughterman" for his cruelty during the Khmer Rouge government, the commander in this remote Khmer Rouge country in northwest Cambodia remains popular, where he has built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure and where thousands of former Khmer Rouge soldiers still live.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge surrendered, long-standing loyalty is broken in Anlong Veng as well.
In April, the victims of the Truth and Reconciliation Forum were allowed to publicly confront people who were part of the regime.
In June, the government provided textbooks that for the first time explain the history of the Khmer Rouge and their former soldiers to children.
And in July, the United Nations and the Cambodian court will jointly issue the first conviction of a former Khmer Rouge member, the sentencing of a former leader, the notorious violent association Tuol Sleng, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Spirit, to 35 years in prison.
With each such progress, unrest has grown among Khmer Rouge veterans in Anlong Veng, making efforts for reconciliation and their attempts to reintegrate into Cambodian society more complicated.
"There is resentment and fear among the former Khmer Rouge, but they are powerless to do anything," said Chhang Youk, head of Cambodia's documentation centre, an independent organization investigating the regime.
"For them, life among the Khmer Rouge was wonderful, but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
"It divides families."
During the Khmer Rouge rule in Cambodia, from 1975 to 1979, an estimated 1.7 million people were executed or died of starvation, illness or overwork.
When the Vietnamese invaded and overthrew the Pol Pot government in 1979, the remnants of the regime and its troops fled to the Cambodian border with Thailand.
There they launched an uprising that lasted until the last movement in December 1998.
Pol Pot, Nuon Chea, and Ieng Sary led guerrilla warfare from their bases in the mountains and jungles of western Cambodia, while Ta Mok cultivated supporters in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a UN-sponsored peace agreement, the country was led to the first democratic elections in 1993. Large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began to transition to a government that culminated in the capitulation of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuon Chea in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural death in 1998 and Ta Mok, who survived, was captured by government forces in the nearby Dangrek Mountains in 1999.
He died in Phnom Penh Prison in 2006 while awaiting trial.
Their patrons no longer cared for them, most of the former Khmer Rouge fighters fell into ordinary Cambodian rural life, and many of them nostalgically remember the time of the movement.
Although several elite Khmer Rouges have maintained their local government position in exchange for their weapons, their position remains weak as unskilled farmers.
"These people had only minimal benefit from capitulation," said Sok Leang of the Centre for Justice and Reconciliation, which is run by public forums throughout Cambodia, including Anlong Veng.
"They are surrounded by the regime's utopian agrarian ideology."
"They were educated without any idea of doing business."
Sor Lim, 55, who joined the Khmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle around Anlong Veng before settling down as a poor farmer in 1998.
"Life under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said.
"The Mok has nourished them all."
"But now life is hard, because we have to take care of everything ourselves."
The ongoing Khmer Rouge court has also raised concerns.
Early next year, the court will begin investigating Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister.
The court has a mandate to prosecute the leader and the people responsible for the crimes, but it has not been said whether it will continue in these four cases.
It was not enough to calm the worries in Anlong Veng.
Recent media speculation focused on Im Chaem, 64, who was a regional leader in Banteay Meanchey province during the Khmer Rouge government in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she told researchers at the Documentation Center in Cambodia that she was overseeing the construction of the Trapeang Thma dam, a project that likely killed thousands of forced workers.
On a recent steamy evening, Im Chaem returned from work on the field to her wooden cottage on a dirty road outside Anlong Veng.
As the sun began to set and shadows appeared over the flat grass, Im Chaem refused to talk about her past among the Khmer Rouge.
If the court summoned her, she would refuse to go.
"There is peace and stability in Cambodia," she said.
"If there are more prosecutions, there will be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who ran away from the Khmer Rouge in 1978, also repeatedly warned that there would be instability if the court searched for more suspects, although experts and historians disagree.
"Cambodia must dig a deep hole and bury the past in it," he said.
But confronting the past is just what Cambodia has to do to move forward, Chhang Youk of the Documentation Center said.
"Reconciliation in Khmer conditions means colliding broken pieces," he said.
"It is our duty to put these broken pieces together so that we can understand each other."
The Centre has published the first textbook approved by the Khmer Rouge government, has 75 pages and is titled "History of Democratic Cambodia."
It was distributed in Anlong Veng in June as an addendum to the Ministry of Education's history textbook, which contains less than four pages on the Khmer Rouge.
Like many people in Cambodia, the young people in Anlong Veng knew little about the Khmer Rouge, despite the connection of the city with the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19, a high school student in Anlong Veng, said the new textbook helps students understand important parts of their history.
But his parents were skeptical when he took home the book for study.
"My family rejects many parts of the textbook and the courts," he said.
"They're suspicious because they're not sure how many people the court will sue."
Such resistance makes the process of reconciliation more complex and difficult, Sok Leang said.
But public forums, textbooks and the court are beginning to have an impact, he said.
The Khmer Rouge still has a strong charm here.
At the top of the Dangrek Mountains, the road is covered with weeds and sprinkled with discarded plastic bags, leading to a rectangle made of black suede, covered with a rusty sheet metal roof.
Pol Pot's body was burned on a pile of tyres after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31, a mobile phone saleswoman on the side of the road, said she didn’t know much about the man who was cremated at the spot.
"But he has a strong spirit, a lot of locals come here and pray to him," she said.
Nuom Sothea had a birthday and planned to visit Pol Pot's resting place later, where she would bring a bunch of ripe bananas in the hope that it would bring her luck.
Belarus agrees to appear to have stockpiles of uranium-based weapons
In a surprise victory in President Obama’s campaign to secure nuclear material around the world, the Belarusian government announced Wednesday that it would give up its stockpiles of highly enriched uranium, a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The agreement was announced in a joint statement issued after the security summit between Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton and Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov.
The U.S. government has been trying for years to persuade Belarus to give up highly enriched uranium, and it seems that they stumbled upon a rock in the fall of last spring.
But U.S. officials told The Washington Post that a couple of covert operations have been carried out with Belarus over the past two months to remove 187 pounds of uranium-based weapons from a Belarusian research facility.
This paved the way for Wednesday's deal to remove the rest of the material - about <0xC2><0xA3>500, according to an official who spoke on condition of anonymity, because it is a sensitive matter.
The agreement proved to be one of the most important outcomes of Obama’s 47th National Nuclear Security Summit in April, at which Belarus was eliminated.
And it was apparently a good move to secure the invitation of the former Soviet Republic to the subsequent summit in 2012.
"I was really fascinated by the fact that they want a place at the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit."
“This proves that the process is working,” said Ken Luongo, president of the Global Security Partnership, a group supporting nuclear security.
Clinton called the deal a “very significant, important step” from Belarus.
In April 2009, Obama pledged to secure all sensitive nuclear materials around the world within four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries get rid of all their stockpiles of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be the seventh.
Dozens of countries have done so for George W. Bush’s reports.
At the time of Obama's nuclear security summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko announced that his people would never give up their uranium.
"We have highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilograms of what is essentially the basis for a weapon and less enriched uranium," Lukashenko said.
“It’s our commodity... We’re not going to make dirty bombs and we’re not going to sell them to anyone.”
"We only use it for research purposes, that's all."
Belarus, however, joined the United States a few months ago and expressed an interest in reaching an agreement.
The first commitment to remove Belarusian uranium in October was particularly complicated because the material was lightly illuminated, officials said.
It was loaded onto a special train that travelled more than 1,300 miles to the Russian storage and disposal facility, officials said.
The second operation was closed on Monday and was carried out by air, officials said.
The U.S. government has spent $13 million on the program, most of it on delivering less enriched uranium to the Belarusian research institute, which is not suitable for the production of nuclear weapons.
“Everything was coordinated very carefully and managed on the basis of trust,” which led to the deal signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, an energy ministry official working for Global Threat Reduction.
The James Martin Center for Nuclear Non-Proliferation Studies has estimated that Belarus has at least <0xC2><0xA3>88 of uranium used to make weapons.
According to the joint statement, Belarus will endeavour to eliminate its stockpiles by 2012.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been tense for years, mainly because of Lukashenko’s cruel repression of human rights.
But Wednesday's statement suggests the possibility of a gradual meltdown.
"We welcome progress on these global security issues, the United States and Belarus have recognized that a more consistent adherence to democracy and human rights in Belarus remains the basis for improving mutual relations and this is necessary for the progress of the country and its people," he said.
The Spanish government did not do gems with the CIA's flights
The Spanish government did not make jewelry about CIA flights transporting detained Taliban and Al Qaeda members to Guantanamo through Spanish territory, as the US envoy in Madrid said in his telegram.
According to documents provided by WikiLeaks to the El País newspaper, the then First Deputy Prime Minister María Teresa Fernández de la Vega had requested that the Spanish executive be informed and "could thus show to the public that she has the proper supervision of foreigners by means of the authorities".
In June 2006, following a Council of Europe communication in which a dozen states, including Spain, were accused of participating in human rights violations, a meeting took place between U.S. Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega.
The deputy prime minister said the Council of Europe's announcement "takes the Zapatero government out of the game" and insisted that Spain has nothing to hide in this matter.
De la Vega stressed that Spain does not have a problem with intelligence flights across its territory.
“They just want to be informed,” so they don’t “get caught unprepared,” Aguirre said in one of the documents.
The then Secretary of State, Miguel <0xC3><0x81>ngel Moratinos, also hinted to the U.S. ambassador that the Spanish government “wanted to give the matter as little outline as possible, but that because the matter was in the hands of the judges, the cabinet had limited possibilities of influence.”
In February 2007, Vicente González told the Embassy that he did not intend to block the judge's initiative to request the declassification of documents of the National Secret Service Center (CNI) and the Ministry of Defense related to CIA flights.
"This information does not contain any incriminating file or any sensitive information," the embassy said after an interview with the prosecutor.
However, the U.S. expressed concerns more about "obvious coordination between the Spanish judge and German prosecutors" than about declassification of information from the CNI or the Ministry of Defense.
"This coordination between independent experts will complicate our efforts to resolve this case discreetly between governments," Aguirre said.
In March 2007, on the occasion of the luncheon of the U.S. Ambassador and Secretary of the Interior Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, he told the ambassador that "although the Spanish judges are very jealous of their independence and will do what they consider appropriate to the embassy", he said.
The Ambassador also expresses his concerns about the conduct of the political party Partido Popular (PP; Czech People's Party) in this matter.
“Despite its general pro-American orientation, our experience tells us that the Popular Party will not hesitate to take advantage of any indication that the Zapatero government has tolerated or deliberately ignored US actions that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, even in the event of negative government findings.”
Confessed mother-murderer complained on the network about maternal "age"
A young woman was talking about a child when he was already dead, and she had her own blog: "Terror in Galicia"
Mónica Juanatey Fernández calls herself "Muki" on the Internet.
She communicated with her cousin and at least one friend by this nickname, both from the village of Noia in the area of La Coruña, where the young woman comes from.
The reports are from 2008.
In order for them to be understood, it is necessary to know the emotional life of a woman, which the ABC daily reconstructs with the help of the testimony of her family members.
A 30-year-old woman from Galicia entered into a relationship with the industrialist Ivan Tunes in 1998.
They've been dating for a year.
Shortly after they broke up, she found out she was pregnant.
The man wanted to know if the newborn was his child, but his ex-girlfriend never had DNA tests done.
Soon she found a new acquaintance.
Her chosen was Alberto, a young man from the nearby town of Lousame.
Their coexistence lasted a long time.
Little Caesar lived with them.
When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to look for a job, the little one stayed with her partner, who even came to visit her for a week in Palmyra.
However, from the content of her communication, it can be seen that the relationship has broken down.
In March 2008, she is alone in Menorca and writes: "Alberto is kind of angry that I left for work."
"When I told him, he thought it was good, but now he realizes he has to be with the kid all day and he can't do what he wants."
Then she talks about a text message she just received: “I want you to come back this month or give me the address where I should send you the baby.”
He complains: "If he doesn't like me leaving the baby with my mother, I'll marry him when I get back," he says.
In May, he says about his return to his hometown: "I'm going there this week, but I'm only staying until the 19th, because on the 20th I have to go for work so that I don't lose the place."
He explains that if everything goes well, he will take his son with him.
“He’ll be with who he’s supposed to be with, so with me, and never again in his life will it happen that I’ll leave him with someone other than my mother,” a dubious intention given her bad relationships.
In July there is another post.
When he taps this message, it is assumed that the child who arrived on the island on the first day of this month, and was probably murdered on the 10th, is already dead.
"Caesar is pleased on the one hand, but not on the other."
"On the one hand he's with me and he likes it here, but on the other he goes to school almost every day."
He's talking about moving to Mallorca.
"He's going to summer school there, so I'll save some money for a nanny."
Seventeenth greetings and complaints.
"A big mouth from Caesar, who asks me when you will come."
“Alberto says he sent you an e-mail, I don’t know what videos, look how he likes it, meet me, sex is needed.”
Thirty-second message: "The boy is doing well, going to summer school to learn Catalan."
There's also a report about Victor, his current partner: "He's giving me money."
On the Internet there are Mónica's posts on anime and manga blogs.
She even had her own on MySpace, now revised, where she kept calling herself "Muki ex-prisoner."
"Terror in Galician (motto) ".
The last man she lived with, the guard, expresses his regret and feels guilty.
He doesn't want to believe that it all happened because she didn't tell him she was a single mother.
Monica yesterday entered the Provincial Discipline in Palma, where she came from a prison centre in Menorca.
The defendant, Carlos Maceda, said the defendant did not remember how it all happened and "that she had no intention of harming the child in any way".
But before that, she admitted that she drowned Caesar in the bathtub and put his body in the trunk.
Both the defense and the prosecutor are requesting a psychiatric examination.
People would win 4 seats in the House and the PSC (Socialist Party of Catalonia) would lose 9 seats
With the results of November 28, the PP party could have the main word in the town halls of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona.
After a significant increase in the number of votes won and the number of experienced MPs during the recent autonomous elections, the Catalan PP (Catalan People's Party) already has a given idea of general elections, whether there will be an increase or not, its prospects are more than positive.
In 2008, the Catalan people won 610.473 votes in the general election, while in the autonomous elections of 2006 this number was only 316.222.
Last Sunday, the PPC (Catalan People's Party) received 384,091 votes.
If this upward trend, which has been supported by the PSC's 25-plus votes and the loyalty of the PP voters, persists, then the party's analysts have calculated that if the general election is held, the PPC could win 12 MPs in the House against the current 8 MPs.
These calculations would confirm that Catalonia is of fundamental importance to the PP and the PSOE (Spanish Socialist Workers’ Party).
According to this analysis of the people, the ERC (Left Republican Party of Catalonia) would lose one member - now has 3 - while the ICV (Initiative of the Greens for Catalonia) would continue to have one mandate, or would win another.
However, according to the electoral calendar, the next round will be held in May 2011 on the occasion of the municipal elections, where the people could also have a decisive influence on the end of the domination of the socialists in the four main provincial cities and also on the changes in the Council of Barcelona (Diputación de Barcelona), which is one of the 6 million years for the euro - the year with the largest turnout.
Both the nationalists and the populists agree that the PSC could lose the town halls of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where the socialists would not receive a majority and could not even turn to their traditional allies, the ERC and ICV parties.
Given the debacle of the Republicans, it would not be impossible for this party to lose its representation in the Barcelona representative office - since it needs to win at least 5% of the vote.
The PP has increased the number of votes won in four capitals and could have a decisive influence in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced that they could play a major role in the turnout in Tarragona, where they ruled together with the PP party before the current mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lérida, the PP won only 500 votes more than the PSC, whose mayor Angel Ros has a very good relationship with Marian Rajoy - during the last campaign they met on several occasions.
The villagers also gained in other important town halls such as Badalona, Castelldeels or Reus.
Currently, the PP has a presence in 34 municipalities in Catalonia and would like to nominate candidates in as many municipalities as possible.
Catalan cell gives Al Qaeda thousands of passports
In addition to seven detainees in Barcelona, three more were detained in Thailand.
Seven Pakistanis and one Nigerian, who were detained in 2008 by agents of the General Information Commission in Barcelona, formed a jihadist cell controlled from Thailand, which arranged passports for various groups of al-Qaeda, among which were the "Tigers of Liberation" and the "Tigers of Liberation".
The Ministry of the Interior attaches great importance to the investigation of this matter, aiming to ensure, with the help of “Operation Kampai”, the weakening of the counterfeiting apparatus of al-Qaida at the international level and thus “limit its operational capabilities”.
Investigators estimate that during the two years it was active in Catalonia, the cell could have sent thousands of passports to Thailand, where they were then counterfeited and then delivered to the groups that make up the Al-Qaeda criminal galaxy, so that their "warriors" could travel across the country with impunity.
This broken cell was not the only active jihad network in Europe, and therefore, in addition to the Thai services, other European police units also participated in these investigations, and it cannot be ruled out that in the following days there will be no similar strikes in other European countries, such as the one in Barcelona.
In connection with this operation (when the Pakistanis Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade were detained), another was developed in Thailand by the Pakistanis Junaid Humayun, At Atiqur Rehman, At Asghar, At, At, At, Butt, At, At, Buti, At, At, But, At, At, But, At, At, But, At, At,
It was these men who drove from Bangkok a cell based in Spain and others in other European countries.
The Catalan network, part of which was destroyed in 2009, was stealing tourist passports that met the demands of Islamists.
This means that the documents must have belonged to men between the ages of 25 and 45, must have been valid for several years, and must be visa-free.
Investigative documents stress that no facts linking the detainees from Catalonia to the Bombay assassination are yet to be known, although the perpetrator of these attacks, "Lashkar-e-Taiba", was supposed to be one of the groups that accepted passports stolen in Spain and then faked in Thailand.
However, it is worth mentioning that a few days before the assassination, about a thousand dollars were sent from Catalonia by a transfer agency that was “invested” in buying cards to mobile phones, which were later used by members of the “team” that killed 106 people.
The police have seized a lot of evidence.
The People's Party (PP) demands that Masovo stop the fiscal agreement
Alicia Sánchez-Camachová, president of the PPC (Catalan People's Party) as a national economist, had the opportunity yesterday to personally present to Arturo Mas his conditions under which she is willing to support his appointment as president of the Generalitat; these conditions are the same as those proposed during the campaign and their priority is in the economy.
The President of the Catalan People's Union came to a meeting with Artur Mas with the certainty of 18 seats received in last Sunday's election, which is a more than satisfactory number for gaining popularity, so the CiU candidate needs to be asked to hold at least one of the formations.
On possible agreement with the PP depends future alliances that nationalists would like to maintain in the House when general elections are held, but so far the talks he is conducting these days with the rest of the political leaders are carried in the Catalan spirit.
As for the PP president to get her support for her inauguration, she "will have to end all sovereign and liberating speeches," as well as an economic deal - similar to the one in the Basque Country - that the CiU leader even wanted to have voted on in a referendum.
Both leaders would like to slim down the overwhelming political apparatus of autonomous administration and reduce inheritance and donation taxes.
Details of the negotiations on Masov’s inauguration will be discussed within the PP Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
The Mass has already met Joaquin Nadal (PSC), who promised the hard opposition, Joan Herrera (ICV) and will meet today with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The director of the geriatric facility assures that the deaths did not occur as a result of "lack of measures"
Olot’s presentation does not rule out the fact that their caregiver killed more than 11 clients
The management of the La Caritat de Olot geriatric center (Gerona) gave a press conference yesterday to describe the damage caused to the institution by the criminal behavior of Joan Vila Dilmé, a caregiver who - while employed here - killed at least eleven seniors he had in care.
The director of this home for seniors, Joan Sala, appeared in the company of the facility's lawyer, Joan Canady, and announced that "the desire of the home of La Caritat would be to be able to bring charges against the culprit" responsible for the murder, but "legality and responsibility will oblige us to take this process".
In addition to the damage to the reputation that this institution may suffer because it has not detected the criminal activities of the caregiver in time, the great threat to the home of La Caritat is now the claims for material compensation, which are already calculated by the legal representatives of the surviving families.
Joan Vila Dilmé admitted that his first crime occurred in August 2009 and that since then he has not stopped killing.
The judge ordered the exhumation of eight bodies of patients at the elderly’s home, suspecting that in many cases no doctor had personally examined the deceased, but that – given the age and poor health of the patients – everything was handled by phone.
La Caritat yesterday, through its director, resolutely rejected this extremism, stressing that "the lack of action could in no way be the cause of what happened".
Lawyer La Caritat added that "there is no indication in the case that, in addition to the defendant himself, any third party has committed a mistake".
A man now nicknamed "The Angel of Death" confessed to 11 murders yesterday, specifying that he committed the first crime on August 29, 2009 and killed the second old woman a month and a half later.
in this case, death caused by administration of too high a dose of insulin, unlike the first case when he used a mixture of soothing tablets.
Director La Caritat said it was difficult to control staff’s access to medicines.
Insulin and a sedative cocktail were probably in six out of nine cases the means that this caregiver used to kill patients in his attempt to relieve them from suffering.
However, only the analyses currently underway in the lab should show whether Vila was lying and actually looking for a less cruel death for his first victims or killed them by giving a sepulchre, as he has already admitted in the case of three women killed between 12 and 17 October.
In La Caritat, they do not believe in medical claims, nor do they exclude that the number of deaths may be higher than the number they confessed to, and they justify their behavior in the various versions submitted by Vila to the court with the knowledge that he must change his behavior when it turned out that he killed eight people.
That is why they say they want to be available to the judiciary so that the full scope of this matter is illuminated.
The European Central Bank is at risk
Investors reacted sharply to yesterday’s threat from the President of the European Central Bank, Trichet, who warned that “markets should not underestimate our ability to react”.
Border differentials closed by force and the shares of European banks fell by more than 5%.
However, we should also not underestimate the European Central Bank's ability to make mistakes - the euro has just risen above the critical value.
What happened yesterday is typical of the illiquid market, which, although declining, is recovering - but thanks to short and highly speculative positions.
It will take some time for the investor to lose fear.
A month ago, the European Central Bank quoted us to take back the liquidity rate today, and tomorrow it will have to withdraw for the fourth time in two years.
The Bundesbank called for the end of the plan to buy out the sovereign debt for inefficiencies and the elimination of all extraordinary liquidity measures within the deadline, and to keep unlimited access for only one week.
Following the Irish crisis, we expect the liquidity rate to be forecast "at least until March" and to comply with a three-month bid with unlimited access by the end of this quarter to guarantee liquidity at least until June.
We also hope that they will continue their bond purchase program and that they will even announce its intensification.
If they do not meet the expectations created, they will re-create the reaction of the markets from yesterday, and if they continue to blindly withdraw the liquidity rate, God is with us!
The same was true at the May congress, where they claimed they had not even considered buying bonds, and there was a market collapse - tomorrow history could repeat itself.
The European Central Bank must be credible and persistent.
In May, the armored company announced on Monday that it had already bought many of them, causing a further market crash.
Yesterday's bid for one-year bills in Portugal was very poor.
El Tesoro issued only 500 million with 5.28%, compared to 750 million with 4.81% of the previous auction.
As a result, rates in Portugal fell 30 points below, reflecting the change in market mood that Trichet said had occurred.
In Ireland, the figures were published representing the losses of the Allied and Bank of Ireland.
The estimated amounts represent about $10,000 million in short-term securities and another 15,000 potential, they have a chance to become private capital by February, otherwise they will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has no credibility, after the problem was not revealed by stress tests in July, the amounts are acceptable under the relief plan and will help reduce uncertainty.
However, next Tuesday, the government will need to get parliamentary approval for the new budget and it still does not have enough support, so uncertainty continues to reign in Ireland.
Angela Merkel has softened the tone of her speech to ease tensions in the face of the next EU summit on 14 December, where a political compromise is needed to show that we are a union and we are all on the same boat.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner, while others would prefer Beethoven’s Ode to the delight.
In Spain, the Prime Minister had the opportunity yesterday to present a plan of action, which will be approved by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in autonomous regions and financial institutions, deficit reduction, liberalization, privatization, measures to restore employment – in the ears of investors, it sounds like four years from Vivaldi.
The double effect of Trichet and Zapatero explains why the Spanish stock market grew by 4.5%, that is, twice as much as the other European stock exchanges.
Unlike in February, the response of the government and the Spanish National Bank was swift and convincing – we are apparently benefiting from the surprise effect.
Today we have a key three-year bond auction here, which will be favored by the Trichet effect, which we hope will be in great demand to help dispel doubts about our refinancing ability.
Asking for a rescue plan would be self-sacrifice for Spain.
They would give us cash that we don't need - 40 billion in cash is available in El Tesoro, three times more than in March - further high rates and access to markets would be closed to us sine die.
However, it is necessary to continue to use the strategy of Caesar's wife - "not only to be it, but also to seem it".
We can do it.
President of the Eulen Group will attack the actions of Vega Sicilia requested by his children
The storm in the open conflict in the <0xC3><0x81>lvarez family, the owners of Eulen and El Enebro, is not silent.
David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez, the founder of the group, attacks after he considers it "totally insignificant", the legal proceedings of El Enebro planned for the 16th of this month and demanded five of his seven descendants, on which they should try to force their majority and seize the company with the help of the Sigurds of Sigurd.
David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez and his sons Jesús David and María José are reconciling the legal group for a new chapter of their dispute over the control of a part of the society.
The founder of the largest corporate services holding company does not seem willing to settle his dispute over membership in the El Enebro Group’s governing bodies.
five of its seven descendants, who were appointed heads during the shareholders’ meeting on 18 January of this year and whose objection is recorded in the Commercial Register, were removed from its Administrative Committee.
The El Enebro trial scheduled for the 16th of this month, which was convened by an official of the Commercial Court No. 2 in Madrid, once again revived the thunderstorm in the bosom of the <0xC3><0x81>lvarez family.
Appeal to a judge is the only legal remedy that guarantees the convening of a commission until the dispute is resolved.
The final move by Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilia, Marta and Elvira <0xC3><0x81>lvarez Mezquirez is seen by David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez as a “desperate means of his five children serving with the help of a judicial scam and clear legal fraud to strengthen and improve on the January 18 act, which was totally unpaid”.
This argument will serve as a basis for justifying the legal assault of this act as "completely insignificant".
The very protagonists, who quietly remain silent, have already unsuccessfully tried to have the court summoned in June.
in El Enebro, a group that owns Bodegas Vega Sicilia among other activities, controls the seven descendants of David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez 100% of the capital.
However, according to family protocols, the founder of the group demands the right to use 51% of the capital.
This issue is a key issue that will have to be decided by the judge when considering the issue of the appeal of proceedings. The date of this review has not yet been set.
Red Bull wins Formula One with a secret weapon from Siemens
The software proposes the improvements in the vehicles in real time.
Since Red Bull entered the Formula 1 series in 2004, its history in this exceptional world of speed has been characterized by surprise and success.
At first, no one took the possibilities of this newcomer team too seriously, and despite the recent upward trend, everyone was betting on the triumph of Ferrari’s Fernando Alonso.
Without wanting to undermine the riding abilities of the champion, the German Sebastian Vettel, or the Renault engine that drives his car, a legend has been born in the world of Formula 1 - the "secret weapon" that the multinational Siemens put into the hands of Red Bull to make it a winning team.
In fact, it is a powerful software simulating marches, which the German company launched in 2007 for the purposes of very remote motorsport.
The so-called PLM, this powerful software device, has been used to design assembly lines in manufacturing plants around the world, in power plants and for high-precision devices.
It aims to faithfully reproduce the product or simulate the process before it is actually created, thus avoiding unnecessary errors and expenses.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon’s cameras, Sukhoi aircraft, and Nissan’s most famous commercial vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of Siemens’ industry division, explains that the use of this software enabled the Red Bull team to perform “within a few hours, in almost real time” modifications and improvements that would otherwise be detected during races and tests.
Russwurm says that in 1992, the stables employed an average of 10 technicians who were able to perform a maximum of three or four improvements in a single period.
The Red Bull team today employs 180 young, highly skilled professionals equipped with powerful information technology to analyze and design every type of modification of racing vehicles.
The head of Siemens explained that the PLM software is capable of analyzing and improving all elements of the Red Bull racing vehicles, with the exception of the engine, for which Renault is fully responsible.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are being modified.
Changes can be translated from virtual reality to reality in less than 24 hours thanks to advanced production systems using lasers and high-tech autoclaves.
The only limit to this technical feasibility is the amount of $40 million representing the maximum that any Formula 1 team can spend for each period to improve its competitiveness.
Red Bull has set up a state-of-the-art technology plant about 50 km from London to design and manufacture its racing cars.
These are two buildings that are restricted to visitors - especially journalists - to enter.
Everything that takes place here is considered a "great secret."
The list of participants in this project includes 580 people, including two pilots - champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
The hero of Red Bull is undoubtedly the fresh champion Sebastian Vettel in Formula 1.
However, behind the immense technological resources that the energy drinks brand has invested in its participation in racing circuits, there are other protagonists whose help is invaluable and no one knows them.
Chief Manufacturing Technology Officer Steve Nevey says five years ago it was possible to say that advances in vehicle research and development contributed to a 50% victory and the rest was thanks to drivers.
Currently, this ratio has changed and the technology is worth the achievements of 85%, while the pilots contribute from 15%.
Nevey acknowledges that Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by computing, as they are "unpredictable gladiators".
HP sets up 20 stores within two years in partnership with local distributors
Hewlett-Packard (HP) in partnership with its business partner Pont Reyes today inaugurated its first exclusive store in Barcelona.
This company will be the first of a network of 20 stores with an area of 80 to 100 m2 that this multinational company plans to open in Spain in the next two years.
These stores will also be located in 16 existing retailers such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
As an example, Vice President of Spanish HP Helena Herrer mentioned the newly rebuilt store at Barcelona’s Gran Vía, owned by Pont Reyes, with which HP has been working for 30 years.
The North American company has prepared a plan to establish 200 outlets in Europe by 2013, which includes 20 Spanish stores.
The first stores were opened last week in Bucharest (Romania) and in Belgrade (Serbia), so the store in Barcelona is third.
Herrera did not want to disclose where other stores would open, but admitted that Madrid could be one of the following locations.
Herrer, who also manages HP Human Resources Systems, assured that the philosophy of opening stores will remain the same – using local distributors who have the experience and knowledge of the sector.
The North American company here advises on the exclusive design of the equipment of the stores (with products that can be interactively tested), which will be identical in Europe.
In addition, HP is also involved in staffing for business.
Helena Herrer denied that it would be a franchise, stressing that the exclusive network of stores aims to "improve customer service, services to small and medium-sized enterprises in terms of purchase, service, after-sales service and even packaging".
The Barcelona store is part of a world-class pilot program that aims to address possible problems with computer devices under warranty.
The online service is connected to a technical centre based in Maastricht (Netherlands).
"So we'll be able to solve problems within 10 minutes that might otherwise take up to two days."
“This system is specifically designed for small and medium-sized enterprises and regular customers, given that large companies already have contracted technical assistance service,” said Helena Herrerová.
Sabadell to “steal” one million customers in three years
More optimistic than other bosses, Banco Sabadell’s delegated board member Jaime Guardiola believes 2011 will be a tough year for the bank, but rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the passive war.
However, it expects to reduce interest rates, which will try to compensate by reducing bank fees and loan prices.
Sabadell expects to get a million private clients in three years.
Sabadell found a way to take advantage of the next three years and survive in difficult economic conditions.
The Bank will launch a new three-year strategic plan in 2011.
The goal is, in addition to surviving without having to turn to public aid in FROB, to gain market share by capturing a million new private clients - or 700,000, if they are deducted from those who may leave the bank - since up to now AI Institute rather than large and medium-sized enterprises have overwhelmed clients.
This year, the bank has already acquired 250,000 private clients and 50,000 businesses.
Its market share is 3.5% for private clients, while for corporate customers it is more than 10%.
Another of the basic ideas of the 2011-2013 plan is a commitment to productivity, or sobriety, in order to reduce the costs, the bank will show when it presents the results for the period.
Not many banking institutions are daring to set goals and make them public at this time, as the financial crisis has changed all the plans of world banking.
Sabadell will close its Optima program this year, set four years ago, although it was originally for three years, but the market situation required an extension for another period.
Customers who leave the savings banks will be their main target group.
At the APIE meeting, Guardiola insisted that 2011 will be "a difficult and very important year".
In fact, he believes that the path out of the crisis in Spain "will be lengthy".
In addition, in two or three years it will be "very difficult to create jobs", which is fundamental to the survival of the banking sector, he added.
And while he believes that a passive war – which reduces margins – is receding, the price of surcharges for the risk banks and savings banks pay for their emissions to receive liquidity is already shifting to lending prices, thus compensating for the reduction in margins.
"The issue of liquidity and financing is structural and will be a credit pressure factor."
"We haven't closed the tap yet, but the differentials are very high," Guardiola admitted.
Banesto already issued its network orders on Thursday to cut long-term loans and raise the prices of differentials – see CincoDías of November 22 and 27.
He also acknowledged that the trend in banking "now is a reduction in commissions", but there is a "competitive framework".
Sabadell’s strategic plan is based on organic growth, but as usual, the group does not rule out corporate operations.
It is not in vain that he assures that in Spain "they will demand larger sizes".
“Next year there will be no stone on the rock,” he said.
It confirms that the capital needs are "worthily reduced" and does not exclude that some Spanish institution will enter among the red numbers.
And it points out that FROB can supplement the fundraising on the market before the new capital measure.
Having assured that Sabadell can survive the temporary closure of markets, it continues to pose a serious problem in what some bankers predict as a new liquidity crisis.
He notes that it cannot be issued, but unlike what was in June, short-term funding can be obtained through repo rates, which alleviates the crisis.
CECA excludes another wave of spartelen mergers
The Director-General of the CECA rejected yesterday that there should be another wave of mergers of savings banks, and again insisted on the speed with which the reorganization of the sector is being carried out.
When the process of grouping the Spanish savings banks started, there were several institutions that assured that this first phase would not participate and wait for the second round.
However, the director general of the Spanish Confederation of Savings Banks (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday ruled out a new wave of these operations.
"I believe that most of the mergers have already been carried out, the incorporation of Cajasol into the Banca Cívica group cannot be considered a second round, what is happening are the conventions."
“Most are fully implemented; it is possible that instead of 17 constitutions we will go to 13 or 14, but all the major processes are already completed and under the protection of the Spanish National Bank, which has cooperated very well in this matter,” the director noted.
In his statements at the meeting of the ADEA (Association of Leaders and Executives of Aragon) Olavarrieta explained that the process of concentration is taking place "at the highest possible speed and we must be very satisfied, as shown by the instalments of the banks, which were in the plans of their time, not in the now,
"Moving from 45 savings banks with an average asset volume of 28,000 million to 17 with 75,500 million is a process that has never been compared in history, reducing the number of institutions by 62% to make them larger and thus in line with the Basel Treaty," he stressed.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there are a number of not too happy views on the slowness of the process" which show "a lack of seriousness and understanding" because "what the Spanish National Bank is doing is a reminder that we must be on time before the end of the year".
CECA Director-General José Antonio Olavarrieta said Spain had the toughest financial system in all of Europe and "probably" in the world, and attributed a "lack of knowledge" to those who question it.
The director noted that in the current favorable economic situation, “we can be calm” about financial institutions and the savings system, which has mastered the “very important” process of concentration and continues “at the highest possible speed”.
He also pointed out that Spain’s banking sector has been doing very well in the stress tests carried out by the European Central Bank in July.
Zapatero and the Red German Line
Berlin decided to maintain the euro, but set the conditions for the whole of the Union.
Tensions in the markets have provoked a double government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Zapatero proposed new adaptation measures, from the reduction of taxes for small and medium-sized enterprises, through the regulation of private intermediation agencies or the abolition of 426 euros for unemployed people without benefits, to the privatization of 49% AENA (Spanish airports and air traffic management - the state's airports and 30% of the airports), the bar.
Vice-President Elena Salgado, with the support of former Prime Minister Felipe González, on the other hand, joined in the criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel for her responsibility to trigger the current crisis.
How to interpret these movements?
It should be said in advance that Merkel’s position is not a mistake in her communication policy.
On the contrary, it is another point in the complex process of redefining the euro.
And here, Germany has a radically new vision of what its future is going to be, which runs counter to the idea of keeping the old traditions, which is held by a large part of the other members.
In the face of European resistance, Germany is beginning to speculate about three possible ways out of the crisis.
The first is a strong eurozone, which would include Germany, but also, for example, Austria or the Netherlands, while the southern states would leave the currency zone.
The second is a return to the march - although it may now seem like a sci-fi, this version has wide public support, approaching 50% of the population.
The third option, according to German proposals, is to rework the euro with greater macroeconomic oversight, budgetary rigor, fines for guilty states, possible delays in payments for some of them, and extending the possible costs of regulation to the private sector.
The German position is clear and has been defined for some time, so there is no room for turners now.
First, when both the International Monetary Fund and the European Commission spurred deficits in 2009, the German government pulled a constitutional reform out of its sleeve to prevent them from happening in 2016.
This was the first sign of a contradiction between what Germany considered correct (fiscal tightness and stability plans for public finances) and what its European partners, including France, practiced.
The second was shown by this Central European country, when Merkel painfully extended the decision to save Greece.
Already at that time it was the subject of sharp criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and public opinion, which was also published, were strongly opposed to the salvation of Greece.
Finally, in the last days of October, Merkel again emerged with a clear stance when she demanded to reform the European Union conventions so that it would be possible to save a member state while at the same time giving private creditors the obligation to bear part of the costs.
This opinion has been interpreted as anti-European, as it has accelerated the Irish crisis and everything else.
However, its proposal, albeit in a somewhat moderate form, has been approved, and in the coming months we should monitor the Union's reform process, which should allow for these measures from 2013 onwards.
Germany has drawn a red line that it does not intend to cross.
And it is telling us all that, although measures need to be taken now, with which they seem to disagree too much, from this date the old functioning of the euro will come to an end.
2013 will be the birth of a new monetary zone, in which non-compliant states will be severely sanctioned and may be forced to report deferrals of payments, and the private sector will also have to bear part of the costs.
Germany is showing us that we must take the strict path of growth with increasing the rate of savings and investment, moderate consumption, improving productivity and competitiveness, and capital reserves.
Another option based on receivables and construction, with huge gaps in the balance of payments that reigned in the years of Spain’s boom in growth, they simply do not want to tolerate.
The offer is clear.
And we'd make a mistake if we didn't understand.
It is not just about restoring the public deficit to 3% in 2013.
What they want from us is much harder.
Worst of all, under these circumstances, we may be mistaken.
I hope that these current turbulences will be replaced by more calm.
And that we will take advantage of the opportunities they give us by the spring of 2013.
Prime Minister Zapatero also seems to have understood this, and his double statement (the reforms promised after last Saturday’s meeting with big companies and yesterday’s announcement of new measures) suggests that despite criticism of Merkel, the way has opened up to the idea that things need to be put in order.
However, the red line that Germany has outlined is here, and it does not seem to want to move with it.
And from the options that can be considered, leaving the eurozone full of not too serious countries cannot be excluded.
Well, Germany will always be able to tell us that it warned us.
Sport and circumvention of rules
The Finty, as shown by Alonso and Ramos in the match against Ajax, show cleverness rather than the intention to escape punishment.
The alleged exclusion of two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramose) in the Champions League match against Ajax on 23 November caused a sea of ink to be drawn about whether or not this is unsportsmanlike behavior and whether UEFA should not have both footballers.
As is known, a few minutes before the end of the match (which had their team clearly won), the appointed players deliberately lost time one after another at the time when the foul was to be played to provoke the judge, and he showed them the second yellow card.
In this way, both players will meet the prescribed penalty in the next match against Auxerre - with Real Madrid finishing in his group in the lead - and will be able, deprived of cards, to proceed to the next phase.
In the end, the UEFA disciplinary committee fined coach José Mourinho for two games and the guilty players were fined.
Provoking a yellow card under similar conditions is not a new practice, but is more or less common in football.
It is so prevalent that it is part of the ethos of football, i.e. rules that are unwritten but watched.
Part of the discussion in this case was due to the fact that the participant was the Real Madrid team (who boasts in his anthem of nobility and honor, and who has already fined his players for similar acts), and as it seems, also thanks to the dramatization led by Mourinho, who thus adds to his long history of comedy.
In any case, the debate revolves around whether this kind of action, which is not expressly prohibited by the rules, is contrary to the principles of sport, i.e. whether circumvention of the law occurs in these acts; it is indeed an action respecting the rules of sport, the meaning of which, however, it seems, is to be circumvented.
It is a question of what kind of damage such actions cause to the sporting spirit.
One of the characteristics of sports behavior is the physical inviolability of opponents, which in these cases has not been violated, or there has not been a violent game.
Another of these characteristics of pure play is to avoid giving players an advantage over the opponent's team due to their offense - which did not happen here either.
Thus, the paradox of the action of Real Madrid players is the fact that what we normally characterize as cheating or circumvention of the law has not occurred, there has not been a covert violation of the rules in order to avoid the penalty, but this behavior should be as obvious as possible in order to receive the penalty.
They waited and liked to be punished.
The next question, however, is what benefit the perpetrators will have from their intentional offense.
Here it is necessary to state that the opponent does not get into a disadvantaged position, and that he does not make any profit in the current match, because the obvious consequence is that the team itself will have fewer players.
And this is not a useful strategy for the next match, as the club will not be able to count on these players.
The advantage obviously lies in the fact that players will start the next phase of the Champions League without cards, which could jeopardize their participation in the future match.
However, this is an advantage from a long-term perspective and with a certain degree of uncertainty, that is, at first glance the team can be eliminated, and besides this action the players will be relieved of the penalty, and they will go to the second round of cards, in which the exclusion is enough one card less than in the first round.
So how the wheels will continue, it will not be entirely clear whether this is an advantage.
In short, these actions do not go against the spirit of sport, part of which is to make strategic decisions that will allow you to get the maximum benefit within the rules.
in the case that we deal with here, the players did not aim to avoid the imposition of a penalty (which would be a clear case of circumvention of the rules), but rather chose when to submit to it.
They made strategic decisions without evading or fleeing punishment.
Although the boundary between cleverness and circumvention of rules is not entirely clear, I believe that in this case it was clearly cleverness.
It seems to me that the controversy arises for two reasons: because they were two self-exclusions and because of the way in which instructions were transmitted to provoke them from the leadership.
The damage to sporting principles by these actions is not as ethical as it is aesthetic.
Struggle of offers for the organization of Christmas parties in Barcelona
The dictate of the calendar concentrates this year the avalanche of reservations on 16 and 17 December.
The celebration of paid employees who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros is growing rapidly.
Like Turkish honey or lottery, with the arrival of December, the pre-Christmas parties are again coming, which still act as an oxygen bomb for restaurants and leisure facilities in Barcelona, but due to the crisis have resulted in a fight to get clients by reducing prices: almost everyone wants to spend 20 to 30 euros on food.
To complete the complication of the numbers, the calendar this year (when Christmas fell on Friday) concentrated requests for the week from December 13, creating an avalanche of reservations for the peak days (16th and 17th), while in the previous week there was almost no traffic.
As has been the case since 2008, when the lean years began, there are many companies that have cancelled collective parties for budgetary reasons.
In order not to leave the tradition, many employees pay for spending on parties out of their own pocket.
Regardless of the situation, many demand prices at the limit of portability, says the president of the restaurant association Gremi de Restauració de Barcelona, Gaieta Farras.
The representative of the patronage of restaurants does not at this time dare to predict what the celebrations will be this month.
"People will think it over before they make a reservation."
“They want to get out, but when it comes to pricing, they’re careful,” he adds.
Shops will go well for those "who offer quality and good service at a favorable price", he says, recalling that due to the crisis, customers tend to go down a step and most customers now want to spend around 25 euros.
Surveys at various facilities show that the biggest strain of booking requests is on the evening of December 17.
Soteras Group is reporting a real boom of reservations for this Friday, with the most demands being for expenses up to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>30, which they have adapted the offered menus, whose total prices are from <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>25 to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>30.
in another important company, which is Andilana, reading 16 establishments in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), brought the peculiarity of this year’s calendar of more early bookings, since the beginning of November.
“We made it possible and impossible to maintain last year’s prices, and our menu, which everyone should choose from, ranges from 19.95 to 30 euros,” they said.
At AN Grup, which includes El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 companies, they remain optimistic after seeing profit growth since the second half and have a relatively solid outlook for Christmas sales.
The company’s sources stress that December 18 will also be a busy day, as pre-Christmas celebrations will be held among friends.
They added a Christmas menu to their six group menus, with a budget of 30 euros or more, as they saw a tendency of guests to spend 10% more in exchange for other items such as cava (Spanish sparkling wine).
They also noted that companies are already appearing, which again invite their employees, and it seems that the size of the groups is slightly larger.
Vice President of Fecasarm (which includes institutions such as the Association of Bars, Restaurants and Leisure Centres in Barcelona) Enric Goma believes he is beginning to see the end of the tunnel, claiming that the number of reservations has "revived", although clients "agree to the maximum".
This impression did not go away even during the Christmas celebrations, no matter who pays, points out.
Pakistan's nuclear program sparked major unrest in U.S.
Islamabad is producing nuclear weapons “at a faster pace than any other country.”
WikiLeaks documents confirm ties between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the U.S. Embassy in Pakistan and the U.S. Department of State published by WikiLeaks confirms the extraordinary unrest that the Pakistani nuclear program is arousing in Washington.
In addition to the clarifying and significant details they offer regarding the content of the communication and the ideas of representatives of North American diplomacy in Islamabad, these documents reveal that cooperation between the two states in terms of nuclear security, rather than increasing, "is not in retreat" and that this "should not remove the unstable asymmetries" from the country.
The peculiarity of Pakistan’s nuclear program – that its weapons are not assembled but stored in pieces to make their destruction in the event of an attack more difficult – is one of the main reasons for Washington’s vigilance.
This is calculated by Ambassador Anne W. Patterson to Pakistan in a report before a visit to the then National Security Advisor James Jones: “The proximity of some nuclear facilities to the territory under Taliban control, the alleged dispersion of atomic material from the transport of nuclear materials”.
The increased number of people associated with nuclear arsenals and the missile-controlled program is no longer observed only in the US, but also in Russia, as a growing and presenting reason to be on the alert.
"Pakistan has had to hire personnel with strict religious beliefs to protect its nuclear facilities; given the decline in the level of education and culture, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people who will work in nuclear programs or missile-controlled programs," Yury Korolev, a U.S. secretary of state, said.
The biggest novelty of the documentary published by Julian Assange’s server is the ever-lowering cooperation between the US and Pakistan on nuclear proliferation issues and the increased pace of Pakistan’s production of these weapons.
A decree issued by the embassy in May, which qualifies communication with Pakistan as "frustrating", says: "Transparency often does not exist; aid offers remain unanswered or are rejected."
In another report, Peter Lavoy, a national intelligence official for South Asia, notes that “despite the economic disaster, Pakistan is producing nuclear weapons as fast as any other country in the world.”
Ambassador Petterson also urged Washington to “very well clarify” during the visit of Army Chief General Ashfaq Kayani that “the Pakistani army must stop tacitly supporting terrorist groups.”
She is the head of WikiLeaks.
Obama appoints a high-ranking official responsible for counter-terrorism to avoid new leaks.
Interpol is issuing a “red call” to track and determine where Assange might be.
Everything about WikiLeaks and its founder Julian Assange is a complicated labyrinth where it’s hard to be sure of the facts.
Yesterday, Interpol announced an “extraordinary call,” the so-called red notice, to “locate and monitor the movement” of Assange.
However, this is not a classic detention order.
Moreover, this challenge is not new, but dates back to November 20.
And it has nothing to do with the latest leak of more than a quarter of a million diplomatic documents, but with the allegations of sexual abuse that Australians face in Sweden.
In addition, WikiLeaks’ lawyer, Mark Stephens, assures that “the police know where and how to contact Mr. Assange.”
It was on 20 November that an international police corps based in Lyon, France, issued the order at the request of Sweden, but did not publish it until yesterday, when it received permission from the Swedish authorities.
In this situation, 188 Interpol countries have instructions to identify or locate Assange "in order to impose a temporary bond on him and issue it".
Although Interpol cannot order the detention of the person concerned by the red call, many Member States, as the organisation has explained, consider the so-called red notice to be an enabling detention - this must be ensured by the national police department - especially in the case where the states have a bilateral agreement on the detention of the suspects.
Assenge’s lawyers, who published a letter yesterday, said that the 39-year-old founder of WikiLeaks was willing to answer Swedish authorities’ questions via videoconferencing.
They also recall that Assenge requested and subsequently received permission to leave Sweden from the prosecutor of his case, which they compare to the legendary Lavrenti Pavlovic Beria, head of Stalin’s security.
“This is a hunt and not legal persecution,” the letter reads.
While the whole world is looking for him - and his mother from Australia defends his son's innocence - Assange is still in an unknown place, but he is not silent.
On Monday, he gave an interview via Skype from an unknown location to Time magazine's editor-in-chief - in that interview, he demanded the resignation of U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
"If it turns out that she was responsible for ordering U.S. diplomats to conduct espionage at the United Nations and thus violate the international conventions that the United States signed, she should resign," he said.
His opinion was rejected yesterday by White House press spokesman Robert Gibbs, who called the demand for resignation "ridden and absurd".
"I'm not quite sure why we should care about the opinion of the individual who operates the website," he told CNN.
Obama himself commissioned a senior anti-terrorism official, Russell Traverse, to prevent further leaks of documents.
President Barack Obama’s intention to stop adding importance to Assange contrasts with the views proclaimed by conservative politicians and commentators these days.
Peter King, a member of Congress who will chair the National Security Committee in the Lower Chamber from January, has asked the State Department to explore the possibility of including WikiLeaks among terrorist organizations “so that anyone who contributes financially or otherwise provides assistance can be intervened and prosecuted.”
Tom Flanagan, an adviser to Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, went further, saying that Assange should be "killed", which he had to then call off.
"Obama should write a reward on it or use an unmanned aircraft or something like that."
Who did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, a Baptist priest, a former governor of Arkansas and a possible presidential candidate.
“Whoever is in government, whoever is responsible for the leak, has committed treason and any punishment other than execution would be too mild,” he said.
Puigcercós seeks peace in ERC by "blinding" on supporter Caroda
The Republican leader will allow the party to secretly vote on his stay.
Huguet proposes a more plural executive and the end of the meeting system.
Joan Puigcercós apparently found a recipe for fighting the already several internal revolts in the ranks of the ERC (Left Republican Party of Catalonia), unsuccessful due to the loss of 11 MPs and half of the votes.
The leader of the party is aware that his gesture about resignation seems inadequate to the followers of former leader Josep Lluís Caroda-Rovira, and also knows that the influence of this sector is already as weakened as its leader himself today, and that it absolutely cannot cause him the same concern that he had with the others.
Therefore, the leader of the Left will try to get new critics using blinking, which will help him turn to the municipal elections.
Puigcercós announced yesterday that more than 200 members of the national committee will be able to speak secretly about his stay in office.
Using ballot papers, not raising your hand.
If the Caroda supporters want to pass the criminal vote on to the president, they will be able to do so without fear of retaliation.
In fact, the boss wants to avoid division and submission of his person.
In several interviews, he claimed that he would not consider himself confirmed with half the vote and one extra, but added, without specifying the percentage, that it would also not be a good result "after Bulgaria".
Caroda's supporters demand more from the president than to make his office available - a gesture they consider to be of no importance, as Puigcercos controls the largest organ in the congress.
But since they do not have a sufficient majority to enforce resignations, they will try to remind the executive of the plan from now until May.
For this reason, they expect to participate in the preparation of a strategic reorientation document, which will be voted on by the leadership of the National Council on the 18th of the month.
Their goal is to support Puigcercós in return for promising to move Congress as early as autumn 2011.
The ERC leader said "multiple-vote" was damaging stability and that its goal was to ensure that the organization was able to wash its dirty laundry behind closed doors once and for all.
In this context, it seems to be a characteristic article that current adviser Josep Huguet signed on his blog.
After considering Puigcercós’s ideology, this innovation advisor took it for granted that the leader would be confirmed “in exchange for several goals”.
And he appointed five of them, two of which stand out.
The first is to "recompose" the executive so that it represents at least 90% of the members, which means to include also new faces who are from the sector inclined to Carod.
The second goal can be great news.
Huguet proposes that the ERC completely end the meeting as a mechanism of operation.
And so it is fighting for the reform of the statutes so that congresses can be held through delegates elected by vote.
The end of the model of the system of meetings, an exception in the Spanish system of political parties, is the intended goal of Puigcercós’ team, which has fought in this direction already in the last two congresses.
However, the 2008 congressional assembly decided that the meeting must be assessed at a special congress on statute reforms.
This issue is still pending, as the situation within the party has discouraged the resolution of this issue.
Now, without the hovering critical sectors, it might be a good time to re-examine this issue and try to close it once and for all.
23 murders per month November; 390 per year 2010
According to the MILENIO newspaper, Mexico recorded a decrease of 4 cases compared to 2010.
In November, 23 people were killed in Mexico, four fewer than in the previous month, according to the newspaper MILENIO.
Among the murders are cases of three women and the discovery of a pair of separate bodies in the Valley of Mexico.
In the penultimate month of the year, there are a total of 390 murders in Mexico, presumably linked to organized crime.
Among the cases is the discovery of a corpse in San Diego de los Padres Cuexcontitlán, in the district of Toluca.
The victim suffered at least three gunshot wounds, a further grace wound to the head and had her hands and legs tied with a rope.
The next day, a body was found in a trunk, which was stored in the trunk of the vehicle above Mixtecas Street, in the colony of Santa Cruz Acatlán, in the district of Naucalpan.
Early in the morning on Thursday, November 4, co-workers discovered a body bearing the marks of torture and at least three deadly shots in the chest off the Tenango-Ixtapan de la Sal highway in the Villa Guerrero district.
Next to the body was a report signed by the allegedly criminal organization La Familia Michoacana.
A day later in Nezahualcóyotl, a 50-year-old man was killed by eight gunshots after he left his house and wanted to start collecting garbage.
On November 7th, two 30-year-old victims were shot dead in the head in the colony of San Pedro Xalaxtoc, in the district of Ecatepec.
A body of a man shot in the forehead was found on a remote road in the El Naranjo colony in Chalco, and a 25-caliber gun shell was found underneath the body.
In Ecatepec, parts of the human body were found in the sewage channel in the colony of Playa Golondrina.
Rescue files conducted a thorough search for other parts of it, but did not find them.
Residents of Tepotzotlán reported finding a body with their hands tied backwards and their heads wrapped at the site of Pena Colorada.
The man had a gunshot wound on his back.
In the middle of the month, the murder of two men who were wrapped in bed linen and left in the trunk of the vehicle in Villas de la Hacienda in the district of Atizapán de Zaragoza was reported, and reports of death were found among the victims.
A day later, a cardboard box containing a human head was found in the Valle de los Reyes colony in the Los Reyes La Paz district.
In a nearby colony, the rest of the body was found, wrapped in a black plastic bag, with a message from El Incorregible.
On the 17th, two dead women were found wrapped in Mario's bed linen in the settlement of Zoquiapan in the district of Ixtapaluca, and the next morning in Huixquilucan, a dead man was found wrapped in a yellow-blue sheet, who was provisionally identified by the report of his murderer.
In Ixtapaluca, a woman with no sign of life was found in the settlement of San Francisco Acuautla with two wounds to the buttocks.
On the skin of the woman, tattoos of the sacred figure of Santa Muerte (literally "Holy Death" - pozn.
At the end of the month, a body of a man with at least a third gunshot wound and a report signed by a criminal group was found in the car in the village of Zinacantepec.
Two days later, the bodies of two men with their heads wrapped in a ribbon were found in the village of Puente de Piedra, in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
For the victims, the report was probably written by one of the criminal organizations, which said: "This will happen to those who do not adapt."
In Ecatepec, two bodies were found carrying torture marks and tied limbs inside an abandoned taxi behind the Justice Centre in the colony of San Agustín.
On the last day of the month, the remains of two men were found in the districts of Los Reyes La Paz and Nezahualcóyotl.
The first was sliced and found in the Cuchilla Ancón colony and was wrapped in black plastic bags, tied with a ribbon and left with a message; while the second was tortured and found in a plastic package in the streets of Colonia Juárez.
Along with him, the agents also found a ticket with a message.
China meets its goal of reducing greenhouse gases
The country’s representative at the UN climate change conference COP16 assured that his country has made extraordinary efforts to reduce the carbon footprint, and clarified that it insists on its promise to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45% by 2020.
China will deliver on its pledge to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45% by 2020, said Su Wei, the country’s representative at the UN climate change conference.
In his first public speech at the 16th Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, Su Wei assured that his country had made tremendous efforts to reduce the carbon footprint and transform its industry.
He said his country has already invested $245 million over the past four years in an effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
However, he made it clear that China will not change its goals and will continue to work on this issue together with the international community.
He noted that China's strategy on climate change is divided into four items: dialogue, capacity building, institution building and support for pilot programmes.
In all these points, progress has already been made, including last year’s approval of a new energy law, which includes the proposed greenhouse gas emission reduction targets, he explained.
He further stressed that in China, federal authorities have worked in coordination with provincial and local authorities to achieve their goals in terms of energy savings, energy efficiency and emission reduction.
Furthermore, he said, various multi-annual plans are underway or have already been completed, which are funded by both the Chinese government and the governments of other states.
It is, for example, the Energy Efficiency Programme, which has been implemented over the last five years and which has received investments from the UN, the government and private initiatives.
A provincial project on climate change is also underway, as well as a project to exchange fluorescent lamps for energy-saving bulbs and a project to mitigate and adapt, he said.
At the same table, Martin Krol, the country’s expert climate change advisor, assured that China’s efforts were greater than generally thought.
For example, he explained, greenhouse gas emissions per capita in China represent 6 tons, while in the United States it is 100 tons; China is responsible for 9% of the historical share of emissions.
It has also made unprecedented efforts in terms of energy use – for example, it has increased energy efficiency by 20% over the past five years and expects to make further progress by 2020, he added.
The Legal Exclusion of Espina: César Nava
The National Chairman of the PAN Party (Partido Acción Nacional, Czech National Action Party) stated that the former chairman of this party is entitled to apply to the National Order Commission of his right.
The national leader of the PAN party, César Nava Vázquez, assured that the expulsion of Manuel Espina Barrientos had been legalized, and that the former president of that party was entitled to turn to the National Order Commission and claim his rights.
In an interview before the objection was raised by the Governor of the state Gabin Cué Monteagud, he said that the exclusion of Espino is in any case a decision taken at the local level.
"This is an autonomous decision of the Order Commission in Sonora."
"Mr Espino has the right to appeal in his case through a complaint to the Order Commission of the National Council in order to make it a decision made by the competent authority," he added.
He further explained that now is not the time to think about 2012, and that she has never been at the negotiating table about the alliance’s presidential candidacy.
Nava Vázquez expressed his belief that the PAN will emerge from the internal elections held on 4 and 5 December, in which his successor will be elected, strengthened.
"This (the 2012 alliance) is a topic that has never been at the negotiating table, at least not so far, it was an intention for a local election that was successful and fulfilled its purpose," he said.
President PAN said that there are 71 years of dialogue behind him, and therefore "we are not afraid of internal competitiveness, on the contrary, we benefit from it and strengthen us", he added.
He said the committee would be able to select the best president or chairwoman the PAN deserves for the next three years without debate, so it would hand over the staff to "whom the committee determines".
"I am therefore absolutely calm and relaxed, and I will proudly hand over the office of the party leader to any of the five."
He predicted that the rise that the party saw in the last elections in July would be reflected in future kneelings, although “there is still no time to think about 2012.”
"Now we need to accompany Governor Gabin Cué in this task."
In this context, he stressed that these three governments, rooted in the alliances in Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa, will represent the flag and will be the subject of observation throughout the country, as "many expectations and desires have been placed in them, and I am sure that Gabino will do so".
When we asked him about the criticism of President Felipe Calderón by the PRI (Partido Revolucionario Institucional, Czech Revolutionary Institutional Party) for his speeches within the four years that he ruled, César Nava called on the members of the PRI to think about the six-year periods of Carlos de Salerino and former Presidents Erne.
“If they think the governments of Zedil and Salinas were better than the governments of Fox and Claderón, let them start defending them, let them get out of their way,” he said.
He stated that the head of the federal executive power has the right to express himself as he did during his speech at the National Audit Office, since there is no use of censorship or censorship in this country.
Obama Promotes Twitter Law to Support Students with No Documents
“If you think the Dream Act is right to pass, let your senators know and urge them to pass it,” Trump tweeted.
President Barack Obama tweeted on Tuesday that he was joining a national mobilization in support of the Dream Act, which is supposed to legalize undocumented students.
“If you think the Dream Act is right, let your senators know and urge them to pass it,” Obama tweeted.
His brief report draws attention to the Internet link to a larger document, which asks the public to contact senators immediately as the vote on the bill approaches.
"Since the vote is expected to take place soon, now is the time to let your opinion be heard," he said.
The report was released after 42 Republican senators threatened to block the passage of any law unless an extension of Bush-era tax cuts and government funding were approved.
Such a blockade, which was announced in a letter signed by 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote on the Dream Act and other projects, such as the ratification of a new treaty with Russia against nuclear proliferation, called START.
Asked about the Republican blocking of the Dream Act and other proposals, the presidential spokesman said he believes that once the fiscal issue is resolved, it will be possible to compile a calendar for the rest of the projects.
"I believe there's still plenty of time..."
"We all agree that we need to resolve the tax issue before the end of the year..."
I believe that we will be able to reach an agreement at some point on this matter and then we will be able to plan the order of other matters," he said.
Senate Democratic Majority Leader Harry Reid announced on Tuesday that he would request a "close-up vote" on the Dream Act, so a proposal to legalize undocumented students could be voted on in the Senate from next Thursday, though it is more likely next week.
The Senate approval of the Dream Act, or the “American Dream” Act, would legalize some 800,000 young people who entered the United States before the age of 16, stayed in the country for the past five years, and were admitted to a higher education institution or the military.
However, supporters need 60 votes to approve the bill, which is why they need the help of several Republicans, so the organizations of its supporters are conducting intense agitation to ensure the approval of the bill.
The Democrats, most of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 mandates.
However, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, expressed that he would vote against, and only one Republican, Richard Lugar of Indiana, expressed his support for the bill.
That’s why supporters of the Dream Act need to get a few Republicans in case other Democrats decide to reject the proposal.
Among the Republican senators with whom supporters are most negotiating are Senators from Maine Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as the resigning Florida senator George Lemieux, who supplemented the mandate of Senator Melo Martinez.
Other Republicans who have supported the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch of Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas, but they said they will not support it next time.
Another Republican who supported the proposal, John McCain, has not yet commented.
Although the House of Representatives will stick to a different version, according to most analysts, the Dream Act will face the biggest obstacles in the Senate.
with literature put a finger in the wound ("poner el dedo en la llaga", translated "put a finger in the wound" is the equivalent of Czech "to hit a nail on the head - pozn. overkl.)
The second round of the Pleasure of Language Cycle was a promenade where participants presented a literary gala performance
"I understand this with Sex in the language, but... the finger in the wound? What do you expect from me?", asked the writer Luisa Valenzuelo, who was invited to start the second round Pleasure with the language, a cycle that celebrates literature written in the Spanish language, and the question of which was used under her tongue.
The finger in the wound "brings us into the narrows", said the gently Argentine writer to the audience, composed mainly of young people, who met at the International Book Fair in Guadalajara to hear this debate at the round table by Luís, Valérie, and Monte Schulz.
Luisa Valenzuela read the text she gave to Gonzalo Celari, which Schultz later described as a great story in which Luisa acted in the first person as the protagonist, who, in search of knowledge of what the "wound" is, goes from doctor to doctor, from which she does not get the answer, although she does not get the answer.
From the infectologist, she goes on to say, "Patience is not my strength, maybe it will be my wound."
Eventually, after frustration with the traumatologist who took her breath in the middle of the road, but explained to her that the wound is not a scientific term, it is a psychoanalyst who reveals the secret: "the wound represents it really open, and the symbolic is the scar."
The protagonist sighed lightly and concluded that "she was only able to learn so much about the wound, that it is really open and that it does not exist", but she became convinced that the pleasures and temptations in the language must go hand in hand.
The writer Valenzuela played with both.
Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also came up with a delightful tale, which he called The Praise of Invention, in which the finger in the wound is not named, but at one point it appears.
with elements of magical realism tells about the famous witch, who played the clouds, brought back the people who went far, or repaired the honesty lost by a virgin, this story, which then turned to speak America, a great novel, in which, from the beginning, the writer did not miss his own
Cervantes, who invented us all, ridiculed the fake testimony that was presented in the stories as real, but never succeeded in telling the story of America in such a fictional way that it lacked even the stud.
However, he stressed, "they are fools and liars who have a greater fantasy" and precisely where reality and lie merge, where it is no longer known what belongs to one group and what belongs to the other, fictitious literature reaches its peak.
This is called the Cervantes tradition.
"Thanks to his legacy, we have what we have."
Then Mayra Monterová emphasized and praised the variety of interpretations that the invitation of the International Book Fair with her word Finger in the Wound made possible.
A Cuban-Portuguese writer has pointed her finger at the great blow of social violence that her country – and Latin America shares it – is the result of trade disputes and drug trafficking.
“I think good literature, good poetry and good songs conclude a silent compromise that of course is not intended,” she said after stating that the reality of literature is the communication and dimension of the compromise that is created between the author and the reader – and in their “chemical reaction.”
The evening was concluded by the Spanish poet Luis García Montero, whose performance also emphasized "this finger in the wound of the writer committed by the writer".
He said that in a world that lives in a hurry, also in the intellectual habits and control of consciousness that overwhelms dogmatisms, one forgets that "behind every invocation there is a small no, and behind every denial there is also a small yes".
"To be masters of our thoughts and realities we must color: and to color means many times to put a finger in the wound and to bother those individuals who are much more comfortable, because they think in cartoons, in black-and-white, in fixed ideas and without coloring, to bother the world, and to bother the authorities that prefer these."
Romano is going for his first title.
Rubén Omar Romano scored three defeats in the final, experienced both good and bad during his career, but was able to achieve three times in the decisive series.
in the Santos Laguna and Monterrey duel in the final, in addition, they will face two different styles characterized by their techniques, teams that have a noticeable difference in results.
Rubén Omar Romano scored three defeats in the final, experienced both good and bad during his career, but managed to achieve already on three occasions in the decisive series, but until now he left with the loss, and that is why this opportunity is extraordinary for him.
The Argentine had to settle for a silver medal, remained a step behind the winner and curiously played with the same team in the following finals.
The Santistic strategist reached his first final in the Apertura 2002 tournament, when he had in his hand the reins of club Morelia, with whom he lost a total of 4-2 against Toluca; then in the Clausura 2003 tournament he again moved to the decisive duel and also lost it with the team's overall score of Ray 3-1, which was against.
Already with Santos Laguna in the tournament of Torneo Bicentenario 3 mins, but again against the "Devils" of Toluca, Rubén suffered a defeat again, although his team played against the "Uzenári" (another nickname of the club Deportivo Toluca - posn. overcl.) after 210 minutes of the game, he lost to the 2nd of the game.
Ruben has already lost two finals against the Red Devils of Toluca and one against his future rival, Monterrey, so he would like to avoid the same fate and get rid of the curse, and could thus for the first time celebrate the title, although he says it is the most important institution for him.
"I want to come out as a winner, I don't want to break the statistics, this is for the club, for the passion I'm committed to, and the title would of course be for me, but the first one is the most important," the coach said when asked about the numbers that speak against him in the final.
in the live memory has a previous finale, in which, as he confirms, he learned a lot, "we took the lesson that until the referee whistles the end, we can not celebrate, we must be ready for action, as well as the players, because last time with two penalties, we were already ready to run, we were not ready to celebrate"
He does not worry that this series could be decided in the penalty shootouts, but he does not believe his players: "You never try to get to the penalty kicks, you try to end in normal time, but sometimes there is no other option and you need to be prepared, in the last tournament we would be prepared
In his hands, Romano has a chance to stop being the second and taste for the first time the glory that the titles bring.
The U.S. is changing its visa rules.
People will have to contact the Visa Applicant Services Centers before the Consular Department interview; costs will be lower and waiting time will be shortened.
As of January 10, 2011, the visa process at the U.S. Embassy and Consulates will change.
with the new procedure, the majority of applicants will have to contact the Visa Applicant Services Centres (abbreviated from ASC) before the interview at the Consular Department.
The ASC personnel will collect the biometric information of the applicant and they will be evaluated by the Consular Department prior to the interview.
The new procedure will have certain benefits, including the following:
The total cost of obtaining a visa will be lower, there will be no need to pay a fee for arranging a meeting, second for processing the application and others for the delivery of the document by the transport service.
The applicant will only pay a single fee to cover all three services.
The current tariff will remain unchanged: an amount equivalent to $140 per tourist visa, $150 for visa applications (including temporary worker visas) and $390 for business and investor visas.
People who want to renew their visa will not need to have an interview with a consular officer, but will only contact the nearest ASC, where they will submit their documents and their fingerprints will be taken.
Since biometric information will be collected at the ASC, applicants who will require a second interview meeting at the Consular Department will spend less time here than in the past.
Similarly, those who apply for a visa at consulates in Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay an additional $26 service fee.

NASA Announces Discovery of Extraterrestrial Life
The U.S. Space Agency convened a press conference tomorrow to present a discovery that could cause a breakthrough in the search for extraterrestrial life.
The U.S. National Aviation and Space Administration (NASA) is announcing an astrobiological discovery Thursday that could confirm the theory of extraterrestrial life.
The discovery will be presented tomorrow at 1 p.m. by experts in astrobiology, a science that deals with the study of the origin, evolution, distribution and future of life in space, at a press conference at NASA headquarters in Washington.
Inviting journalists, NASA assured that it would present a "discovery that will cause a breakthrough in the search for extraterrestrial life", prompting speculation by experts from other countries.
The discovery could confirm the theory that there are other creatures besides us, living in inhospitable conditions that were considered uninhabitable, and that could present the possibility that one day they will become intelligent creatures, such as humans, if the conditions in which they live improve.
It appears to be a microbe that was found at the bottom of Lake Mono in Yosemite National Park, California, where it lives in an environment that was considered too toxic for any form of life, as the lake is rich in arsenic.
The creature somehow uses arsenic for its life, and it is this ability that increases the likelihood that similar life could exist on other planets that do not have the atmosphere that is on Earth.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it will be proved that “there is another, different form of life than the one we know.”
The space agency will announce the real extent of the discoveries at tomorrow's press conference.
The conference will be attended by geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who studies the possibility of life on Mars; biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists exploring Titan (the largest moon of Saturn) with the prospect that its chemical composition is similar to that on Earth.
PRD, PT, Covergencia and Patron produce opposition "block"
Reforms of the Constitutional Act on Congress lead to the advent of "bipartism", they declare.
The 60th parliamentary period had not yet begun, when the opposition bloc was formed in the Congress, led by the MPs of the PRD (Partido de la Revolución Democrática, Czech "Party of the Democratic Revolution", PT (Partido del Trabajo, Czech "Party of Labour", Jesús" and Convergence).
Before the start of the 60th parliamentary term, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez from Convergencia, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza from PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo from PRD and Patrón Montalvo "heated" against the reform of the Constitutional Act, as it repeals them.
With this reform, they repeated, "bapartism" begins, because now it will be two people from the same number of parties who will control Congress.
These four MEPs, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aquilar, PRD party coordinator, were the only ones to vote against the Council, led by Salvador López Brit on behalf of the PAN (Partido Acción, Czech "National Action Party" - known as) and Vice President Luis Prezden C.
Corvera Quevedo stated that these reforms institutionally constitute political marginality at the instigation of the PRI (Partido Revolucionario Institucional) and the PAN.
He clarified that in the coming days they will talk to the representatives of the PAN and PRI parties to modify the scheme on the basis of political will, and if they do not have it, they will again be subjected by these two parties, ending the opposition coalition.
“When I get here, I look at it because we are excluded from any decision, they are not even willing to consider the opinions of others.”
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, on behalf of Convergencia, said that they agree with the PRD, PT and Patrón and will therefore form a pluralist group.
It is not possible to allow, he continued, that Congress, after being monopolistic, be now "duopolar".
The aspiration of the reform of the law is not that there should be endless bipartism in Congress.
This group starts with five lawmakers and its members are now talking to other colleagues to get more votes, as Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez added.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of the PT explained that at the moment Congress has become a "prey" of two - in reference to the PAN and PRI parties.
"It used to be controlled by one side, but now it's divided by two."
Patron Montalvo asked that the personality of the Member be respected, that he be given a seat at the negotiating table.
"In order for the five of us, probably already nine, but now they see us in five, not to be left out because of the crooked agreements, each in a different faction, we have come together to find a place at the negotiating table, because the problem is that in the reform that we have formed, we will not agree with, and we will not push away."
A further 200,000 pesos is issued for the "supplier"
The town hall in Mazatlan will pay another check to the owner of the company supplying the electrical material.
Another check for just over 200,000 pesos was sent by the mayor to Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos.
Thus, the amount paid in this second semester to the owner of the company supplying the electrical material rises to 1,200,000 pesos.
According to the transparency page of the town hall, this last check number 9258447 was sent on November 16 of this year, it was issued to the amount of 200.144,56 pesos and as its subject was indicated "compensation of unpaid payments".
Treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno noted that the municipality will pay this supplier, which was monitored by the Supreme State Audit Office for selling at high prices, another amount.
What has not been said is the total amount that the town hall still owes her, and how many more checks will be sent to Camach Palazuelos.
"Nothing has been bought now, only what we owe it to her, as well as to other suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last checks "reappeared" in the last quarter of the year: September 24, two on October 15, October 19, October 29, and the last on November 16.
Although this entrepreneur has not yet been published in the Government Gazette, as stated by the law in the case of companies audited by the Supreme State Audit Office, to prevent their services from being used by other administrative authorities, the Treasurer assured that she did not re-use the services of the Town Hall’s supplier.
In the past, after July 25, the Noroeste newspaper published a review of the checks issued by the town hall to its suppliers, which revealed that in the period from March 2008 to July 9, 2010, during the three-year period of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, the city of Camacho paid more than 10 million pesos through the city of Palazuelos.
She also carried out transactions with Jumapam, where she collected checks for more than 3 million pesos.
Tourist sites need to be maintained.
Tourist managers complain about the accident of a foreign tourist because of the poor condition of the Sánchez Taboada road in Mazatlán.
After the fall of a foreign tourist into the depths of Sánchez Taboada, the tourism sector in Mazatlán asks authorities to pay attention to areas and places that are in poor condition, and thus do not show the port in good light.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Association of Traders of the Zona Dorada region, recalled that they repeatedly asked to take care of the impression of the destination, and the bad that tourists find here, to be replaced by new activities or routes.
He said that the poor condition of the streets and sidewalks affects tourists who walk here and see the disorder, which adversely affects nearby businesses.
“Politicians don’t know what it’s like to shut down a business for a day, and they don’t have an idea of the trades they’re avoiding, otherwise they wouldn’t have dealt with these issues for so long and without proper planning.”
Hotelier José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said the fall of the tourist caused a lack of preventive measures and maintenance by the town hall.
"The worker will have to take responsibility and prevent something like this from happening again, he will have to devote himself to preventive maintenance, not just fixing existing flaws," he said.
We would like to enjoy a clean city, because not only because we are a tourist area, maintenance should be done, but also because as residents we deserve clean housing, the city council should change its strategy for the maintenance of the city."
There are also other places that look neglected and miserable, noted, such as the Emblem of Mazatlan and El Venadito (monument, statue of a deer).
"In today's time, tourists come, not only the promotion, it is necessary to offer a good product, that is, a city flooded with the cleanliness of its beaches and streets, where the constant maintenance of tourist attractions is carried out," he said.
"There has not been the necessary attention paid to this, and these facts emphasize something that is well known to everyone, maintenance is missing.
Speaking about a number of places that need to be put in order in cooperation with the town hall, he said that the priority must be to keep the city clean and in order to make it attractive because it has tourist potential.
Raúl Llera Martínez, subsecretary of the Tourism Promotion, said that the rescue of tourist sites in Mazatlan is urgent because they are not used correctly and do not make a good impression.
Fortunately, Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural destinations and spaces, but it will be necessary to put in order first to make these places attractive and to be able to include them in the list that we have for the promotion of this destination.
IP asks Congress for results
Eduardo Dávalos, President of the CCE, would like Members to take great responsibility by setting an example in the search for a better Sinaloa, in the various challenges that the state faces.
A parliamentary period full of dignified work and without agreements between the parties and the State Executive is required by the business sector in Mazatlan, because Sinaloa is in a state of convulsions and facing major problems.
Since yesterday, the 60th parliamentary term, consisting of seven political forces, 19 PRI MPs, 13 from the PAN, three from the Partido Nueva Alianza, two from the PRD, one from the PT, one from the Convergencia and the last from the PVEM, which includes a total of 40 national representatives.
On the list of expectations from the new members of Congress is that they will be able to implement decent leadership, with commitments to society and the various areas that require responsible legislative work, and that the same partisan and paternalist patrons will not repeat themselves.
Eduardo Dávalos Zamora, Chairman of the Coordinating Business Council (CCE), has proposed that the recently elected 40 members of Congress should take on great responsibility and set an example on the path to better Sinaloa in the various challenges it faces.
“We expect MPs to actually exercise their right, without agreements between the parties, because they usually take measures to promote their own interests and they become carnival parades of rulers and leaders of parliamentary factions.”
Therefore, he spoke of the need to confirm the commitment to establish the necessary interlocks that would move the ruling forward in order.
“We want them to do a decent job and be above all committed to society and sectors, because it was the Sinaloa people who gave them their vote of confidence in the past elections.”
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Tres Islas Hotel Association, said that one of the biggest challenges for 40 national representatives will be to gather all forces in an effort to achieve the country’s economic growth, because the current economic situation is very complex.
The most important thing is to stimulate economic growth in order to create incentives for investment and infrastructure, which in some ways will support the creation of jobs."
With regard to tourism, he asked that the new legislators give him more weight within the state budget and support the Ministry of Tourism.
"I have learned that it is a ministry with the second lowest budget, which is disproportionate given that it is an important economic activity, bringing currencies and investments, which in addition directly compete with agriculture."
In addition to issuing funds for start-up tourism projects, Congress should help provide the state with security and help with an alcohol law that failed to be resolved in previous parliamentary periods.
The Three Kings are looking for
Dolls, cars and bicycles are on the wish list of children in the Coronado family Valenzuela.
It will be difficult for their parents to fulfill their dreams on the upcoming Feast of the Three Kings, since their household has exactly 12 people and one ram.
However, Adelaide, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaiah, José Juan and Miguel do not lose hope that Kaspar, Melichar and Baltazar will give them the toys and clothes they so long for.
The family lives in a modest dwelling in the village of Colonia Salvador Allende in poor conditions, as the father does not have a permanent job.
"Sometimes it's hard because the husband is not lucky, but we sell mandarins and potatoes... In the afternoon I go out with the "plebeians" on the street to sell on the street," said Cayetana Valenzuelova Andrade, the mother of the children.
Four-year-old Adelaide wants a doll or a bike, while her three-year-old sister Isabel would like a Barbie doll.
As for ten-year-old José Alfredo, he would have wanted a "monster" car for some time, and for his eight-month-old brother Jesúse, Cayetana would have wanted clothes the size of a year.
"He told me [José Alfredo] 'I wish I had this monster car' but I told him 'we'll see the son' because it was very expensive," Cayetana recalled.
For older children who were just in school, it would be ideal to wear clothes and shoes.
María Guadalupe, who is 11 years old, is a size 12, ten-year-old Isaiah is a size 10, while eight-year-old Miguel is wearing a size 8.
Fourteen-year-old José Juan lacks sneakers, so a pair of five-and-a-half or six sizes might be a good fit for him.
To help fulfill the dreams of children of the Coronado family Valenzuela, you can participate in the campaign "The Three Kings Are Looking", and at the reception of the Noroeste newspaper to bring a gift or cash.
14 Suspected Drug Dealers Arrested
Dozens of inspections were carried out in Estonia, on Wednesday, as part of the dismantling of the network for the production and sale of Indian cannabis.
Fourteen people have been arrested and face various charges.
The tours took place in Sherbrooke, Orford, and Stoke, mostly at the sites used to manufacture drugs.
"About 750 cradle of Indian hemp, four kilograms of hashish, money and the equipment that was used to make it was seized," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, a Quebec police spokesman.
A total of eleven men and three women were arrested, both of whom were allegedly heads of the entire network, two men from Sherbrooke.
The detainees had to appear at the Sherbrooke Judicial Palace following their arrest.
They could face charges of producing Indian cannabis, possessing it for the purpose of trading it, plotting and stealing, among others.
These inspections followed a long-term investigation, which lasted almost a year.
"It was the information we received from the public that allowed us to access these arrests," Ruel said.
This police operation involved 70 officers from the Estrie Regional Investigation Unit of the City of Quebec State Police, the Sherbrooke State Police and the Sherbrooke Memphremagog Police Administration.
Illegal migration will be able to continue without problems.
The Conservatives bill, which the government says should regulate the problem of ships loaded by illegal immigrants, will obviously be defeated, while all three opposition parties on Wednesday said they could not support it.
"I rely to a great extent on the Charter."
"I stand directly on the side of the party that built the granite under your feet," said Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff, surrounded by MPs after a week-long session of the weekly du caucus.
The Liberals insist that the bill, as proposed, would violate the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which would allow detaining for up to one year any person from a ship identified as carrying an illegal immigrant.
The head of the Quebec Bloc, Gilles Duceppe, also said he could not support the bill because it was heading towards the wrong goal.
"We are against and it seems that all the opposition parties are against, so we will see what the government will do," Duceppe said.
NPD critic of immigration, Olivia Chow, has rejected critics who want her party not strong enough when it comes to illegal immigrants.
“The neo-democrats agree that we should take action against the transferees of illegal immigrants, and that is what we see as the backbone of another bill, C-35,” Chow said.
“We don’t support the Conservative bill because it blames refugees and imprisons children for at least one year,” Chow said.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney accused the opposition parties.
“Canadians are collectively telling MPs that they don’t tolerate this kind of illegal immigration, these criminal operations that take Canada by surprise and treat it like a pathologist.”
They expect Canada to take consistent action, Minister Kenney responded.
The government has not declared a vote of confidence in its bill, which could lead the country to the elections leading to its rejection.
One conservative told QMI that the government would ask for a vote so that every MP who is against would be held accountable for his position in front of his voters.
New unity does not mean unanimity.
Despite the announcement of the possible establishment of a permanent anti-corruption and collusion unit, many observers continue to demand the establishment of a public commission of inquiry on the issue.
The Minister of Public Safety, Robert Dutil, is striving to keep this idea in mind: Quebec intends to consult with the New York Department of Investigation on this issue as early as January next year.
Metropolis has had a permanent anti-corruption unit since 1870.
So Tuesday's announcement surprised none of us.
It should be noted that at the meeting of the Standing Council for Police Services in Quebec on 29 October last year, this measure was not discussed despite the presence of Robert Dutil himself.
What’s more, PQ critic Stéphane Bergeron did not need to rate the announcement as “a rabbit pulled out of a hat” and “an amateur solution fused on his knees.”
Minister Dutil himself responded to those who fear that political power has too much influence on the possible future of unity.
"He'll be satisfied with the confirmation: you'll see the result when we announce it."
"We are aware of this problem."
For CSQ President Réjean Parent, nothing can replace the establishment of a public hearing of witnesses.
"In addition, Mr. Charest is firm in not wanting to set up this commission of inquiry, and people, like you and me, think he's hiding something," he explains.
"The only way to achieve the establishment of an investigation commission is the resignation of Jean Charest," explains Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and political science at the Institute for the Education of Higher Officials.
In order to get out of this dead end, he proposed to Quebec to give special authority to the Inspector General to investigate collusion and corruption.
"We must be able to extend the mandate of the Inspector General," he said.
It also believes that Quebec could give the inspector the same powers as the commissioners, who allow him to force people to testify.
The creation of a permanent working group is not the only proposal in the records of the Charest government.
Quebec would also after Ottawa to amend the Criminal Code so that it would be better adapted to this type of crime.
This request would be based on the Commissioner for Operation Marteau (Kladivo), who informed Justice Minister Jean-Marc Fournier that the case-law for this type of investigation is not explicit.
Federal Minister for Public Safety, Vic Toews, has confirmed that his colleague in the judiciary, Rob Nicholson, is currently dealing with some of the amendments related to this dossier.
In Operation Spring 2001, which affected groups of bikers, although the Criminal Code has not yet been amended, 131 people were arrested.
Ottawa subsequently made changes to the Gangster Act.
The rivers are under strict supervision.
Several streams have come under strict control due to heavy rainfall that has fallen since Tuesday in several regions of the province.
There was a landslide in Shawinigan, Mauritius, on Wednesday afternoon.
Two houses have been evacuated.
In the evening there was another landslide in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, Lanaudière.
The road's steep.
From Tuesday to Wednesday night, several regions were hit by heavy rainfall, i.e. from 40 to 70 millimetres.
Another 20 to 40 millimeters were not expected from today until Thursday evening, according to the regions.
The sections north of the river and in the Outaouais valley were the most affected.
It could fall up to 100 millimeters there.
If we add these precipitations to the melting of snow accumulated in some sectors, we can be afraid of flooding in some streams.
Quebec’s emergency services issued a flood warning for the rivers Ouareau and Achigan in Lanaudière on Wednesday evening.
Rivers in the north, in Saint-Jérôme, in les Laurentides, and in Chêne, in Lotbinière, have become the subject of flood alert and continuous checks.
In the Lanaudière region, heavy rainfall caused the distribution of some lakes, in Sainte-Julienne, in Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare, as well as in Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, a temporary bridge was demolished as a result of heavy rains.
Two residences had to be evacuated preventively.
In Outaouais, the spill of some lakes from the shores caused the closure of some roads, especially in the village of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The emergency services have an emergency and are monitoring the situation in the area, said Annik Bouchard, a security adviser.
Quebec's Flood Forecasting Centre issued a flood warning Wednesday for several rivers, notably Maskinongé, Assumption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Dupont partially blamed
Quebec Radio Moderator Stéphane Dupont suffered a partial failure before the Canadian Broadcasting Standards Council (RRTV) due to controversial statements regarding social assistance and Haitians and, as well as gross expression during broadcasting.
The Council on Radio and Television considers that Mr. Dupont and his group from CHOI 98.1 FM had the right to express their views, but some of the statements contained "inaccurate information about social assistance and inappropriate negative statements by Haitians."
The Council also concluded that the discussion of suicide, including the broadcasting of the names of the two people who took their lives, did not violate the rules for radio broadcasting.
The Council for Radio and Television Broadcasting received a number of complaints concerning comments made during the broadcast, broadcast between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was made following a complaint from the Quebec Social Support Beneficiaries’ Joint Front.
The group complained that the amounts quoted in the broadcast were inaccurate.
Moderators must provide reliable information, not deceptive.
As for suicide, moderator Stéphane Dupont thought suicide was a gesture of despair.
Most members of the Commission concluded that the report carried out was such that suicide cannot be understood as a solution to the problems of everyday life.
"The majority of the Commission considers that the controversial episodes of the broadcast of the Dupont Noon Reports encountered a delicate subject in an impartial and appropriate manner."
No grudge was raised against him.
The last dispute involved a statement following the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort then went into a media shootout, which provoked many reactions.
The CHOI moderator stated that he did not send any donation to help the Haitians because we cannot be sure that the money they need will actually be given.
The Commission considers that these comments were not unjustified but that their cumulative effect creates an unduly negative picture of Haitians.
"I've already made up my three-day postponement of the thing."
"My file has been untouched for one and a half years," the moderator said.
In all decisions, the Commission refuses to use gross expression in broadcasting.
In any case, the radio broadcasting CHOI-FM cooperated "in the framework of its duties".
For the station, which will have to, inter alia, notify these decisions once during the main broadcast within three days, the consequences are minimal.
The King of Kung Fu in Montreal.
A resident of Montreal, native of Algeria, Nacereddine Zemmal, has an extremely peculiar course.
An athlete who excels in "sanda" (kung-fu "full contact"), kickboxing and Thai boxing enters the tatami and rings of the world and seeks new challenges.
“I started with martial arts like kung fu and kickboxing 12 years ago, in Algeria,” explained Zemmal, who has not lived in the capital since 2008 to learn from professionals.
"In my case, I'm looking for matches pretty much everywhere because for those who don't like playing on a ground that appears in martial arts, competitions in North America are rare."
Recently, this man, who works as a security guard and assistant for UPS, just gave his opponents bad news when he won two gold medals at the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA) World Championships, from 23 to 30 October, in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I won the full contact kickboxing and Thai boxing categories," he said.
"I am currently preparing for the San Shou World Cup in China."
"They were invited competitors who finished in the top four at the last World Cup in each category."
"I won a bronze in Toronto in 2009."
"I finished eighth in Vietnam in 2005."
"In 2007 in China I finished in the tournament on the fifth morning, while in Toronto in 2009 I finished third," he added.
"What's interesting is that I've made some progress in every competition."
"I'll be the first this year or next!"
"San Shou" or "Sanda" is a discipline originating in China where fist and foot punches, as well as throwing on the ground, are allowed.
Matches are traditionally played on the platform and more rarely in the ring.
The most famous boxer, originating from this form of fighting, is an American of Vietnamese origin Cung Le, well known in the world of martial arts.
As much as Nacer Zemmal is supposed to keep only one result in his career, he will boldly confirm his participation in the "King of Sanda" supertournament, the Super Bowl in kung fu.
"This competition is the highest and most prestigious in China," explains the sympathetic guy.
"It's kind of equivalent to Stade Lumpinee (the largest stadium in Thailand)."
"It was a great experience."
Zemmal won his first game, in the semi-finals of his category (80 kg), before suffering a loss in the final.
"The one who beat me was a real pro, he analyzed."
"There are four competitors per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg et 90 kg)."
"The winners of the semi-finals will compete in the finals of their category."
"Then the winners of each category will compete so that a single champion, the King of Kung Fu, can be crowned."
450 million contracted without public competitions
Hydro-Québec has agreed to a mutual agreement of $450 million in contracts with engineering companies for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
At the heart of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts is a consortium formed by the companies BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which won the most significant contract, a contract to manage the entire project for a total of $295 million without a public competition.
This consortium, on behalf of Énergie gérance, was empowered in 2004 in parallel with the selection of Hydro-Québec to entrust the private sector with its responsibility for the management of this significant hydroelectric project worth $5 billion.
At the beginning of 2005, the consortium "Énergie gérance" won a lucrative contract without any public tender.
For the Quebec side, a complaint against a consortium of companies presents us with a serious ethical problem that risks excluding competition and causing price increases.
"It's a new way of implementing a collusion and eliminating competition."
"This means that people who no longer make side deals in secret are already doing them openly today," PQ MP Sylvain Simard said at a press conference.
A little earlier in the morning, Mr. Simard put this question to the National Assembly because he says it is hard to bear how the public interest can be sold in this way.
The Minister for Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, objected this afternoon, strongly denying that this contract was a collusion.
"I have my own way," she said, claiming that the PQ was "dishonest" and "missed accuracy."
She said "this would be the least" that PQ would apologize.
The recipe for creating a consortium is a common practice around the world.
This is usually a time-limited alliance that allows two or more companies to pool their mutual expertise to respond to a call for tenders for a complex project.
The Eastmain project is very complex in terms of workload.
The building is still under construction and must be completed by 2012.
However, the contract was granted without competition being able to negotiate; it was a trade.
It must also be admitted that the formula of consortia is no longer an exception in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As Le Devoir revealed last week, the formula of consortia in engineering consulting is the subject of a government investigation.
If we fly through the business register of Quebec companies at a speed, it will allow us to discover more than 200 consortia, some of which seem to have been created permanently.
This is how Dessau works in partnership with most of its main competitors; namely CIMA+, Genivar, SNC-Lavalin and Roche and Tecsult.
Each combination, and there are dozens of them, leads to the same legal entity, and that is Dessau.
With regard to the Energy Management Consortium, Minister Normandeau stressed in particular that "the Baie James territory is a typical special dynamic of the workforce and that Hydro-Québec has been responding to it since the 1970s".
The main sponsor of the Eastmain project, Réal Laporte, of the Baie James Energy Company (SEBJ), gave an explanation that will force us to take the forehead over the fact that the project management contract was concluded by mutual agreement.
"If you enter a public competition and there are few bidders, your bid prices may be higher."
"You have two choices: to pick up the people who appear in the contract as participants in the competition, and to say, 'Let's make a satisfactory deal with a good price.'"
"But the main idea is that it is not the price that matters, but the competence of the people," Laporte said.
This contract awarded to the Energy Management Consortium is part of a long list of contracts for more than $50,000 received by the Quebec Party.
The contracts were concluded with Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After Le Devoir’s verification, he counted 109 engineering consulting contracts concluded between 2002 and March 2010 with companies or their branches, in particular with laboratories carrying out analysis of soil samples.
SNC-Lavalin won 22 contracts, of which Genivar won 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without having a share in the "Energie gérance".
All contracts have been closed.
They total $449,783,344, including a contract with Énergie Gérance for $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard suggested that the four companies that are part of the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are "very well-known Liberal Party of Quebec".
Minister Normandeau released a report that PQ is also affiliated with the companies that “finance” it, before specifying that they are more of her managers.
Barometer of responsible consumption - "green" label does not inspire confidence
More green, but openly skeptical.
The Quebec consumer has very little confidence in the actors of sustainable development, but also in "impartial" labels and ecological certifications, to be guided in the selection of products accordingly.
Worst of all, even if we bathe in a media universe that insists on us and encourages more socially responsible consumption, this media universe complains about a lack of credible information, a failure to perform duties, which it qualifies even as a brake on its commitment, the Barometer states in its response.
Although consumption of so-called socially responsible products increased in 2010, Quebecers who try to sell them still don’t trust them very much.
Two-thirds of us actually say they don’t believe in companies’ environmental promises simply because companies’ green advertising is detecting a measuring tool developed by the University of Sherbrooke’s Observatory of Responsible Consumption.
Other findings: Half of consumers question the credibility of official certificates attached to so-called fair products, but also the credibility of products and brands labelled as environmentally responsible, according to the Barometer.
In the same way, the debate of politicians on this topic is taken as serious by only 14.6% of the population of Quebec.
Responsible consumption information, however, seems to be the primary stimulus for this page of consumption, which is currently revived by nearly a third of Quebec consumers.
Indeed, the vacuum and dubious nature of information would alleviate the enthusiasm of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake that Baromètre has identified at a higher price for these products.
Incidentally, one-third of the population of Quebec is mistrustful of the listed data about the products or "green" services we are looking for to let them pass through our hands.
On the other hand, in 2010, almost half of consumers were willing to change their habits and, in particular, to change the brand of one or more products, thus responding to their beliefs.
A total of 61% of them preferred shopping from merchants in their neighborhood and preferred buying food grown in their region, according to the Baromètre.
More "green" and responsible - the index of responsible consumption has reached 64 out of the maximum 100 for this year - , Homo consumus Québec likes to present itself as the king of recycling, which strives to minimize the impact on the environment by caring for the protection of animals.
But their social and environmental conscience has obviously remained somewhere outside their car, says the Baromètre: in 2010, barely 28% of Quebecers said they use public transport or that they recommend using the car to drive at least two people, in the interest of nature protection.
Walking and cycling were also supported by 39.1% of participants in this extensive behavioral survey who used this cliché.
State loan for the purchase of the eXcentris cinema complex
The Government of Quebec, which we have requested financial participation in the purchase of the eXcentris cinema complex by Angus et le Parallele, agrees to participate, but only to the extent of the loan.
The development company "Angus et le Parallèle", which sought a gift of $7 million from the Minister of Culture to buy a cinema complex on Saint-Laurent Boulevard and which proved its mission as a lover of film art, did not get what it demanded.
The government accepts the fact that it will be included in the documentation, but on its own terms.
Rather than the expected gift, the government of Quebec is proposing a loan, the amount of which would otherwise be lower, some were the original expectations, which could lay the foundation for a viable solution under favorable conditions and with resources coming from the state.
The first action plan and 12.8 million demand were already rejected by Quebec last spring, but requests have already been revised for reductions.
The proposal and the action plan were sent to the Minister of St-Pierre by François Macerola, President of the Society for the Development of Business in Culture (SODEC), who manages the eXcentris cinematographic project.
The final report was sent ten days ago.
But the government's counter-proposal came to SODEC on Tuesday.
Le Parallele et Angus have until December 31 to respond.
However, it seems that the hypothesis of a gift from the state must really be rejected.
Recall that the Association of Cinema Owners and Cinema Centres in Quebec opposed the direct investment of the state in order to support the purchase of eXcentris, assuming that the Minister of Culture should not finance a real estate project when he did not do so for other cinemas.
On the contrary, several participants in the discussion demanded substantial economic support.
Daniel Langlois, the owner, got into his cinemas over a decade of film art after he himself financed the construction of the complex, which may have been a reason for a change by the state's financial council.
The shortage of independent film halls is crispy in Montreal, and eXcentris has managed to gain a permanent clientele.
Angus et le Parallèle, headed by Christian Yaccarini, is leading a campaign to release funds to the private sector, in the belief that it will hold $700,000 to push the acquisition.
Since the spring of 2009, the only of the three film companies, Le Parallèle, continues to distribute films for eXcentris.
The goal of the future buyers is to reopen all three halls on February 27 next year and to screen Xavier Beauvois’ most beautiful film, Men and Gods.
But Christian Yaccarini did not notice Le Devoir and so he is ignored, as he and his group think about the proposals for reductions that are made to him.
Lifted curtain on Canada as a whole...
New U.S. diplomatic sources cited through WikiLeaks reveal what the U.S. considers a Canadian’s inferiority complex to Americans, but with the same blow they reveal their sense of superiority towards the latter.
U.S. diplomats, therefore, are surprised that every Canadian voter is at the heart of Canadian-U.S. relations when going to vote, and believe that President Obama’s visit helped the conservative government to pass its budget in 2009!
Four new reports, including the U.S. embassy in Ottawa and Washington, released on Wednesday to the public, provide sensitive details to get each other “under the skin.”
The announcement, dated 22 September 2008, in the middle of the election campaign, details at what point the United States is not part of the stakes discussed by political leaders.
To the great astonishment of the U.S. Ambassador to Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr Wilkins gives several explanations for this situation.
“The Canadian Minority Complex, almost obsessed, may condition political leaders to talk about internal stakes, rather than realizing that these elections also apply to the United States (as in the 1988 Free Trade Campaign),” he writes.
“The United States is, therefore,” he concluded, “the proverbial elephant in this election: ubiquitous, but potentially too threatening to be talked about.”
The ambassador understands this "deafening silence" all the less that both countries maintain intense political and economic relations.
“It is logical that the ability of a candidate, party or even better party leader to manage these important relationships should be a key factor that voters have in mind when going to elections.”
Other expressions of this sense of importance can be read in a report sent on 22 January 2009 by Terry Breese, chargé d'affaires in Ottawa, preparing President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your journey will help ensure that the government is maintained in the confidence vote in early February on the federal budget, to which Canada will publicly admit its first deficit in more than a decade, due to a $30-$40 billion recovery plan," Breese wrote.
No mention is made of the fact that the government had to postpone the pre-Christmas session of parliament so that it could not be defeated by the coalition and that the opposition parties condition their survival on the quality of the proposed recovery plan.
Another January 2008 report, signed by Ambassador Wilkins, draws Washington’s attention to the increasingly negative image that dramatic series broadcast on CBC cast on the United States.
The ambassador is concerned about broadcasting Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which not too clever references to Maher Arar, "No-Fly-List" or also to kidnappings for the purpose of violent interrogations at the CIA can be observed.
Another report reports that at their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked her French partner Bernard Kouchner if Europe was ready to accept some Guantanamo detainees.
Mr Kouchner answered yes, but on a case-by-case basis.
At the end of the meeting, it says here, "some paper was handed over concerning Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin, the Secretary of State."
"The secretary agreed to revise the file."
Finally, let’s note that people affected by WikiLeaks are sweating.
Tom Flanagan, a former adviser very close to Stephen Harper, said on CBC that the person responsible for this massive leak should be "destroyed".
Mike Huckabee in the U.S. reportedly heard about it.
World Plan for the Restoration of Lighting
The United Nations today proposed in Cancun a plan to rebuild home lighting, retail lighting and industrial spaces in 100 countries to achieve a greenhouse effect (GES) limit that corresponds to nearly one-third of the additional limit that needs to be achieved to stabilize the planet’s climate from now on.
This ambitious plan is at the stage of major concrete projects that the UN wants to implement in Cancun to compensate for the lack of hard-to-reach reduction commitments on the part of industrialized countries.
According to the plan presented yesterday, if the incandescent bulbs, which monopolize another 50 to 70% of the market, are replaced by fluorescent bulbs or, even better, by bulbs with electroluminescent diodes (DEL or "LED" in English), a substantial amount of 1.8 billion tons would be added to the planet.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of the world’s emissions.
That’s the equivalent of 70% of the global car fleet’s emissions.
In Copenhagen last year, large countries with a significant share of emissions, such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, were involved in voluntary plans to reduce global GHG emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
But another 5 Gt will need to be deducted from this balance in order to achieve a 2 degrees Celsius climate warming stabilisation by 2020 so that it can be excluded from getting out of control.
In heated bulbs, 95% of the energy is dissipated in the form of heat and the rest, i.e. 5%, is a product of light.
With fluorescent bulbs, the energy consumption is reduced by 75% and with new LED bulbs, we will reduce this consumption by two more times.
Fluo-compact bulbs last an average of 6,000 to 10,000 hours.
The new DEL bulbs, which he introduced this week to Philips' production - the company reportedly participated in a UN study - have an estimated lifespan of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than the incandescent bulb, giving us an idea of the possible savings with a replacement plan that would apply in 100.
All these new bulbs can also work with reostats and emit less heat.
And they don't contain any mercury.
Several experts have expressed reservations about fluorescent light bulbs because they contain mercury and should be classified as hazardous waste, which is still not possible in developing countries unless manufacturers set up collection centres.
However, as the report states, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not a fluorescent bulb, but rather thermal coal-fired power plants that emit much of the mercury needed to produce electricity wasted in heated bulbs.
In the United States alone, these plants release 25,000 tons of mercury annually.
The report also details the profits that each country would make from this international program.
Indonesia, for example, would save $1 billion a year for the purchase of electricity and eight million tons of CO2, which is the equivalent of 3.5 thermal power plants, which would cost 2.5 billion to build.
Ivory Coast is eagerly awaiting the results of the election.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has called for immediate disclosure of the results of the Ivory Coast presidential election after the deadlines expire.
"The Secretary-General underlines the need for an independent electoral commission to complete its work and immediately announce the preliminary results," a spokesman for the United Nations said.
"It calls on all Ivory Coast parties and institutions to demonstrate their sense of responsibility and refrain from any initiative until the provisional results are announced."
Despite the pressures exerted by some foreign governments, the election commission let the latest date expire - Wednesday midnight - without publishing the results, three days after Sunday's screeching.
About forty minutes before the deadline, the President of the CEI confirmed on television that the commission "continues to work" to announce the results.
On Wednesday, calls across the world for the CIS to finally announce the name of the winner of the second round, between resigning Laurent Gbagbo and opposition member Alassane Ouattara.
But the Gbagbo camp relies on the dismantling of the Constitutional Council for "fraudulent" votes in the north, managed by former New Army (FN) insurgents since the unsuccessful coup in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N’Guessan, director of the Ivory Coast presidential election campaign, confirmed that the intimidation maneuvers practised by the FN (New Army) in the north of the country discouraged Ivory Coast supporters from going to the polls.
Elections could be cancelled if the Constitutional Council took into account the complaints filed by Gbagbo.
However, opponents of President Gbagbo believe that the country’s supreme court is not neutral because it is run by Paul Yao N’Dré, a very close political ally of President Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man from the north who denies any association with former insurgents, condemned the delay in announcing the results as "unacceptable" and asked Gbagbo to respect them, but did not go so far as to demand victory.
His allies confirm that Gbagbo is blocking the publication of the results because he knows he suffered a loss, and that it would be illegal to file a complaint with the Constitutional Council after he prevented the election commission from broadcasting the results.
The second round of the presidential election, held on Sunday, was considered to crown the process of reunification and reconciliation of the country, which has been divided in two halves for years.
The United Nations on Wednesday warned the Ivory Coast political faction that it could be held responsible for possible violence.
Laurent Gbagbo finished in the first round, October 31, as the winner with 38% of the votes against 32% for Alassan Ouattara, who received public support from former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
The unemployment rate in France remains stable in the third quarter of the year.
The unemployment rate in France, according to the International Labour Office (ILO), remained stable at 9.3% in metropolitan France (9.7% including overseas regions), according to provisional seasonal deviation correction (CVS) data published by INSEE on Thursday.
The number of unemployed has stabilized to 2.631 million in the metropolis.
Data from the second quarter were confirmed on 9.3% of the active population in the metropolis and 9.7% including overseas regions.
In one year, the unemployment rate increases by 0.1 points.
In general, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France are not working in the third quarter, but would like to work, whether they are available or not in two weeks to be able to work, and whether they are looking for a job or not.
The situation of current young people in the labour market has further escalated with a new increase in the unemployment rate reaching 24.2% in metropolitan France (+0.9 points in three months, +0.5 points in one year) and 25% including overseas regions.
In the third quarter, according to the International Labour Office, 637,000 young people aged 15 to 24 were unemployed.
As for the elderly, they saw a slight increase in unemployment in metropolitan France to 6.4% in metropolitan France (+0.2 points in three months, as well as in a year), that is, 482,000 people aged 50 years and over and 6.6% including overseas regions.
Only the 25-49-year-old population benefited from unemployment stability at 8.3% in metropolitan France (-0.1 point in three months, +0.1 point in one year) and 8.8% in the whole of France.
Insee no longer publishes the monthly unemployment rate since 2006, following a controversy over its calculation method.
On the other hand, Eurostat, the European Union’s statistical agency, continues to produce monthly statistics and on Tuesday announced a rate of 9.8% for France (including DOM) in October after it amounted to 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini is charged and imprisoned
Alexandre Guérini, 53, one of the heads of waste management companies and brother of the PS of the Bouches-du-Rhône Board of Directors, was charged and imprisoned in a prison in Luynes, near Aix-en-Provence, as part of an investigation into public procurement allegedly conquered by
Alexandre Guérini was charged with misuse of company property, misuse of public funds and public property, secrecy, bribery, acceptance of bribes in order to influence the office and possession of ammunition, his lawyer said.
"Alexandre Guérini is a fighter and insists that the judge explain to him all the questions that he intends to ask him, not any delusions."
"It's easy to prosecute him for many criminal reasons, but another thing is to prove them," his lawyer, Florence Rault, told AFP.
Mr Guérini said through his lawyers that he sent a brief message to the judges before his interrogation to explain everything.
One of his relatives, Philippe Rapezzi, was also charged and imprisoned on Wednesday night.
According to his lawyer, Lucien Simon, his client had never done anything other than to ensure the operation of the landfills he was supposed to manage.
When it comes to the award of contracts or the destination of funds associated with their functioning, he never knew anything like that, Mr Simon said.
In this matter, Daniel Pinna, the former director general of the services of the agglomeration of Aubagne, was charged on Wednesday for the misuse of public funds and plots, and released, under judicial supervision with a ban to contact, the protagonist of the whole matter.
"My client has been able to provide an explanation of all the facts that have been brought against him."
"The investigating judge is looking into this and leaving him free," said his lawyer, Yann Arnoux.
Four other people were charged and released on Wednesday night, with two of them under judicial supervision, prosecutor Michel Raffin said, according to the Associated Press.
Michel Karabadjakian, deputy director general with the elegance of Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM), is being prosecuted for accepting bribes in order to influence the office and for passive corruption.
Two officials from the Aubagne agglomeration, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, are charged, one for "storage and misuse of company property", the other for "complot in the misuse of public funds".
Finally, Alexandra Guérini’s business partner, Jeannie Peretti, was charged with “concealing the abuse of company property.”
Among those confronted with Mr Guérin is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, who was recently charged in a parallel case of fraudulent public procurement involving Corsica.
Investigators suspect his company was helping to launder money from widespread gangsterism.
The investigation is being conducted within the framework of several open judicial investigations against X in April 2009 following the receipt of anonymous letters concerning alleged fraud in the award of public contracts, in particular in the case of waste.
From a source close to the investigation, the search focuses in particular on the conditions of allocation and operation of the landfill in La Ciotat, which collects waste from Aubagne, as well as from some cities from the Municipality of Marseille (MPM).
The Case of Clotilde Reiss: The Elysian Palace Exaggerated Syria Mediation
For more than a decade, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Klotilda Reiss, a young researcher arrested in Iran for "espionage", united views in France, brought diplomacy into a state of emergency and emphasized relations between Paris and Tehran.
All this is carefully monitored by diplomats from the United States.
U.S. documents received through WikiLeaks and consulted with Le Monde reveal some of the disadvantages of this crisis.
They describe how the Elysee Palace explained its strategy to the Americans, going so far as to give them advice on how to handle such hostage cases in Iran (a small group of travelers).
They show how French leaders tried to convince Washington that the release of the young Frenchwoman was not a compensation against the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian jailed in France and wanted by the U.S. justice for illegal material trafficking in favor of Iran’s nuclear program.
Finally, they are subjecting a sharp light to the way the French Presidency has tried to manipulate the media to accredit the idea that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad played a central role in the liberation of Klotilda Reiss.
In fact, he didn't do anything about it.
A diplomatic telegram written on 12 August 2009 in Paris is entitled: "Iran:French comments on how to deal with hostages".
François Richier, an adviser to the Elysee Palace for Strategic Affairs, accompanied by the director of the Quai d’Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, speaks with the representative of US diplomacy, Allegrone.
They explain the French method to him.
They recommend that Americans do the same for being transported back home by their own nationals detained forcibly in Iran.
“Make noise,” they say, “and constantly speak loudly” in the media the words “fundamental human rights,” “innocence,” “immediate liberation.”
It is necessary to bring into trouble the Iranian regime, sensitive to its image.
“The more you do it, the more they’ll ask you to stop doing it.”
Because there have been attempts to negotiate through discrete channels, "silence will solve nothing", the Iranians are "masters of avoidance maneuvers".
Mr Richier recalls that arresting foreigners is “an Iranian family tactic: taking hostages for the purposes of “political blackmail”.
She announces that the release of Klotilda Reiss (which will take place on August 16, the day she is granted refuge by the French embassy) "will require the payment of a large amount of money to the Iranians" (a deposit of 230,000 euros).
And it will announce that the Elysée Palace anticipates hostage cases, a phenomenon that "will be exacerbated".
The Iranians could “in the future arrest an additional 1,800 French people living in Iran,” he said.
28 August 2009.
Klotilda Reiss left prison 12 days ago, but is still blocked in Iran.
Iranian Majid Kakavand, whom the United States claims to have been expelled for illegal trade in Iran-sensitive electronic material, is being released in Paris on the basis of a judge’s decision.
The U.S. embassy, as well as many observers, is questioning this disturbing agreement.
For Washington, which is pursuing illegal Iranian networks to obtain material intended for the nuclear program, the expansion of Majid Khakavanda is bad news.
Did France agree to a deal?
Liberating an Iranian for the Liberation of a Young French Woman?
In another interview with Kathleen Allegrone, on September 4, François Richier assures that this is not the case.
The Elysee Palace, he said, was not only “surprised by the judge’s decision,” but was looking for a way to counter it.
"There have been talks between the presidential office and the minister of justice" (at the time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot change the decision of the court," he notes.
Mr Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand is under the "limited" supervision of the French intelligence service.
An adviser to the Elysée Palace dials a phone number, hangs a telephone and then informs the U.S. diplomat that the Iranian is currently in the Paris buildings managed by the Iranian embassy.
At the time of Klotilda Reiss’s imprisonment in Iran, the Elysee Palace is making efforts, negotiating, through communication and organized “killers” in the media, to convince that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad plays a “significant” and “influential” role as a “mediator.”
Americans observe this activity not without irony, noting that manipulation bears fruit, as several articles in the press reflect the French official version.
A telegram dated 25 August 2009 evokes the media "scourge" of French officials.
What is the basis for such a degree of "gratitude" towards Mr Assad, he asks the embassy in Paris.
“Despite their statements full of praise, French officials in private acknowledge that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians have actually done.”
The document then deals with the reasons that forced the Elysée Palace to pay in this fiction.
Intensive communication “focuses on validating President Sarkozy’s policy of opening up to Syria,” he analyses.
The policy implemented in 2008 "has been observed by many critical voices in France and abroad and labeled as premature and unmerited".
By “exceeding Syria’s role,” Paris is trying to “demonstrate to Syria what praise it can make when it plays a constructive role in the region.”
It also aims to “sat the grain of discord between Syria and Iran.”
The U.S. embassy knows this from a very good source.
On August 11, François Richier told him: "Of course, we don't know if the Syrians did anything, whatever it is."
"But we thanked them anyway."
"It should at least bring confusion and ambiguity among Iranians."
Klotilda Reiss returns to France on May 16, 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy welcomes her to the Elysée Palace.
In the statement, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in the liberation of our compatriot".
End of online games after midnight for young Koreans
The South Korean government will pass a law called “Pecival” that will ban teenagers from playing online games after midnight by blocking access to them, officials said.
The bill will be presented to Parliament in December to allow online gaming companies to ask to block access to these games after midnight for people under the age of 16, according to officials from the Ministry of Culture and the Ministry of Family Affairs.
"Many children play these games all night and then have trouble learning in school and are unable to lead a normal life during the day."
"We believe that this law is necessary to ensure their health and their right to sleep," Jo Rin, the head of the ministry responsible for the bill, told AFP.
Online games will be newly available from 6 a.m.
Companies will have one year to prepare for the application of the law, he said.
The government also assumes that it will ask companies to limit the daily time of access to these games for young people whose parents request it to be supplemented by a responsible worker.
It also provides free programs to people who request it, allowing them to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "affected" countries and the daily press regularly brings various facts related to the intense use of the Internet.
The country is also an undisputed champion in world competitions in online games.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, facing 58 other nations.
2018-2022 FIFA World Cup: FIFA establishes host countries.
Full of unrest over suspicion of corruption, FIFA’s executive committee sets Thursday’s World Cup host country in 2018 and 2022, a sovereignly politically motivated choice where the fight for influence and lobbying risk surpassing technical criteria.
The thing is certain, the FIFA Royal Competition in 2018will take place in Europe, the traditional bash of this discipline (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgium).
The championship in 2022 will be much more exotic, with the International Federation hoping to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia) after its premiere on the African continent in 2010, or continue to deploy to the United States or to the Far East (Japan).
The list of personalities who will participate in the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Prince of Qatar, the heads of government of Belgium and the Netherlands, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) gives the opportunity to create a complete picture of the world’s economy and policies of measurement.
Negotiations behind the scenes face the risk that they will last until the last minute.
For the rest, it is difficult to determine the hierarchy according to the candidates.
According to the FIFA review report, the English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) documentation contain the best arguments, as well as the documentation of their competitors.
But these reasons will not have too much weight for the 22 members of the executive committee at the hour set for voting.
The Sunday Times at the beginning of the revelation, leading to the suspension of two members of the EC / European Commission? / for corruption (Reynald Temarii et Amos Adamu) may have ruined the chances of his country, the cradle kicked, which has so far hosted the world championship only once, a year.
The BBC put the crown on Monday when it broadcast a document that "sniffed a pin" three influential EC (European Commission?) members, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
How to make FIFA dissatisfied and bring into trouble the English executive with David Cameron in the first place.
The prime minister hopes to repeat the move that his predecessor Tony Blair made in 2005, who managed to win the Olympics for London in 2012.
Will this intense activity be enough for England to add a new shine to its name at the CE (European Commission?)?
Nothing is less certain, because the pair Spain-Portugal lacks the trumps of the already prepared stadiums, his goodwill (World Championship in 1982 in Spain, the 1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona, Euro-2004 in Portugal) and their football culture.
But the sluggish economic and financial prospects of both countries could give these ambitions a cold shower.
Possible retaliation against the English and doubts about the eligibility of Spain and Portugal only increase the position of Russia, which was an outsider despite gaps in its documentation (stadions, hotels, transport).
But Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has decided that the championship will not be moved to Zurich and has publicly declared "irrelevant competition in the preparation of the vote", in verbal indictments barely postponed to charge the English press against members of the CE (European Commission).
"We will throw mud at them, we will try to compromise them," Putin said.
For 2022, the United States seems to be a logical favourite with its considerable experience from 1994.
The highest performance of the economy in the world, the headquarters of the main sponsors of FIFA, it seems that this country has a big lead over Japan and South Korea, which, separately, have produced a beautiful project.
But these candidacies seem premature for both countries, which together passed the "test" in 2002.
Another threat: awarding the 2026 World Cup to China, which Fifa desperately desires, has nullified Asia’s chances for 2022.
With Qatar pulling out of its sleeve a large ace in the form of futuristic stadiums, and Australia, FIFA would continue to expand into new countries, but these two countries pose more risks than certainties.
Australia, as well as Japan and Korea, could succumb to flat-rate TV fees (due to time delays) paid by European countries, forming a driving force for FIFA.
Second mandate: clarity (certainty)
De Gaulle was hesitant.
Mitterrand seemed to be hesitating.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not hesitate at all.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than them.
The mandate of the Elysée Palace calls for someone else.
The current head of state will be the candidate in 2012.
But the clarity is not in good agreement with the share of secrecy associated with the presidency.
Therefore, it is necessary to act as if the doubts persist.
In one way or another.
In 2006, Jacques Chirac's friends made claims that a third term would not be ruled out.
On November 15, Nicolas Sarkozy said he would "decide sometime in the fall of 2011."
As he recalls in front of members of the UMP parliament on Wednesday evening in the Elysée Palace, the perspective of the "two mandates" has set a little fever.
Was it an official announcement of his candidacy?
He wasn't far from it.
The President only recalled that the amendment of the Constitution in 2008 reduced the number of five-year terms of office to two.
It was just a statement on his part, not a notice.
It’s not the first time he’s remembered in such meetings with a humorous tone of the presidential election.
"In the worst case, or in the best case, you have seven and a half years ahead of you with me," he said in July 2009.
Rebellion in May 2010: "Don't think I'm not considering the next stage."
His previous statements will not make him a candidate more than the day before; they will not make him a candidate less.
If they're making comments, it's because of the dual truth.
Acceleration of the path to the candidacy to the PS, on the one hand.
But it’s not the entrance to Ségolène Royal’s pit, which is pushing Nicolas Sarkozy to sue.
Rather, it is because his 2012 candidacy is evident that many in the PS want to arrange for combat formations rather prematurely than planned.
Bad research on the other hand.
First, right-wing voters would prefer François Fillon's candidacy over Nicolas Sarkozy's (46% vs. 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and we are not discussing the matter with the UMP," people from the prime minister's immediate vicinity reacted cautiously.
"If he believes in a possible defeat, he will not run," Raffarin said.
"He'll still believe he can win," corrects Alain Juppé, who is set against the odds.
Euro: The European Central Bank is forced to continue its purchases of sovereign bonds.
The last meeting of the Governing Council of the Central Bank in the year should be an opportunity to clarify the conditions for exiting the crisis or, at least, to announce the halt of a large number of unusual monetary policy operations that must be completed by the end of this year.
The crisis of sovereign European receivables binds, the Institute for the Issue of Securities will undoubtedly not be able to afford to be so categorical under the threat of worsening the situation already so tense in the European securities markets.
In that case, the price would be higher.
Yesterday, on the occasion of a press conference, French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde paid tribute to the active role played by the European Central Bank in resolving the debt crisis of European states.
She didn’t want to say if she thought the bank could have done more, for example, by increasing its sovereign bond purchase program.
"I reserve my consideration for my European partners (...) ".
On the evening before, in Brussels, when he interviewed the European Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, the President of the European Central Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, did not appear to be more eloquent in terms of his intentions, and was satisfied with the fact that he stated that he would "promote" the purchase of sovereign titles on a secondary basis.
The European Central Bank will keep its basic unchanged interest rate at 1%, its historically lowest level since May 2009.
In fact, the purchases of bonds from the Treasury by the Central European Bank doubled in the last week to almost 1.35 billion euros.
And thanks to the foolishness of the negotiators in the market yesterday, she made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese bonds.
In total, the Eurosystem’s central banks have purchased <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>67 billion since May 2010.
There are no doubts among market participants about the anticipation of the continuation of purchases (see page 29).
Even economists do not expect any significant change in price.
If loan operations for more than three months have already disappeared from the arsenal of the Central European Bank, the latter shall proceed to the unrestricted provision of liquidity on generous terms and for a period of one week to three months.
Economists today expect this mechanism to be extended for several months.
"I can't imagine that she would change her program in a significant way."
“If not, it would mean taking the risk of triggering a short-term new tension,” says Michael Schubert, economist at Commerzbank.
"The progressive approach announced during the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely," predicts Norbert Bräms, an economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
To the plan of its interventions in the public debt market, "the European Central Bank would have to maintain the volume of purchases of its bonds in order to revive the weak market", adds Norbert Bräms.
Given the exposure of European banks to sovereign debt markets in the euro area, there is no choice but to maintain its presence in the market.
“It needs to compensate at all costs for the shortage of investors in the market and act in such a way as to prevent the burgeoning of paid performance states, among the most fragile,” the senior bond manager testified yesterday.
Because if interest rates go up, states will worry more about reducing their debt, rather than stabilizing it.
It's saving the euro at this price.
Berlusconi's back in Italy
After the start of the week for Italy, the worrying situation relaxed a bit, yesterday with a rebound of 10-year bond interest rates.
Return to Temporary Calm.
At the end of the meeting with the Minister for the Economy, the Prime Ministers said they had heard Giulio Tremonti classify the situation as "unresolved" and that he expected an "unpredictable" weekend, which he then demented.
In any case, on Tuesday, the deviation from the long German interest rates reached a record 210 basis points and the price of bankruptcy hedging contracts (CDS) flew up to 263 points, causing some upheaval in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers Silvio Berlusconi noted that in Spain the deviation with German interest was more than 400 basis points.
But his right hand, Gianni Letta, said he was "too busy" with "storms of markets" and possibly a contagion originating in Ireland.
The good news is that Italy, the third economy of the eurozone, is not like Greece or Ireland.
“The bad news is that it’s like Portugal,” explains Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
Clearly and unencrypted, its problem is the absence of growth and insignificant fiscal inputs, which goes hand in hand and exposes the state to the risk that it will not be able to cover its funding needs.
Brussels’ latest forecasts were a cold shower for the government.
Italian growth is now expected to be 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... while the budget that is available to the Senate for its analysis is at 1.3% and 2%.
Under these conditions, the European Commission calculates, the public finance deficit will still represent 4.3% of the gross domestic product next year (against 3.9% projected by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Hence the reputation of a new set of supplements to the draft state budget, which could be introduced after the holidays, in the amount of 7 billion euros.
“Strict new measures will have to be taken if necessary,” said Olli Rehn, Commissioner for Economic Affairs.
For now, Italy is accepting the support of international institutions.
“The cornerstones of its economy are in order and its calculations are correct, we have been repeating this for a long time,” said Arrigo Sadun, an Italian member of the International Monetary Fund’s Board of Directors, under pressure from Italy on the International Monetary Fund.
"There is no immediate problem, neither short-term nor long-term, because despite its significant debt (119.2 percent of the 2011 gross domestic product, NDLR), the stabilisation effort demanded in Italy is less than the effort demanded from other countries," said Pier Carlo Padoan, OECD chief economist.
There is a question of political instability.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of no confidence in the House of Representatives, after which elections, which are expected to be held at the end of March, could begin.
This would open up a period that would be inappropriate for decision-making in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans are thinking about strengthening the anti-crisis mechanisms.
Christine Lagarde reiterated this at a press conference in Paris yesterday: "I think that the Europeans demonstrated this on Sunday throughout the day and night, they are obviously very solidary, committed to defending their currency and their currency zone."
Although everything is relative, yesterday’s expansion of interest rates on European sovereign bonds brought water to the mill to governments and the European Central Bank.
But we can't talk about the beginning of normalization.
Standard & Poor’s has said it could degrade Portugal’s debt record, the target that is most targeted by various speculations.
“Because in May, there is a real lack of transparency and clear policy, mainly based on banking systems,” says economists Exane BNP Paribas.
“Political time is running slower than market time.”
Aware of this interrupted context and the dangers it conceals, European countries are intensifying discussions aimed at strengthening existing crisis mechanisms.
Informal consultations between finance ministers, the most affected by the problem, and on a broader scale with their G20 counterparts, are progressing very well.
This is in view of the meetings of the Eurogroup and Ecofin since the beginning of next week.
The meeting of the European Central Bank is taking place today.
On the agenda is the fate of unconventional measures to support euro area countries with a focus on markets (see above).
With regard to the European Finance Fund (EFSF), its Executive Director, Klaus Regling, set out on Tuesday in Singapore a trip to Asia to inform investors from the Far East about the development of the crisis in Europe.
If the goal of this path is not to increase the funds, it certainly prepares the ground for achieving this goal.
The first issue of FESF securities is expected to take place next month.
Yesterday, a U.S. official told Reuters that the United States would support any increase in mobilized funds by additional direct engagement with the IMF.
The countries concerned in the first place, Portugal and Spain, are preparing to adopt structural reforms, in particular with regard to the organisation of the labour market.
Reforms that are aligned with stringent, fast-acting measures.
Lisbon and Madrid used a different route than Greece and Ireland.
Both countries want to avoid at all costs asking for international assistance even before they apply their own budgetary corrections and decide on the structural reforms necessary to regain lasting confidence.
Capital participants in European funds are finally talking about options available to speed up the process of normalisation of sovereign bond markets.
On his way to Paris on 24 November, Axel Weber came up with the idea that if the 750 billion euros mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to re-enter the stockpile of securities.
Economists at Barclays Capital, which is the actor in the very first sovereign debt trading plan in Europe, believe that an additional <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 billion would be enough, “preferably” in the form of direct provision of financial liquidity.
The fund exists: it is the European Financial Stability Mechanism, subsidized to date by 60 billion euros.
A council that has every chance to be tested in European capitals.
Especially when the market conditions have deteriorated.
Snow and ice: 24 counties have an orange standby.
Snowfall still causes traffic problems, especially on second-class roads in Brittany, and there is a risk of disrupting some economic activities.
Twenty-four counties are now in an orange emergency because of the risk of snow and frost.
L'Eure, l'Eure-et-Loir, les Deux-Sèvres and la Vienne have joined the 20 districts that have already declared orange emergency, 18 from Wednesday afternoon and two, la Dordogne and la Gironde, later in the night.
According to Météo France, significant snow surges are causing problems in the north of la Gironde and les Charentes and little snow on Ile-de-France.
Snow cover from 2 to 5 cm, places from 7 to 10 cm, is expected in the affected districts and cover from 1 to 3 cm, places up to 5 in the Paris region.
The districts of Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, du Poitou and the districts of Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin are affected.
The waves of snow are large enough to cause traffic jams and disrupt some economic activities, Météo France predicts.
On the Côtes d'Armor coast, some districts have banned the passage of heavy goods - trucks over 7.5 tons with the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac route.
Traffic on second-class roads in Brittany is very difficult, according to police, and the police recommend leaving with their vehicle only when it is really necessary and the operation of some trucks has been canceled for this day.
In Picardy, school connections were banned on Thursday.
No special measures are expected to be taken on Wednesday night to limit freight traffic.
The district authority "calls on all motorists to be as careful as possible on the roads and to adapt the driving to the nature of the road".
The General Directorate of Civil Aviation (DGAC) has asked airlines to cancel 25% of their flights at Roissy Airport and 10% to Orly on Thursday due to expected snow surges.
The DGAC recommends that passengers using air transport services connect with their company.
In the UK, Gatwick Airport in south London and Edinburgh Airport in Scotland are closed until Thursday morning.
Metro Grand Paris: the first financial proposals
Since the debate on modernising transport on Ile-de-France is in full swing, billions have been raining.
At least during the discussion.
23 billion for the Grand Paris Metro to be built by the Société du Grand Paris.
In order for the construction to start, the state has announced a grant of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC> 4 billion.
Purely theoretically, this is the amount that will then allow SGP to use part of the financing from its double source for contracts.
Today we finally get to the first additions.
The 2010 Finance Rectification Act, which the National Assembly's Finance Committee is examining this morning, contains the mechanisms established to secure these funds.
There are two: creating a special equipment tax and increasing the tax from offices on Ile-de-France.
First, read in the text of the bill, article 15, reads "for the benefit of the public institution Société du Grand Paris".
It is estimated: "The income from this interest is <0xE2><0x82><0xAC> 117 million per year".
The second is the reconstruction of the rate for offices, which already exists, "to be modernized, to increase the income derived from it and to affect the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would it take?
Delirium.
This is not counted in the text.
We're up to $4 billion away.
"It is clarified that these fiscal resources will be added to the <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>4 billion of the capital subsidy that will be mobilised by the state and invested in the Société du Grand Paris under the project," the statement said.
This system does not seem shocking to us at SGP.
"From the moment we generate revenue (both taxes, ndlr), we can cover the studies for three years and then rake up to 4 billion," he explained.
"It will be included in the budget and used as needed."
SGP estimates that 4 billion will be allocated to the 2014 budget only in 2013.
This mechanism, in which the promised 4 billions belong to absent subscribers, risks triggering a somewhat hectic parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will be held on 7 December.
Revengeful Hackers and Scouts
The WikiLeaks case has two meanings.
On the one hand, an obvious scandal is revealed, a scandal that seems to be a scandal only in the face of the hypocrisy that governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it speaks of profound changes at the international level, anticipating a future controlled by regression.
But let's go straight.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that every document compiled by the Secret Service (of any nation) consists exclusively of print cuts.
The "extraordinary revelation" of Americans about Berlusconi's sexual life is announcing what for months now anyone could read in any newspaper (all but these two Berlusconi owns), and the non-blatant cartoon profile of Gaddafi has long been a cabaret artist's name.
The rule that secret documents may consist only of the messages already known is essential in the dynamics of the secret services, not only in this century.
When you go to a bookstore that deals with esoteric literature, you will see that every work repeats (about the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, the Templars or the Masons) exactly what has already been written in previous works.
Not only because the author of the occult texts does not like to look for new information (he does not even know where to look for news about the non-existent), but because those who engage in occultism believe only what they already know and what confirms what they have already learned.
That's Dan Brown's mechanism for success.
The same goes for secret documents.
The informant is the lazy, and lazy (or limited spirit) head of the secret service (and if not, he could be, as I know, the editor of the newspaper Libération) who thinks only what he admits to be true.
The high-secret information about Berlusconi, which the U.S. embassy sent to the state department, was the same that Newsweek published the week before.
Why, then, has there been so much clamor around the revelation of these documents?
On the one hand, they say what every cultivated person already knows, namely that the embassy, at least since the end of World War II and since the time when heads of state can telephone or fly off for a joint dinner, has lost its diplomatic function and, with the exception of a few small transformational exercises, has been represented.
Any viewer who watches investigative films knows very well that it is only out of hypocrisy that it seems to be ignored.
However, the fact that it is repeated publicly disgraces the duty of hypocrisy and throws a bad light on American diplomacy.
Second, the idea that any hacker can obtain the most strictly classified information from the world’s most powerful country is a hard blow, not negligible, to the prestige of this state department.
The scandal affects both the victims and their "executors".
But let's move on from here to the deep truth about what happened.
Once upon a time, in Orwell’s time, it was possible to seize all power, like some Big Brother who controlled every movement of his people.
Orvello’s prophecy has been proven ever since, thanks to the ability to control every movement through the phone, every transaction made, the hotel visited, the motorway used and so on, the citizen became the ultimate victim of the crown of power.
But when we demonstrate how things are going now, that even the "graves" with the most secret information of the powerful cannot withstand the intervention of any hacker, the control message ceases to be one-way and becomes a loophole.
Power is controlled by every citizen, but every citizen, or at least a hacker – elected as a citizen’s avenger – can know all the secrets of power.
How can a power that no longer has the ability to keep its own secrets be maintained?
It is true that already Georg Simmel said that the true secret of all is the uncontained secret of Clinton (and the uncontained secret of Hill will never be revealed); it is also true that all information about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is indeed a mysterious uncontained secret, because it was extracted from the public life; but it was the secret of the public life.
WikiLeaks did not make any mistakes with Sarkozy or Merkel, but it did something big with Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this blow to the inflicted power so great?
It is clear that, in the future, states will not be able to send sensitive information online – that would be equivalent to posting it on a poster sticker on the street corner.
But it is also quite obvious that with current technologies, it is unnecessary to hope that it can be kept secret from the message on the phone.
There is nothing easier than finding out if and when the head of state traveled by plane and contacted one of his colleagues.
How will private and sensitive messages be kept secret in the future?
I know that my prognosis for the moment belongs to science fiction and is therefore fantastic, but I have to imagine government officials who discreetly carry formalities along uncontrollable routes and carry with them only those messages that know the memory or rather hide rare information in the shoe.
The information will be kept in unique copies in locked drawers: overall, the attempted espionage in the Watergate affair was less successful than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that technology is now moving sideways forward, that is, backward.
One century after the wireless telegraph revolution in communications, the Internet rehabilitated the wire-based telegraph.
Video cassettes (analogs) have allowed movie lovers to shoot a movie step by step, push it back and forth and reveal all the secrets of assembly, while now CDs (digitals) only allow them to jump on chapters, that is, on macropores.
By high-speed trains we can get from Rome to Milan in three hours, while to travel by plane and transportation, which includes three and a half hours.
It is not unusual, therefore, that politics and communication technology will return to horse-drawn cars.
One last note.
At other times, the press tried to understand what had been conceived in the embassy's secret.
Now it is the embassies that are requesting confidential information from the press.
Climate: How France Hacked Its Promises of Financing
One year after the Copenhagen Agreement, it is time to try to keep the promises of fast-start funding (so-called fast-start funding or early funding) implemented by developed countries.
And the big French hacks have been revealed
Under the Copenhagen Agreement, developed countries pledged to provide $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union has promised 7.2 billion euros over three years and France 1.26 billion euros (420 million euros per year).
At the start of COP16, the EU pulled out a big axe to convince its partners of the reality of its commitment to fast start funding: a report clarifying the actions of its Member States, a press conference, a grand side event, the distribution of brochures...
Transparent operation invaluable and valued at its true value: developed countries and civil society would like all developed countries and civil society to be treated equally and with the same degree of accuracy.
The EU announces that it has released <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion in 2010, leading it on the right track to deliver on its promise of 7.2 billion in 2012.
But if we focus on detail, we will find that things are much more complicated.
According to the Copenhagen Agreement, these funds are "new and additional" to ensure that the increased burden is realised without prejudice to public development aid.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what "new and additional" means.
While the European Commission has proposed harmonisation, some Member States, including France, have blocked the process.
Today, everyone chooses the reference that suits them best.
The European Commission, for example, considered 2009 as a reference year: international funding has been retained and it is adding 150 million to it for three years under the title of fast start funding.
Other countries have chosen similar references with annual payment deadlines or with deadlines at the level of public development aid.
France, on the other hand, considers the financing of "all new projects" in 2010 to be "new and additional".
In other words, there is no reference to expenditure from previous periods or to the global level of public aid for the development of Aide publique au développement.
Specifically, the total amount of France's support to developing countries may remain unchanged (or even decrease), it is expected to meet its commitment to finance "new and additional"...
Another crucial element is the division into gifts and loans.
There is no rule yet, and everyone chooses their own way of calculating.
Some, like France, think that 1<0xE2><0x82><0xAC> borrowed equals 1<0xE2><0x82><0xAC> donated.
Obviously, this is hard to prove: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans can be proven for some investments that are profitable (often projects related to emission reductions, consisting of more efficient technologies), it is foolish to present one euro that we get as the equivalent of one euro that we give... , but we should not take it from the title of our equities.
But France can only justify this: it "maintains" its commitment of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>420 million, of which 91.5% is a loan (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>389.8 million) and 8.5% is a gift (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>36.1 million) - see the EU document to verify for yourself.
It is the only country in the EU that uses a loan on this scale.
Germany asked for 46% of donations, while Denmark, the Netherlands and Slovakia (among others) respected their commitments with 100% of donations.
In other words, if an absolute majority of the European Union gives 1 euro to fulfil its promise, it gives France only 10 cents and considers this effort comparable.
What a cute piece of jellyfish!
To sum up, in its financing of the “fast start”, France operates with a double shading: on the one hand with the development of the stock in time and on the other hand with the real financial burden.
Although it spends only <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>36.1 million, it can convince that it is spending <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>420 million "new and additional" in connection with its promises.
Manipulation of the Treasury Minister (because it seems that although Bercy made such decisions) could have a double negative impact, both within the EU (why would Member States continue to donate when it is enough to borrow?) and in negotiation, because developing countries are not completely naive...
The chapter on early funding is only a small issue, relatively short-term, in relation to a series of climate debates.
But it could be an extra grain of sand in a huge machine like the UNFCCC.
Let's hope that's not our case.
Whatever it is, it is essential to draw lessons from this first year of early funding.
First, France should announce a change in its way of keeping accounts for 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of respect for its obligations and of decency and fairness towards the other countries of the European Union.
But above all, France should avoid discussing long-term financing contributions (another crucial chapter currently being discussed): let’s not avoid the question of “additionality” or how to book loans.
France should change its stance to become as progressive with these deposits as it is with others.
So everyone is putting hope in the new Minister for the Environment, Mrs Kosciusko-Morizet, who will come to Cancun next week.
The surprising announcement of France’s fast-start and its vision of “additionality” and use of loans could trigger an increase in the level of international trust necessary to move forward in the discussions.
Alarm regarding pesticides that children will eat.
A ten-year-old child will one day eat 81 different chemicals, according to a study published this Wednesday, from the Association of Future Generations (ex- Movement for Rights and the Preservation of Future Generations).
The association, which notes that its results "do not have a significant statistical value in terms of the low number of samples analyzed, but are characteristic of the issues processed", bought between July and September foods commonly consumed in four meals and one light meal in a super dish in a single dish as a light snack.
These typical foods, including official recommendations – five pieces of fresh fruit and vegetables, three dairy products and 1.5 liters of water a day – as well as confectionery, have been analyzed by research laboratories on chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The balance of the plate is crushing: 81 chemicals, of which 42 are carcinogenic, possible or probable, and five are clear carcinogenic, as well as 37 substances that could act as disruptive to the glands with internal mixing (PE) research, according to studies conducted by several institutes.
“While in almost all cases the legal limits for each chemical taken individually are not exceeded, we can clearly see in our research that the reality of consumer exposure to contaminants, possibly carcinogenic, and/or PE is astounding.”
For breakfast, butter and tea with milk contain about ten residues with potential carcinogenic effects and three proven to be certain carcinogens, as well as about twenty residues that could disrupt the hormonal system.
The apple, imported from Brazil, listed by studies as a small snack, contains traces of six chemicals, including a banned fungicide in France.
The same goes for the green beans from Kenya included in the lunch, for which studies have found traces of strong insecticides banned in the EU.
In addition, steaks of minced meat, tuna in a can, and even gooseberries and chewing gum were sprayed with pesticides and other chemicals.
The analysis revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroform in the water from the tap.
The salmon steak for dinner was “the richest” with 34 chemical residues discovered, and even the analysis of the plastic plate used to heat the food in the microwave did not evade the analysis.
The ultimate risk to consumers of this “cocktail of contaminants” is likely to be underestimated, according to the study.
Ecological Europe-Greens (EE-LV) has proposed a moratorium on the use of pesticides to stop the "growth of civilized diseases" in the face of an "urgent situation".
In a July study, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) examined the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruits and vegetables consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
