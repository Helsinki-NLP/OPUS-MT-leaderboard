It's a shadow.
Where is the German Embassy?
Be very friendly.
This rose is wonderful.
But he knew it couldn’t continue.
Probably not.
I want that too!
She looks but sees nothing.
You can’t eat anything sweet today.
She's eating.
I would like to travel around the world.
Do you like the Italian language?
I was sentenced to five years in prison.
I didn't win.
Any universe that is simple enough to be understood is too simple to create a mind that could understand it.
We didn't have to hurry.
Oh, please?
It doesn’t matter which team wins the match.
He's running.
This dress is too big for me.
Go back and sit next to your car.
Bring her a plate of salads.
We're fighting.
She didn't answer.

Obviously, you've done this before.
Did you get the letter?
Two years ago, I couldn’t play basketball at all.
What's the difference?
It's your fault.
She rejected my request.
Which one do you prefer?
I like the Korean food.
I was invited to lunch.
You're still green.
There's nothing here.
You never know what will happen in the future.
We made squirrel-shaped cookies.

I wanted to be a philosopher.
You're not fast enough.
We left the door open.
Can you come at 9?
Why did you call?
They discussed the problem.
If I had not received his help, I would have been dead.
He was almost asleep.
I have one brother.
Why are you here?
Do you like this color?
Isn't it strange that Tom isn't here yet?
Millions of people lost their lives during the war.
Compare your sentence to that on the board.
She met him happily.
They need our help.
Did you get a message from Tom?
I don't like how he speaks.
I no longer know what is happening to me.
I learned a lot from him.
He murdered that man.
Don’t expect too much.
That brown hat is old.
He plays golf every Sunday.
Be a creative one.
I couldn’t understand what he said.
Close the gate.
I'm always tired.
He's a weird guy.
Go back to your seat.
Be very friendly.
Isn't it a wonderful morning?
At least it is a story.

His son has eight.
If I had wings, I would fly to you.
Where the hell are you going?
He promised me that he would be more cautious in the future.
When did you hear the shot?
I forgot to buy a pillow.
I've heard a lot about you.
Don't go now, we're getting ready to have lunch.
Italy is a very beautiful country.
It's an old insomnia.
Eat the bread!
Although he lives in the United States, Thomas does not speak English.
The school is five miles from my house.
I gave up my guns.
Who ate all our food?
I know her bread will be delicious.
Come here, please.
Women are changing the world.
In Singapore, smearing on the floor is considered a crime.
I wanted Mary to love me instead of Tom.
You can sit in a chair.

The smell of roses filled the room.
Sometimes evil wins.
Tom had already drunk three cups of coffee.
I do not understand the German language.
Yes, please.
I'll help you.
It's your fault.
What are you looking for?
What does that mean?
The apples on the other side of the wall are sweeter.
Who's there?
I am studying Japanese language.
It's pointless.
It had the head of a woman, the body of a lion, the wings of a bird, and the tail of a serpent.
Tell me how you solved this problem.
Would you like to dance with me?
Even if I wanted to, I couldn't explain what happened there.
I am afraid of heights.
I don't know where to go.
If it's not raining, let's go.
Who's coming with me?
I agree with you.
Compare the facts.
I'm not hungry now.
I'm going on holiday to France.
You can sit where you want.
You are an engineer.
The door slowly opened up.
At least it's history.
Do you do any sport?
It’s time for you to start a new business.
Let's wait here.
The girl I told you about lives here.
Please, just get out.
I can't believe she's older than my mother.
Look back and you’ll see a black cat.
His family traveled a lot.
Do you know him?
I don’t know whether to turn left or right.
I'll clean up the kitchen later.
He came from a small town in the mountains.
I was talking to friends.
All your cats are grey.
I still remember those days when we were upstairs with you.
When we go to sleep, we say "good night."
The scandal ruined his career.
Cats are complex individuals.
He was so poor that he could not even buy bread.
I suggest you ask Tom.
This bag is not small.
There's nothing wrong with that.
If you call him, he'll probably come.
I know that you know that I know.
Come home before six o'clock.
The bread is fresh.
I'll be back in half an hour.
I don't want to be a bad guy anymore.
Are you a lawyer?
Where's your school?
Candles illuminated the room.
Excuse me.
Fold the paper in half.
What does he write in the letter?
A woman eats bread.
I eat an apple.
A lonely man enjoys observing ants.
Who is the man sitting at the other end of the table?
Are You Pregnant?
Now I'm really tired.
His steps have accelerated.
The eternal silence of these infinite spaces frightens me.
Why do you need a new umbrella?
He drew a straight line on the wall.
Do you need a car?
Take off your hat when you enter the class.
They don’t just complain anymore.
She was in a hurry.
Please get in touch with me when you arrive in Boston.
Thomas woke up at seven o'clock.
This is for us.
Listen to the radio.
The boy wants to know the truth.
Tom ate the whole pizza alone.
You have to take care of yourself.
You need patience, Tom.
How are you?
Your journey starts here.
Can you believe what he said?
Tom asked where you were.
I'd like to help, but I'm very busy.
Thomas couldn’t stop thinking about Mary.
I think we should call Tom.
Don't be late for the bus.
All the apples are there.
You're gonna have to pay.
What time should we go to the station?
The more I think about it, the less I like it.
I'll take you to a new store.
Everybody knows her.
She is incredibly naive.
Where do you live in Turkey?
Thomas is gone.
I can't.
Get out of class.
Three dogs are sleeping on Mom's carpet.
Thomas had already finished the work he had to do.
If you can’t have children, you can always adopt.
That's what I was thinking.
Although she ran as fast as she could, she still couldn’t get on the bus.

Do you play chess?
Her boyfriend is a Turk.
Answer me.
My mother can't come.
There are many beers in Bavaria.
Do you know if he has a girlfriend?
I don't have a family.
The parents were expecting too much from their son.
What would you like to order, gentlemen?
He did it.
He came into my room without permission.
You can't just leave.
Come on, move it!
You can sit in a chair.
Where do you live if you don’t have a home?
Our union can be perfect.
He told me I could use his car.
Almost all students love to speak English.
The test was so difficult that we didn’t have enough time to finish it.
That's it.

English is spoken around the world.
All their efforts were pointless.

Did you understand what he said?
What color is her hair?
The sooner you get back, the happier your father will be.
Are you ready to start your journey?
Your clock is ten minutes late.
They cheated on you.
I thought you said it was yours.
How much money do you have hidden under your bed?
We believe in God.
I'm Irish.
This is the man I was waiting for.
He did not pay the debt and disappeared.
Mr. Brown speaks Japanese very well.
No, he's not my new boyfriend.

The queen stood beside the king.
This bridge was built two years ago.
She is my first love.
You have to keep your promise.
Today, Tom looks different.
What is the price of a room rental?
We have to get out of here.
Thomas never wants to do it again.
I asked her to wait a minute.
How long have you been learning Esperanto?
They do not pose a threat.
Her advice prompted me to go abroad.
You're the only one who can help me.
What places does the tour visit?
It started to rain heavily. That's why we played inside.
Your carpet is completely white.
But I don't want to.
I'm sorry I can't see you tonight.
She has a sister who is a lawyer.
I look like my mother.
Tonight, you look gorgeous.
Doctor, can you listen to me?
You understand, don't you?
I hope to see him on Monday.
Tom changed his clothes.
The oven is hot, so be careful not to burn.
Have you found your letters?
For God's sake!
He didn’t know if the room was empty or not.
The store sells expensive accessories for women.
I don't like to be wrong.
It's not theirs.
I didn’t get up early.
Stay where you are.
The house is hers.
The doctor advised him to stop working so hard.
Are you sure?
You've been busy.
I can't live like this anymore.
He will do anything to make money.
I just want to talk.
What kind of music does Tom like?
The tree grows near her house.
Do not speak in the reading room.
How are you, ma'am?
I exchanged the yen for dollars.
I hate the winter.
I think Tom's going to kill Mary.
There are only two correct answers.
If I had been rich, I would have given you some money.
When and where did you meet her?
Where did you curse them?
Tom didn't show up.
Don't be so serious, it's just a game.
He told a funny story.
I don't have time right now.
Tom is the captain of our team.
This carpet is very long.
Listen to what the teacher says.
Why doesn't anyone eat my potatoes?
I asked Tom to play the guitar.
What reminds you of this?
She literally translated it.
What a wonderful night!
I can't find Tim.
She called him Charles.
I’m not sure if it’s a boy or a girl.
Life is beautiful.
She takes them to school.
Tatoeba was temporarily unavailable.
No one believed what you said.
I didn't know what to say.
Do you think I should go alone?
Just respond to the hearing.
I never want to be indebted to anyone.
Look at the train running across the bridge.
I'm not the only one who likes Tom.
I'm really bored now.
No, I don't think it's my fault.
Where are we?
I've got twenty-five.
Her journey seemed ridiculous.
She's too young to understand.
I bought this dress just for the occasion.
This is similar.
Be careful, okay?
This is the only explanation.
I can't believe I'm actually here.
Don't you know the way?
I really like that.
Tom will need help.
I have printed a hundred pages.
I see and hear.
Don't forget your ticket.
Raise your hand before answering.
Please change the flag.

I am a vegetarian.
You have to go there.
What's the reason?
I can't see anything from here.
Since I didn’t get an answer, I wrote it again.
She's standing behind the wall.
Don't expect too much from me.
They missed a great opportunity.
Fight for your rights.
He always talks to me when he meets me on the street.
Look at the book on the table.
I drank a beer and pretended to be drunk.
Tom didn't think he needed a personal guard.
Someone opened the door.
Do you have any questions about this lesson?
We saw her enter the park.
I don't think you're busy.
It didn't seem like you wanted that book.
I have a red bike.
It is low and thick.
I want to go to Tokyo.
The trip was annoying.
He's much smarter than me.
Tom doesn’t seem to be interested.
The weather is terrible today.
I didn't want this to happen.

She continued her speech.
Mike can't play baseball well.
Cameroon is often used when traveling in the desert.

I'm glad I'm not a woman.
Stop wasting your time and get back to work.
The more, the better.
Ten years is a long time.
Is this your car?
I can't believe you're still hungry.
Wanting to be happy is normal.
We must move very cautiously.

I don't have a computer at home.
My dad didn't eat much fruit.

She kissed my cheek and wished me a good night.
My friend is here.
Where do you live now?
The older you are, the harder it is to learn the language.
Tom doesn't drink coffee, but he smokes cigarettes.
Not everyone likes dogs.
I'll stay here for a few days.
I feel bad.
Why did you say such a stupid thing?
You can't beat me.
I don't think I could do that.
Is that true?
She's crying.
See you in hell.
He's my father.
He doesn't want to wait for you.
He took his family to the zoo.

Half of nine.
This car was made in Japan.
Is this your first time in Japan?

Take a photo of him!

Tom hopes he won't eat the leftovers again tonight.
Someone opened the door.
I'm not your mother.
Why isn't Tom in the car?
My name is Ricardo.
When did you get the telegram?
You shouldn't be swimming in that pond.
When will the snow melt?
He thought that I was very tired.
I don't think she wants to eat anymore.
Either you're with us or you're against us.
Please help me, I'm dying!
Tom knows he likes Mary.
I like this music.
She scared the dog.
He went to the store, but stopped at her house.
The snow is falling fast.
We're having lunch here.
Of course, I should read this book.
Tom is not in prison at the moment.
Tom and Mary went to the museum.
The ship disappeared over the horizon.

The result was disappointing.
I climbed through the window.
The meat has not yet been prepared.
Give me a piece of chalk.
She needs more sleep.
Did you hear anything?
Is she your mother?
Can you turn on the lights?
He no longer trusts the doctor.
This was the first time I visited the museum.
We had a great time.
I think Tom wants to sit down.
What a great family.
Are you still in Florida?
You shouldn't have eaten that green fish.
Get ready! Tomorrow is the last day.
We looked out the window, but we didn’t see anything.
When was the last time you saw Tom?
The capital of Sweden is Stockholm.
They talked about love.
Thomas never wants to do it again.
I don't understand.
Left alone, the child would feel very lonely.
I don't know anything here.
Our team was lacking in mobility.
The cat crossed the street.
There's a mirror there.
Why don't you help the police?
I want to meet your father.
Please keep going.
He was busy.
I am a widow.
I saw him.
I'm teaching Lo<0xC5><0xBE>bano.
"Good morning," said Tom smiling.
My arm hurts.
He needs a ladder.

You have to choose the path of your own life.
Without air and water, no one could live.

Are you busy at the moment?
I'll take back everything I said.
Where did you get all those keys?
I got in through the window.
Take Tom to the hospital.
I have a white cat.
He hastened to write down our names.
My son died during the war.
He is dissatisfied with the result.
Of course you're wrong.
I can’t say who will come first.
I don’t want to talk to you because you broke my heart.
Don't trust him.
We may as well all go.
Who's that person sitting at the other end of the table?
This idea is very attractive.
They're going shopping.
Everything that is brilliant is simple.
Her students are learning too much.
Tom raised his hand.
Put your shoes on, let's go to lunch.
The birds flew south.
This tea is very tasty.
I disagree with him.
It's my fault.
Not bad, but I'm a little tired.
That's a great idea.
He is very proud of his toy.
That's enough for us for now.
I'm not afraid at all.
A woman wants to know the truth.
Is this word often used?
Lithuania joins the European Union.
I want to be a linguist.
Where is the cat?
I'm sorry for what I did.
She became a postman.
I learned to ride a bike when I was six.
He took out a piece of chalk.
Let me do that.
I like the jazz.
I'm sure he's innocent.
Open the window and let in fresh air.
Have you ever worn a sack?
It's snowing hard.
Have you seen my mother?
I know his name.
Tom doesn't want to live like that.
Do you agree with what she does?
He came here before the end of classes.
Do you know their address?
What the hell are you doing?
He looked down at his dirty shoes.
Her cat lay on my pillow and didn’t want to get down.
There are several good hotels in the city.
Where did this letter come from?
He doesn’t want to study today.
We are all different.
You don't know how much I love you.
I wrote her a long letter.
He couldn’t do what he wanted.
I feel a little weak today.
Life is interesting.
She's here?
I don't like to be wrong.
Be careful, all right?
I bought a camera for $30.
That's great.
It’s not a method, it’s a provocation.
Reply in English.
He wants to see us again.
The water here is very shallow.
Where do you live?
My friend doesn't use sugar.
I fell off the ladder.
He knows how to interrogate people.
Bob washed the dishes at the time.
My brother is two years older than me, but he is three centimeters lower than me.
I can only tell you what I know.
I'm thinking about you.
What is your home address?
He will be free tomorrow.
Didn't you see my wife?
Your daughter heard us talking.
Thomas will die soon.
I'm used to going to bed late.
I've met him before.
Look at the house with the red roof.
My apartment is on the fourth floor.
She was already pregnant.
We are basketball players.
These clothes are good for you.
Don't blame her.
Do you know that you are stronger than you think?
I love her so much that I can’t leave her.
Can you come with us?
I don't care.
Thomas couldn’t find a reason why he needed to return home early.
Raise your hand.
He didn't sell the house.
No one has ever seen God.
She saw something waiting for her at the school.
I don't think you're busy.
Where's Mary?
The new contract allows us to demand what we want.
Tom is still a prisoner.
Go and open the door.
I said I'd call each of them later.
God, help me!
She told him she was happy.
She needs him more than he needs her.
Awesome outings!
Tom, I'm back.
You wanted to see me?
This is not a mistake.
