Members of the Welsh Assembly are concerned that they will be “associated with muppets”
Some CAs are horrified by the recommendation to change their title to "Mr. of the Parliament of Wales" (MWP).
This recommendation came as a result of plans to change the name of the Assembly to "Parliament of Wales".
WHAT all the political spectrum is concerned about is that it can provoke ridicule.
One Labour MP said his group was concerned about the rhymes with Twp and Pwp.
For readers outside of Wales: in Welsh, "twp" means "unintelligible" and "pwp" means an act of defecation.
Cha of the Welsh Party said that his group as a whole is "unhappy" and offers alternatives.
One of the Welsh conservatives said his group was "impartial" about the name change, but drew attention to the fact that the MWP could quickly become a "mappette".
In this context, the Welsh pronunciation of the letter "w" is similar to the Yorkshire English pronunciation of the letter "u".
The Assembly’s committee, which is currently developing legislation to change the names, noted: “The final decision on the new name of the members of the Assembly will certainly be made by the members themselves.”
The Welsh Self-Government Act of 2017 gives the Welsh Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public discussion of the proposals, and the renaming of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament received broad support.
As for what to call the CHA, the Commission proposes to call them “Members of the Parliament of Wales”, i.e. WMP, but the MWP version received the greatest public support.
Of course, the CA offers alternatives, but trying to reach a consensus can cause problems for the president, Elina Jones, who is due to submit a bill on changes within a few weeks.
Legislation on reforms will include other changes to the work of the assembly, including the rules for the removal of CAs and the structure of the committee system.
The CA will hold a final vote on their new name when they discuss the legislation.
Macedonians are going to vote in a referendum on changing the name of the country
On Sunday, voters will vote on whether to change the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The vote was organized with the aim of resolving a long-standing dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long argued that the name of their northern neighbor is a claim to the territory of Greece, and has repeatedly opposed Macedonia’s membership in the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Georgi Ivanov, who opposes a referendum on the name change, said he would ignore the results of the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that changing the name is simply the price to pay for joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells are silent because Harlem's churches are experiencing difficult times
“The old people I spoke to say that there used to be a bar and a church in every corner,” says Mr. Adams.
Now there is neither one nor the other.”
He believes that the disappearance of bars can be understood:
“People are socializing differently nowadays.
Bars are no longer the kind of local living room where they regularly go.”
As for the churches, Adams fears that the money from the sale of assets will not be enough for as long as the leaders expect, and “sooner or later they will be where they started.”
Churches, he added, can be replaced by houses with condominiums, and there will be people who will not help the shrines that remain nearby.
“The vast majority of people who buy condominiums in these houses will be white,” Adams explained, “so it will speed up the day when all these churches will be closed, because it is unlikely that the majority of those who move to the condominiums will become their parishioners.”
Both churches were built by white communities before Harlem became a black metropolis: the Metropolitan Community Church was built in 1870, and Saint-Martin ten years later.
The indigenous white Methodist community left here in the 1930s.
The Black community, which held ceremonies nearby, received ownership of the building.
St. Martin moved to the black community under the leadership of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, the main shopping street of Harlem. These merchants did not want to accept to serve their blacks and whites.
In 1939, the fire severely damaged the building, but Father Johnson's parishioners wanted to rebuild it and installed a carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, the son and successor of Father Johnson in St. Martin, proudly called the carillon "the bells of the poor".
The expert, who played the carillon in July, called it a "cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
This expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also noted that this is the first carillon in the world played by black musician Dionisio A. Lind, who 18 years ago moved to the larger carillon in the Riverside Church.
According to Mr. Merrivezer, in Saint-Martin he was not found a replacement.
What has been happening in Saint-Martin over the last few months is a complex story about architects and contractors, some of whom have been involved by church leaders, others by the diocese.
The Council – the governing body of the parish, which consists of secular leaders – in July wrote to the diocese that it was concerned that the diocese “will try to pass on expenses” to the council, although the council did not participate in the recruitment of architects and contractors, which it sent.
Some parishioners complained of a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
A shark injured a 13-year-old boy who was diving behind lobsters in California
According to officials, on Saturday, a shark attacked a 13-year-old boy and injured him. The boy dive after lobsters in California on the day of the opening of the lobster season.
The attack took place at about 7 a.m. near Bicon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy calling for help, and along with the group came to him to pull out of the water.
At first, Hammel thought it was just a thrill about the lobster caught, but then he realized that the boy was yelling, “I was eaten!
They tasted me!”
As soon as he reached the boy, he saw that his jaw was completely torn.
“I shouted to everyone to get out of the water: ‘Shark in the water!’” Hammel added.
The boy was taken to the Children's Hospital of the Council in San Diego, where he is in critical condition.
The species of shark that carried out the attack is unknown.
Rescue captain Larry Giles told a news briefing that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks ago, but it was found to be non-hazardous.
Giles added that the victim had received traumatic injuries to the upper torso.
For the sake of investigation and security, the authorities for 48 hours closed access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablada to Swami in Encinitas.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's to enter UK cosmetics market
Sainsbury's is going to compete with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams using islands with cosmetics similar to those available in stores. Work on the islands will be qualified sellers.
As part of the increased entry into the British market of cosmetics worth 2.8 billion pounds (continues to grow at a time when the volume of sales of clothing and household goods decreases) increased islands with cosmetics will be tested in 11 stores all over the country. In the next year, if
The investment in cosmetics is related to the fact that supermarkets are looking for ways to use the shelf space that was previously used for televisions, microwaves, and household goods.
Sainsbury’s said it would double its cosmetics range and offer up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees range will get more space: brand areas will appear similar to those in stores like Boots.
The supermarket is also updating the Boutique cosmetics range: now most of the products presented will not be tested on animals, which is increasingly demanded by young buyers.
In addition, the perfume retailer Fragrance Shop is testing its trays at two Sainsbury’s stores: the first tray opened in Croydon, North London, last week, and the second will open in Sally Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and the transition to buying small amounts of food every day in small stores forces supermarkets to make additional efforts to attract visitors.
Mike Coope, executive director of Sainsbury's, said their stores will become more like department stores as the supermarket network tries to counter Aldi and Lidl discounters with more services and non-food goods.
Sainsbury's opens Argos departments in hundreds of its stores, also opened a number of Habitats departments. Sainsbury's bought both networks two years ago and claim that this increased food sales and also made both networks more profitable.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to update the departments of cosmetics and pharmaceutical products failed.
Sainsbury's tested its partnership with Boots in the early 2000s, but it ended after a dispute over how to split pharmacy revenues in supermarkets.
The new strategy came after Sainsbury's sold its pharmacy business (281 pharmacy) Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy network, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
They agreed that Lloyds will help by adding an expanded range of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director of Sainsbury, said: “We’ve changed the look of our cosmetic islands to make the atmosphere more pleasant for buyers.
We have also invested in specially trained consultants who will be able to give advice.
The range of brands presented by us is designed to meet any need, and the pleasant atmosphere and convenient locations mean that we are now an attractive place to buy cosmetics, which is a competition of the old way of buying.”
Peter Jones 'disturbed' over Holly Willoughby's <0xC2><0xA3>11m deal
The star of "Dragon's Bed" Peter Jones is "dismayed" by the fact that TV presenter Holly Willoughby has withdrawn from a deal with his brand of goods for life (the value of the deal is <0xC2><0xA3>11 million) to focus on new contracts with Marks & Specter
Willoughby doesn’t have time for the Truly homewear and accessories brand.
The couple's business was associated with the Goop brand Gwinnett Peltrow.
The 37-year-old host of This Morning announced her departure from Instagram.
Holly Willoughby brought the star of Peter Jones' Dragon's Bed to the brink when at the last minute she stepped out of their lucrative life-time commodity business to focus on new lucrative contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources report that Jones was "disgusted" when a golden girl on TV confessed during a tense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of the Jones business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new deals worth <0xC2><0xA3>1.5million, not <0xC2><0xA3>1million, were due to her.
This business was linked to the Goop brand Gwinnett Peltrow and was to double Willoughby's fortune, which is estimated at <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones flew out of the UK to one of his holiday homes.
The source said: “Truly, without a doubt, was Holly’s top priority.
It was supposed to be her long-term future for the next few decades.
Willoughby’s decision to quit the business stunned all interested parties.
No one could believe what had happened on Tuesday, almost on the eve of the launch.
Headquarters in Marlowe has a full warehouse of ready-to-sell items.
Experts believe that the departure of the leading This Morning, which is one of the UK’s highest-paid stars, could have cost the firm millions through large investments in goods (from pillows and candles to clothing and homewear) and create further delays with the launch.
It can also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby's mother and her husband, Dan Baldwin, had been close to Jones and his wife, Tara Kapp, for ten years.
Willoughby and Kapp formed Truly in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined as chairman in March.
The couple spent the holidays together, Jones owns 40 percent of the Baldwin company, which is engaged in television production.
Willoughby will become M&S brand ambassador and replace Anthony McPartlin as I'm A Celebrity's ITV host.
A source close to Jones said last night: “We will not comment on his case.”
A tough conversation, “and then we fell in love”
He joked about the criticism he would receive from the news media for a comment someone would consider “non-presidential” and for a very positive attitude towards the North Korean leader.
“Why did President Trump make such big concessions?
said Trump, imitating the voice of the news leader. —
I didn’t make any concessions.”
He noted that Kim was interested in the second meeting after Trump called their first meeting in Singapore in June a major step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
But the talks on denuclearization have gone to a deaf angle.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly that North Korea was not seeing a "relevant response" from the United States to its first steps towards disarmament.
Instead, he noted, the United States continues to impose sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Speaking at his rally, Trump was much more optimistic.
“We have good relations with North Korea,” he said.
We were going to fight with North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
We have such a wonderful relationship now.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had brought positive results: the end of missile tests, the release of hostages and the return of the remnants of U.S. military personnel to their homes.
He also defended his unusual approach when he talked about his relationship with Kim.
“It’s so easy to behave like a president, but instead of 10,000 people on the street trying to get into this battle-laden stadium, we have about 200 people standing right there,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd right in front of him.
The tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia destroyed the island, hundreds of dead
In particular, after the earthquake in Lombok, foreign NGOs were told that their assistance was not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok’s population was affected, the national disaster was not declared, and this is a prerequisite for international assistance.
“In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it clear that they are not seeking international aid, so it is somewhat difficult,” Sumbung said.
Although “Save the Children” gathers a team to travel to Palu, it is not known if foreign personnel will be able to work on the spot.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster agency, said the Indonesian authorities are evaluating the situation in Palu to determine whether to allow international organizations to provide assistance.
Given the constant earthquakes in Indonesia, the country remains terribly unprepared for nature’s anger.
Tsunami shelters have been built in the province of Aceh, but they are not typical of other coastlines.
The apparent absence of a siren warning about the tsunami in Palu, although the warning was effective, probably contributed to the deaths.
Moving between the many Indonesian islands is not just even in the best times.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
A medical ship that was in Lombok to treat the victims of the earthquake is sailing to Palo, but will be able to get to the site of the new disaster in at least three days.
President Joko Widodo has made improvements to Indonesia’s infrastructure the basis of his election campaign and increased spending on roads and railways.
But the lack of funding has created problems for the Joko administration, which plans to relocate next year.
Mr. Joko is also hampered by long-standing interfaith hostility in parts of Indonesia where members of the Muslim majority have chosen a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people have been killed, tens of thousands displaced from their homes as a result of confrontations between Christian and Muslim gangs on the streets using machetes, bows, arrows and other primitive weapons.
Watch: Daniel Starridge from Liverpool scores a goal from the depths of the field and equalizes the score with Chelsea
Daniel Starridge saved Liverpool from defeating Chelsea in the Premier League with his 89th-minute goal on Saturday at London's Stamford Bridge.
Starridge received a pass from Jordan Shachiri when he was at a distance of about 27 meters from Chelsea's gate. At this point his team lost with a score of 1-0.
He threw the ball on the left leg and charged it in the direction of the long rod.
The ball flew high above the penalty in the direction of the upper right corner of the gate.
He flew over the bouncing Cape Arrisabalaga and fell into the gate.
“It was just an attempt to take that position in order not to waste time. Players like Shachiri are always attacking as much as possible, so I just tried to make sure I had as much time as possible,” Starridge told LiverpoolFC.com.—
I saw Kante approaching and made one touch, I didn't think about it too much and just took the ball.
Chelsea led 1-0 after the first half, in which Belgian star Eden Azar scored a goal in the 25th minute.
The striker of the blues handed the pass back to Mateo Kovacic, swung near the middle of the field and quickly ran to half of Liverpool.
Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87> quickly played against the wall in the middle of the field.
Next, he made a good penetrating pass, which brought Azar to the penalty.
Azar bypassed the defense and made a decisive leg kick in the grid of the long bar. The ball passed the goalkeeper "Liverpool" Alison Becker.
Liverpool will play against Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League at 15:00 on Wednesday at the stadium of Sao Paulo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will play against Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 15:00 on Thursday in London.
Tsunami death toll in Indonesia rises to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the Indonesian disaster agency said on Sunday morning.
Many people were trapped in the debris of buildings destroyed during Friday's 7.5-point earthquake, which caused waves of 6 meters in height, Sutopo news agency spokesman Purvo Nugroho said at a press conference.
The city of Palu, home to more than 380,000 people, was flooded with debris from destroyed buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death
The investigation into the murder began after the woman’s body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
A 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. with wounds in Grayson Muse, John Street. A 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police have called for people to respond who have seen or heard something.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan commented: "The investigation is now in its early stages, but I ask everyone who has been near John Street in Birkenhead and has seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I also ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, who could have taken anything on the video recorder, to contact us, as the information on these videos can be very important for our investigation.”
A police official confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a resident of Birkenhead and was found in the house.
Today in the afternoon, friends who believe they know a woman came to the scene of the crime to ask where she was found this morning.
Investigations are ongoing, and police said they are currently informing the victim’s immediate relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grayson-Maws had just tried to return to his apartment, but police said no one was allowed to enter and leave the house.
When he found out what had happened, he lost the gift of language.
Residents are now told that it will take hours before they are allowed to return home.
Someone heard a policeman tell one man that the whole area is now considered a crime scene.
At the scene of the crime, a woman appeared in tears.
She said, “It’s so horrible.”
At 2:00 p.m., two police vans stood behind the fence, another van in front of the fence.
Several policemen stood behind the fence and watched the apartment building.
Anyone who has information is asked to write a direct message to <0x40>MerPolCC, call 101 or call Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 and name the code 247 and the date of September 30.
The statue of Cromwell near the Parliament becomes a new monument that suffers from the "rewriting of history"
The removal of the statue would be a well-deserved retribution for the Taliban-style destruction of many of England's cultural and religious artifacts by its fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Community called Mr. Crick’s proposal “foolishness” and “an attempt to rewrite history.”
John Goldsmith, head of the Cromwell Community, said: “Given the ongoing debate over the removal of statues, it was inevitable that the statue of Oliver Cromwell at Westminster Palace would become a target.”
The iconoclasm during the English Civil Wars was not carried out by Cromwell himself or by his orders.
It is likely that Cromwell will undeservedly be sacrificed for the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent statue of Cromwell sculptor William Hamo Thornecroft is a testament to the mood of the 19th century and part of the historiography of the figure, which, in the opinion of many, is still worthy of reverence.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Many probably more in the late 19th century than now, consider Cromwell a defender of parliament from external pressure, in his case, of course, a monarchy.
Whether such an idea is quite accurate is the subject of ongoing historical debate.
There is no doubt only that the conflict of the mid-17th century determined the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is one of the well-known figures who represents one side of this conflict.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also to be celebrated and honoured.”
Pig killer kills Chinese farmer to death
According to local media, the farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest China.
The man, identified only by the name Yuan, was found dead in blood with a ruptured artery near a pig market in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
In Sinin, Qinghai Province, China, on May 30, 2005, a pig farmer is about to vaccinate pigs in a pig farm.
It is reported that on Wednesday he left with his cousin from the neighboring Yunnan province to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his brother found him dead and saw that the door of the pig farm was open.
The brother noted that there was a large herd of pigs with blood on its mouth.
A forensic examination confirmed that a 249-kilogram cockroach killed the farmer to death.
“My cousin’s feet were in blood and distorted,” said the victim’s cousin named Wu, quoted as saying by Guiyang Evening News.
A security camera footage showed that Yuan entered the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The market leader told Evening News that when police gathered evidence at the scene, the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking people.
It is reported that seven I Yuan and the market administration are discussing compensation for his death.
Although rare, but cases of attacks by pigs on humans have been recorded before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts and injured the man critically.
Ten years before that, a 295-kg pig held a Welsh farmer pressed to a tractor until the farmer's wife frightened the animal.
After a farmer from Oregon ate his own pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can become a “trigger.”
“They’re just playful.
They're like kids, very curious... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to treat them with due respect,” he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa will bring extensive rainfall to the southwest of the United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over cooler waters off the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days, Rosa will bring rain with floods to the north of Mexico and the south-west of the United States.
Rose had a wind speed of 137 km/h (this is a Category 1 hurricane) at 5 a.m. Eastern time on Sunday and was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It is expected that on Sunday Rosa will go to the north.
Meanwhile, over the Pacific Ocean, a dam is beginning to form, moving east to the west coast of the United States. When on Monday Rose approaches the Lower California Peninsula in the form of a tropical storm, it will begin to push a strong tropical moisture north to south.
On Monday, Rosa will bring up to 25.4 cm of rain in some parts of Mexico.
Further, in the coming days, tropical humidity, which interacts with the approaching rainforest, will create heavy rainfall in the southwest.
In this area from 2.54 to 10.2 cm of rain will cause dangerous floods, waste streams and the possibility of landslides in the desert.
Heavy tropical humidity will lead to an increase in precipitation at places up to 5-7.6 cm per hour, especially in some parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
5–10.2 cm of rain is expected in some parts of the southwest, especially in large parts of Arizona.
Floods are possible with a rapid deterioration of conditions due to the scattered nature of tropical rains.
We strongly advise not to go to the desert on foot, because tropical rains are possible.
Heavy rain can make the canyons stormy rivers, and thunderstorms will bring windstorms and dust storms here.
The approach of the dam will cause heavy rain in some parts of the northern coast of California.
The amount of rainfall can exceed 1.27 cm, which can lead to flabby waste streams and slippery roads.
This will be the first rainfall in the region in the rainy season.
Some scattered tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona late on Sunday and early on Monday, and in the evening on Monday and Tuesday the rains will become more extensive.
Heavy rain will go over the For-Corners from Tuesday to Wednesday.
In October, there may be intense temperature changes throughout the U.S. as the Arctic gets colder, but the tropics remain quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to sharp temperature changes over short distances.
On Sunday, you will be able to see a great example of sharp temperature changes in the central part of the United States.
This is a nearly 7-degree temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, as well as between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the summer heat will try to return and spread again.
It is expected that a significant area of the center and east of the United States will be warm by October, and the temperature from the southern plains to some parts of the northeast will be 27 degrees Celsius.
The temperature in New York can reach 27 degrees Celsius on Tuesday, which is about 12 degrees Celsius above the average temperature.
According to our long-term weather forecast, there is a high probability of exceeding average temperatures in the eastern part of the United States in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched the hearing in the case of Brett Cavanaugh
On Thursday, more than 20 million people in six television networks watched the exciting testimonies of Supreme Court Justice Brett Cavanaugh and Christine Blaise Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual assault that allegedly occurred in the 1980s.
The political confrontation continued, with channels interrupting scheduled programs to report Friday's latest news: an agreement prepared by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake to conduct an FBI one-week investigation into the indictment.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100 percent sure that Cavanaugh had drunk her and tried to strip her off at a high school party.
In his emotional testimonies, Kavanaugh said he was 100 percent sure that this was not the case.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people watched this on Friday, according to the research company Nielsen.
The company counted the average audience of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
It was not possible to immediately get the numbers from other networks that also showed hearings, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Also, Nielsen usually has problems measuring the number of people who watch TV in offices.
For comparison, such an audience is similar in size to an audience that watches a playoff series match or an Oscar.
Fox News Channel, whose headlines strongly supported Kavanaugh’s appointment, was the leader among all channels during the day-long hearing, with an average viewership of 5.69 million, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
According to Nielsen, CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC had 2.94 million viewers, MSNBC had 2.89 million viewers, and CNN had 2.52 million viewers.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake became the central character of Friday's drama.
The office of this moderate Republican has published a statement that he will vote for Cavanaugh. After that, on Friday morning, CNN and CBS cameras recorded how protesters were yelling at Flake as he tried to go on the elevator to the Judiciary Committee hearings.
He stood with his eyes down for a few minutes, during which he was teased, which was broadcast live on CNN.
“I’m standing right in front of you,” said one woman.
Do you think he is telling the truth?
They said to him, “You have power, but many women are powerless.”
Flake said his office had published a statement and, before the elevator closed, added that he would say more at the committee hearing.
All cable and broadcast channels aired live hours later, when the Judiciary Committee was to vote on Kavanaugh’s nomination for the Senate in full.
Flake said he would only do so if he knew that the FBI would consider the accusation against the candidate next week, which is demanded by a democratic minority.
Flake was partly persuaded by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Kuns.
After a conversation with Kuns, and then with a few more senators, Flake made the decision.
Flake's election had an impact because it was obvious that Republicans would not have the votes to nominate Cavanaugh's candidacy without an investigation.
President Trump has initiated an FBI investigation into the allegations against Cavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Theresa May accuses critics of 'playing politics' around Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of “playing politics” with the future of Britain and undermining national interests.
On September 29, 2018, British Prime Minister Theresa May arrived at a Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, UK.
In another interview, which came alongside Teresa’s front page interview, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson criticized her so-called Chequers Brexit plan, saying that offering Britain and the EU to levy tariffs on each other would be “absolutely”
Who Shot Wade Sims: Police Arrest Dayton Simpson on Suspicion of Death of University of Louisiana Player
Police have arrested a suspect in the shooting that led to the death of Wade Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player from the University of Louisiana.
20-year-old Dayton Simpson was arrested and sent to prison on charges of second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge police department said.
Officials released a video of the dispute between Simms and Simpson, and police said Simms lost his glasses during the fight.
According to the affiliated CBS television channel WAFB, the police removed the glasses from the crime scene and noted that they found the DNA of Simpson on them.
After questioning Simpson, police reported that he confessed to having shot Wade.
According to the lawyer, he was given a bail in the amount of $350,000.
The East Button Rose Coroner's office on Friday released a preliminary report stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The department expresses its gratitude to the Louisiana State Police Special Investigation Unit, the State Police Criminal Laboratory, the Southern University Police and local citizens for assisting in the investigation that facilitated the arrest.
Louisiana State University Sports Director Joe Alleva thanked the local law enforcement agencies for their “dedication and aspirations to justice.”
Simsa was 20 years old.
He grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for the University of Louisiana.
Last season, his average score was 5.6 points and 2.6 picks.
On Friday morning, University of Louisiana basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "devastated" and "shocked" by Wade's death.
“That’s what bothers you all the time,” Wade said.
Volcano throws ashes at Mexico City
The ash that emits the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern regions of the capital of Mexico.
The National Disaster Prevention Center on Saturday urged Mexicans to stay away from the volcano, as activity began in the crater and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded in 24 hours.
The center monitored numerous noises and thrusts.
The photo on social networks shows thin layers of ash on the windshield of cars on the outskirts of Mexico City, such as Hochimilco.
Geophysicists have noticed an increase in the activity of the volcano, located 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital, following the 7.1-score earthquake in central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists on the eve of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after protesters advocating independence clashed with a special police unit. Thousands of people joined protesters' demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's separation vote.
A separatist group in masks, held back by special forces, threw eggs and powder paint at them, creating dark dust clouds on the streets, which are usually full of tourists.
The clashes took place and later that day, the police used sticks to deter aggression.
A few hours later, a group of independence supporters who chanted “Let’s not forget, let’s not forgive!” were confronted by supporters of the country’s preservation, who shouted: “Long live Spain!”
According to the local press, fourteen people were provided with assistance in light injuries sustained during the protests.
A year after the referendum on 1 October, which was declared illegal by Madrid but is marked by Catalan separatists, tensions in the region, which seeks independence, remain high.
Voters mostly decided to vote for independence, but the turnout was low, because the majority of those against the division boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured in violent clashes last year as a result of police attempts to stop voting at polling stations across the region.
Independence groups spent the night on Friday in tents to prevent demonstrations in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place, but was forced to go another route.
Narcisse Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who took part in a separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer had hopes that Catalonia could gain independence.
“Last year we had one of our best moments.
I watched my parents cry for joy that they can vote, but now we’re in a deaf corner,” he said.
Despite the vital but very difficult victory in the regional elections in December last year, the Catalan parties advocating independence have not been able to keep the momentum of this year, because many of their most famous leaders are in voluntary exile or exile.
Hoan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who filmed a protest in support of the police over the phone, said the conflict was provoked by politicians on both sides.
“The tension is rising,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Hunqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been in solitary confinement since the end of last year, announced that he would run for the European Parliament next year.
“The status of a candidate in the European elections is the best way to condemn the regression of democratic values and repression that we are witnessing from the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Men Arrested After Car Enters Home
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after the car entered a house in Londonderry on several occasions.
The incident took place at Ballinagard Crescent on Thursday at 7:30 p.m. British Standard Time.
Detective Inspector Bob Bloomings noted that the gate and the house itself were damaged.
It is possible that at some point the car was fired from an arbalète.
Menga's blow secured Liverpool's victory over the Rangers with a 1-0 score
Dolly Menga's first goal at the Liverstone was a win.
Raised in the Livingston class, he stunned the Rangers and brought Stephen Gerrard a second defeat out of 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
The strike of Dolly Menga proved decisive: Gary Holt's team rose to one level from the Hibernian in a second.
Gerrard's team hasn't won a single outing in the Premier League this season and will play with the Harts leaders next Sunday, from which she is eight points behind.
Before that, on Thursday, the Rangers will receive the "Fast Vienna" within the framework of the European League.
Meanwhile, Livingston continues its unbeaten run to six games in the division, and head coach Holt has not yet been defeated after replacing Kenny Miller last month.
"Livingston" misses the chances that give reckless guests.
Holt's team had to be ahead long before they scored, because their straightforwardness creates all sorts of problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through the defense, but made a punch along the gate, then Alan Litgow broke through the gate after pushing through and took the punch of Craig Hulkett along the gate, which he made his head.
The owners were pleased that they allowed the Rangers to play in front of them, while they knew that they could cause problems for guests from standard positions.
That’s how the final goal was scored.
The Rangers missed the free kick, and the Livingston made the opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson involving Menga, who took the ball and scored from the penalty center.
Prior to this stage, the Rangers dominated possession of the ball, but the defense of the field's owners proved impenetrable for them and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was mostly not disturbed.
This trend continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos managed to strike in the direction of Kelly.
Scott Pittman's kick kicked away from Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor. Litgow knocked past the gate in another standard combination of Livingston.
The wings were constantly flying into the Liverpool Penalty and were constantly neutralized, and two requests for a penalty - after Halkett's attack on Glenn Middleton, who was replaced, and for the game by hand - were rejected.
The "Livingston" phenomenon: analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal game and the result of "Livingstone".
All played well together, they continued to exceed expectations on this ascending trajectory.
Their style of play and composition remained virtually unchanged after returning to the highest level, but it should be paid tribute to Holt for how he mobilized the team after his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Hulkett played great, organized the defense very well, and Menga forced Connor Goldson and Joe Warral to be constantly alert.
The Rangers, however, had no inspiration.
They used to play very well under the leadership of Gerrard, but now they do not reach those standards.
They didn’t have the last ball — only once they broke through the defense of the field owners — and it was something like an awakening for the Rangers, who were in the middle of the table.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an was unambiguously accepted in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29th), when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met in Berlin, smiles and a blue sky were seen.
This is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany aimed at restoring relations between NATO allies.
There have been some controversies over issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey’s accession to the EU.
Then Erdogan went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
For security reasons, the police did not allow 25,000 people to gather in front of the mosque, but many supporters of the president still showed up nearby to see him.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan - many of them Kurds - have also forced themselves to listen, condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to invite him to the country.
Bilateral protests testify to the ambiguity of the guest, whom some German Turks have called a hero and others a dictator.
Road accident in Depford: a cyclist died in a collision with a car
A cyclist was killed in a collision with a car in London.
The accident occurred at the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street on a busy road in the Deptford area of the southeast of the city at about 10:15 a.m. British standard time.
The driver stopped and paramedics arrived at the scene, but the man died on the spot.
The accident occurred a few months after another cyclist died after the driver escaped from the scene of the accident to Childers Street, about 1.6 km from the Saturday accident.
London police said they were working to identify the man’s identity in order to inform his closest relatives.
Travel is prohibited and bus routes have been changed, motorists are advised to avoid this zone.
Long Lartine Prison: Six prisoners injured in riots
Six prison workers were injured as a result of riots in the men's prison of the strict regime, the prison administration said.
The riots at Her Majesty's Long Lartine Prison in Worcestershire began around 9:30 a.m. on Sunday and are still ongoing.
To stop the riots, initiated by eight prisoners and located in the same wing, a special unit "Tornado" was called.
The officers were provided with medical care in connection with minor facial injuries received at the scene of the incident.
A spokesman for the prison service commented: “Specially trained prison personnel have been involved in resolving the incident that is taking place in Her Majesty’s Long-Lartine prison.
Six employees received medical care in connection with the injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and make it clear that those responsible will be sent to the police and the duration of their stay behind bars can be extended.”
In the prison of Her Majesty Long Lartine there are more than 500 prisoners, among them the most dangerous offenders of the country.
In June, it was reported that the head of the prison was sent for inpatient treatment after the prisoner's attack.
In October last year, a special police unit was summoned to the prison to stop serious riots, during which prisoners were attacked with billiards layers
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City with drought floods (dry areas may benefit)
Tropical depression seldom strikes Arizona, but that could happen early next week as the remnants of Hurricane Rosa head across the southwest desert, creating a risk of flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings of flooding on Monday and Tuesday on the territory of western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Soho.
It is expected that Rosa will go straight through the Phoenix on Tuesday, and in the evening there will be rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted on Twitter that only ten tropical cyclones have retained tropical storm or depression status within 200 miles (322 km) of the Phoenix since 1950.
and Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles (64.4 km) of the Arizona border.
According to the latest forecasts of the National Hurricane Center, the area of Mogollon-Rome in Arizona is expected to be 5.08 to 10.16 cm, and sometimes up to 15.24 cm of precipitation.
Other areas of the southwest desert, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, are likely to receive from 2.54 to 5.08 cm of precipitation, sometimes up to 10.16 cm.
Where there is no risk of flooding, Rose’s rain can be a blessing as the region suffers from drought.
While flooding is a very serious problem, some of these floods are likely to be useful as the southwest is currently experiencing drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitoring Center, just over 40 percent of Arizona’s territory suffers from at least extreme drought, which is the second highest category of drought, weather.com reports.
First, the path of Hurricane Rosa leads to landslides on the Mexican peninsula of Lower California.
Rosa, still in hurricane force on Sunday morning with a maximum wind speed of 137 km per hour, is located 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and moving north at a speed of 19.3 km per hour.
The storm meets with cooler water in the Pacific Ocean and therefore weakens.
Thus, in the event of a tropical storm in the afternoon or evening, it is expected that the hurricane will cause a shift in Mexico.
The amount of rainfall in some parts of Mexico can be significant, creating a significant risk of flooding.
“The total amount of precipitation from Lower California to northwestern Sonora is expected to be between 7.62 and 15.24 cm, sometimes up to 25.4 cm,” weather.com reports.
Next, Rose will go north through Mexico as a tropical storm, reach the Arizona border early in the morning as a tropical depression, which will go further across Arizona, and reach South Utah late in the evening on Tuesday.
“The main danger expected from Rosa or her remains is very heavy rainfall in Lower California, northwestern Sonora and the southwestern U.S. desert,” the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
It is expected that these rains will lead to life-threatening floods and waste streams in the deserts, as well as landslides in mountainous terrain.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four People Arrested for Attempting to Murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of a murder attempt after a 16-year-old boy was found in Somerset with a knife wound.
The injured teenager was found in the area of Excelsior Terrace in Midsomer Norton at around 4:00 a.m. British standard time on Saturday.
He was taken to a hospital where he remains in stable condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested at night in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset police said.
Police are asked to respond to anyone who may have any video of these events on the phone.
Trump Says Kavanaugh 'Tolerates Uglyness and Anger' of Democratic Party
“The vote for Judge Cavanaugh is a vote against the relentless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a rally in Willing, West Virginia.
Trump said Cavanaugh had "tolerated the recklessness and anger" of the Democratic Party throughout the process of his nomination.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, reluctantly and emotionally denying the accusations of Christine Blaise Ford that he sexually assaulted her several decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing on the allegations she made.
On Saturday, the president said that on that day “the American people saw the brilliance, character and courage” of Cavanaugh.
“The voice behind Judge Kavanaugh is the voice of one of the most accomplished lawyers of our time, a lawyer with impeccable public service experience,” he told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president hastened to mention Kavanaugh’s nomination when he spoke about the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
“Five weeks from now, there will be some of the most important choices in our lives.
“I’m not running, but I’m running,” he said.
That’s why I’m fighting for great candidates everywhere.”
Trump argued that the mission of the Democrats is “to oppose and obstruct.”
The first key procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh’s candidacy is expected to take place no later than Friday, an assistant to one of the Republican leaders told CNN.
Hundreds of people have died from earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, the number of victims is increasing
At least 384 people died, many were swept into the ocean when giant waves hit the beach as a result of an intense earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people rested at a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday when waves of up to six meters (18 feet) in the twilight crashed over the shore, knocking many to death and destroying everything on their way.
The tsunami occurred after the earthquake with a force of 7.5 points.
“When yesterday there was a tsunami threat, people were still doing their business on the beach and did not immediately start fleeing, and they became victims,” Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, a representative of the Indonesian disaster agency, told a briefing in Jakarta.
“It wasn’t just a tsunami, it was driving cars, trees, houses, it was hitting everything that was on land,” Nugroho said, adding that before hitting the coastline, the tsunami had passed through the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h (497 miles/h).
To escape the tsunami, some people climbed trees and survived, he added.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Air photographs published by the disaster agency show that many buildings and shops have been destroyed, bridges turned upside down and destroyed, and the mosque is surrounded by water.
The riots in the coastal city continued on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in the area, where live 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) said the energy released as a result of a strong earthquake on Friday was 200 times the energy of an atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geographic location of the city, located at the end of a long, narrow bay, could have contributed to the tsunami, the agency said.
Nugroho called the damage "wide-scale" and noted that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels were destroyed.
The bodies of some of the victims were found under the debris of the destroyed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 missing.
Nugroho noted that the casualties and damage could be greater than 300 km (190 miles) along the coastline north of Palu in an area called Donggal, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
“The lines of communication were completely damaged, and we did not receive any information” from Donggala, Nugroho said.
More than 300,000 people live there, the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers had left for the affected areas.
“This is already a tragedy, but it can become much bigger,” the message said.
On Saturday, the agency received widespread criticism for not reporting that the tsunami struck Palu, although officials said the waves came at the time indicated in the warning.
On amateur footage, which people shared on social media, you can see a man on the top floor of the house shouting mad warnings about the tsunami approaching people on the street under the building.
After a few minutes, the water wall hit the shore, taking with it buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately verify the authenticity of the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a severe power outage, which severely disrupted the connection around Palu, making it difficult to coordinate rescue operations.
Soldiers began sending cargo planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but the evacuated people are still in dire need of food and other essentials.
The city’s airport has been opened only for assistance, and it will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was due to visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia is more than 800.
That's very bad.
World Vision staff from Donggala have safely reached the city of Palu, where they hide in tarpaulin tents installed in the yard of their office, but along the way they saw scenes of devastation, Mr. Doseba said.
“They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses,” he shared.
That's very bad.
Even when the aid groups began decisive action to eliminate the consequences of the disaster, some complained that foreign humanitarian aid workers with extensive experience were not allowed to go to Palu.
According to Indonesian rules, funding, supply and provision of personnel from abroad can only begin if the disaster site is declared a national disaster zone.
This hasn't happened yet.
“It’s still a disaster at the province level,” said Aulia Arriani, a representative of the Indonesian Red Cross.
As soon as the government says, “Okay, this is a national disaster,” we will be able to accept international aid, but this status has not yet been granted.
The second night fell on Palu after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, and the friends and families of those who have not yet been found, still hoped that the appearance of their loved ones will be a miracle that will decorate these gloomy plots of natural disasters.
On Saturday, the little boy was taken out of the sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers picked up a woman who had been lying under stones for two days with her mother's body next to her.
Gendo Subandono, the head coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, trained two missing paragliders to participate in the Asian Games held earlier this month in Indonesia.
Other paragliders who were trapped at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
“As an elder in paragliding, I have my emotional burden,” he said.
Mr. Hendon tells how hours after news of the destruction of the Roa Roa hotel, which spread among the paraglider community, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to Pal’s rivals who took part in the beach festival.
However, his messages were marked with only one grey check mark, not double blue check marks.
“I think that means the messages have not been delivered,” he said.
Thieves robbed $26,750 at ATM in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink employee who was filling an ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to news from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car emptied the ATM in the entertainment complex and was preparing to add more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the news.
While he was busy, another man "runned back to the Brink employee" and stole a bag of money intended for replenishment.
Witnesses noticed several suspects fleeing the scene, the news said, but police did not specify the number of participants in the incident.
Anyone with information about these individuals should contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to E.
On Saturday, announcing the change on Twitter, he wrote: “Previously officially known as Kanye West.”
The 41-year-old West was called E for some time, and he used this abbreviation as the title for his album, released in June.
The change took place on the eve of his appearance on the show Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new album Yandhi.
For the show, he replaces singer Ariana Grande, who cancelled her participation for “emotional reasons,” the show’s author said.
This is not only an abbreviation of the current professional name, West has previously said that the word has a religious meaning for him.
"I believe 'is' is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," West said earlier this year, discussing the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
Kanye, which means “one,” was shortened to simply “There is—it’s just a reflection of our good, our bad, our confused, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are.”
Kanye is one of several well-known rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs, formerly known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, announced this year that he had chosen the name Love and Brazer Love.
West's former colleague, Jay-Z, also experimented with deficiencies and capital letters.
Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador vows not to use the army against civilians
The newly elected president of Mexico, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, has promised never to use the army against civilians. Soon the country will celebrate the 50th anniversary of the bloody massacre of students.
On Saturday in Tlatelolco Square, Lopez Obrador promised “never to use the army to oppress the Mexican people.”
On October 2, 1968, the military shelled a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing about 300 people. At that time, leftist student movements began to form throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by providing monthly grants to those studying, and to open more free state universities.
He noted that unemployment and the lack of opportunities for education lead young people to criminal groups.
The U.S. should double funding in the field of artificial intelligence
As China increases its activity in the field of artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount it spends on research in the field, says Kai-Fu Lee, an AI investor and practitioner who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These comments were made after various parts of the U.S. government made statements about AI, although the U.S. has no formal AI strategy at all.
Meanwhile, China presented its plan last year: it aims to become No. 1 in AI innovation by 2030.
“A double AI research budget would be a good start, given that all other countries are far behind the U.S. and we are preparing for the next breakthrough in AI,” Lee said.
Double funding could double the likelihood that the next big AI achievement will be made in the U.S., Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book “Superpowers of AI: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in Face++, one of China’s most famous AI companies.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that defeated the best American player at Othello, and later served as the executive director of Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee noted previous competitions with technology held by the U.S. government, such as the Robotics Challenge of the Advanced Defense Research Projects Agency (DARPA), and asked when they would be next to help identify the next prospective participants.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to win state grants, Lee said.
“It’s not China that takes away academic leaders, it’s corporations,” he said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired university lights in recent years to work on AI.
According to Lee, changes in immigration policy could also help the U.S. increase its AI efforts.
“I believe that the Green Card should be automatically offered to AI science candidates,” he said.
The State Council of China published its Plan for the Development of the Next Generation of Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
The National Science Foundation of China provides funding to individuals working in academic institutions, similar to how the National Science Foundation and other U.S. government organizations give money to U.S. researchers, with the quality of academic work in China lower, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense set up a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center to engage industry and academic partners, and the White House announced the creation of a Special Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
Also this month, DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in the AI Next initiative.
As for the National Science Foundation, it is now investing more than $100 million per year in AI research.
Meanwhile, the U.S. legislature, which sought to set up the National Commission on the Security of Artificial Intelligence, has not taken any steps in a few months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on changing the name of the country
The people of Macedonia voted on Sunday in a referendum on whether to change the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia", which will resolve a long-standing dispute with Greece that blocked Macedonia's membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of the northern neighbor is a claim to its territory, and has vetoed Macedonia’s accession to NATO and the EU.
In June, the two governments signed the agreement on the basis of the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents of the agreement claim that this change will undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority in Macedonia.
President Georg Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and due to the boycott campaign, there are doubts about whether the attendance of voters will reach a minimum of 50%, which will allow the referendum to be considered valid.
The question in the referendum bulletin is: “Do you support membership in NATO and the EU subject to the acceptance of an agreement with Greece?”
Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that this is the price that Macedonia, one of the countries formed after the collapse of Yugoslavia, should pay for joining bodies such as the EU and NATO.
“I came today to vote for the future of the country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that it can live freely under the auspices of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us,” said 79-year-old Olivera Georgievska in Skopje.
Although the result of the vote does not entail legal obligations, enough members of parliament have said they will support it to make it decisive.
Two-thirds of the votes in parliament will be needed to change the name.
The State Election Commission said that there were no reports of violations until 13:00.
However, the turnout was only 16% compared to 34% in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66% of registered voters cast their ballots.
“I have come to vote for my children, our place in Europe,” said 62-year-old voter Gyoze Tanevski in the capital Skopje.
On September 30, 2018, in Strumica, Macedonia, Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko gave their vote in a referendum on changing the name of the country, opening the way for accession to NATO and the European Union.
Before the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small scene and put chairs in front of tents organized by those who will boycott the referendum.
“We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to come there with our heads proudly raised, not through the service door,” Kavardarkov said.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of European-Asian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev believes that NATO membership will bring much needed investment to Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is more than 20%.
“I believe that the overwhelming majority will vote in favour, as more than 80% of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after the vote.
He said that the “yes” result would be a confirmation of their future.
According to a poll published last Monday by the Institute of Political Studies of Macedonia, 30 to 43% of voters will participate in the referendum, which is below the required turnout.
According to another survey conducted by the Macedonian TV channel Telma, 57% of respondents are scheduled to vote on Sunday.
70% of them said they would vote in favour.
In order for the referendum to be valid, attendance must be 50% plus one vote.
The defeat in the referendum will be the first serious blow to the policy of the pro-Western government since its beginning in May last year.
Watch: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City passes all the defense of Brighton and scores a goal
Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling passed Brighton's defense and brought Manchester City a 2-0 win on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero's goal in the 65th minute of the match looked ridiculously simple.
The Argentine striker received a pass in the center of the field at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran between the three Brighton defenders and found himself in the open field.
Then Aguero realized that he was surrounded by four green ones.
He bypassed one defender, then bypassed several more on the edge of the Brighton penalty.
Then he made a left pass, seeing Sterling.
The English forward made the first touch on the penalty kick to give the ball to Aguero, who with his right boot launched it into the right part of the goal, defeating Brighton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan.
“Aguero has some foot problems,” Pep Guardiola, the City manager, told reporters.
We agreed that he would play 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We’re lucky he scored a goal at the moment.”
But the initial advantage of the sky-blue in this match Premier League provided Sterling.
The goal was scored in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball deep in the territory of Brighton.
He sent a beautiful penetrating pass along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Leroy made several touches and then made Sterling's pass in the direction of the long rod.
The sky-blue forward threw the ball into the goal just before slipping outside the boundary.
City will meet Hofenheim in the group stage of the Champions League at 12:55 on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena stadium in Zinsheim, Germany.
Sherzer wants to take off the glasses in "Rokis"
Since the Washington Nationals left the playoffs, there was no reason to wait for the next start.
But prone to rivalry Sherzer hopes to go to the pitcher's hill on Sunday in the match against "Colorado Rockis" provided that "Rokis" will still have difficulty with the exit to the play-offs. Now "Rokis" for a game ahead of "Los".
The Rokis have at least a wild card for winning with a 5-2 score over the Nasjonals on Friday night, but are still seeking to secure the title of the first division.
“Despite the fact that we’re playing for nothing, at least we’ll be able to leave the ball knowing how the spectators are behaving here in Denver, and the other team will probably be playing at the highest level I’ve seen in all this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to participate in this competition?
The Nasyonals will announce who will be the starting pitcher on Sunday, but it is reported that they are inclined to think that it will be Scherzer.
Scherzer, for whom it will be the 34th start, held a pitting session on Thursday and can play on Sunday, his usual weekend.
Washington's right has a score of 18-7 out of 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts at 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump's rally in West Virginia
The president hastened to mention the situation around his candidate for the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh, when he spoke about the importance of the presence of Republican supporters in the midterm elections.
“Everything we’ve done will be put on the map in November.
In five weeks, there will be some of the most important choices in our lives.
It’s one of the big, big ones – I don’t run, but I really run, so I fight for great candidates wherever I can.”
Trump continued, “You see this terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, you see it happening right now.
And they're firmly inclined to return power by any means you can see vileness, stupidity.
They don’t care who suffers from them, who needs to cross over to get power and control, they want power and control, we’re not going to give them.”
The mission of the Democrats, he said, is “to oppose and obstruct.”
“And you’ve seen it in the last four days,” he said, calling Democrats “evil and vile, ugly and lying.”
He mentioned the Senate Judiciary Committee, naming Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein by name, which provoked the audience to loud cries of discontent.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you get the paperwork?
E-eh, what.
No, uh, no, I’m waiting — it was really bad body language — the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
The Labour Party is no longer a broad church.
It is intolerant to those who express their opinions.
When the Momentum activists in my local party voted to condemn me, it was almost a surprise.
After all, I am the last of those Labour Members of Parliament who have been told that they are not happy, and all because we are expressing our opinion.
My fellow Member of Parliament, Joan Ryan, has been treated almost in the same way because she has strongly opposed anti-Semitism.
I was convicted of not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe. These issues are ironically similar to those on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The report on the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday said: “We want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
Most of the evening Friday meetings of the General Committee in my eight years as a local Member of Parliament from the Labour Party were exactly like this.
Unfortunately, today many meetings have a completely different tone, and the promise of "more friendly, softer" politics has long been forgotten, if it ever began to be implemented.
It is becoming increasingly obvious that the Labour Party does not allow for different views and each opinion is assessed from the point of view of whether it is acceptable for the leadership of the party.
It started shortly after Jeremy became a leader. Colleagues with whom I previously seemed to have similar political views began to expect me to turn 180 degrees and take positions that I would never agree with. Whether it is a national security or not.
Whenever I speak in public — and it doesn’t matter what I say — a tyranny of social media attacks with calls for revocation, condemnation of the centre’s politics, I am told that I shouldn’t be in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
I know that I have been more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because my comments are usually political.
I am delighted with the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face daily streams of sexist or racist attacks, but never give up.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is that abuse levels have become the norm.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should cultivate a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer such a broad church, and with every move of “confidence” or change in the rules of selection, the party narrows down.
Over the past two years, I have received a lot of advice. I was urged not to stand out, not to speak so loudly that with me "everything was good".
But I didn’t come into politics for that.
I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a schoolboy, because because of the lack of attention from the government, Thatcher, my class in high school had literally collapsed, since then I have been striving to improve the quality of public services for those who need them most, whether it be a local councilor or a minister of government.
I’ve never hid my politics, including in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East has been confused by my political views and discrepancies with the current leadership.
To those who contributed to Friday's events, I want to say only one thing: in a situation where the country is stepping up to Brexit, which will harm households, businesses and public services, I do not understand the desire to spend time and energy on my loyalty to the leader LeBron LeBron.
In fact, I have another message, but not for Nottingham's "Momentum", but for my constituents, as members of the Labour Party, and no: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threats to call me back and no political advantage to me.

"Air" 38 - 17 "Melrose": the invincible "Air" rise up
The last two attempts may have somewhat distorted the final result, but no doubt Air deserved a triumph in today’s wonderful entertainment match of the Scottish Premiership.
Now they lead the table, it's the only unbeaten team out of ten.
Ultimately, the excellent defense and improved ability to take advantage of the chances gives the hosts and coach Peter Mercy full right to be satisfied.
“We’ve been tested with our games so far, and we’re still undefeated, so I have to be satisfied,” he said.
Robin Christie of Melrose commented: "I give Air the right shot, they used the odds better than we did."
Grant Anderson's attempt at the 14th minute, implemented by Frazier Clima, brought the Air forward, but a yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, issued by the Warriors, allowed the Melrose to show figures, and Jason Baggott used the szrebu.
Climate strengthened the leadership of Air with the help of a penalty and just before the break made and implemented a solo-trial, which gave a score of 17-5 in favor of Air
But the Melrose started well in the second half, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, implemented by Baggot, reduced the gap to five points.
There was then a prolonged delay due to the serious injury of Ruarid Knott, who was taken off the field on a loader, and the Air restart escaped ahead with the help of Stafford McDowell's attempt, which was implemented by Clima.
Captain "Air" Blair McPherson then had a yellow card, and again "Melrose" forced another player to pay for Bruce Colvin's unfulfilled attempt under fierce pressure.
The hosts returned, however, when Stryan Hutchinson received a yellow card for intercepting Climax without a ball from the penalty area line, McPherson made a touchdown behind the Air mall.
Climate realized an attempt he made almost every time after the restart, after which Kyle Rowe received a punch from David Armstrong into the box and sent Flanker Gregor Henry for the fifth attempt of the hosts' team.
It seems that the star of the series "Always a game" is set for a new career in the restaurant industry
It seems that the star of the series "Always play" Ford Kiran is set for a new career in the field of hospitality. Such a conclusion can be made after it became known that he is the director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC television series, the script for which he writes and in which he starred with longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo have announced that the upcoming ninth series will be the last in the series, and it seems that Kirnan is planning a life after Craigleng.
According to the official record, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although a source in the Scottish Sun suggested that Kirnan wants to enter Glasgow’s “best-growing restaurant business.”
“Our Sea”: Inland Bolivia hopes the court will open its way to the Pacific Ocean
Marines patrol an equipped naval headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings hang an ocean-blue flag.
The sea bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are painted with the motto: “The sea is ours by right.
We have to bring him back.”
In Bolivia, which has no access to the sea, there is still a living memory of the loss of the coastline that left Chile in the bloody conflict of the 19th century due to natural resources, and there is also a desire to swim again in the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are now perhaps the strongest in decades, as Bolivia awaits a ruling from the international court on October 1 after five years of consideration of the case.
“Bolivia has a momentum, a spirit of unity and peace, and of course it expects a positive result,” said Roberto Calzada, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the announcement of the decision of the ICTY on large screens across the country. They hope that the tribunal in The Hague will make a decision in favor of Bolivia, which after decades of fragmented talks will force Chile to negotiate the grant of Bolivia a sovereign settlement.
Evo Morales, a charismatic indigenous Bolivian president who faced opposition to his re-election next year, also puts great hopes in a decision to be announced on Monday.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to make a decision in favor of Bolivia, and if that happens, little will change.
The United Nations body, based in the Netherlands, has no authority to allocate Chilean territory and noted that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
That the ICJ’s decision, taken only six months after the final arguments were made, indicates that the case “was not difficult,” said Pas Zarate, a Chilean expert on international law.
The case of Bolivia has not progressed, the last four years could have contributed to the retreat back.
“The issue of access to the sea was used by the current Bolivian administration,” Zarate said.
Morales’ military rhetoric undermined the remnants of Chilean kindness, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue the dialogue at some point, but after that it will be very difficult to hold discussions.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Velze, a representative of Bolivia in The Hague, disagreed with the fact that the court's decision was unusually rapid.
On Monday, Bolivia will have an “extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile and a chance to end 139 years of differences, with mutual benefit,” he said.
Calzada also denied that Morales — still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents — used the maritime issue as a political militia.
“Bolivia will never renounce its right of access to the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
This decision is an opportunity to see that we must leave the past behind.”
North Korea says there will be no nuclear disarmament unless it can trust the United States
North Korea’s Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his country will never give up its nuclear weapons first before it can trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the U.N. General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to deliver on the promises made at the summit in Singapore by the leaders of rival countries.
His comments came as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be on the verge of restarting nuclear diplomacy, which fell into a deadlock more than three months after a Singapore summit with Kim Jong-un.
Ri says the belief that continuing sanctions and opposing the U.S. declaration on the end of the Korean War will one day put North Korea on its knees is an “impossible dream.”
Washington is afraid to accept the declaration before Pyongyang takes significant steps towards disarmament.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second meeting.
But there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about abandoning its arsenal, which the country probably considers the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
At the Paris fashion shows presented the latest trend of massive headwear, which is already heading to the main streets of your city
Whether you want to increase your collection of hats or completely hide from the sun, you’ve found what you need.
Designers Valentino and Tom Brown demonstrated a number of eccentric oversize-style headwear from the spring-summer 2019 collection at the podiums of the brilliant Paris Fashion Week.
Very impractical hats flooded Instagram this summer, and the named designers have already sent their stunning creations beyond the podium.
Valentino stood out with an extravagant beige hat with wide feathered fields that covered the heads of the models.
Among other oversize accessories are decorated with gemstones of watermelon, a wizard's hat and even a pineapple hat, but they are not meant to keep your head warm.
Tom Brown also demonstrated an assortment of original masks — very in time for Halloween.
Many of these multicolored masks had sewn lips and resembled Hannibal Lecter more than high fashion.
One creation resembled a scuba diving gear with a tube and glasses, the other looked like a horn of ice cream that had melted.
And if you support this serious fashion application, you're lucky.
Stylists say that huge hats can go out on the main streets of your city.
Overseas hats came into fashion thanks to "La Bombie", a straw hat with sixty centimeters wide fields, which was seen on everyone: from Rihanna to Emily Ratazhkovsky.
The iconic brand behind the very impractical hat, which could be seen everywhere on social networks, gave the world another creation: a straw beach bag the size of a model in a swimsuit that wore it.
The yellow-red raffia bag with a raffia braid and a white leather handle was a central element of the La Riviera Spring-Summer 2019 collection of the Jacquemus brand at the Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “Next summer I expect to see big hats and beach bags on the main streets of cities, because the designer’s influence is so huge that it will be hard to ignore the demand for oversize accessories.”
John Edwards: Knowledge of languages is mandatory for the citizens of the world
Scotland’s independent schools maintain high standards of learning, and in 2018 again achieved excellent exam results, complemented by individual and collective success in sports, arts, music, and other fields.
These schools, which enroll more than 30,000 pupils across Scotland, are represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SHRNSH). They strive to provide the best level of service for pupils and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare students for further and higher education, their chosen careers, as well as making them citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can develop and implement an individual school program, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable subject of choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If you talk to a person in a language he understands, he perceives it with his mind.
If you talk to her in her native language, she takes it with her heart.”
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot use only English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the latest results of this year’s exams, we see that in independent schools, languages are leading in the rankings of subjects with the best ratings.
Overall, 68% of students who studied foreign languages received a higher score of A.
The data collected in 74 schools of the SRNSH showed that 72% of students received a higher score of A with Chinese, and another 72% of those who study German, 69% of those who study French, and 63% of those who study Spanish also received A.
This indicates that independent schools in Scotland consider foreign languages to be vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages as a subject of choice are now taught in the same way as NTIM subjects (science, engineering, engineering and mathematics), as part of independent school programs and in other institutions.
A survey conducted by the UK Commission on Employment and Skills in 2014 found that 17% of the reasons employers can’t close job vacancies are related to lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly necessary in preparing young people for future careers.
As more and more promising positions require knowledge of languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the chosen career, if someone has learned a second language, he will have a real advantage in the future, because it is a lifelong skill.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically gives a person who speaks several languages an advantage over competitors.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75% could not speak a foreign language well enough to support a conversation, and French was the only language spoken by a two-definition percentage of people (15%).
That’s why investing in language learning is important for today’s children.
Knowing several languages, especially the languages of developing countries, will provide children with a better chance of finding a full-fledged job.
In Scotland, each school will learn its own language.
A number of schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered the most important for the UK from a 2020 perspective, such as Chinese or Japanese.
Regardless of your child’s interests in independent schools, you will always be able to choose several languages to study with qualified teachers.
Scottish independent schools are trying to create an educational environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills needed to succeed, regardless of what has prepared the future for them.
It is now undeniable that in the international business environment languages continue to be vital to the future of the country, so this should be reflected in education.
Modern languages should indeed be considered “skills of international communication”.
Independent schools will continue to provide this choice, diversity and excellence to Scottish youth.
We have to do it.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron debuts with the Lakers in San Diego
Fans who want to see the first start of LeBron James for the Los Angeles Lakers are almost welcome.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play on Sunday in the first pre-season game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
How many minutes he will play is not yet decided.
“It’s going to be more than one and less than 48,” Walton said on the Lakers official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell said that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for six pre-season games for the Lakers.
“At this stage of my career, I don’t need pre-season games to prepare,” he said.
Trump rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump today begins a series of pre-election rallies from the city of Willing, West Virginia.
This is the first of five Trump rallies scheduled for next week, including rallies in friendly states including Tennessee and Mississippi.
The final vote for his nomination to the Supreme Court has been postponed, and Trump seeks to form support for the upcoming midterm elections as Republicans risk losing control of Congress after voting in November.
What time will Trump’s evening rally in West Virginia take place and how to watch it online?
Trump's rally in Willing, West Virginia is scheduled for 19:00 Eastern Time today, Saturday, September 29, 2018
You can watch Trump’s rally in West Virginia online below live on YouTube.
Trump is likely to recall the strains of hearings this week over Supreme Court candidate Brett Cavanaugh, who is accused of sexual harassment, and the Senate’s postponement of the vote for a week while the FBI’s investigation is ongoing.
But the main purpose of this series of rallies is to help Republicans gain popularity before the November election.
Trump’s representatives said the five rallies next week were aimed at “activating volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to preserve and expand the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives.”
“Control of Congress is so critical to its agenda that the president will go to as many states as possible because the tense season of the election campaign is approaching,” Trump’s campaign spokesman told Reuters.
Fans from Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as media outlets from Pittsburgh, may attend today’s rally at the Wesbank Arena in Willing, West Virginia Metro News reported.
Saturday’s visit will be Trump’s second in a month’s visit to West Virginia, where he garnered more than 40 percent of the vote in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Republican candidate to the West Virginia Senate Patrick Morrizi, whose rating is lagging behind the results of polls.
“It’s not good for Morrissa that the president is coming to raise his rating in the polls,” said Simon Heather, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
2018 Ryder Cup: U.S. team set to fight and hopeful ahead of Sunday singles
After three sessions, which ended in a one-sided victory, Saturday afternoon forsoms may be exactly what this Ryder Cup lacked.
Impulse Emergency Pendulum is a fully invented sports concept that players really believe in, especially in such competitions.
So when will they say that the impulse is working?
“They were six points ahead, and now they’re four, so I think we’re taking it a little bit like an impulse,” Jordan Spitt said as he left.
Europe has an advantage, of course, on four points ahead and twelve more in the game.
Americans feel a little wind in their sails, as well as a lot of encouragement, not least the shape of Spit and Justin Thomas, who played together all day, and each earned three points out of four.
Spit with his killer blows from tie-pitch to grin shows an example.
These cries of celebration became louder when, in the continuation of his round, he made a decisive patch and leveled the score on the fourth game after he and Thomas were two points behind.
His patch, which allowed them to win a match on the 15th hole, met with a similar shout, one that tells you that the American team does not seem.
“You really just have to try hard and worry about your own game,” Spit said.
That’s all the players left behind now.
18 holes to become famous.
The only players with more points than Spit and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undeniable history of the Ryder Cup.
An unusual but charming couple from Europe has four out of four and cannot make mistakes.
The Mollywoods were the only couple not making boggs on Saturday afternoon, they also managed to avoid the boggs on Saturday morning and after lunch on Friday and on the last nine holes on Friday morning.
This race and how their energy seems to flow to this turbulent crowd and back, makes them believe that they will win on Sunday and that there will be no more popular players except Fleetwood or Molinari to solidify the potential victory of the Europeans when the sun goes down.
Preferably both at the same time in different holes.
However, it is still too early to talk about the triumph of Europeans.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson dealt with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning forballs, when he was in pairs with Alex Norren.
One god and two ducks in the first nine holes led the Spaniard and the Swede to a hole they could never escape from.
On Sunday, however, no one will help you get out of the hole.
Forbols and forsoms are very interesting to observe closely because of the interaction between the participants of the pair, because of the tips they give, the tips they do not give, and also it is interesting to observe how the strategy can change in one moment.
Europe still plays better as a team and has a significant lead on the last day, but this session of forces also showed that the U.S. team intends to fight, which some, especially Americans, doubt.
Europe leads with a score of 10-6 in the last day of the Ryder Cup
On the final day of the Ryder Cup, Europe will have a solid advantage, because after Saturday's forbols and forsoms, it is ahead of the United States with a score of 10-6.
Inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari have won two wins over backward Tiger Woods, and now at Le Golf National they have four points.
The European team of Thomas Björn, who is trying to return the trophy they lost to Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the American team in the morning draw with a score of 3-1.
The U.S. made more resistance in the forsooms and won two matches, but were unable to narrow the gap.
Jim Fury's team needs eight points in 12 Sunday singles to save the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to have won four points in a row, while he and Mollynari (together "Mullivud") are only the second pair to score four points in the first four matches in Ryder Cup history after a sensational weekend.
Having smashed Woods and Patrick Reed in the forballs, they teamed up to defeat repulsive Woods and rookie American Bryson Dechambo with an even more spectacular 5th4.
Woods, who pulled out two games on Saturday, showed random flashes of genius, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 games in the forearms and forearms and seven games in a row.
Justin Rose, who did not take part in the morning forballs, returned to partner Henrik Stanson in the forsoms to get a 2-1 defeat from Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, who are the first and third in the world rankings.
Europe could not do everything in its own way on this pleasant fresh day south-west of Paris.
Three-time lead winners Jordan Spite and Justin Thomas set the standard for Americans on Saturday with their two points.
They won a decisive 2nd-1 victory over the Spaniards John Ram and Ian Poulter in the forebows and later defeated Poulter and Rory McLroy with a 4th-3 score in the forebows, losing their first two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history the team returned with a four-point deficit in singles, although Furick's team only needed a draw to save the trophy.
However, after the second place for two days, the counterattack on Sunday looks as if it is not in their power.
North Korea says it will “in no way” disarm unilaterally without confidence
North Korea’s foreign minister told the UN on Saturday that the extension of sanctions deepens mistrust of the United States and that under such circumstances the country will in no way be able to give up its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho said at the annual UN General Assembly that last year, North Korea took “substantial measures of goodwill”, such as the cessation of nuclear and missile tests, the dismantling of the nuclear test site and the commitment not to disseminate nuclear weapons.
"However, we do not see any appropriate reaction from the United States," he said.
Without trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances we will not be the first to disarm unilaterally.
While Ri reiterated North Korea’s familiar complaints about Washington’s “step-by-step” approach to denuclearization, according to which North Korea will be rewarded for its gradual steps, his statement was important because it was not unilaterally rejected.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first ever summit between a real U.S. president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim called for work on the “denuclearization of the Korean peninsula” and Trump’s “people without guarantees”.
North Korea is seeking a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said Pyongyang should first give up nuclear weapons.
Washington is also resisting calls to weaken tough international sanctions on North Korea.
“The U.S. is insisting on ‘denuclearization first’ and raising the level of pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal by force, and even opposing the ‘declaration of an end to war’,” Ri said.
“To believe that sanctions can put us on our knees is the impossible dream of those who do not know us.
But the problem is that the continuation of sanctions deepens our mistrust.”
Ri did not mention the plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. leader stressed at the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the minister drew attention to three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Zhe In over the past five months and added: “If the party to the denuclearization issue were South Korea, not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula is not too far away.”
Despite this, the tone of Ri’s speech drastically differed from last year’s when he told the General Assembly that North Korea’s missile targeting the U.S. mainland was unavoidable after “Mr. Evil President” Trump called Kim “a human-missile.”
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to “completely destroy” North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking disarmament measures, but said much more needs to be done and sanctions should remain in place until North Korea’s denuclearization.
On Wednesday, Trump said he did not set a time frame for this: “It will take two years, three years or five months – it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia claim that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday, “Implementation of the Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously and steadfastly until we see a complete, definitive, confirmed denuclearization.”
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to block funding for Pyongyang’s nuclear programs and ballistic missiles.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was unsuccessful.
He left Pyongyang in July and commented that progress had been made, but a few hours later North Korea convicted him of "gangster demands".
During a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised to dismantle the missile complex, as well as the nuclear complex, if the United States takes "appropriate measures".
He said Kim said he needed "appropriate measures" to ensure the security that Trump had promised in Singapore and steps to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to get enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has provided all its students with more sleep. This is an attempt to combat the growing culture of learning cruising all night after caffeine refills.
The professor found that the number one university students in the world are often uneducated when it comes to the very basics of how to take care of yourself.
Charles Chassler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham Women’s Hospital, has developed a course that he believes is the first such course in the United States.
He decided to start the course after giving a lecture on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
In the end, one girl approached him and said, “Why are they telling me this right now, in my final class?”
“She told me that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
The course, which was first introduced this year, explains to students the basics of how good sleep habits help achieve academic and sporting results, as well as improve overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university’s medical services, said the university decided to introduce a course after it was found that students were seriously sleep deprived during the week.
The hourly course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one section, there is an image of a room in a dormitory where students click cups of coffee, curtains, exercisers and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, the impact of sleep deficiency on athletic performance, as well as the importance of sleep-related routine.
Another section tells participants how prolonged sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression, and cancer.
Next, a map of the campus with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
“We know that this will not change the behavior of students instantly.
But we believe that they have the right to know, just as you have the right to know about the health consequences of smoking cigarettes,” Chassler said.
A culture of pride for “wake up all night” still exists, he added, noting that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students mean that the problem of sleep deprivation is on the rise.
A good enough sleep should be a student’s “secret weapon” to fight stress, exhaustion and anxiety, even with excess weight gain, as sleep deprivation translates the brain into a mode of hunger that causes constant physical hunger, he said.
Raymond Soe, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Chassler develop the course after enrolling in one of his other courses last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to create a new course for the entire campus.
The next step, he hopes, will be to appeal to all graduates with a request to go through a similar program of study before entering a competitive institution.
Professor Chassler recommends that students be reminded that they should go to sleep, as well as put on an alarm clock and be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" that is emitted by electronic screens and LED lamps and can disrupt the circadian rhythm, leading to problems with the eyes.
"Livingston" 1 - 0 "Rangers": the goal Menga upset the guys Gerrard
The Rangers survived another attack of outgoing sadness: Dolly Menga's blow brought a 1-0 defeat to Stephen Gerrard's disastrous team from Livingston.
Aibrox's team sought to achieve their first victory in the starting match after the February triumph over St. Johnston with a score of 4-1, but the team of Gary Holt gave Gerrard a second defeat as manager of 18 games.
Menga scored seven minutes before the break, and the Rangers, who lacked inspiration, did not look like they could match the score.
Now "The Rangers have dropped to sixth position, and the Livingston have risen to third, and for the difference of balls they are ahead only of the Hibernian.
In addition, the Rangers may have another problem, because lineman Calum Spence was forced to treat the head wound after he was thrown in from the guest sector some object.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that once flew past Air in the Scottish League Cup semi-finals.
And Holt released the same Left 11 squad that took one point at the Harts last week, and was thrilled at how his coerced guys oppressed opponents every step of the way.
The Rangers may have dominated possession of the ball, but the Livingston team worked more with the resulting ball.
They were only supposed to score after two minutes of play when Menga's first free zone pass allowed Scott Pittman to hit Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder wasted this great opportunity by sending the ball past the goal.
Keagan Jacobs' deep free kick hit skipper Craig Hulkett, but his defense partner Alan Litgow hit the back pole
The Rangers have indeed gained control, but in the last third there was more hope than faith in their game.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt that he should get the right to a penalty on the mark a quarter of an hour after colliding with Stephen Lawless, but referee Stephen Thomson rejected the Colombian's appeal.
The Rangers managed to score only two goals in the first half, but former Aibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly's header Lassana Kulibali and Oviedo's calm strike were hardly bothered.
And although Liverpool’s 34-minute goal may have contradicted the course of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it only by their hard work.
The Rangers were once again unable to cope with Jacobs's workout.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who quietly chose Meng for a simple finish.
In the break, Gerrard replaced Kulibali with Ryan Kent, and this change worked almost immediately when the wingman broke into Morelos, but the striking Kelly drifted off his line to block him.
However, The Livingston continued to force guests to play exactly the kind of game they liked when Litgow and Hulkett made one long pass after the other.
Holt's team could have improved the score in the final stages, but McGregor was well against Jacobs before Litgow hit from the corner.
Glenn Middleton, a replacement for the Rangers, made another late application for a penalty when he faced Jacobs, but Thomson turned his back on the lookout.
Almanach: inventor of Geiger's counter
And now the page from our almanach "Sunday Morning": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago on this day, and the time is passing... in Germany was born the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactive radiation, an invention that eventually evolved into a device known as the Geiger counter.
Since then, Geiger has become one of the key elements of science, as well as one of the key elements of pop culture, for example in the 1950 film Coronado Bells with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, who play dubious cowboy scientists.
Husband: “What is that?”
Rogers: “This is a Geiger counter that is used to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you wear these headphones, you can really hear how radioactivity in minerals affects atoms.”
Evans: “Well, it’s really cracking right now!”
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention, which bears his name, continues to live.
New Cancer Vaccine Could Teach Immune System to ‘See’ Malignant Cells
New Cancer Vaccine Could Teach Immune System to ‘See’ Malignant Cells and Kill Them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells that are part of the treatment
The method involves the removal of immune cells from the patient and their change in the laboratory
These cells are then able to "see" a protein that is common to many cancers. Then these cells are re-injected to the patient.
The trial vaccine shows promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
In one woman who received a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells, ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method involves removing immune cells from the patient, altering them in the laboratory so that these cells can “see” the proteins common to many types of cancer (HER2), and then re-introducing these cells to the patient.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the Bethesda National Cancer Institute, Maryland, said: “Our results show that we have received a very promising vaccine.”
“HER2 “stimulates the growth of several cancers,” including breast, ovarian, lung, and colorectal cancers,” he explained.
A similar approach, which involves removing immune cells from patients and “training” them to target cancer cells, has worked in the treatment of one of the types of leukemia.
After appearing in the studio of the SNL show in baseball MAGA Kanye West stunned with a sharp speech in support of President Trump,
What caused the negative reaction of the spectators
Spectators at the show’s studio SNL (Saturday Night Live) cheered Kanye after his tumultuous speech, during which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run for president in 2020.
After performing a third song titled Ghost Town in a baseball bat with the inscription "Let's Bring America Back to Former Glory," he exploded with a tyranny in which he criticized Democrats and reaffirmed his support for Trump.
“Often white people ask me, ‘How can you like Trump?’ He’s a racist.”
“Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago,” he said.
The SNL show began with a sketch by Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star ridiculed Brett Cavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Legal Committee in the case of Christine Blazey Ford's sexual assault lawsuit.
Although West's speech was not broadcast live, the video with his tyranny was posted on the social network by comedian Chris Rock.
It remains unclear if Rock wanted to mock West by posting this post.
West also complained to the audience that behind the scenes with him happened an unpleasant situation due to the headdress.
As reported by the Washington Examiner, West stated: "When I was behind the scenes, I was rudely treated.
I was told, “Don’t go out to the spectators in this baseball.”
They were teasing me!
And then they tell me that I am in a place where the oppressed are silent.”
The West continued: "You want to see a place where the oppressed are silent? I'll wear my Superman baseball cap because that way no one will be able to tell me what to do. Do you want the world to keep moving forward?
Then try to treat each other with love.”
As reported by the weekly Variety, his comments at least twice caused a negative reaction of spectators in the hall, and the actors of the show SNL looked confused. One of the spectators said this: "The studio was a dead silence".
At the last minute, Vesta was invited to replace singer Ariane Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days before the air.
Vest has caused many surprises by performing the song I Love It (I Love It) in a Perrier water bottle suit.
Vesta was supported by the head of the conservative organization TPUSA Kendesh Turner, who wrote on Twitter: "One of the bravest: THANK YOU FOR standing against NATO."
Instead, talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West "is who he is, and it's just great."
However, I will NOT reward (buying his music or clothes or supporting his “art”) who, in my opinion, professes and ejects an ideology that harms my community.
He is a free man.
Just like us,” she added.
Before performing on the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name: now he is "the one who was previously known as Kanye West".
West is not the first performer to change his name; he follows the example of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and Pippi Diddy.
Colleague rapper Snoop Dogg had previously been called Snoop Lion, and it is known that the music legend of recent decades Prince changed his name to a symbol, and then became an "Artist formerly known as Prince".
Accused of attempted murder after knife attack in Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man is accused of attempted murder after inflicting a knife wound on another man in a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
Police reported that the incident took place in the restaurant "Belligecamor".
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast magistrates' court on Monday.
The prosecution will consider the indictment.
"Game of Thrones" star Keith Garrington condemns the idealization of brutality
Keith Garrington became famous for his role as a warrior with the sword of John Snow in the brutal medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones produced by HBO.
However, the 31-year-old actor spoke out condemning the stereotype of the macho hero, claiming that because of such heroes on screens, young guys often seem to have to become cool to be respected by others.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Keith said that, in his opinion, "something went wrong," and asked how to solve the problem of idealizing brutality in the era of #MeTo's popularity hashtag (#also, #eating, etc.).
The cat, who recently married his Game of Thrones colleague, 31-year-old actress Rose Leslie, said he was “resolutely determined” to tackle the issue.
"I am at the moment quite determined. When did we get on the slippery path of idealizing brutality?" – he asked.
"Why do we teach future men if we look at their growing up through the prism of the problem we see now?"
The cat believes that television is partly responsible for popularizing brutality through the images of extremely brave heroes.
He continued: "What is natural, and what are we being planted?
Why does television and the street teach that young boys feel pressured to be such men?
In my opinion, today’s really important question is, “How do we change this?”
“It’s clear that the young people are on the right track.”
In an interview, he also noted that he will not be filmed in any prequels and sequels to Game of Thrones after the show's show next summer, as "he's already finished with battles and horses."
From November, Kit will play in the production of the play "Real West" by Sam Shepard - the story of the film producer and his brother-robber.
As the actor recently admitted, he considers his meeting with his wife Rose the best he has received from participating in the series Game of Thrones.
"During the shoot in this series, I met my wife, so he gave me a future family and defined my future life," Kit said.
In the fantasy series, which received the Emmy awards, Rose played Igritt, the love of Garrington hero John Snow.
The couple got married in June 2018. The ceremony took place on the territory of the estate of the Leslie family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: In China, a sharp increase of 14% in the number of new cases of the disease
In China, there has been a sharp increase of 14% in the number of citizens suffering from HIV and AIDS.
According to representatives of health authorities, in total there are more than 820,000 patients in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, 40,000 new cases of the disease were reported.
In most cases, the disease was transmitted sexually, which indicates a change in the past trend.
For a long time, in some regions of China, HIV quickly spread through infected blood during the transfusion.
However, official health officials said at a conference held in Yunnan province, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has dropped to almost zero.
However, compared to the previous year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Sexually transmitted HIV in time is a serious problem for the Chinese LGBT community.
The decriminalization of homosexuality in China took place in 1997, but the LGBT community often suffers from discrimination.
According to research, 70-90% of men who have sex with other men are later married to women because of the country’s conservative values.
The transmission of the disease in most cases occurs as a result of improper use of means of protection during sexual contact.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged to ensure free access to HIV medicines, seeing this partly solve the problem.
Maxine Waters denies the influx of data from Republican senators into the network by her full-time employee and exposes sharp criticism of "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
U.S. House Speaker Maxine Waters on Saturday denounced the statement that one of her full-time employees posted personal data of three U.S. Republican senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The L.A. Democrat claims that these statements are spreading to “ultra-right” political viewers and websites.
“Lie, lie, and then even more disgusting lies,” Waters said on Twitter.
The information reportedly included the home addresses and telephone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsay Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orino Getch of Utah.
The data appeared on the network on Thursday. They were posted by an unknown person from the Capitol during hearings in the Senate Commission on charges of sexual misconduct brought against Brett Cavanaugh, a candidate for the position of a judge of the U.S. Supreme Court.
The leak occurred some time after three senators questioned Cavanaugh.
The Hill newspaper reported that on such conservative websites as Gateway Pundit and RedState, information appeared that the IP address of the leak source was associated with the Waters office and was able to find the data of its full-time employee.
“These unsubstantiated claims are absolutely untrue, they are not true,” Waters continued.
“An employee of my office whose personal data and security have been compromised as a result of these fabricated and false statements has nothing to do with the leak of this information.
These unsubstantiated statements are absolutely untrue, they do not correspond to reality.”
Waters’ statement was quickly criticized on the internet, including former White House press secretary Ari Fleisher.
“This denial is full of anger,” Fleisher wrote.
"This suggests that with such a character, she cannot be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something he has not done, there is no need to be angry.
The defendant should not behave arrogantly.
He should not ask about the motives of the accuser.
He must remain calm and unmoved.”
Flaescher seems to have paralleled Waters’ reaction to Democrats’ criticism of Judge Cavanaugh, who was accused of appearing too angry at Thursday’s hearings.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who is running to take Waters' place in the midterm elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
“This is news, if it’s true,” he wrote.
In her statement, Waters said her office had already reported "appropriate state and law enforcement agencies on these false claims."
“We will do everything we can to find the culprits,” she continued, “and they have responded to the law for their actions, which are harmful and dangerous to all of my employees.”
Review of the film "Agent Johnny English: A New Mission" – a passing parody of spy fighters with Roven Atkinson
It has become a good tradition to look for in every new British film meanings enveloped Brexit. They are also in the new part of the series of comedy parodies on fighters about Johnny English. The first film called "Johnny English" was released from the screens, in 2003
Will the ridiculously ironic self-satisfaction about who we are become a new export potential of the nation?
Either way, Johnny English with his moving face and blurred eyes for the second time got the opportunity to make a mess, while his name more than anything else indicates that this comic character was created for viewers in non-English-speaking countries.
As you know, Johnny is an amusingly funny secret agent in 2012, in which, despite his strange attempts to be gallant and charming, there is a little bit of Inspector Clouseau, a little bit of Mr. Bean and a lot of - from the guy who played one note of the melody in the film "Ompeya".
A prototype of the character is also a traveler and a mystery of an international scale that has always left behind the mess Atkinson once played in the long-forgotten TV commercial of Barclaycard.
There are a few good moments in the last film about Johnny English.
I liked the scene when Johnny English in his knightly armor approached the helicopter, and the shovels of the screw crawled around his helmet.
The film reveals Atkinson's talent to arrange a bufonada, but humor is transient, and at some points it is too much, especially if compared to "serious" movie brands, such as "Agent 007" and "Mission impossible", one of the "ingredients" as well.
It seems to me that jokes are intended for children rather than adults, and the senseless attacks that happen to Johnny Ingles don't seem as inventive and thoughtful as Atkinson's jokes in the silent films about Bean.
As always, the film begins with the fact that there is a serious threat over the UK.
In the British super-secret network of spies penetrates the hacker and reveals the names of all the field agents, which became a complete surprise for the acting agent (unfortunately, Kevin Eldon played only an episodic role in the film).
This turned out to be the last drop for the prime minister – a arrogant person who has already been subjected to devastating criticism and is in a deep depression due to the loss of popularity (Emma Thompson tried to convey the image enveloped by Theresa May, but the script did not give it a chance.
Advisors from the intelligence service informed her that all active agents were compromised, and she needed to involve someone from the retired.
The choice falls on the clumsy Johnny English, who now works as a teacher at some superfashion facility and unofficially teaches children operational work undercover (in this part with the spy "school of the year" English for teens there were a few successful jokes).
The Englishman is quickly taken to Whitehall for an emergency briefing, where he meets again with his many-suffering friend Buff, who is once again played by Ben Miller.
Buff is now married to the captain of the submarine (the role of the exalted boring person does not quite match the talent of Vicki Pepperdine).
So, when everything in the Secret Service of Her Majesty is gone, "Batman and Robin" return to the line and unexpectedly meet the fatal woman Ophelia Pistoletova, played by Olga Kurilenko.
And at this time, the Prime Minister falls under the spell of a charismatic billionaire who has earned his fortune in technology and claims that he can solve the problem with the British network – the disgraceful Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacey.
English and Buff go on a journey and again resort to their ridiculous tricks: dressed by waiters they make a fire in a chic French restaurant; then they sow chaos, illegally going abroad on a luxury yacht Volta; Ing<0xC5><0xA1>la
All the stops lead us to the last episode, but with his kindness and madness, he resembles a movie for children.
A passing film.
As with other Johnny English films, I asked myself the same question: can the British film industry not offer Rowena Atkinson a role that really fits his talent?
The Labour Party has rejected a plan that would allow Britons to work four days a week but receive a five-day salary.
Labour’s Jeremy Corbyn party is expected to discuss a radical plan that would allow British workers to work four days a week but receive a five-day salary.
It is reported that the party wants to oblige the heads of companies to transfer the funds saved as a result of the artificial intelligence revolution to the employees, giving them an additional weekend.
Thus, the workers will have a three-day weekend and at the same time bring home the same salary.
According to sources, this idea will be consistent with the party’s economic program and will direct the country’s resources to support the working class.
The transition to a four-day working week was approved at the British Congress of Trade Unions. It is seen that in this way workers will be able to benefit from the change in the general economic situation.
A source in the Labour Party told The Sunday Times: “A policy review will be announced at the end of the year.
Everything will not change overnight, but the idea of a four-day working week corresponds to the party’s approach to changing the balance of the economy in the interests of the workers, as well as the party’s overall industrial strategy.
Labour was not the first to endorse this idea, as the Greens promised to introduce a four-day working week even during the 2017 election campaign.
However, not all members of the Labour Party at the moment approve of this aspiration.
The Speaker of the Labour Party said: "The political program of the party does not provide for the introduction of a four-day working week, so now we do not consider this idea."
“Shadow” Chancellor John McDonnell presented his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy at the Labour Party’s pre-election congress last week.
Mr. McDonnell said he was willing to take back power from "faceless directors" of utilities and "searchers".
The chancellor’s “shadow” plan also means that shareholders of water companies may not get their full share of the capital if the Labour government imposes “deductions” on the basis of alleged violations.
He also reaffirmed plans to include workers on the board of directors of companies and create inclusive equity funds to transfer 10% of the ordinary shares of private sector firms to workers who are waiting for annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell in the show 60 Minutes (60 minutes), whether the investigation of the case of Cavanaugh, which is led by the FBI, can change their minds.
In connection with the investigation of the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh, who is headed by the FBI, the final vote on his appointment as a Supreme Court judge has been postponed for at least a week. The question arises whether Republican senators will continue to support Kavanaugh after his dismissal.
On Sunday's 60 Minutes show, Scott Pelli, a correspondent, asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find something that would change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open-minded than his South Carolina counterpart.
"Yes, of course," Kennedy said.
During the hearings, I told him that I had a conversation with Judge Cavanaugh.
I called him after it all happened and the accusation came up, and I asked him, “Did you really do that?”
He was determined, unshakable, uncompromising.”
It seems that Graham's opinion will not change anything.
“I believe that Kavanaugh’s indictment is a provocation,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly denied everything,” Graham added, addressing Christine Blaise Ford.
And everyone she calls can't confirm it under oath.
It happened 36 years ago.
I don’t understand what can change.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and how can it affect poverty reduction?
This Saturday, New York City will host the Global Citizen Festival – an annual event in the music world with an astonishing number of star performers and no less striking mission – to fight poverty around the world.
During the seventh Global Citizen Festival, tens of thousands of people will be moaning on the Great Lawn of Central Park, not only to enjoy the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendes, but also to draw attention to the real purpose of the festival.
The Global Citizen Festival, which started in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Poverty Project, an international non-governmental organization that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to get a free ticket to the event (unless you want to pay for a VIP ticket), visitors must perform a number of tasks or "acts", such as taking lessons in a volunteer project, writing an e-mail to the world leader, making a phone call or anything else – call us to
So are there any results already, because the organizers of Global Citizen have 12 years left to achieve the goal?
Is the idea of awarding a free concert really a brilliant way to convince people to demand action, or is it just another case of so-called “clitivism” when people feel like they’re really making a difference by signing an electronic petition or making a tweet?
According to Global Citizen, since 2011, they have recorded 19 million “acts” of their supporters aimed at achieving different goals.
The organization claims that these actions have prompted world leaders to announce planned financial allocations and programs worth more than $37 billion that will help change the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group listed as an example of the results of its activities 390 financial liabilities and public statements, with at least 10 billion already collected and spent.
The group estimates that the funding has already directly affected the lives of approximately 649 million people around the world.
Among the main financial obligations can be mentioned the fund The Power of Nutrition (Power of Food), which territorially relates to the UK. Within the project, investors and implementers have undertaken to "help children grow" and promised to provide Rwanda with 35 million.
“With the support of the UK government, patrons, governments of other countries and citizens of the world like you, we can make the social problem of malnutrition a minor fact of history,” said The Power of Nutrition spokeswoman Tracy Ullman, speaking to the public at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The organization also said that after 5,000 "acts" calling for better nutrition for mothers and children, the UK government announced funding for The Power of Nutrition project aimed at improving the nutrition of 5 million mothers and children.
In response to one of the most common questions on your website, “Why do you think you will be able to overcome extreme poverty?”,
Global Citizen wrote: "This is a long and difficult journey, so sometimes we will fall and we will fail.
“However, like the civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed because together we are stronger.”
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, and Janelle Mona are just some of the star performers who will perform at this year’s New York Festival, hosted by Deborah Lee Fernandes and Gue Jackman.
The interior minister said that the United States can use naval forces for the "blockade" to prevent the export of Russian energy resources.
According to a quote from U.S. Home Secretary Ryan Zinke, quoted in the Washington Examiner, “if necessary” Washington may seek help from the Navy to prevent Russian energy resources from entering markets, including the Middle East markets.
Zinke said Russia’s involvement in the conflict in Syria, especially where it acts at the invitation of a legitimate government, is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
“I think they are in the Middle East because they want to be an intermediary in energy trade, as they are already doing in Eastern and Southern Europe,” he said.
According to the official, there are ways and means to solve the problem.
“Thanks to the U.S. Navy, it can ensure free passage by sea and, if necessary, block them so that Russian energy resources do not get into the market,” he said.
Zinke addressed the event, which was conducted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that positions itself as the “voice of every consumer” in the United States.
He then compared approaches to trade with Russia and Iran, noting that they are actually similar.
“The economic strategy for Iran and Russia in general is that we use energy resources efficiently and replace them with alternatives,” he said, calling Russia “unilaterally developed” because its economy depends on energy carriers of mineral origin.
While these claims were being made, the Trump administration has set itself the goal of increasing exports of compressed natural gas to Europe, pushing out of the Russian-origin energy market a much cheaper option for Europeans.
For this purpose, officials of the Trump administration and President Donald Trump himself are trying to convince the German government to abandon the “inappropriate” project of construction of the “Nord Stream 2” pipeline, which, according to Trump, will make Berlin a hostage to Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, which is worth $11 billion and which will double the capacity of the existing gas pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is an exclusively economic project.
The Kremlin is convinced that Washington is fiercely opposed to the project only for economic reasons, which is an example of unfair competition.
“In my opinion, we share the view that energy resources cannot be a tool of pressure and the consumer should be able to choose suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow.
The US position has provoked a negative reaction from Germany, which has confirmed its support for the project.
The Federal Association of German Industry (BDI) has urged the United States not to interfere in the EU's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I don't like it when a third country interferes with our energy supplies," Dieter Kempf, head of the Federal Association of German Industry, said after the last meeting of German Chancellor Angela Merkel with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren 'will seriously think' about running for president in 2020
Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would "reflect seriously" on running for president after the midterm elections.
During a meeting with the public in Goliath, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she is considering nominating her candidate.
According to The Hill, Warren said: “It’s time for women to go to Washington and set up a government job, and for that to happen, a woman must be at the head of the government.”
“After November 6th, I will seriously consider nominating myself for the presidency.”
During a meeting with the public, Warren expressed her appreciation of the presidency of Donald Trump, saying that he is "leading his country in the wrong direction.
“I am extremely concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren was frank, criticizing Trump and his proposed candidacy for the post of Supreme Court Justice Brett Cavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren wrote: "... undoubtedly, before the vote, the FBI should conduct an investigation."
However, according to a poll released on Friday, most Warren voters do not believe she should run for office in 2020.
According to a poll conducted jointly by the University of Suffolk's Center for Political Studies and The Boston Globe, fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts' potential voters objected to the senator's nomination.
Thirty-two percent supported the move.
The results of the survey showed that the former governor Deval Patrick enjoys greater support. For his potential promotion to the post of President, 38%, against – 48%.
While discussing the nominations of other prominent Democrats who may run in 2020, former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont state senator Bernie Sanders are also named.
According to the Associated Press, Biden said he would make the decision by January.
Sarah Palin mentions PTSD Track Palin during a rally in support of Donald Trump
26-year-old Trek Palin spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in the military in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence, and the incident took place at night on Monday.
“What my son is going through now, what he is going through after he returns, can only be understood by other families who are experiencing the consequences of PTSD and other health problems with which our soldiers are returning home,” she told a rally in support of Donald Trump in Tallahassee.
Palin called the arrest of Trek "a problem that no one is paying attention to" and said that her son and the other veterans of the war "return home not as they used to be, more cruel, and want to know if the people here respect what their other brothers and brothers did to the soldiers.
According to a spokesman for the police department of the city of Vasilla, Dan Bennett, Trek was arrested on Monday in the town of Vasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence and assault on a woman, as well as in the fact that he prevented the report of the attack.
18 states and the District of Columbia support the challenge of the asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support the challenge of the new U.S. policy, according to which victims of gang harassment and domestic violence refuse to be granted refugee status.
According to NBC News, representatives of 18 states and the county sent an analytical note from a court adviser to Washington to support the claimant, who is in need of asylum and has appealed in court against the said policy.
The full name of the plaintiff in the "Grace v. Sessions" case under the lawsuit of the American Civil Rights Union, in which the federal policy is being challenged and which was filed in August, is not disclosed.
The plaintiff said her partner "and his brutal gang sons" beat her, but U.S. officials refused her when she asked for asylum on July 20.
She was illegally detained in Texas.
Prosecutors who support Grace’s lawsuit said residents of El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala (refugees who often seek asylum in the U.S.) often face such serious problems as banditry and domestic violence.
The new policy of granting refugee status repeals the 2014 decision of the Immigration Appeals Board, according to which undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence could apply for asylum.
District Attorney General Carl Reysin said on Friday that the new policy “ignores a decade of state, federal and international laws.”
“The federal law requires that decisions on applications for refugee status be based on consideration of the facts and circumstances set out in such a statement, and the prohibition violates this principle,” the court’s advisor said in an analytical note.
In a memo, prosecutors argue that a policy that bans immigrants from entering the U.S. harms the country’s economy, as they can potentially become entrepreneurs and “replenish the necessary labor resources.”
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued an order for immigration judges saying they could no longer grant refugee status to those fleeing domestic violence and banditry.
“The asylum is granted to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear of persecution in connection with race, religion, nationality, membership in certain public groups or political views,” Sessions said in a statement.
Giving asylum was never meant to solve all the troubles, even the serious problems that people around the world face every day.
Rescuers are desperately trying to find the survivors, while the death toll in Palu has doubled
For those who have survived, the situation continues to deteriorate.
“The situation is very tense,” said the 35-year-old mother, reassuring her boy with a fever in the evacuation center of the devastated city of Palu.
“Every minute ambulances bring in bodies.
There’s not enough clean water.”
Some residents return to their destroyed homes, picking up submerged proceeds, trying to save what they found.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals damaged as a result of the earthquake, whose strength was 7.5 points on the Richter scale, are overcrowded.
Some of the wounded, including Two Garys with a fractured back and shoulder, are resting near the Palu Army Hospital building, where patients are provided open-air assistance due to repeated push-ups.
His eyes were filled with tears as he remembered how a strong shock shook the hotel room on the fifth floor where he was staying with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time for rescue.
I think I was trapped among the debris of the wall,” Garys told the Associated Press, adding that he and his family had come to the city for a wedding.
“I heard my wife begging for help, and then there was silence.
I don’t know what happened to her and my son.
I hope they’re safe.”
U.S. ambassador accuses China of "imposing psychological pressure" through "advertising that contains propaganda"
A week after a state-run Chinese newspaper posted a four-page advertisement on the mutual benefit of trade between the United States and China, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to disseminate propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to a paid app of the China Daily in the Des Moines Register, Iowa’s most popular newspaper after accusing China of trying to influence the congressional elections to be held on November 6. China rejects these allegations.
U.S. officials told Reuters that Trump’s statements accusing Beijing of attempting to interfere in the U.S. election mark a new phase of escalation by Washington, whose goal is pressure on China.
While foreign governments may place advertisements to boost trade, there is an escalation of the trade war between Beijing and Washington, in which they have already raised import duties.
According to experts from China and the United States, at the beginning of this war, the introduction of repressive tariffs in China was intended to strike at exporters from states such as Iowa, which supported the Trump Republican Party.
Terry Brenstead, the U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, the largest exporter of agricultural products to China, said China had done harm to U.S. workers, farmers and companies.
China, as Brenstead wrote in a column in the Sunday issue of the Des Moines Register, “increases the pressure by publishing propaganda ads in our independent press.”
“To spread propaganda, the Chinese government is using the road for the American people’s tradition of freedom of speech and freedom of the press by placing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register,” Brenstead wrote.
"Contrary to this, on the street layouts here in Beijing, you will find only some voices of dissidents. Here you will not see a true reflection of what the Chinese people really think about the direction of the development of the Chinese economy, which causes concern, which can be concluded by the control of
He also added that "one of the respectable Chinese publications offered to publish" his article, but did not name which one.
Analysts warn that the failure of Kavanaugh Republicans are set against women voters before the midterm elections
As many prominent Republicans support and defend the Supreme Court judge candidate Brett Cavanaugh after he has been charged with several charges of sexual harassment, analysts warn that this could trigger an undesirable reaction on the eve of future interim filings.
Passions are raging around this situation, and most Republicans publicly declare that they would like to go to the polls.
Such things can’t just be replayed,” Grant Riger, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University, told The Hill in an interview published on Saturday.
Riger said he doubted the FBI's investigation, which Senator Jeff Flake (a Republican from Arizona) began insisting at the last minute, would be enough to reassure angry voters.
As reported by "Washington, D.C", the chief adviser and spokeswoman of the progressive group MoveOn (Move on) Catherine Jean-Pierre on Friday said: "Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget about it tomorrow, in the morning".
According to Mic, on Friday morning protesters sang "November is approaching!" during a demonstration in the Legal Committee, when Republicans decided to go ahead with Kavanaugh's candidacy despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blaise Ford.
In an interview with the news website, Stu Rotenberg, an out-of-party political observer, said: "People will be extremely interested and motivated."
“They say it’s already happening, and it’s true.
However, the motivation may increase, especially among 18-29-year-old electorate women who are not yet determined and often do not vote if they do not like the president.
Even before Ford testified in connection with the accusations of a Supreme Court sex offender candidate, analysts predicted a negative reaction from voters if Republicans insisted on approval.
As NBC News reports, earlier this week the former chairman of the National Committee of the Republican Party, Michael Steele, said: “This is an unpleasant story for the Republican Party.”
As Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA (a group that helps the Democrats in the election campaign), said in an interview with the news channel, "it's not a matter of a committee vote, a final vote, or that Cavanaugh was on the jury's bench, but that they were on the jury's bench."
However, the opinions of Americans about which testimonies to believe, Ford or Cavanaugh, were divided. Ford has a little more support.
According to a new YouGov survey, 41% of respondents believe or rather believe Ford’s testimony, while 35% of respondents believe or rather believe Kavanaugh’s testimony.
In addition, 38% of respondents noted that in their opinion, Cavanaugh gave or more likely gave false testimony, while 30% of respondents said the same about Ford.
According to The Guardian, after Flake’s insistence, the FBI is conducting a verification of the allegations made by Ford and another plaintiff, Deborah Ramirez.
Last week, Ford testified under oath to the Senate Legal Committee about how Cavanaugh attacked her while intoxicated when she was 17.

The inventor of the world Internet plans to launch a "new Internet" to create competition between Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a new startup to create competition between Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest legendary project of the world of technology, the company Inrupt, is engaged in the development of an open source platform Solid, the idea of which belongs to Berners-Lee.
With the Solid platform, users will be able to choose where to store data and to whom to give access to this or that information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the goal of Inrupt was "world domination".
“We have to do it now,” he said of the startup.
This is a historic moment.”
The application uses Solid technology, which will allow users to create a "personal online data store" or POD.
It can store contact lists, current lists, calendar, audio library, and other tools for your own use and work.
It’s like using Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify in one browser at a time.
A unique feature of this personal online storage is that it fully meets the needs of the user who can access any information.
The company calls it “expansion of personal capabilities with the help of data.”
According to Inrupt CEO John Bruce, the company aims to deploy resources, processes and relevant skills to make the Solid platform accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform acquired from IBM, several full-time developers hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer software developers.
As of this week, technology developers around the world can create their own standalone apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not negotiating with Facebook and Google about whether to make a full replacement when all their business models undergo fundamental changes in a short period of time.
“We don’t ask for their permission.”
In a statement on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt’s mission is to “provide commercial energy and ecosystem and help protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on the Solid platform.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by establishing the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential figure in the debate over net neutrality.
Even at the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee remained the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, The Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m very optimistic about the next era of network development,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of the award of the Order of the Cross of Victoria to the representative of the Church in the years of the First World War
The only representative of the Anglican Church, who received the Order of the Cross of Victoria for his participation in hostilities during the First World War, is honored in his hometown after 100 years.
Lieutenant-Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann received an award for his involvement in the attack on Belanglis and Leokur on September 29, 1918.
However, he died of a sniper bullet four days later and never knew that he had received the highest military award in Britain.
On Saturday, two of his grandchildren opened a memorial stone during a parade in the town of Rashden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, called it "extremely symbolic" that the discovery of the memorial stone took place exactly 100 years after his grandfather performed the feat for which he received the award.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann moved his battalion through the Saint-Katen Canal "through a very thick fog and under the dense fire of field guns and machine guns."
Later, he rushed to the frontier of fire and with "desperate courage" led the squad forward, before which one broke into the field gun and destroyed the three guns of the enemy unit.
Lieutenant Colonel Vanna was shot dead by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather had done something he would never have been able to repeat and that he deserved to be respected.
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, laid the wreath after a parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he was "very proud to be taking part in this parade" and added that "the courage of a real hero is demonstrated by the respect that so many people show him."
Fans of MMA did not sleep all night to watch the Bellator 206 tournament, but instead showed them "Pippa Pig"
Imagine that you don’t sleep all night just to watch the Bellator 206 event, and you’re denied the chance to watch the main event.
The posters of the tournament, which took place in San Jose, showed 13 fights, including six main event matches, which were broadcast live at night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just before Gegard Musasi and Rory McDonald were getting ready to fight, viewers in the UK froze to astonishment when Peppa's pig appeared on the screen instead of broadcasting the fight.
Some spectators were not delighted by this, as they did not sleep until the very morning, waiting for the battle.
One of the fans wrote on Twitter that switching to a children's cartoon seemed to him "something unsuccessful joke".
“According to the government’s ruling, the content that was broadcast at 6 a.m. was inappropriate, so they were forced to release the children’s broadcast,” said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president of marketing and public relations, when asked about the television broadcast.
Pig Peppa, yes.
Bellator president Scott Cocker has promised to work on a schedule of broadcasts to reach viewers in the UK in the future.
"I think if we talk about re-broadcasting, we can arrange that," Cocker said.
"But now there is Sunday, 6 a.m., and we can't do anything until we have Sunday, and they have Monday.
But we are working on it.
Believe me, when the broadcast was turned off, we received a lot of messages to which we responded, and the text of these messages was not very friendly.
We thought it was a technical malfunction, and we tried to fix it.
It turned out, however, that it was inconsistent with government regulations.
I can promise you that this will never happen again.
We're going to cut the tournament to five fights instead of six, as usual. We tried to redirect the signal to the fans, but so far we've postponed these attempts.
It’s a really unpleasant situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "worse" than others because of his sexual orientation
Olympic water jumper Tom Daley says he grew up feeling worse than others because of his sexual orientation, but this gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old athlete said he did not understand that "not everyone is like him" until he went to high school.
Taking part in the radio 4 broadcast Desert Island Discs by Lauren Laverne, he noted that he was openly speaking about gay rights to give "hope" to others.
He also said that he was less concerned about winning the Olympics because of parenthood.
The host, who has been running this program for a long time, Kirsty Young, went to the hospital for a few months.
Arriving as a pariah on Laverne's first program, Daley said he felt "worse" than others in childhood because "society didn't accept when someone liked boys and girls."
He said: "Until now, the feeling of inferiority and difference was what gave me the strength and strength to succeed."
According to him, he sought to prove that something was "worthy" so as not to disappoint all those who eventually learned about his orientation.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a well-known champion of LGBT rights and took advantage of his appearance at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to urge more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He stated that he spoke frankly about his views, as he felt happy that he could live openly without any consequences, and wanted to give this "hope" to others.
The three-time world champion admitted that his feelings for the man, American film director Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, became a real surprise for him.
Daley married an Oscar-winning 20-year-old last year, but he said the age difference was never a problem.
"When you're going through so much at such a young age" (he was in the early Olympics at the age of 14, and three years later his father died of cancer), it's hard to find someone of his age who would also have survived similar ups and downs.
In June, a son named Robert Ray Black Daley appeared in the marriage, and since then, according to Daley, his "world perception" has changed.
“If you asked me last year, I would only think that I should win the gold,” he said.
“You know, there are things that are much more important than the Olympic gold medals.
“My Olympic gold is Robbie.
His son was named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father could not accept the idea of the end and before he died asked if they had bought tickets to the 2012 London Olympics because he wanted to sit in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him ‘you’re not going to sit in the front row because you’re not going to be around anymore’,” Daley said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and only after he actually stopped breathing and died did I finally realize he wasn’t invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daley took part in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
“I knew that’s what I’ve dreamed of all my life: diving in front of my compatriots at the Olympics, and there was no feeling better than that,” Daley said.
This feeling also inspired him to choose his first song – Proud by Geiser Small – which resonated with him in preparation for the Olympics and still causes ants.
The Desert Island Discs program airs on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 a.m.
On Saturday from the match of the tournament for the "Rider's Cup" brought out Michelson, who was not in shape
American Phil Michaelson will set a record on Sunday after playing his 47th game in the Ryder Cup tournament, but he has to rebuild the form so that the event does not become unhappy for him.
Michelson, who in the record 12th time participates in the tournament, which takes place once every two years, removed from the game Captain Jim Furyk for the time of the forballs and forzas.
Instead of being at the center of events, as he often did playing for the United States, the five-time winner encouraged the team all day and trained on the sidelines, hoping to master the emotions.
Since Michelson was not famous for hitting even at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old athlete was not quite suitable for a challenging Le Golf National golf course, where the raft usually punishes for wandering hits.
And if the field is not such an obstacle, in the ninth match on Sunday, Michelson will have to meet with Open Championship champion and striker Francesco Molinari, who in pairs with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood won all his matches this week.
If the Americans, who are three points behind after 12 singles matches, start well, the match of Michelson can be decisive.
Furik expressed confidence in his athlete, and he probably had nothing else to add.
“He fully understood his role today, he gave me a clap on my back, he hugged me and said he would be ready tomorrow,” Furik said.
“He doesn’t doubt his ability.
Michelson is a member of the Hall of Fame, who has done so much for the teams last week and this week.
I didn’t expect him to play in two games.
I predicted more matches, but it turned out that way, so we decided to act that way.
He wants to be there, on the field, like everyone else.”
If Michelson comes out on the field on Saturday, he will break the record of Nick Faldo, who played the most matches in the Ryder Cup tournament.
At this point, he may end his career in the Ryder Cup tournament, which never corresponded to his individual achievements.
Michelson's account included 18 wins, 20 losses and 7 draws, but Furyk said his presence could play a crucial role for the team.
“He’s funny, edible, cunning, he likes to joke with others, he’s a guy who’s great to have on the team,” Furik said.
"I think the younger players had a good time riding on him, and this week, and it was interesting to watch.
He’s more than just a player.”
European team captain Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn knows that a big gap does not solve anything
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the European team, knows from experience that a noticeable break before the lone matches of the last day of the tournament for the "Rider's Cup" does not yet guarantee the victory.
The Dutchman made his debut in 1997 in a game at the Walderrama, where the team led by Sev Ballesteros led the Americans by five points, but won the match with a slight break with a score of 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2:131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“You remind yourself that we had a big gap in the match at the Walderrama field; a big gap in Brooklyn where we lost, and on the Walderrama field where we violently won,” said Bjorn after watching the winning Class 2018 games with a score of 5:3 on Friday and 10 on Friday.
So history teaches me and every player of the team that nothing is solved yet.
Tomorrow we have to play with the maximum return.
Go out to the field and do whatever it takes.
The game will be completed only after the result appears on the dashboard.
We have a goal – to win this trophy, and that’s what we want.
As I said earlier, I focus on the 12 players of our team, but we are well aware of who will be against us – the best players in the world.”
Satisfied with his players' performance on a challenging field, Bjorn added: "I will never run ahead.
Tomorrow, things could be different.
We are going to have individual matches tomorrow, and that’s something else.
It’s great to play on the field with your partner when everything is going well, but just when you’re standing there alone, and you can check what you’re worth as a golfer.
Here’s how to set up players to perform tomorrow: on the edge of opportunity.
You leave your partner without support and now he also has to show what he’s capable of.”
Unlike Bjorn, the opposing number Jim Furyk expects his partners to have the best game on an individual level, except for Jordan Spitt and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
To Furik himself, fate on the last day returned from different sides: he was among the winners in Brooklyn, but was defeated when a team from Europe created the "Miracle in Medina".
“I remember every word of the oath,” he said in response to questions about how Ben Crenshaw, captain of the 1999 team, organized the players before the last day of the competition.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but we need to start successfully, as we did in Brooklyn and Medina.
When the initiative moves to someone's side, players in the middle of the distance are subjected to special pressure.
We have appropriately positioned the players as part of the team, as if we were going, like, to do something incredible tomorrow.”
Thomas was instructed to try to lead the counterattack in the top match against Rory McIlroy. Then in the first half of the European team were Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter.
"It's these partners that I chose in this order because I want to distribute the effort evenly throughout the game," Bjorn said in a statement.
The introduction of a new German warship was postponed again
The most modern frigate of the German Navy was to be put into operation as early as 2014 instead of outdated Cold War war warships. However, according to local media, this will not happen until at least next year due to faulty systems and rapid increases in costs.
According to the newspaper Die Zeit, received from a spokesman for the military department, the introduction of the ship "Rheinland-Pfalz", the main ship of the series of the most modern frigates of the "Baden-Württemberg" class, has been postponed until the first half of 2019.
The ship was due to join the rest of the fleet in 2014, but the problems that arose after the delivery hindered the implementation of the ambitious project.
Four ships of the Baden-Württemberg class, which the Naval Service ordered in 2007, are to replace outdated Bremen-class frigates.
It is clear that they will be equipped with a powerful gun, a set of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some technologies to reduce visibility, in particular, radar, infrared and acoustic.
Another important feature is a longer period of maintenance. It is expected that the new frigates will not be able to return to the base port for about two years.
However, Die Zeit journalists warn that due to constant delays, the state-of-the-art warships that were to strengthen Germany's military power at sea will also become obsolete at the time of commissioning.
The frigate F125 hit the headlines last year when the German navy officially refused to put the ship into action and returned it to the Blohm + Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first case of return of a warship to a shipbuilding company after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but the German media mentioned significant "software and equipment defects" due to which the battleship became unfit for military operations.
Software shortcomings are particularly significant, as the crew of the Baden-Württemberg class ship consists of approximately 120 sailors – only half of the number of military personnel who served on old Bremen-class frigates.
In addition, it has been found that the ship has a significant excess weight, which deteriorates its performance and limits the possibilities for further modernization.
It is believed that the frigate "Rheinland-Pfalz" is twice (7000 tons) heavier than the ships of the same class used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to the faulty equipment, another problem was the total cost of the project, which also includes the cost of training the crew.
The expected <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion turned into a colossal <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion (US$3.6 billion).
Problems with obtaining new frigates have gained special weight in light of recent warnings about the decline of the German naval forces.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the Bundestag’s official for the armed forces, said the country’s navy had “left a small number of ships suitable for carrying out combat tasks”.
The official said that the situation deteriorated rapidly over a certain period of time, as the old ships were decommissioned and new ones did not arrive.
He expressed deep regret that none of the frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class had been able to replenish the navy.
The National Trust will observe the secret life of bats
A new study, which is being conducted on land in the Scottish Highlands, aims to establish how bats use the landscape in search of food.
Scientists hope that the resulting data will help shed light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals in order to take measures to preserve them in the future.
In the gardens of Inverness in Western Russia, scientists of the National Trust of Scotland will observe such species as the dwarf neptune and the pygmy neptune, as well as the ear of the ordinary and the water nightmare.
Special registrars will be placed in strategic locations on the territory of land ownership to monitor the behavior of bats during the season.
Employees and volunteers of the National Trust of Scotland will also conduct mobile research using handheld detectors.
An expert analysis of all recorded sounds will help establish the frequency and affiliation of bat screams.
It is then planned to develop a detailed animal habitat map and prepare a report to link animal behavior with their habitat environment.
Rob Dewar, an advisor on nature conservation at the National Trust of Scotland, hopes that the results of the study will help determine which habitats are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to assess the effectiveness of habitat care measures (e.g. meadow formation) and to identify optimal forest conservation methods for bats and other related species.
Over the last century, bat populations have declined significantly in Scotland and the United Kingdom.
They are threatened by the active construction and development of territories, depriving them of nest sites.
Other negative factors include wind turbines and lighting, adhesive paper for flies, chemical treatment of building materials, as well as attacks of domestic cats.
They are not actually blind.
However, by hunting at night, the ears help them catch prey more effectively than the eyes.
They use a complex echolocation technique to detect insects and obstacles on the flight path.
The National Trust of Scotland, which houses more than 270 historic buildings, 38 gardens of special significance and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes bat problems very seriously.
Ten specially trained experts regularly conduct research, inspections of nesting sites and sometimes even rescue operations.
The organization's efforts even created the first and only bat reserve in Scotland. It is located on the territory of the Triv estate in the Damfries-and-Halloween region. It has found a shelter for eight of the ten species of bats that live in Scotland.
Managing Director David Thompson says this is the perfect place for them.
"On the territory of the site of Triv excellent conditions for bats," he assures.
"There are old buildings, many giant trees and other favorable living conditions.
However, we still need to learn a lot about bats. Thanks to the research we are doing here and elsewhere, we will be able to learn more about what they need to thrive."
He insists that it is very important to check the territory for the presence of bats before carrying out any technical work, because due to the accidental destruction of one nest site for the removal of the young may die up to 400 females with the young, which is likely to cause the destruction of the entire local population.
Species and their nests are protected by law. Animals are prohibited from killing, torturing or disturbing.
Elizabeth Ferrell, an officer at the Scottish Bat Conservation Center, urged the public to join the organization’s efforts.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats. We have not yet revealed the characteristics of the populations of many species."
Ronaldo denies allegations of rape, and his lawyers are preparing a lawsuit against the German edition
Cristiano Ronaldo called the allegations of rape “blame” and said people were “trying to get attention” using his name.
His lawyers are ready to file a lawsuit against the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which published information about the suspects.
American Catherine Mayorga accused the forward of the Portuguese national team and football club Juventus of rape, which occurred in 2009 in a hotel room in Las Vegas.
According to Der Spiegel magazine on Friday, Ronaldo allegedly paid her $375,000 for silence.
A few hours after the allegations were made, 33-year-old Ronaldo appealed to 142 million of his fans on Instagram, calling the relevant messages “blasphemous.”
"No, no, no, no, no!
Today’s accusations are a slander,” the five-time Golden Ball winner made a statement on camera.
“They want to draw attention to themselves by using my name.
It's natural.
These people are trying to take advantage of me, but such situations are part of my job.
I’m a happy man and I’m fine,” the footballer added, smiling.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing a lawsuit against Der Spiegel for the published charges, which they called “an unacceptable report of suspicion in the sphere of privacy.”
Attorney Christian Herz said the player would seek compensation for "moral damages to the extent of the seriousness of the violation, which is likely to be one of the loudest cases of personal rights violations in recent years."
It is claimed that the incident occurred in June 2009 at the Palms Casino Hotel in Las Vegas.
It is reported that after a meeting at the nightclub Ronaldo and Mayorgo returned to the player's room, where he allegedly anally raped her. Such testimony is transferred to the district court of Clark County, Nevada.
Mayorga claims that after the incident described, Ronaldo fell to his knees before her and said that he was a "99 percent good guy" who was misled by "one percent".
As noted in the documents, Ronaldo confirmed that he had sex with the model, but by mutual consent.
Majorga also claims that she turned to the police and then to the hospital, where her injuries were photographed. However, she later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was "fearful of revenge" and warned of "public humiliation".
Now a 34-year-old woman is seeking to cancel the previous agreement as she continues to suffer from an incident that she says took place.
At the time of the incident, Ronaldo was preparing for the transfer to Real Madrid from Manchester United. This summer, he became a player of the Italian football grandstand, the Juventus team, for 100 million euros.
Brexit: UK 'will forever regret' loss of automakers
The UK will "forever regret" if it loses its status as a world leader in the field of car manufacturing after Brexit. This is warned by Economy Minister Greg Clark.
He added that he was excited by a statement by Toyota UK representatives, who told BBC journalists that in the event of Britain’s withdrawal from the EU without a deal, the company would be forced to suspend production and operation of its plant in Bernaston, near Derby.
“We need a deal,” said Minister Clarke.
The Japanese automaker said the consequences of delays at the border in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs.
The plant in Bernaston, which produces Toyota Auris and Avensis models, produced about 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“In my opinion, if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, production at our plant will be stopped,” said Marvin Cook, CEO of Toyota in Bernaston.
Other carmakers, such as Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, are also concerned about the impact of Britain’s exit from the EU without an international trade deal.
For example, BMW said that the production plant for the Mini model in Oxford will be closed a month after Brexit.
The main concerns of automakers are related to the fact that a no-deal Brexit could pose risks to supply chains.
Toyota’s production line operates as part of an expedited supply of parts and materials as needed – parts are delivered every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and the EU for custom-built cars.
If Britain leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be interruptions in the supply of parts at the border, leading to delays and shortages of materials.
As noted in the company, in the warehouse of Toyota you can place parts for no more than one day. So production will have to stop.
Greg Clark noted that in the plan for the organization of relations with the EU, prepared by Theresa May (Chequers Plan), "a separate scheme for avoiding problems at the border is provided".
"We need a deal. We need to make an optimal deal, which, in my opinion, will allow not only to achieve success at the current moment, but also to take advantage of the prospects that have arisen," he said during the Today program on BBC Radio 4.
“Given the testimonials of Toyota, as well as other automakers, we urgently need to maintain highly efficient supply chains.”
Toyota has not been able to say how long production will be stopped, but in the long term, it is expected that the increase in costs will lead to a decrease in the competitiveness of the plant and, as a result, will force cuts in jobs.
Peter Zuvalaris, head of the organizing committee of the Unite trade union at the plant in Bernaston, who has worked here for 24 years, said that the other participants are extremely concerned: "From experience, I can say that cuts in jobs are not being restored."
The government spokesman said: “We have put forward an accurate and reliable plan to shape our future relations with the EU.”
Trump and Rosenstein meeting may be postponed again, says White House
According to White House officials on Sunday, Donald Trump’s responsible meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be “deferred for another week” as discussions on Brett Kavanaugh’s candidacy for the position of Supreme Court judge continue.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special prosecutor Robert Mueller, who investigates Russia’s interference in the election, the links between Trump’s aides and Russia, and the potential obstruction of justice by the president.
For months, Washington has been discussing the possibility of firing the deputy attorney general, which would jeopardize Mueller’s independence.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had commented on the use of microphones to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of early termination of the president's powers under the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein has not confirmed this information.
But last Monday he visited the White House amid reports that the official is about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the U.N. headquarters in New York, was scheduled for Thursday.
Trump said he "wouldn't want" to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed to avoid a timing coincidence with a Senate Legal Committee meeting to testify against Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into allegations against Cavanaugh, which further delayed the vote in the Senate.
Trump’s spokeswoman, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: "The date of the meeting is not scheduled. Perhaps it will take place this week. I expect it to be postponed for another week, given all the events related to the Supreme Court.
But we'll see. I keep an eye on the press for the latest news."
Some journalists disagreed: Sanders had not held a media briefing in the White House since September 10.
Chris Wallace asked me why.
Sanders responded that the briefings were not often associated with a reluctance to "play to the public" by television reporters, although she added: "I will not deny that they play to the public."
She then suggested that Trump himself would communicate with the press more.
“The president answers questions more often than any president before him,” she said, adding, without referring to the source: “Statistics speaks for itself.”
Sanders said the briefings would still be held, but “if the press has an opportunity to ask a question to the U.S. president, it’s better than talking to me.”
We try to communicate often with the press. This should be especially noticeable in the last few weeks. The opportunity to talk to the US president is no worse than a press conference."
Trump regularly answers questions during events outside the White House, open meetings or press conferences involving high-ranking guests.
Personal press conferences are rarely held.
In New York City this week, the president may have demonstrated why this is the case by behaving in front of journalists with outrage and at times with wonder.
The Secretary of State for Health of Scotland addressed in a letter to workers from the EU in connection with the concerns about Brexit
The Secretary of State for Health addressed in a letter to citizens of other EU countries working in the National Health Service of Scotland to express gratitude for their work and ask to continue it after Brexit.
Jean Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before Britain left the EU.
The Scottish government has already undertaken to cover the cost of applications for permanent resettlement status for EU citizens working in autonomous public services.
In her letter, Mrs Freeman said: "During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on the issue of withdrawal continued. We should wait for appropriate solutions this fall.
But the UK government is stepping up preparations for a possible no-deal exit.
I know that this period can be very troubling for you.
That’s why I would like to reiterate how I value the contribution of each employee, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from across the European Union and beyond share valuable experience and skills, strengthening and improving the work of the health service for the benefit of the patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is your home. We really want you to stay."
Christian Ebercrombie has undergone emergency surgery after a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers midfielder Christian Ebercromby underwent an emergency operation after receiving a head injury in a Sunday match against the Vanderbilt Comodoro, which his team lost with a score of 31:27. This was reported by a journalist of the edition Tennessee.
Tennessee State Tigers head coach told reporters that the player was injured shortly before the break.
"He approached the sideline where he got sick," Reid said.
On the sidelines, coaches and medical staff gave Ebercrombie oxygen before picking him up for further examination.
An official from the Tennessee State Tigers team told Chris Harris of WSMV (Nashville, Tennessee) that Ebercrombie had been operated on at Vanderbilt University Medical Center.
Harris added that "so far there is no evidence of the type and severity of the injury." The Tennessee State Tigers team is trying to find out when the player was injured.
Ebercrombie, a second-year student, spent his first season at the Tennessee State Tigers after moving out of the Illinois team.
He performed five interceptions of the ball on Sunday before leaving the game. So for the season he has on account of 18 interceptions.
Foreign buyers will pay more state duty in case of real estate purchases in the UK
Foreign buyers will pay more tax if they buy real estate in the UK. According to the new Tori plans, additional funds will be spent on helping the homeless
This event neutralizes all attempts of Corbyn to attract young voters
A higher state duty will be levied on those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Ministry of Finance hopes to attract an additional <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year to help the homeless
As announced today, Theresa May, foreigners buying real estate in the UK, will pay more taxes. Additional funds will be spent on helping the homeless.
This step can be seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbyn’s efforts to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing aimed at high-paid workers.
The tariff increase will apply to individuals and legal entities who do not pay taxes in the UK. Additional funds will be directed by the government to help those who are forced to sleep under the open sky.
The additional duty, which accompanies the increase of the two-year old age for the second dwelling and real estate intended for lease, can be three percent.
The Ministry of Finance expects to attract an additional <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year.
According to experts, 13% of the new real estate being built in London is owned by foreign citizens. This leads to higher prices and complicates the task for those who only dream of owning a home.
Many of the country’s wealthy areas, particularly in the capital, are deserted because a large number of foreign buyers mostly live outside the country.
The new action plan came just weeks after Boris Johnson called for lower state taxes to make housing more affordable for young people.
He accused large construction companies of maintaining high real estate prices by buying land without further use. He urged Theresa May to give up quotas for affordable real estate to remedy the "disgraceful housing market situation" in the UK.
Mr. Corbyn announced a number of important reforms in the real estate sector, including controlling rents and preventing evictions without weighted reasons.
It also proposes to expand the powers of local councils in the field of construction of new housing.
Theresa May said: “Toric, I promised to dedicate my premiership to restoring the British dream – for every new generation of life to be better.
This requires a change in our imperfect housing market.
The UK will always remain open to those who aspire to live, work and build their future here.
However, it cannot be called fair the fact that individuals who do not live in the UK, as well as foreign companies, buy housing on the same conditions as British citizens.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home has become unattainable. The problem of living under the open sky still remains very painful."
Jack Ross: “I want to be the head coach of Scotland”
Sunderland head coach Jack Ross says he is “over all seeking” to lead the Scottish national team.
The 42-year-old Scottish has taken to re-establish the club from the northeast of the country, which now occupies third place in the First Football League, three points behind the leader.
Ross moved to the Stadium of Light this summer, returning last season to St. Mirren FC in the Premier League of Scotland.
“I wanted to represent my country as a player.
I got to Scotland's second national team, but that was the end of it," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportssound radio station.
"When I was a kid, my father and I often watched Scotland play at Hampden Park, which has always attracted me.
The only hope for me is to be successful as head coach of the club.”
Ross's predecessors in Sanderland FC, in particular, were Dick Lawyer, David Moes, Sam Ellardais, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keen, Gustavo Poet and Paolo Di Canio.
Former head coach of FC Alloa Athletic claims that he did not feel anxious about moving to the big club following such authoritative names, having previously rejected proposals from FC Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"At the current stage, I will consider it a success if the club returns to the Premier League.
Due to its structure and material and technical support, this club, no doubt, corresponds to the level of the Premier League," he said.
“It’s not going to be an easy task, but I’m unlikely to see another outcome as a success for myself.”
Ross has only been building a coaching career for three years. Before that, he worked as a second coach in Dumbarton FC, and also spent 15 months in the coaching staff of Harts FC.
He then helped Alloa recover after FC reached the third division, and in the following season from St. Mirren went the way from the departure stage to winning the title of the first division winners.
According to Ross, he now feels more comfortable than ever during his playing career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Folkerk, St. Mary's and Hamilton Academic.
"I found myself at the intersection," he recalls, talking about the transition to FC Alloa.
“I sincerely believed that the coaching activity was more suitable for me than the game.
It sounds strange, because I was successful, made good money on it, and reached certain heights.
But playing is not easy.
There are a lot of difficulties that have to be overcome every week.
I still face them, experiencing stress and tension, but as the head coach I feel in my place.
I have always been interested in coaching work. I have never felt so comfortable in my adult life as after I chose this profession."

Study: 17:30 on Sunday – the perfect time for a beer cup
The summer heat helped increase revenue for British pubs, which are not experiencing the best times, but increased the pressure on the restaurant chain.
According to calculations, sales in pubs and bars rose by 2.7% in July, while restaurant profits declined by 4.8%.
The author of the calculations Peter Martin of the organization CGA, which is engaged in business development consultancy, noted: "Due to the sunny weather and longer than expected, the participation of England in the World Championship, in July passed on the same scheme.
The June drop of 1.8% in July increased.
Pubs and bars focus on serving drinks, so far have the best indicators – the growth of their profits is equivalent to the losses of restaurants.
The pubs that serve food were also affected by the heat, but not as much as the restaurants.
It seems that visitors are only interested in drinking.
In controlled pubs and bars, beverage sales increased by 6.6% per month. At the same time, food sales decreased by 3%".
Paul Newman, analyst at RSM’s leisure and hospitality business, said: “We’ve been seeing similar trends since the end of April.
Weather and large-scale social or sporting events remain the main factors affecting sales in the domestic market.
It is no wonder that restaurant groups continue to lose profits. Annual sales decline of 4.8% is a particular concern against the backdrop of the need to cut costs.
The long hot summer has not come at the best time for the establishments serving food. We will see if the moderate temperature we observed in August will be able to give them such a necessary rest."
Overall sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including new establishments, amounted to 2.7% in July, reflecting the slowdown in the introduction of new brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker industry sales indicator in the UK’s pubs, bars and restaurants sector is a reflection of the collected and analyzed performance indicators of 47 working groups whose total turnover exceeds <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion. It is a commonly accepted industry standard.
One in five children has a social media account hidden from their parents.
According to the study, one in five children, sometimes less than 11 years old, have a hidden social media account from parents and teachers.
A study that covered 20,000 high school students found an increase in the number of fake pages on Instagram
This news has heightened concerns about the possible posting of content of a sexual nature
20% of students reported having a “main account” that they show their parents
One in five children, sometimes less than 11 years old, creates a social media account that hides from adults.
The study, which covered 20,000 high school students, found an increase in the number of fake pages on Instagram, a social photo-sharing network.
This news has heightened concerns about the possible posting of content of a sexual nature.
20% of students reported having a clean “basic” account that they show their parents, as well as one or more private ones.
A mother who accidentally stumbled onto a secret page of her 13-year-old daughter saw a call to "rape me".
A study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters' and Headmasters' Conference (HMC) in private schools found that 40% of children aged 11 to 18 have two profiles on social networks. Half of these children admitted that the additional account is classified.
Mike Buchanan, president of HMC, said: “We are very concerned that many teenagers feel a desire to create an online space where parents and teachers can’t find them.
Eileen Doyle to be 'Athlete's Representative' at Scottish Athletics
Eileed Doyle is elected to the Scottish Athletics Board as an independent director at the annual general meetings of the board members.
Doyle is Scotland’s most prestigious athlete. The chairman of the board, Jen Bitty, called this step a great opportunity for those who lead the sport movement to take advantage of its wide experience gained internationally over the last decade.
“Eileen enjoys great respect among the athletes of Scotland, the UK and the world. We are convinced that by bringing her to the council, athletics in Scotland will be of great benefit,” said Bitty.
Doyle said: "I will be inspired to act as a representative of the interests of athletes. I hope that I will really be able to benefit and contribute to the development of sport in Scotland."
An American, a four-time Olympic champion who won the 200 and 400 metres at the 1996 Atlanta Games and now a sports spectator for the BBC, has lost the opportunity to walk through a transitory ischemic attack.
He tweeted: “That’s why I had a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time will tell if I can recover and how much.
Thanks to incredible efforts, I was able to recover completely. I have learned to walk again and today I am doing dynamic exercises!
Thank you for your words of support!”
In the advertising of a milk suction cup, women were compared to cows – the opinions of Internet users were divided
The manufacturer of milk extractors has faced a mixed reaction of Internet users to advertising, in which young mothers are compared with active cows.
To mark the release of a product called “the world’s first silent all-in-one milk suction cup”, tech consumer goods company Elvie has released an ad in the style of a humorous music video to demonstrate the freedom that a new suction cup gives mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a blue-filled cornice under a song that contains the words: "Yes, I'm feeding myself, but I don't have a tail" and "As you can see, it's not a wimp, it's my breasts."
Next, the choir sings: "Suck up, suck up to feed the children. Suck up, suck up so that the milk is not wasted."
However, an advertisement posted on the company’s Facebook page sparked a tumultuous online discussion.
The video received 77,000 views and hundreds of comments. However, the reaction of Internet users turned out to be ambiguous. Many noted that the advertising underestimated the "terrible organization" of milk production in the industry.
"It's not a very smart decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they need to get pregnant and give birth to give milk. However, their children are taken away from them a few days after birth," one of the users wrote.
Elvie suction cup can be easily hidden in a feeding bra (Elvie/Mother)
Here’s another comment: “Obviously, it’s traumatic for both the mother and the child.
But why not engage them to advertise a milk suction cup for women who need to feed their babies?"
Another added: “This advertisement is very far from reality.”
Other users spoke in defense of the promotional video. One of the women of the video seemed "very cheerful".
“I think it’s a brilliant idea.
I would definitely have bought a thing like this if I was still breastfeeding.
When I sucked in the milk, I felt like a cow.
The ad is a bit crazy, but I didn’t look for hidden content in it.
It’s a great product,” someone wrote.
Here’s another comment: “A funny ad aimed at moms who suck milk (often at work or in the toilet) and feel like cows.
This advertisement is not aimed at highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, women show milk suction cups hidden in their bras.
The concept of an advertising campaign is based on the information that many women who use such products feel like cows.
However, the Elvie vacuum cleaner works absolutely quietly, has no wires or tubes and easily hides in a feeding bra. Thanks to this, women can move freely, hold children and even go out on the street.
Ana Balarin, partner and executive creative director of the advertising agency Mother, commented on the situation: “Elvie’s vacuum cleaner is so revolutionary that it required a bright and provocative presentation.
Having made a parallel between milk-squeezing women and real cows, we wanted to draw attention to the features of breastfeeding, in an exciting and interesting way demonstrating the incredible sense of freedom that the new suction cup will bring.
The Elvie vacuum cleaner is not the first time getting into the news headlines.
During the Fashion Week in London, the mother of two children appeared on the podium with this product during a show of clothes from fashion designer Marta Yakubovsky.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a tent town on the Texas border
The number of detained migrant children has risen sharply, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, in part because the Trump administration’s harsh rhetoric and policies have complicated the process of placing children in caregivers.
Traditionally, in most cases, the caregivers were the immigrants themselves without documents. Now they are afraid to jeopardize their own opportunity to stay in the country, proposing to take responsibility for the child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential caregivers and other adult members of their households would be required to provide fingerprints and that the data would be passed on to immigration services.
Last week, Matthew Albens, a senior official at the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress that the Bureau’s staff had arrested dozens of people who had applied for care of unaccompanied minors.
Later, the Bureau confirmed that 70% of the detainees had no criminal history.
"Approximately 80% of people who are carers or members of their households are illegally in the country. Many of them are foreigners who have committed crimes.
Therefore, we continue to persecute these people,” Albens said.
Asylum workers said in order to deal with children’s cases more quickly, officials introduced new rules that would require some of the children to appear in court within a month of detention, rather than 60 days, as was the case earlier.
Many of them will be able to use videoconferencing, rather than come to court in person to prove their legal status before immigration judges.
Those who are not entitled to asylum by the court’s decision will be quickly deported.
According to asylum workers and official data from responsible officials over the past months, the longer children remain in custody, the more likely they are to experience anxiety or depression. This can trigger outbreaks of violence or attempts to escape.
Human rights activists argue that these problems are exacerbated in larger institutions such as Tornillo, where it is more difficult to monitor the psychological state of children.
They added that by moving children to the camp and not giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to friends, we risk aggravating the trauma that many of them have already experienced.
Syria has ordered the "occupation forces" of the United States, France and Turkey to immediately withdraw troops
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualem urged Syrian refugees to return home, although the country has been at war for the eighth year.
Mualem, who also works as a deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were illegally on Syrian soil under the pretext of fighting terrorism, so "putting them in will be appropriate".
“They should leave immediately and not impose conditions,” he said at the assembly.
Muallem insisted that "the war on terrorism is actually over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions have left their homes.
He said Damascus would continue “this sacred battle until we clear all Syrian territories” of terrorist groups and “any illegal foreign presence.”
The U.S. has deployed about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and advising Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
In a war-torn country, France sent more than 1,000 soldiers.
Regarding the refugees, Muallem assured that the country has created the right conditions for their return. He also accused "some Western countries" of "propagating unreasonable fears" because of which refugees do not dare to return.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to contribute to the return of people,” he said.
“We are witnessing attempts to politicize a purely humanitarian problem.”
The United States and the European Union warn that they will not provide assistance to Syria in the reconstruction of the country until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.N. diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone around Idlib, the last major rebel stronghold, has created an opportunity for continued political talks.
Thanks to the Russian-Turkish agreement, it was possible to prevent a large-scale attack by Syrian forces supported by Russia on the province, where three million people live.
However, Muallem stressed that the deal had "clear terms" and expressed hope that military action would be directed against jihadists, including al-Qaeda-linked militants of the al-Nusra Front, who would be "destroyed".
U.N. Ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of the new committee, which will include representatives of the government and the opposition, in the near future, to develop a post-war constitution for Syria and create the conditions for the elections.
Muallem put forward the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying that his work should be limited to "revising the articles of the current constitution", and warned against interference.
Why Trump will be re-elected
According to this logic, Trump could be re-elected in 2020 if, as many liberal viewers are likely to expect, he does not resign early after the scandal and impeachment.
Without a doubt, this would be the “most dramatic end to the presidency of all time”!
At the moment, viewers do not show signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, the number of viewers in prime time has more than doubled (to 1.05 million) on CNN and has actually tripled (to 1.6 million) on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in prime time, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and The Rachel Maddow Show on the cable channel MSNBC was at the top of the rating with 3.5 million viewers in the evening when the main news was discussed.
“It’s a fire that attracts people because it’s beyond our grasp,” said Neil Burr, executive producer of the drama The Last Candidate on ABC, about a secretary of state who becomes president after a devastating attack on the Capitol.
Nell Skovell, an experienced humorist and author of Just Funny Moments: as well as a few harsh truths about penetrating the Hollywood Men's Club, offers a different theory.
She recalled a trip in a Boston taxi before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he would vote for Trump.
“Why?” she asked.
"Because he makes me laugh," he said. That's the story Mrs. Scowell told me.
Chaos is entertaining.
Of course, unlike any other content on TV, the stories from Washington are able to determine the future of Roe v. Wade, the possibility of reuniting immigrant families and the state of the world economy.
Abandonment is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet it can not be said that you are only trying to stay informed citizens of the Washington Post, when you watch six hours as a group of experts discusses the use of Bob Woodward's "well-known" sources for his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's jacket from the skin of the ostrich (for 15,000 to)
For me, for example, Super Mario will never be the same again.
"The feeling of reality-show is partly due to the fact that you are fed something new every night", - said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the author of the TV program "Stars of the Lombardy", about the rotation in the cast and the daily show.
If you allow yourself to miss a single episode, you can hopelessly lag behind.
When I was able to meet Mr. Flees this week at his home on the north coast of Kauai Island, there was warm sunny weather (27 degrees Celsius), but he was sitting at home watching MSNBC and recording CNN.
He couldn’t break away from television – not when Brett Cavanaugh stood before the Senate Legal Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court hung on his head.
“I remember how we used to make all those crazy shows, and people said it was the beginning of the end of Western civilization,” Flees told me.
“I took it as a joke, but it looks like they were right.”

External inflows of funds in the toughest midterm elections in Congress
It is no wonder that in the 17th district of the state of Pennsylvania is directed additional money inflows, because by reviewing the boundaries of the electoral districts, two current congressmen compete for one chair.
In the fight for this suburban district of Pittsburgh, whose borders have recently been changed, comes a Democrat, a member of the House of Representatives, Conor Lamb, who won another county in the additional elections last spring.
Lamb opposes another incumbent congressman, Republican Keith Rothschild, who now represents the old 12th county of Pennsylvania, whose borders largely coincide with the new 17th.
The maps were revised after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled in January that the old boundaries of the districts were drawn in favor of Republicans contrary to the constitution.
The pre-election races in the new 17th district caused a fierce confrontation between the financial divisions of the main parties, the Democratic Party's Democratic Congressional Elections Committee (DCCC) and the Republican Party's National Committee (NRCC).
Lemba's last name became very well-known in Pennsylvania after winning with a minimal advantage in 18th County during the additional congressional elections in March, which enjoyed wide public attention.
This place was owned by Republicans for more than a decade. President Donald Trump won in this district with a 20-point lead.
Political experts have given little preference to Democrats.
The U.S. considered the possibility of punishing El Salvador for the support of China, but changed its mind
Diplomats recalled Washington’s weak resistance to the actions of the Dominican Republic and Panama, which had previously supported Beijing’s position.
In June 2017, Trump had a warm meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela. Earlier, Trump also had a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled staff hired by the Trump Organization from there.
State Department officials have decided to recall the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of “recent decisions on Taiwan’s non-recognition,” Department of State spokeswoman Gezer Neuert said earlier this month.
But sanctions were considered only against El Salvador, which received about $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, in particular in the area of drug control, as well as in support of social and economic development.
The proposed fines, which included cuts in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would be painful for this country of Central America with its high unemployment and homicide rates.
According to the results of the internal meetings, officials from the states of North and Central America postponed the high-level conference on security and economic prosperity. A similar event took place last year, and it was considered as a step forward in US efforts.
But by mid-September, high-ranking officials of the administration made clear that they want the conference to take place. In fact, at this consideration the question of sanctions against El Salvador ceased.
According to diplomats, Vice President Mike Pence now plans to speak at a conference scheduled for mid-October, a sign that the administration considers this event very important.
At the same time, the three U.S. envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, as there were no new harsh messages or punishments from Washington.
Mr Bolton’s White House spokesman declined to comment on details of the internal discussions, which were reported by three U.S. officials, two of whom are diplomats, on condition of anonymity.
The information provided by them was confirmed by a third-party analyst close to the administration, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
Study the history.
The next inconvenience may be the report of special prosecutor Robert Mueller about the possible obstruction of justice by Trump, a weighty confirmation of why you can find in the now available public information.
As part of his investigation, Mueller is reportedly testing a possible link between the Trump campaign and an attack on our voting system by Russia.
If congressional influence passes to other hands, Trump will have to report to congressmen, as well as to voters and, ultimately, one-party voters.
There are a lot of “if” in this case, and I don’t want to say that Trump’s fall is inevitable, just like his colleagues in Europe.
All of us on both sides of the Atlantic must make a choice that determines the length of the struggle.
In 1938, German officers were ready to stage a coup d'état against Hitler, if only the West began to oppose him and support Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We have failed and lost the opportunity to avoid bloodshed.
The hedge of history is defined by such turning points, and the steady movement of democracy is accelerating or slowing down.
Americans are now waiting for a few such breakthrough myths.
What will we do if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man on whom Mr Mueller’s fate depends?
Rosenstein was in trouble even as the newspaper reported that last year he offered to secretly record conversations with the president and shared his thoughts on Trump’s inconsistency with the position.
Rosenstein called the information in The Times inaccurate.
“How do we respond if the investigation into the case against Brett Cavanaugh, which the FBI recently launched, proves to be insufficiently thorough or honest, or if Cavanaugh’s candidacy for a position in the Supreme Court is approved despite compelling allegations of sexual assault and misconduct?
And, first of all, will we vote in the medium term for those members of Congress who will be able to hold Trump accountable?
If we fail these tests, there will be bad times for democracy.
But I believe that we will not fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later sent me to light Saturday candles on a swastika table.
Having such a legacy, can I not look with optimism into the future?”

Graham Dorrance of the Rangers with optimism awaits the meeting with the Vienna "Rapid"
FC "Rangers" receives "Rapid" (Vienna) on Thursday. After an impressive no-one in Spain in a game with "Villarreal" at the beginning of this month, the victory over the Austrians will provide the Scottish club with good chances of leaving Group G of the League of Europe.
Due to a knee injury, midfielder Graham Dorrance was able to play for his team for the first time in the season only in a game against Villarreal, which ended with a score of 2:2. However, he believes that FC Rangers can use this result as a stepping stone to achieve more.
“For us it was a good result, because Villarreal is a strong team,” said the 31-year-old.
“We went out to the game with the hope of getting something and scored one point.
Maybe at the end of the game we could go forward, but in general, a draw, probably, can be considered a fair result.
In the first half the opponent was better, but after the break we corrected the situation in our favor.
On Thursday, there will be another important confrontation in the Europa League.
I hope we can get three points, but it will not be easy. Our future rivals have shown a good result in their last game. However, we can count on the support of the fans. I am sure that we will be able to give the fight and achieve a positive result.
The past year has certainly been difficult, starting with my injuries and ending with changes in the club itself. But now the situation has normalized.
We have a great team, and all the guys are satisfied. Training goes well.
I hope we can go further, leave behind last season and achieve success.”
Women lose sleep because of fear of retirement savings
Despite the fact that the survey participants had a clear idea of how they would like to organize care for themselves, few people talked about it with their family members.
About half of the people who participated in the Nationwide study said they talked to their husband or wife about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10% of respondents talked about it with children.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they’re not in a hurry to start a conversation on the subject,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide’s life insurance division.
Here's where you need to start.
Talk to your husband or wife and children: your family will not be able to provide you with the necessary care unless you inform your relatives of your wishes in advance.
Consult with your counselor and family to determine where and how to receive care, as this choice can become an important factor in determining the cost.
Involve a financial advisor: he can advise on a way to cover the corresponding costs.
Sources of funding for long-term care include a traditional insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy, or self-insurance at your own expense (provided you have the money).
Carefully prepare legal documents: this will allow you to avoid legal dragging in advance.
Prepare the credentials for your representative, who will control your medical care and make sure that the specialists fulfill your wishes in case you can’t do it personally.
In addition, we advise to issue a trust at the disposal of funds.
Choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions for you and pay the bills in the event of your incapacity.
Do not forget about the minor details. Imagine that one of your elderly parents needs urgent medical attention, so he is taken to the hospital.
Will you be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Write down this information to be ready.
"It's not just about finances. It's important who the doctors are," Martin says.
What medications can be taken and
Who takes care of the dog?
Make a plan like that.”
In Ilfracombe, a man fired several times with a pneumatic rifle
The man fired several shots from a pneumatic rifle as he returned home from the party.
The 40-year-old was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and arm.
Officers described the shooting, which took place at 02:30 in British summer time, as a "accident".
The victim did not see the attacker.
His wounds are not life threatening, and the police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died as a result of a powerful earthquake and tsunami in the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, but the number of victims could increase.
Due to the outage, officials dealing with humanitarian aid issues are unable to receive any information from the Regency of the Dongala, a district north of Palu, which is located closer to the epicentre of the 7.5-point earthquake.
After the disaster, 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu.
We will list some basic facts about the city of Palu and the regency of the Dongala located on the island of Sulawesi.
Palu is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 according to 2017 data.
When the earthquake that caused the tsunami occurred, the city celebrated its 40th anniversary.
The Dongala is a regency that extends for more than 300 km (180 miles) along the coastline in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
According to data for 2017, the regency, the administrative region located in the lower part of the province, lives about 299,200 people.
Fishing and agriculture are the main branches of the economy of Central Sulawesi province, especially the coastal region of the Dongkal.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is mainly concentrated in Moravali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian agency for mitigating the effects of natural disasters over the last 100 years, Palu and the Dongala have suffered from the tsunami several times.
In 1938, the tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
In 1996, a tsunami also covered the western part of the Dongkal, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the seismicly active Pacific Ring of Fire and regularly suffers from earthquakes.
Below are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years.
2004: On December 26, a strong earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh, located in the north of Sumatra, caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries, resulting in 226,000 deaths along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in the region.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people have died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude earthquake shook southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, and caused a tsunami that struck the southern coast, killing about 700 people.
2009: Near the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra, an earthquake of magnitude 7.6 was recorded.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake shook one of the Mentawa islands near Sumatra and caused a tsunami of up to 10 meters high, destroying dozens of villages and killing about 300 people.
2016: A weak earthquake hit the Padijaja Regency in Aceh Province, causing destruction and panic associated with the fact that people have not yet managed to forget the devastating earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died under the rubble of buildings.
2018: Heavy earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mostly in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed many houses, and thousands of tourists could not immediately leave the island.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
According to an Alaskan police report released Saturday, 29-year-old Palin from Vasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence and charged with obstructing the report of a case of violence and resisting it during the arc.
According to a police report, when an acquaintance tried to call the police to report possible crimes, he took away her phone.
According to KTUU, Palin is in custody in the Matanuska-Susitna investigative detention center with the right to make a bail in the amount of $500.
He stood before the court on Saturday, where he pleaded "innocent" when asked if he confessed to his guilt, the network reported.
Palin is charged with three Class A misdemeanors, which involves arrest for up to one year and a $250,000 fine.
He is also charged with Class B offenses, which is punishable by a day’s imprisonment and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that Pauline has been charged with a crime.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police and reported a possible attack.
The case is currently before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, as well as obstructing the reporting of a case of domestic violence and carrying a gun in a state of intoxication when the incident occurred.
His girlfriend said he hit her in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by groups of veterans for justifying her son’s violent behavior with a post-traumatic stress disorder after serving in Iraq.
In Indonesia, the earthquake caused a tsunami: hundreds of people died
At least 384 people were killed in an earthquake on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
An earthquake of magnitude 7.5 caused a tsunami and destroyed hundreds of homes.
Communications and power grids have gone out of business, and the number of casualties may increase in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred near the center of the island of Sulawesi, located northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
The video, circulating on social networks, shows the moment when the element struck.
Hundreds of people gathered for a festival on the beach of the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the shore.
Federal Prosecutors Claim Rare Death Penalty for Suspect in New York Terror Attack
In New York, federal prosecutors are demanding the death penalty for Saifullo Saipov, a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York that killed eight people – a rare punishment that has not been applied in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
It is alleged that in October, 30-year-old Saipov, driving a rented pickup truck at Home Depot, went on a bike lane along the highway in West Side, Lower Manhattan, and began to beat down cyclists and pedestrians who were hit.
According to a report of intent to achieve execution in the Southern District of New York State to justify the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov “intentionally” killed eight people and “intentionally” caused serious bodily harm.
According to the court records, each of these charges involves the possibility of the death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, the Federal Jury Court charged Saipova with 22 counts, including eight counts of murder for the purpose of prosecution, which federal prosecutors usually lay out in cases related to aggravation of organized crime, as well as aggravation of the crime.
According to prosecutors, who described Saipov's crime as "terrible, cruel and malicious", the attack is the result of "careful planning and premeditated intent".
The victims of which Saifulla Habibulaevich Saipov inflicted injuries, caused damage or killed, were Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleves, Ann-Lora Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlich, Hernando Ferruccio, Ariel Ehrlich, Dairy
Five of the dead were tourists from Argentina.
It’s been ten years since the last time a criminal case that is punishable by the death penalty was filed in the Southern District of New York.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug suppliers and eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty in a federal case was brought to execution in New York in 1953. The married couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years before.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to the court records, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, did not show any reprimands of conscience in the days and months following the attack.
According to police, he told investigators that he did not regret what he had done.
According to the indictment, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to carry out an attack on the video of ISIL, which he was watching on his phone.
Police said he had also asked for the ISIS flag to be hung in his hospital room.
He did not plead guilty to 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were "very disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
“We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of admitting guilt and awarding life imprisonment without the possibility of release will only aggravate the psychological trauma caused by these events to all the victims,” Patton said.
Saipov’s defense side had earlier also urged prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
MEP from the Conservative Party believes that NAIJEL FARAJA should be appointed responsible for Brexit negotiations
Today, during the protest action at the Conservative Party congress, Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the People's Army".
The former leader of the UK’s Independence Party said politicians should “feel the pressure” of Eurosceptics as one of Theresa May’s MPs proposed his candidacy for negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Boone said at a march in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would "already have come out" if Mr Farage was Brexit's secretary.
Attention to the problems May faced in trying to reconcile her deeply divided ranks has been further attracted by the fact that Conservative MPs who oppose the exit have joined a special action of protest in the city against Brexit.
The prime minister is trying to implement Chequers’ compromise plan despite attacks from Brexit supporters, those against the exit, and the EU.
The Allies insist that it will not abandon attempts to negotiate with Brussels, despite the negative reaction, and will force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between what it offers and “chaos.”
At the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull, Mr. Boone said he wanted to "renounce Chequers".
He offered Mr. Farage to step out of the shadows and take responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he was responsible for that, we would have already left,” he said.
Wellingborough added: “I will support Brexit, but we must give up Chequers.”
Speaking against the EU, he said: “We have fought in world wars not to submit.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Mr. Bone rejected the assumption that after the 2016 vote, public opinion had changed: "The idea that the British changed their minds and did not want to leave is absolutely not true."
A member of the Conservative Party and Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkins, who was also on the march, told reporters: “I’m just saying, ‘Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Chequers’ plan is unpopular among the general public, the opposition is not going to vote for it, it is not being supported by our party and our activists, who actually walk the streets and fight for voter votes.
“Please drop the Chequers and start listening.”
In an address to Theresa May, she added: “Prime Ministers keep their positions when they keep their promises.”
Farage said politicians should “feel the pressure” if they are going to give up the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
“Now it’s a matter of trust between us, the people and our political elite,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit, and we’re here today to tell them it’s not going to get out of their hands.”
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want our political elite, who are planning to betray the idea of Brexit, to feel pressured.
We are mobilizing this country’s People’s Army, which will lead us to victory in Brexit and will never rest until we become an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, opponents of the exit passed through Birmingham, and then held a two-hour rally in the city center.
Several activists waved banners “Conservatives against Brexit” after the group’s launch this weekend.
Labour's Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives over the fact that security issues arose after the opening of the conference through their party program.
“These are the people who tell us that they can use the IT systems and technologies needed for Canada-plus, a well-organized border, free trade with Ireland,” he said.
“This is a complete farce.
There is nothing good about Brexit,” he added.
Warren plans to "seriously think" about running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said that after the November election, she would "reflect seriously on running for president."
The Boston Globe reports that on Saturday, during a general meeting in Western Massachusetts, a representative of the Democratic Party of Massachusetts spoke about her future.
Warren, who often criticizes President Donald Trump, is running for a second term in November against Republican Party member Jeff Dyle, who co-chaired the 2016 Trump campaign in Massachusetts.
It is considered as the main candidacy that can fight with Trump in 2020.
On Saturday afternoon, her 36th meeting with voters took place in the format of general meetings since Trump took office.
The participant asked her if she plans to participate in the presidential election.
Warren responded that "it's time for women to go to Washington and set up a government job, and for that to happen, a woman must be at the head of it."
Arrested suspect in the murder of LSU Tigers basketball player with a firearm Sims
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, said on Saturday that a suspect in the murder of LSU Tigers basketball player Wade Sims was arrested on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Deaton Simpson at a press conference at 11 a.m. Eastern time.
On Friday, they published a video recording of the shooting with a request to help recognize the person on it.
20-year-old Simse was shot dead near the campus of Southern University on Friday morning.
"Vade Simms was shot in the head and died as a result," police chief Murphy J. Paul told reporters on Saturday.
Wade gave in to his friend, and Simpson shot him.
As a result of the interrogation, it was established that Simpson was at the scene of the crime, carrying a weapon and shooting at Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody at the East Button County Police Department.
Sims, who was 6 feet and 6 inches tall and played in the junior league, grew up in Baton Rouge. He played 32 games with 10 stars last season and on average spent 17.4 minutes on the field, scoring 5.6 points and 2.9 points.
Grand Prix of Russia: Lewis Hamilton reduced the lag in the fight for the title of world champion after the team decided to give him a victory over Sebastian Fettel
Since Walter Bottas left Lewis Hamilton behind on Saturday, it has become clear that Mercedes’ team decisions will play a significant role in the race.
Bottas started well from the pole position and almost bypassed Hamilton, who tried to maintain his position in the first two laps and gave Fettel the opportunity to attack his teammate.
Vettel went to the pit stop first and left Hamilton on the track in the tail of the race, which was about to solve everything.
The driver of the Mercedes team passed another lap and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton broke out in the leader after a certain maneuver wheel to wheel, as a result of which the Ferrari driver reluctantly left the interior space due to the risk that it will be stuck in the front, after the result of the maneuver
On his 21st birthday, Max Verstappen started from the back row of the grid and remained in seventh place until the end of the first round.
After sweating, he led most of the race as he did not change tires to quickly reach the finish line and displace Kimi Rykkonen from fourth place.
As a result, he stopped on a pit stop in the 44th round, but was unable to increase the pace in the last eight, making Rykkonen fourth.
“It’s a difficult day because Valtteri taught full-time on all weekends and showed nobility when he gave me the opportunity to pass.
The team has done exceptional work to take first and second place,” said Hamilton.
The language of the body did not impress.
At a rally on Saturday, President Donald Trump ridiculed Senator Diane Feinstein for her firm position that she did not disclose the contents of a letter from Christine Blaise Ford accusing Supreme Court candidate Brett Cavanaugh of sexual assault.
During his speech at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly address the testimony given by Ford to the Senate Legal Committee, but instead expressed his opinion about the events in the Senate, which he said showed human "laziness, uglyness and rudeness".
“The only thing that could happen, and all the wonderful things that have been happening in the Senate over the last few days, is anger, you see evil people demonstrating vileness, uglyness and falsehood,” he said.
“You look at the publications and the published information, and then they say, ‘Oh, I didn’t do that.
It's not me."
Do you remember?
Diane Finstein, did you disclose the information?
Remember her answer... Did you disclose the contents of the documents? – “What?
Oh, no.
I didn’t announce it.”
Hold on a minute.
We did not disclose?... No, we did not disclose,” he added, copying the behavior of the senator.
In July, Finstein received a letter detailing the allegations made by Ford against Cavanaugh, and his contents were made public in early September, but Finstein denied that the leak had occurred in her office.
"I did not conceal Dr. Ford's allegations, I did not disclose the information she received," Finstein told the committee.
“She asked me to keep it a secret, and I didn’t break my promise.”
However, her objection did not seem to please the president, who commented during the Saturday rally: "I will tell you, her body language was not impressed at all.
Maybe she didn’t, but I haven’t seen anyone hold on worse.”
Continuing to defend a candidate for the Supreme Court who was accused of sexual assault by three women, the president suggested that Democrats use the charges for their own purposes.
“They are determined to return to power by any means necessary.
You see ignominy, uglyness, they don’t care who to insult, who to cross over to get power and control,” Mediaite quoted the president as saying.
Elite League: "Dundee Stars" – "Belfast Giants", 5:3
Player "Giants" Patrick Dwyer threw two washers in the match against "Dundee"
The Dundee Stars were rehabilitated for Friday's defeat in the elite league from the Belfast Giants, winning a match-response with a score of 5:3 on Saturday.
The Giants were given an early lead in two rounds thanks to pitches by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Boville.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cooney equalized the score in the home game, and then Dwyer again brought the Giants forward.
Dundee player François Bouchard equalized the score, and two goals by Lucas Lundwald Nielsen ensured their victory.
This is the third season in the elite league to defeat Adam Kif's team, who won a 2-1 victory over Dundee on Friday evening in Belfast.
This is the fourth team meeting of the season. Three previous matches were won by the Giants.
Dwyer threw the first wash at the fourth minute (3:35) after Kendall McFall's hand, and four minutes later Boville, who received the wash from David Rutherford, doubled the score.
After a tense first period at the fourteenth minute (13:10), Sullivan returned the fielders to the game, and at the sixteenth minute (15:16), Cooney, having received a wash from Matt Markwardt, equalized the score.
Dwyer secured the advantage of the Giants before the first break, dropping his second wash at the end of the first period.
The owners of the field regrouped, and Bushar at the twenty-eighth minute (27:37) again leveled the score, dropping the washer when his team outnumbered.
Thanks to the efforts of Cooney and Charles Corcoran Nielsen at the end of the second period, he first brought Dundee forward and secured his team's victory in the fifth half of the final period.
On Friday, the Giants, who have already lost four of the last five games, will play the start match against the Milton Keynes.
The air traffic controller died so that hundreds of people on the plane could avoid the earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller has been declared a hero after he helped take off a plane with hundreds of people at the cost of his own life.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a strong tsunami-causing earthquake on Sulawesi Island on Friday.
Strong underground thrusts continue to shake the area, many people found themselves under debris in the city of Palu.
However, unlike his colleagues who fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in a heavily shaken control tower at Mutiara SIS Al-Jufri Airport in Palu.
He remained in place to make sure that flight 6321 of Batik Air, which was on the runway at the time, safely rose in the air.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he thought it was going to collapse.
He later died in the hospital.
A spokesman for Indonesia’s aeronautical service provider, Johannes Sirait, said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australian news agency ABC News.
We have prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan, which has to deliver it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost it this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“We are very sorry to hear about this,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands, as the country's disaster mitigation agency says access to the cities of Dongdala, Sigi and Butong is limited.
"The number of victims may increase, as many bodies are still under the rubble, and many of them cannot be reached," Sutopo Purvo Nugroho's agency spokesman said.
Waves reaching a height of six meters devastated the city of Palu, where mass burials will take place on Sunday.
Military and passenger airplanes deliver assistance and food supplies.
Riza Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute ambulance brings bodies.
There is not enough clean water.
Mini-markets are looted everywhere.”
The head of the International Committee of the Red Cross in Indonesia, Jan Gelfand, told CNN: “The Red Cross of Indonesia is rushing to help the people who have survived this tragedy, but we don’t know what they will find there.
It’s a tragedy, but it can get much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and addressed the country's military: "I ask all of you to work day and night to carry out all the tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?”, CNN reported.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was hit by earthquakes on the island of Lombok, which killed more than 550 people.
Air crash in Micronesia: as stated in Air Niugini, after the fall of the plane in the lagoon one man disappeared
The airline, which operated a flight that crashed in the Pacific Lagoon in Micronesia, now claims that one person has disappeared, although it was previously reported that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the plane, which was sinking.
Air Niugini said that as of Saturday, it is not possible to find a single passenger.
The airline reports that its representatives are trying to find a man and are cooperating with local authorities, hospitals and investigators.
The airline did not immediately respond to a request for more information about the passenger, for example, about his age and nationality.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water as it attempted to land at Chuuk Island airport.
On Friday, officials said seven men had been taken to the hospital.
The airline reported that six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday, and they were all in stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events are unknown.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in a lagoon near the runway.
Some witnesses believe that the plane flew the runway.
American passenger Bill Janes said the plane flew very low above the ground.
"It's very good," said Janes.
Janes said that he and others managed to pass through the emergency exits on a submersible plane by being on the belt in the water.
He said the stewardesses panicked and screamed, and that he had a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy reported that sailors working nearby on the modernization of the dock also helped in the rescue operation, taking people to shore using an inflatable boat before the plane sank at a depth of 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
According to Aviation Safety Network data, over the past two decades, 111 people have died in plane crashes related to PNG-registered airlines, but this list does not include Air Niugini.
Analyst restores the chronology of the night in which the woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecution filed a lawsuit against a man accused of burning Mississippi women alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Roulette has testified as an expert on operational development for several hours.
He told jury members how he used cell phone footage to recreate the movement of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of the murder.
Roulette, as reported by The Clarion Ledger, said he had received location data from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was from Chambers the night she died, contrary to his previous claim.
When the data showed that his cell phone was near Chambers, although he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, police went to talk to the latter.
On Saturday, Sanford testified and declared that he was not in the city that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's pickup that night, Sanford said he was "lies because my pickup was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis claimed to have known Chambers about two weeks before her death.
Records of telephone conversations indicated that they only knew each other for a week.
Roulette said that some time after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' text messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
“He wiped it out of his life,” Gail said.
The defense has to put out its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge expects the trial to be handed over to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip-hop?
The hip-hop trio wants to challenge a negative view of the genre, filling their music with constructive messages.
The High Breed group from Bristol claims that hip-hop has changed its nature – it has abandoned political ideas and struggles to solve social problems.
They want to go back to the origins and make conscious hip-hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently witnessed a revival of this direction in the UK thanks to groups such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?!
In New York, a nanny filed a suit for the couple for dismissal, after receiving a "racist" message
In New York, a nanny filed a lawsuit against the couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving an improperly addressed message from her mother complaining that she was “another black woman.”
The couple denies that they are racists, comparing the lawsuit to “extortion.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed concern when she saw that the new nanny, Giselle Morris, who arrived on her first working day in 2016, was black.
“NO, ANOTHER DARKNESS,” Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a message.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Miss Morris twice.
As reported by the New York Post, realizing her mistake, Mrs. Plaxon-Flaxman felt "uncomfortable" and dismissed Miss Morris. She stated that their previous nanny, who was an African-American, was doing poorly her job and that, in turn, she was expecting Flippin.
Mrs. Morris was paid for one day of work and then sent home on Uber.
Now Maurice is suing the couple, hoping to receive compensation for the dismissal in the amount of salary she would have received in six months of living with the couple she was originally hired for, although without a contract. She was paid $350 a day.
“I want to show them that we don’t have to do that,” she told the Post on Friday, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
In response to allegations that they were racist, the couple said releasing Maurice was a sensible decision because they feared they would not be able to trust her after being insulted.
"My wife didn't mean what she sent to her.
She's not racist.
We are not racists,” her husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
“But would you leave your children with someone you’ve been rude to, even if it wasn’t intentional?
Your own baby?
NAVRIAD".
Comparing the lawsuit to "extortion," Plasco said his wife gave birth to a baby just two months ago and "hasn't recovered yet."
"Would you take revenge on someone after that?
This is a bad act,” added the investment banker.
While the trial is still ongoing, the public opinion court quickly condemned the couple on social media, criticizing their behavior and logic.
As reported in the new letter, the publishers of Paddington feared that readers would not understand the idea of a bear that is able to speak
Bond's daughter Karen Yankel, who was born almost immediately after the book agreed to be printed, said of the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the place of the first person who reads the book before it's published.
Now it's funny, because we know about the huge success that Paddington's story has had."
Telling that her father, who worked as a BBC operator, before a small toy bear inspired him to write a children's book, optimistic about the fact that his work was rejected, she shared how, on the 60th anniversary of the book's release, she felt "joy and joy".
Regarding Paddington, whom she describes as "a very important member of our family," Karen added that her father was quietly proud that the book had become so popular.
“He was a pretty humble man and didn’t like to brag,” she said.
"But Paddington was so real to him as his own child! After all, when children achieve something, we are proud of them, although it is not theirs, not our victories.
I think he looked at Paddington's success that way.
Although Paddington was a creation of his imagination, he always attributed success to him.
My daughter died, and I had to say goodbye to the phone
After the landing, her daughter was taken to 2 hospitals named Louis Pasteur in Nice, where doctors unsuccessfully tried to save her life.
“Over regularly called, saying that everything was really bad, that she shouldn’t have done it,” said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"And then Nad called me and said she would die in the next two minutes and I should say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, honey, I love you very much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you."
The medications that the doctors gave her to keep her heart beating gradually ceased to work and left the body.
She died a while before everything was turned off.
I just had to sit there and wait, knowing what was going on at that time.
I could not mourn, cry or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really should have kept it in my hands.”
Eventually, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, grieving over the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, not paying attention to the severe tests she had to endure.
“Nobody knew,” she said.
I lowered my head and couldn’t hold back my tears.
It’s hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I began to feel deeply sorry for Hope.
He needed my love and support.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Two women in mourning leave postcards to prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones due to suicide work to prevent others from laying hands on themselves.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys leave on the Welsh bridge postcards with phone numbers that people can call for support, as well as messages that would ask them to inspire them.
Ms. Davis Tyler's son was 13 when he began suffering from depression, and at the age of 18 he laid hands on himself.
“I don’t want other parents to feel the same way I do every day,” she said.
The 45-year-old Miss Davis, who lives in Leeds, said her son was a promising chef with an attractive smile.
Everyone knew him for his smile.
They’ve always said that this smile made any room lighter.”
But he quit his job before he died because he was “like in the dark.”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 at the time, found his brother’s body after he placed his hands on himself.
Miss Davis says, "I'm constantly afraid that it's going to have consequences."
Miss Davis created postcards "to let people know that there are those they can turn to and talk to, even if it's just a friend.
Don’t shut yourself up, you need to talk.”
Miss Humphries, who had been friends with Miss Davis for many years, lost her husband Mark, with whom she lived for 15 years, shortly after the death of his mother.
“He didn’t say that he felt depressed, that he was depressed or something,” she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed that it had changed."
And on the day of Christmas, he finally fainted. When the children opened their gifts, he did not look them in the eyes."
She said that his death was a huge trauma for them, but they have to go through this: "This imposed a devastating

The future of Brett Kavanaugh hangs on his hair: the FBI begins an investigation
“I thought that if we could get what we were asking for – limited in time and nature of the investigation – we might have reached some agreement,” Mr. Flake said Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would “disintegrate” amid the hopeless loss of political loyalty.
Why did Mr. Cavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Their unwillingness is tied to time.
The midterm elections will be held in just five weeks, on November 6. If Republicans are expected to have problems, this will seriously complicate their attempts to hold their own person through the elections to the country's Supreme Court.
George W. Bush telephoned the senators with a request to support Mr. Cavanaugh, who worked in the White House under Mr. Bush and through which he met his wife Ashley, who worked as Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI prepares its report?
In the Senate, where there are now 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats, a vote will be held.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh will be able to get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to solve the problem with the same number of votes and approve his candidacy for the position of Supreme Court judge.
During Kim's reign, the number of North Korean refugees "slowed down"
After Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, the number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea has fallen, the South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Pyongyang, citing data from the Ministry of Unification of the Republic of South Korea, said last year the number of fugitives was 1,127, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said the key factors were the strengthening of border controls between North Korea and China, and that smugglers carrying illegals are now demanding more money for it.
In Pyongyang, public comments have been held back.
The overwhelming majority of North Korean fugitives eventually offer South Korean citizenship.
In Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans illegally crossed the border after the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee through China, which has the longest border with North Korea. It is easier to cross than the well-protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China treats refugees as illegal migrants, not refugees, and often forcefully repatriates them.
Relations between North and South Korea, which are still formally at war, have improved markedly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang and discussed the issue of denuclearization, the negotiations on which fell into a deadlock.
This came after the historic June meeting of U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they collectively agreed to cooperate on the nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula.
However, on Saturday, North Korea’s Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused the United States of no progress since then in the face of sanctions.
"Without trust in the United States, we cannot be sure of the security of our country, so under these circumstances, there can be no talk of unilateral disarmament," Ri Yong-ho said in a speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Cavanaugh "hysterical" and says he's not fit for the Supreme Court
The minority leader in the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called the candidate for Supreme Court judge Brett Cavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was unfit for work in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi expressed her views in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I’ve always thought that if a woman ever spoke in this way, she would be called ‘hysterical’,” Pelosi commented on her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Legal Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations of sexual assault on Dr. Christine Blaise Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening speech, Kavanaugh behaved very emotionally, sometimes almost screaming and coughing, discussing his family and school years.
He also openly condemned the Democrats in the committee, calling the accusations against him a “absurd and coordinated ruin of reputation” organized by the liberals, angered by Hillary Clinton’s loss of the 2016 presidential election.
According to Pelosi, Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not work in the Supreme Court because it showed his bias towards Democrats.
“I think that with these statements, as well as his speech against Clinton and the Democrats, he will take his own nomination,” she said.
Pelosi was outraged when asked if she would try to impeach Cavanaugh if his guilt was confirmed, and whether the Democrats would get a majority in the House of Representatives.
“If he’s not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, he’s not only good for the Supreme Court, he’s good for the court where he works now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently serving as a judge at the U.S. Court of Appeals in the District of Columbia.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat she was concerned about Cavanaugh's possible decisions against the Affordable Care Act or Row v. Wade case, as he was considered a conservative judge.
At his hearings on the issue of approval in office, Kavanaugh bypassed the question of whether he would overturn some decisions of the Supreme Court.
“This is not the time when the judge becomes a hysterical, biased person and we will say how wonderful it is,” Pelosi said.
Women need to own these guns.
These are the righteous words that had accumulated in her for months and years of anger, and she could not utter them without tears.
“We cry when we’re angry,” Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual, do you?"
She continued: "One woman, who worked as an executive director somewhere and helped me a lot, said that she also cried when she got angry, but she had her own technique. When she got angry and started crying, she said to the interlocutor: "You can think that I'm sad and because of that I'm crying
I am evil.”
And then she just continued.
I thought it was incredible.”
Tears are considered an acceptable way out of anger in part because they are perceived differently.
One of my clearest memories of the first job in the office, where mostly men worked, was the situation when one day I was crying with unspeakable anger, and the older woman – an unfriendly manager, which I was always a little afraid of – grabbed me by the collar and pulled me on the hook.
“Never let them see you cry,” she told me.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They will think that you are sad, and they will rejoice that they have come to you.”
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in the presidential election.
In 1987, when Mr. Garth was caught in an extramarital affair aboard a boat called Monkey Business, after which he left the race, deeply disappointed Miss Schroeder decided that there were no reasons why she could not run for president.
“It wasn’t a very thoughtful decision,” she told me with a laugh 30 years later.
“Seven other candidates have already taken part in the race, and another candidate is the last one they needed.”
Someone called the situation “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs”.
Since it was at the end of the campaign, she lagged behind in raising funds, so she made a promise to herself that she would not participate in the race unless she raised $2 million.
It was a hopeless struggle.
She found that some of her supporters, who did not regret supporting her husbands, gave her only $250.
“Do you think they’re going to give me a discount?” she asked.
When she made a speech and announced that she would not conduct an official campaign, she was overwhelmed by emotions – gratitude to the people who supported her, frustration with a system that made it very difficult to raise money and forced to focus not so much on voters as on members of the Chamber of Deputies.
“You would think I had a nervous breakdown,” Ms. Schroeder recalls the press reaction.
You would think that Kleenex is my corporate sponsor.
Was I still thinking about what they'd write on my grave plate?
“She was crying?”
How a U.S.-China Trade War May Benefit Beijing
Experts believe that the first steps in a trade war between the United States and China were desperate, and, although far from its conclusion, in the long run, the split between countries could benefit Beijing.
U.S. President Donald Trump made his first warning shots earlier this year, taxing major Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The biggest escalation this week was due to new tariffs on goods totaling $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), which actually taxed half of all goods coming into the U.S. from China.
Beijing has paid the same coin each time, recently imposing duties of five to ten percent on U.S. goods worth $60 billion.
China has committed to similar U.S. measures, and the world’s second-largest economy is unlikely to miss the opportunity to deliver on that promise in the near future.
To force Washington to retreat is to agree to the demands, but for Chinese President Xi Jinping, public worship of the United States is too shameful.
However, experts believe that if Beijing makes the right use of the situation, the pressure in the trade war with the United States could bring China advantage in the long run, reducing the relationship between the two economies.
“A swift political decision in Washington or Beijing can create conditions that will lead to a sharp economic downturn in any of the countries. And it actually poses a greater threat than observers have acknowledged before,” said Security Analyst Abigail Grace, who is involved in the Center for Asian Affairs.
The foreign minister said that Syria "ready" for the return of refugees
Syria says it is ready to voluntarily return refugees and seeks help to rebuild a country devastated by more than seven years of war.
Speaking to the General Assembly of the United Nations, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualem said that conditions in the country are improving.
“Today, the real situation has become more stable and safer thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to rebuild areas destroyed by terrorists so that people can return to normal life.
All conditions have been created for the voluntary return of refugees to a country that they had to leave because of terrorism, as well as unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and limited the means of subsistence.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian aid.
Al-Muhammad said the Syrian government would be pleased to accept assistance to rebuild the war-torn country.
But he stressed that they will not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that support the uprising.
Europe confirms victory at the "Rider Cup" in Paris
The European team won the Ryder Cup in 2018 when they defeated the U.S. team with a total score of 16.5:10.5 at Le Golf National in the suburbs of Paris, France.
The U.S. team has been defeated in Europe for the sixth time in a row and has not won the Ryder Cup since 1993.
Europe regained its crown when the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn scored 14.5 points they needed to defeat the United States.
American star Phil Mickleson, who tried hard most of the tournament, broke his first long shot on the 16th hole of par-3 in the water and ceded to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari won all of his rounds and became one of four players to ever score 5–0–0 since the start of the tournament in the modern format in 1979.
The American Jordan Spit suffered a 5:4 defeat from the player with the lowest rating in the European team Turbiern Olesen from Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, who ranks first in the world rankings, conceded 2:1 to Jan Polter from England, who may have participated in the Ryder Cup tournament for the last time.
Spanish Sergio García, a Ryder Cup veteran who has already participated in the tournament eight times, has become the European who has won the most tournaments in all time, bringing in 25.5 points in his career.
“I usually don’t cry, but I can’t do anything today.
It was a difficult year.
I thank Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy to return the cup.
It’s the team’s merit and I’m glad I was able to help,” Garcia said, without restraining his emotions after winning in Europe.
He passes the relay to his compatriot John Rem, who defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods in a 2-1 singles game on Sunday.
“I’m incredibly proud to win over Tiger Woods, I grew up watching this guy,” Ram, 23, said in a statement.
In France, Woods lost all four matches and now has a career record for the Ryder Cup 13–21–3.
Strange stats for one of the most outstanding players of all time, who won 14 Major tournaments, beating only Jack Nicholas.
The U.S. team tried to reach the fervey zone throughout the weekend, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finnau, who showed high-end golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. Capt. Jim Furyk said of his team after an inconsolable speech: "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning we did not dominate Europe for long.
We fought.
I take off my hat in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players played very well.
We're regrouping, I'm going to work with the U.S. Golf Professionals Association and the Ryder Cup tournament committee, and we're going to move forward.
I love these 12 guys and am proud to be their captain.
You cannot fail to praise them.
We've lost."
Current information about the red tide: a decrease in concentration in the districts of Pinellas, Manat and Sarasota
The latest report by the Florida Commission on Fish and Wildlife indicates a general decline in the level of red microorganism bloom in some parts of Tampa Bay.
According to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission, the abundant flowering conditions reported in certain areas of Pinellas, Manat, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties indicate a decrease in concentration.

The red tide was also observed in Pasco County.
Last week it was reported about the average concentration in Pinellas County and in its coastal zone, the concentration from low to high in the coastal zone of Hillsboro County, the high concentration in Manat County, the high concentration in Sarasota County, the high concentration in Sarasota County and in its coastal zone.
In the districts of Pinellas, Manat, Sarasota, Lee and Collier continue to report respiratory irritation.
There were no such reports recorded in the northwest of Florida last week.
