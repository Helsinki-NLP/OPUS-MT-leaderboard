A Republican strategy to hinder Obama's re-election
Republican leaders justified their policy by the need to fight electoral fraud.
Now, the Brennan Center considers the latter a myth and claims that electoral fraud is less common in the United States than the number of people who die from the fall of a lightning bolt.
In fact, Republican lawyers have found no more than 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in ten years.
One thing is certain: those new provisions will negatively affect the participation rate.
In that sense, these measures will partially undermine the American democratic system.
Contrary to what happens in Canada, U.S. states are responsible for organizing federal elections in the United States.
And on that same line a majority of U.S. governments enacted, from 2009, new laws that made the registration or voting process difficult.
This phenomenon has spread since the November 2010 elections, which saw an increase of 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states.
Accordingly, in 2011 180 bills were introduced that restricted the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states.
The new electoral laws require voters to present an identity document with a photograph, in addition to a proof of American citizenship.
On the other hand, these laws reduce early voting periods, invalidate the right to register as an elector on the day of the poll, and withdraw their right to vote from citizens with a criminal record.
Prior to the 2006 election, no U.S. state required voters to submit a photo ID.
The state of Indiana was the first to demand it.
The Supreme Court of the United States in 2008 confirmed the constitutionality of Indiana law.
As a result, the Republican authorities rushed to extend this practice to other states.
In recent years, these authorities have supported bills in 34 states to force voters to submit a photo ID.
It is important to note that, unlike what happens in Quebec, American citizens do not have a universal identity document, such as a Social Security card.
In fact, 11% of American citizens, that is, 21 million people of voting age, do not have any photo ID issued by a government agency in their state.
On the other hand, five million new voters in 2012 lack an identity document with those characteristics.
But, often, obtaining the required identity document costs more than a hundred dollars.
As a result, the new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and low-income people.
In fact, 25% of African Americans, 15% of people earning less than $35,000 a year, 18% of citizens over the age of 65 and 20% of voters between the ages of 18 and 29 do not have a photo ID.
And there's more.
In many states, students, voters who vote most for Democratic candidates, cannot use the photo ID issued by their institution.
Moreover, these same states allow members of fishing or hunting clubs who usually vote for Republican parties to use the documents issued by such clubs.
Prior to 2004, no state required the citizenship test to vote.
Arizona was the first state to make such a demand.
Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws requiring voters to prove they are American citizens.
These measures clearly seek to limit the Hispanic vote.
It seems that two out of three Hispanic voters support the Democratic Party.
On the other hand, Republican lawmakers backed in 2011 certain laws that abolished voter registration on the same day of the election in eight states.
In addition, they limited the right of individuals and groups to create a support service for voters who wish to register.
These restrictions have consequences.
For example, in the 2004 general election, voter registration campaigns contributed to the registration of about 10 million citizens.
Measures taken since 2009 have resulted in the registration rate of new voters falling in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican lawmakers passed laws in five other states that favored the reduction of the early voting period.
For example, in the 2008 Florida election, 33% of voters who voted in advance were African Americans, while the latter represented only 13% of the state’s voters.
In the case of the Hispanics, the same thing happened.
These represent only 11% of the electorate, which is equivalent to 24% of the citizens who vote in advance.
However, whites, who represent 76% of the electorate, represent only 46% of citizens who vote in advance.
Of course, Democratic lawmakers and their supporters have vehemently opposed the adoption of laws restricting voter registration.
In this regard, the Democratic governors have blocked several bills.
The U.S. Attorney General intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
In part, the damage could be limited.
For example, only 16 out of 34 states passed the law requiring the presentation of an identity document with a photograph.
However, it is undeniable that the new rules adopted will complicate the exercise of the right to vote in 2012.
Democrat critics denounce the partisan nature of the laws that have been voted on, as it is clear that they are intended to influence 2012 results in key states.
A 2011 report from the Brennan Center shows that states that have passed such laws represent 171 of the 270 votes needed in the electoral college to achieve the presidency.
It is too early to say for certain whether these legislative changes to the electoral system will have a significant impact on the results of the 2012 presidential election.
One thing is certain: those new provisions will negatively affect the participation rate.
In this sense, the measures will partially undermine the American democratic system.
Prostate Cancer Screening: Doing the Test or Not?
In fact, the PSA test sometimes presents erroneous results, with false negative results or even false positive results, after which it is decided to perform useless medical interventions.
It’s a reason more than enough to make men, already reluctant on their own, doubt whether or not screening tests should be done.
To take the test or not?
We asked for advice from two experts.
In studies conducted in the United States, a high rate of contagion was detected among the sample groups, making it difficult to interpret those data and make firm recommendations.
For its part, the European study showed some difference in mortality between patients who had been screened and those who did not.
The study, with a follow-up of 12 years, also showed that there is between 30 and 40% chance of metastasis if the detection test has not been performed.
I therefore recommend the test from the age of 50, or from the age of 40 if your father has suffered from prostate cancer.
African-American men have a higher risk index.
The key is to make a good decision once the cancer is detected.
There are aggressive cancers and other cancers that are indolent.
It is really necessary to get the patient to understand the degree of risk of their cancer. They should be offered all possible options and not necessarily treat prostate cancers that do not threaten long-term life, in which case an active surveillance of the disease should be chosen instead.
Today, many men who have been diagnosed with cancer are not treated, since this cancer is not aggressive and does not pose a risk to their lives.
Instead, we suggest an active monitoring of the disease and, if it progresses, we offer treatment.
We increasingly determine precise criteria for deciding who should or should not be treated.
I recommend that the test be done in any case.
But it is important that you talk to your doctor to determine if the test should be done or not.
Movember has created, in collaboration with the International Society of Urology, a tool that allows you to evaluate the pros and cons of the PSA test.

Preventing the disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle recipe to prevent cancer.
Despite research progress, adopting healthy lifestyles remains the best way to reduce the risk of disease.
We estimate that if everyone ate well and moved enough, 30% of cancers could be prevented.
“If no one smoked, that rate would rise to at least 50%,” said André Beaulieu, a spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.
Instead, we assess that about 10% of cancers are hereditary.
Many others remain completely inexplicable.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against smoking remains a priority despite the decrease in the number of smokers.
Tobacco is linked to 85% of lung cancer cases.
It is also a risk factor for other types of cancer.
It greatly harms people’s health.
“Today, there are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec,” said spokesman André Beaulieu.
A promising fact: 10 years after quitting smoking, the risk of dying from cancer is halved.
The weight
Fat and obesity also favor the onset of the disease, according to the SCC.
They increase the risk of breast, colon and rectal cancers, esophagus, pancreas and uterus.
“Research shows that regular practice of lifelong physical activity protects against breast cancer,” they add.
The Food
The body also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In large quantities, they escalate the risks of colorectal cancer.
Carrot products should also be avoided.
Preserving meat for smoking, drying or salting can cause the formation of carcinogenic substances.
“They can damage the body’s cells and lead to the development of cancer,” they explain.
The Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the links between vitamin complexes and cancer.
However, at the moment their investigations are not conclusive.
According to the SCC, studies on vitamin E are contradictory.
While in one of them there was a decrease in the risk of prostate cancer, in another what was observed was, rather, an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has also not been clearly determined.
On the other hand, M. Beaulieu insists on the importance of talking about each person’s concerns and family background with their doctor.
"Making the screening test does not cause cancer."
The Higgs boson in detail
The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs boson generated a great shock last summer, and rightly so.
It is believed, in fact, that this boson is part of the mechanism responsible for the mass of everything that exists in the universe, nothing more and nothing less.
And what is more, it is the particle whose existence the standard model predicted: our best or "less bad" explanation of the nature and behavior of matter, which has not yet been observed empirically.
But for physicists it is not entirely clear that it is Higgs.
We know without a doubt that there is a new particle and that it is very similar to the Higgs boson predicted by the standard model.
In addition, new data revealed this week at a major physics congress held in Kyoto seems to confirm that it is, although more data is still missing to be completely sure.
Anyway, we assume that this is Higgs, as the chances of making a mistake seem small. We will see what it is.
There is, in this great world, a generalized and inevitable law which implies that two things cannot be found in the same place at the same time.
There’s no way to break that rule and don’t try too hard, because you’ll end up hurting yourself.
Although particle physics is a very complex world, it has been shown that there is also in it a law of these characteristics: Pauli's principle of exclusion, which stipulates that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state"; a "state" that consists, grossly speaking, of some of its characteristics.
Physicists classify particles into two categories.
On the one hand we find good citizens called fermions, who wisely obey Pauli’s principle.
And then there are the bosons, a dirty panda of anarchists who have no respect for anything, or at least not for this principle, which means they can be found in the same place and at the same time.
According to the Berkeley Laboratories’ website Particle Adventure, which is by the way extraordinary, bosons are divided into two groups: the mesons, which we won’t talk about here, and the “force particles,” by which the great forces of nature propagate and with which the Higgs boson would somehow be related.
These bosons, I should point out here, are not the exotic bugs we could believe.
In fact, if you manage to read this chronicle, it is thanks to an extraordinarily banal boson: the photon or "light particle" that acts as a "messager" of the electromagnetic force.
Indeed, when a particle with an electric charge accelerates or changes direction, it "disorders" the electromagnetic field in that precise environment; a little like when we throw a stone at a pond.
In this "disorder" an electromagnetic wave (of light, infrared, ultraviolet, etc.) is born, and this wave is nothing but a photon; that is, one of the bosons "carrying force".
More stable field
The same happens with the Higgs boson, with the difference that it is another field, the Higgs field, which needs to be "disordered" for this boson to appear.
However, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field and requires extremely high energies to activate it, as if it were an icy pond in which only a thick rock could slide over the surface.
That’s why it takes a huge particle accelerator like CERN (the great hadron collider is a 27 km ring in circumference!) to reach such energy levels.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is a new tool that explains the relationship between Higgs and mass.
In fact, not all particles or materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do, but others do not: a piece of paper, for example, will never stick to the door of a refrigerator by itself.
And in the same way, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those that do have a mass, while the rest (like the photon, by the way) do not.
Now, what "can" all these investigations bring? asks Mrs Plamondon.
For science, this serves to verify the validity of the standard model (MS), and also allows physicists to examine the differences between observations and predictions of MS.
For their part, many fervently desire to find themselves, for the slightest difference could open a door to a "new physics" that covers certain holes in the model.
This, it must be said, still has enormous deficiencies, as it does not propose any explanation regarding gravity (ups!) or dark matter, which makes up about 80% of the matter in the Universe (other ups!).
But we haven’t found such differences at CERN so far.
Repercussions
The repercussions of such research in our day-to-day life are difficult to predict, but we don’t think we’re wrong to say that it won’t have any.
In the early 1960s, laser pioneers in laboratories had no idea what a revolution their work would bring.
They saw the scientific applications, but nothing more.
In fact, as physicist Willard Boyle, who worked in Bell laboratories, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who developed the first continuous laser (the first were pulsed) in 1962, at first the laser was rather considered a "laboratory apparatus."
You can imagine...
In addition, the applications can also come from all the instrumentation surrounding the research.
For example, Willard Boyle himself developed a light pickup in 1969 in the course of his research on optics.
Although it was not his original intention at all, this pickup now serves as an “eye” for all digital devices in the world, which earned him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2009.
That doesn’t mean, of course, that LHC activities necessarily want to transform our lives, but that you never know...
Palliative care. The best way to die... <0x7C> Le Devoir
In his Commission Dying in Dignity, Quebec recently debated the delicate issue of the end of life.
The debate should resume soon as a bill is being prepared.
Now, within that essential domain, there is still a lot to do.
Le Devoir has tried to see him closely.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. lived alone in his apartment in La Montérégie.
The prostate cancer that was destroying him had given him a two-year respite.
"I had been given five years of life, but I've been like this for seven years," he says, passing by, lying in his bed in the Victor-Gadbois palliative care center in Beloeil, to which he arrived the day before.
“But it’s always a shock, we can’t be prepared for this,” he continues.
The disease has caused him ravages: a huge weakness that prevents him from going to the bathroom alone and even eating on his own.
Sitting in front of an appetizing lunch, he accepts resigned that they help him eat.
Courageous, he even comes to smile, to talk to strangers who pay attention to him, bring him medicines and offer him a bath.
The Courage of Ordinary Death.
"My biggest wish is for diarrhea to be cured, it's humiliating," she confesses.
A few hours later, the team found a remedy to that evil.
“Over the course of our lives we learn that a man pees on his feet,” says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois Center.
Returning to your childhood, for certain people, is an unacceptable humiliation.
“That depends on the person’s ability to accept that regression,” he notes.
Because, in the opinion of most people working in palliative care, great moments take place at the very heart of that regression.
All patients entering the Victor-Gadbois palliative care center have cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
In that state, the team of doctors and nurses around them no longer offer "healing" care.
Ms. A.’s greatest fear, 89, is to die “consciously and drowned.”
But the disease has made her discover her children.
“I have good kids,” he adds.
“I have no more desires in this life,” she says, before accepting a mask to help her breathe.
And in the coming days, he expects a last visit from his son who lives in Italy.
In Victor-Gadbois, a group of volunteers are offered body care and nutrition assistance.
They are palliative care that is given to them when nothing else can be done.
To help make his death more comfortable.
In Quebec we have a palliative care bed for every 11,700 inhabitants.
It's very little, because we all know we'll end up dying someday.
Here, life continues in the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the center.
Whether at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
The dying person is offered mouthwashes with brandy or Pepsi, according to the lawsuit.
Diabetics are no longer controlled on their sugar levels.
Death is part of everyday life.
Last night we served a beer to Mr. X, who died overnight.
This morning, his son finished the beer at the feet of the deceased.
“We help both patients and their loved ones,” says Nathalie Savard, director of care.
In the center of Victor-Gadbois the days pass without ever being the same.
Alongside a 94-year-old man who enjoys his last family reunion in the yard, well placed between his pillows while everyone drinks to his health, a 36-year-old tragically dies, surrounded by his parents, his wife and his two children, after trying everything to survive.
“For six months, there have always been three to five beds occupied by people under 45 who have cancer,” Dr. Christiane Martel said.
53% of patients admitted to the Victor-Gadboisarrivent center come from their home and 47% from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, that is, care designed to alleviate suffering when a patient reaches the terminal stage of their life, whether at home, in the hospital or in a care center.
And several agencies, such as the Victor-Gadbois Center and the Grand Montréal Home Palliative Care Society, specialize almost exclusively in the care of cancer patients.
It is precisely this great relative deficiency in Quebec’s health care that causes many doctors specializing in palliative care to fear the adoption of a law that regulates euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto signed by eminences of palliative care, such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, has been circulating to demonstrate their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, Quebec’s health care system is not competent enough to ensure that anyone is entitled to quality palliative care before accepting to proceed with euthanasia.
“Recently,” he relates, “I’ve seen a patient spend 14 days in the emergency room suffering great pains without having done what was necessary to relieve her.
I’m afraid patients want to die just because they don’t get the proper care.”
And at the same time, many oncologists persist with their patients until the last day, despite the worst prognosis.
Hélène Richard’s survival hopes were already low when she left a exhausting chemotherapy treatment.
“When I told my oncologist that I wanted to stop the treatment, she told me that she was very sorry that I wanted to stop fighting,” she says.
"However, she had told me there was nothing else to do!"
There is no all-powerful care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who apply to die thank their caregivers for not attending to their demands once their pain has been relieved thanks to a palliative care team.
But it must be said that palliative care is not absolutely all-powerful in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of home palliative care at Grand Montréal, patients do not respond to pain treatments in 8% of cases.
At the end of life, doctors usually resort to palliative sedation, which serves to sleep the patient until the moment of his death, either sporadically or permanently.
We cannot pretend that we do not understand that part of suffering.
More and more, the unrelieved disease will have the possibility of having that palliative sedation.
The sick who are not relieved all say the same thing: “I want to die.”
But that doesn’t necessarily mean “I want euthanasia,” but “I want to be relieved.”
This report has been made possible by a journalism scholarship from Canada’s health research institutes.
Extensive Real Estate Scandals in Quebec
Officials of the road network, BTP entrepreneurs, fundraisers of political parties and specialists of the Italian mafia tell, day after day, what they know of a formidable "system", of which the construction industry is part, officials, politicians, unionists and mafiosi.
An “industry” that came out too expensive for Quebec taxpayers, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
“It’s curious how the system pulverizes once we’ve hunted the mainstream media,” said Jacques Duchesneau, a Quebec MP and former Montreal Police Chief.
He led the outbreak of the scandal in 2011, which was made possible thanks to a thorough investigation into road contract malversations in Quebec, which then-Liberal Prime Minister Jean Charest had only agreed to delay.
The "Duchesneau Report" established a direct link between industry, clandestine party funding and corruption among officials.
“Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010, only the Ministry of Transportation would have saved $1 billion in contracts,” containing some of its instincts to stay with a proportional share.
The Charbonneau Commission “has already dropped two mayors,” he adds, while hoping to come to “demonstrate the existing stratagems behind the individuals.”
A permanent anti-corruption unit, created in 2011
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, created in 2011, is also applied with its team of government interventionists, researchers and analysts.
This unit works in addition to the police of the "Marteau squad", which, since 2009, have made the Montreal "sewer cartel" moderate when it comes to inflating contracts.
In recent weeks, the unit has proceeded to register in series allegations of fraud and corruption against municipal charges such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, the mayor of a city outside.
The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned as mayor of Laval, Quebec’s third city.
It is suspected that repeated bribes have been pocketed in exchange for public contracts.
It has formally indicted Montreal road network engineers and entrepreneurs of Italian origin, such as Tony Accuro and Lino Zambito.
The latter has caused shock when explaining to the commission the mechanics of the "system" of obtaining public contracts.
He himself paid for three years 3% of the value of contracts obtained in Montreal to a mafia-linked intermediary who transferred the money to Union Montréal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
Mr. Zambito distributed money right and wrong during the 2000s, awarding more than $88,000 to provincial parties, especially the ruling liberals.
He also admitted to having organized an illegal fundraising campaign for former deputy prime minister, Nathalie Normandeau.
Inflation of the cost of sewerage contracts
In Montreal, the “system” of corruption worked effectively.
Gilles Surprisant, a former public works engineer, explained this perfectly before the commission: in ten years he received gifts, travel invitations, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey matches and bribes from construction companies for a total of $736,000, all in exchange for sewerage contracts whose costs inflated.
Other road network officials have admitted they received money for inflating bills between 30 and 40 percent in terms of fake extras.
In addition, a mayor’s party organizer, Martin Dumont, accused Tremblay of deliberately staring at a parallel budget and filled his coffers with dirty money.
Following these revelations, Tremblay resigned in early November and led Montreal into a massive crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first elected politicians in Montreal to sound the alarm.
As mayor of the Rivière-des-Prairies district in the east of the island, she has been opposed since 2010 to the sale of municipal land acquired for $5 million and resold for $1.6 million to promoters in the midst of a real estate boom.
70% of election campaign money was dirty money.
Of the investigation that will finally be carried out, she says she pulls "a thread to be able to understand the functioning of the system, infiltrated by ants, to stop the gangrene and catch the culprits."
And he adds that the process is “painful, but positive.”
We are cleaning the wounds but it would take a clean research unit in Montreal and be very vigilant so that dubious practices do not repeat themselves.
How to do the cleaning.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau, for his part, declares that "the officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars", but is concerned above all about the role of the "politicians elected to the current of the stratagem".
Estimating at 70% the proportion of dirty money that went to funding election campaigns in Quebec, he ironically: “I’ve been told that’s just a pale reflection of reality.”
The Quebec government proposes to limit party donations to $100, but that will not change the donation, he said, "as long as electoral spending is not strictly limited, there will be dirty money in politics."
He advocates a complete review of the system of awarding public contracts and financing of the parties: "we can not fall lower; going to the bottom of things, with courage, will allow us to rebuild the house with more solid foundations, with more controls and laws."
If this story blurs the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau invites those who laugh to look in the mirror.
"PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
This season he has acquired a new entity with PSG.
How would you explain that advancement?
It could be explained by individual awareness, but also by the new dimension of PSG.
Great players have arrived.
Advancement day by day by your side.
The technical staff also contributed a lot to me.
And those elements push me daily to raise the level of my game.
In a game, that’s easier.
Everything goes very fast in football.
But they don't keep me warm.
From my beginnings at the INF Clairefontaine pre-training centre to my passage through Saint-Etienne, I have always progressed to gigantic steps.
You will benefit from the competition recruited by Carlo Ancelotti.
This summer’s recruits are accustomed to playing very high-level matches.
They know that every training is crucial.
That makes a player like me want to fight and give it all.
On the other hand, Carlo Ancelotti contributes a lot to me in terms of my positioning.
He is backed by deputies like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the man who needed the team?
Of course I do.
Ancelotti inspires respect to all technicians.
Today, there is no equal in League 1 and he is among the best European coaches.
He has great experience and has won numerous titles with the best clubs.
He has worked with great players.
I think there will be other titles in Paris.
In January I had a very comforting conversation with him.
I just got out of a series of injuries.
The confidence you have in me also explains my good performance.
What do you think of PSG in the first half of the season?
In League 1, Lyon has taken away our position of leader.
But we're still in the ambush.
One of our biggest goals is the Champions League: we have qualified for the finals in style.
What is the goal of the club in this competition?
We will try to get as far away as possible.
From now on, anything can happen.
But we have a lot to say in front of many very good European teams.
We want, to begin, to finish the first of our league against Porto in order to be able to receive the round of eights final.
Can PSG become a major European club in the short term?
You already have the budget...
To become a great European club, Paris has to win titles and be there in the long run.
Today, that is not the case.
At the economic level, PSG is committed to its means for that project to come to fruition.
Not winning the cup in League 1, as last season, would it be a big failure?
Of course, it would be a big disappointment.
This year we are going to invest all our efforts in bringing us that title of champion.
Last season we didn’t get far.
In May we took a disappointment, as we had the optimal conditions to finish first.
We had a strong season.
We finished with 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points we should have been champions...
But another team, Montpellier, had a much better season.
This year I think it will be the good one.
Even if big teams like Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux are fighting for the title, I think we have the weapons to take it.
Do you think the media expects more from PSG?
It is normal that they expect a lot from us if we think about what has been invested in the players we have.
We totally accepted it.
After we won 4-0 at home to Troyes, they still find things to blame is a bit frustrating.
We wonder what else people are waiting for.
We can never win 4-0 every weekend.
We are not FC Barcelona.
We are trying to start a game project.
A team is built over time.
In the Champions League we have shown that we can respond and be present.
Look at Manchester City which, after two seasons, has failed to qualify for the finals, and they have also invested a lot!
In view of the amounts invested, we would imagine you with 15 points of advantage to the day.
That would be neglecting our opponents and the French championship.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not well last season, have been "driven" by this new PSG.
That proves that League 1 is exciting.
I hope that in May we can say with a smile that, despite all the difficulties, we have ended up taking the trophy.
PSG seems totally dependent on the successes of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
It's better to say we have a "Zlatandependence."
That means that Ibrahimovic is very competent and scores many goals.
He has come to prove that he is the League 1 star.
And he has shown in all the teams he has gone through that he is a great player, a world star.
In the group we respect the man and the player.
And he also respects the men he has around him.
What he has done is truly exceptional.
That pushes others to increase their level of play.
Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders in the world, also allows us to make progress.
How did you experience the Euro 2012 with the French team?
It's been a disappointment.
I was very excited to participate in this European Cup.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from accumulating game time.
I saw things there and came out reinforced.
Today I manage to play good games in the selection.
That's what I've been waiting for since my baptism with the blues.
We have learned a lesson from what happened in Ukraine, and that is why we have an exemplary behaviour today.
What do you think of Didier Deschamps’ first month at the front of the blues?
He's getting results.
They are well placed in the qualifying group for the World Cup.
The selector is rigorous, close to the players and inspires to win.
As was the case with Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to make comparisons.
Blanc achieved his goal of qualifying us for the European Cup.
I hope Didier Deschamps takes the team to Brazil.
Did the draw (1-1) of October 16 in Spain serve to lay the groundwork?
That game gave us confidence.
Everyone fought for everyone.
Before that shock in Spain, I had never experienced a game like this in my entire career.
With Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks
Contrary to current monetary exchanges, based on central banks, identified transactions and processing burdens between the parties.
Moreover, as is often the case in technology, the political vision is palpable: the conviction that the current monetary system, composed of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a virtual currency convertible to dollars, euros, etc. and a secure exchange protocol in the manner of BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of files on an equal footing.
Nearly 200,000 transactions have been recorded thanks to 15,000 computers on the network.
And about a thousand websites accept bitcoins as donations or as a means of payment.
Bitcoin’s price, after peaking at $30 (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>23) in June 2011, dropped to $2 five months later, before rebounding to around $10 today (quotes are censored on bitcoincharts.com).
It’s nothing impressive if we compare it to global changes in real currency or in financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) was interested in him in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
In it, bitcoin was described as "the most successful virtual currency", "competiting with the dollar or the euro" and "similar to conventional currencies".
Bitcoin differs from other systems with types of virtual currencies such as "credits", used to advance in a video game and that can be won by playing or can be bought (and even sometimes redeemed).
The social network Facebook also developed this type of system.
But in every exchange a central authority controls and handles changes.
With bitcoin, all network nodes are both bookkeepers, checkers, currency issuers, and buyers and sellers.
How does that network work?
Each transaction between two users is actually made between two email addresses.
A user can choose a different address for each payment, thus guaranteeing anonymity.
A set of information linked to this transaction is electronically signed through a dual-key encryption system.
The network can thus verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the contents of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the changes of bitcoins are recorded in the public ledger, which is disseminated throughout the network.
The key milestone is to write that new transaction in that book.
This goes through the resolution of a mathematical challenge launched to the computers and the winner, a sort of provisional central banker, will have the privilege of adding that complementary line.
This is a file fragmentation phase, i.e. the transformation of a large file into a shorter and unique numerical footprint.
The computers "catch" the new transaction and add a number before "switching" the set.
The goal is to find the number that offers a particular footprint (more zeros at the beginning).
Once that number is found, the other nodes easily verify that it is the good one.
The transaction is then indestructibly linked to the chain of sets of the other transactions; any modification would change the footprint.
If, to commit a fraud, a user would like to pay twice with the same money very quickly (in less than ten minutes), the network would only accept as valid one of the two transactions; the other would remain orphaned, as both have different footprints.
The computer that solves the challenge takes 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, that reward is divided into two on a regular basis, probably before the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divisible by one hundred millionth, leaving a wide margin.
The difficulty of this challenge is also revealed in each increase in computing power.
The life of the network already has its ups and downs.
Websites that offer services for Bitcoin have been attacked and deposited bitcoins have been stolen.
“The failure used does not affect the same protocol,” says Pierre Noizat, who has just launched Paymium, a real-currency payment company that uses the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also considers the possibility of money laundering thanks to this anonymous service.
But cash has the same flaw.
Weight-loss actors like Wikipedia reject such payments.
Others, like the WordPress platform, accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, from the Weizmann Institute in Israel, analyzed the book and showed that about 80% of bitcoins do not circulate.
In November, the “giant discounts” were launched.
“They exchanged $30,000,” Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, who turns bitcoins into gold, exults.
Pierre Noizat, author of a pedagogical book on this coin, believes strongly in the potential of this technology as well as in the network of transactions.
Their system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real currency) or a contactless mobile payment, but uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, which thus come out cheaper.
The bearer also manages his identity and can therefore remain anonymous.
The system is easy to run in stores, which do not have to install new terminals or software.
They just need to provide an address that a phone can “photograph and recognize,” says Pierre Noizat, who claims to have thousands of users.
There is a general movement of revision of hierarchical systems by more horizontal systems.
“It will take some time for Bitcoin to impose itself, but in 2013 there could be a change,” he predicts.
Moreover, in its report, the ECB envisages re-evaluating the various risks, today considered high, if this currency is successful.
We came out of Afghanistan.
What about afterwards?
French troops abandoned their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the Americans are due to leave by the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to regain possession of its territory and for the Afghans to choose their future, without expecting anything from us.
We have punished above all the Afghan peasants, whom we have considered terrorists.
And to ourselves, with our 88 soldiers killed, plus the wounded and the mutilated.
The Taliban have foreign extremists and former refugee chiefs in Pakistan, but often also peasants who reject the presence of the foreign army, as in Soviet times.
They want to defend their ancient and archaic traditions, even if their causes are joined by jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks or Tajiks.
Tolerated, sometimes even helped by local insurgents, these will no longer be when Westerners become more discreet.
The departure of the French troops from the Nijrab base, which I observed from the top of the hills planted with almonds thanks to the French credits, was done by order.
The convoys of trucks and tanks returned to Kabul without suffering any attack, guarded by helicopters.
There will be no Taliban influx in Kabul from the end of 2014.
Circumstances have changed since their irresistible advance between 1994 and 1996.
Kabul was then empty and the country wrapped in fire and blood because of fighting between different factions.
Their takeover of the country had been perceived as a kind of liberation, a return to security.
The Afghans have paid the price of the obscurantism of their peasants outnumbered by the al-Qaeda organization, but their situation is not better today.
The old Mujahideen, the current government and the current Taliban share the desire to keep women in a lower position.
The main figures of the anti-Soviet war came back to power in 2001.
They have become speculators, making use of government land to resell it as land for refugees who have returned from Iran and Pakistan, benefiting alongside huge U.S. subcontracting contracts.
They are discredited; most of them have not fought.
People, as I have heard in the countryside, aspire to a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as will those who have been able to take advantage of American generosity: the capital flight is considerable.
Young people are tired of war and its ideologies.
They have lived the modern world during their exiles in Iran or Pakistan and have appreciated its advantages.
With about 65% of its population under the age of 25, Kabul currently has 5 million inhabitants, a fifth of the total population.
In cities, state schools are full of both girls and boys.
It will be necessary to give work to those young people who will not want to return to the obscurantism of the old parties or to the corruption of certain leaders.
Everyone, including the armed opposition, is eager for mobile phones. Television and its Turkish pamphlets presenting a modern world has great admirers throughout the country.
The army is now present.
Will the authorities that want to run the country be considered legitimate?
The former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already concerned about reconstituting the provincial militias, which will flee from central power.
Afghanistan, a mountainous country with strong local identities, should be able to benefit from some decentralization in the image of Western nations, but the United States has wanted to transform it into a centralized state, with a strong presidential power, suppressing the post of prime minister that existed since the 1964 Constitution.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, particularly because of the elections scheduled for April 2014.
However, your country has been dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and even before.
No industry has re-established its services, no reservoirs have been fixed, and important irrigation systems have been repaired.
Everything is imported and nothing is produced except fruits and vegetables.
The priority is left to the private initiative.
In a country ruined after 30 years of war, government control would have been necessary.
The rumor spread that Afghanistan possessed immense mining wealth.
And that only increased the feeling that the Westerners were there to seize them.
Without energy to extract iron or copper minerals from the ground and without means of transport to export them through the mountains, there is no mining.
The Chinese have almost abandoned the copper mines of Aynak Month, allowing international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) to dig up the immense Buddhist site and remain there as the province’s most important employers.
Afghanistan and Pakistan, a country on which imports and exports are largely dependent, will also need to restore their normal relations.
The French troops departed on 20 November.
The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aid: girls' schools, children's schools, a French department at the university, the French Institute, military, legal, health and agricultural cooperation and support to the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, in order to try to "win hearts and spirits" and to carry out the impossible task of making aid and offensive actions coincide, a service of "civil and military actions" of the Ministry of Defense (Cimic), suppressed in 2012, brought and made bring through a small French agricultural NGO numerous works of local interest to collective rehabilitation.
Those works, greedy for local labor, have been able to help contain the insurgency: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, sun protection and increasing crop surfaces.
What will we leave as a memory after two million euros of military spending?
A rather modest budget will contribute to the improvement of local living conditions, which are very harsh in those valleys that are often over 2,000 meters high.
The embassy received dozens of written demands with small agricultural proposals made by local communities in the province of Kapisa.
In order for them to be freed from the insurrection carried out by foreign groups, something that farmers have told me they want, it would be necessary to maintain a small, well-controlled and direct civil aid.
A Constitution with Forceps in Egypt
It is a new double or nothing from President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt is more divided than ever in terms of the constitutional declaration, which gives it provisionally full powers, he decided to play the whole for the whole.
He took everyone by surprise Wednesday, when he announced that the Constituent Assembly would vote on its final text the next day.
Just a week ago, the head of state had given the Assembly two more months to finish its work.
And for almost two years, Egypt has been using a provisional text, several times modified, which weakens institutional stability and leads to judicial clutter.
This new initiative has only increased the fracture in the country.
For his opponents, the president perseveres in his “autocratic delusion” and continues to “betray his word” and “stomp the law.”
It is said by its supporters that this is a measure to put an end to the institutional and political crisis more quickly and to accelerate the transition process.
A referendum should be held in the next 15 days.
A very short period of time that forces the Brothers to renounce their project of explaining the text, article by article, to the Egyptians.
For the president, it’s also a way to regain popular and democratic legitimacy while the controversy is wreaking havoc across the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote in his favor, as he stated in an interview with the American weekly Time.
Considering that this resource has been voted very quickly, it contains an ultimatum for the Egyptian people: "either they vote my text or I maintain the full powers", powers that are supposed to come to an end with the adoption of the Constitution.
It is in that strange environment that 85 members of this Constituent Assembly, Islamist in its overwhelming majority, voted on the text yesterday.
Most liberals did not attend the call.
By mid-November, just before the constitutional declaration, they had closed the door because they felt they could not assert their views.
Representatives of human rights, religious minorities and civil society did the same.
In order to achieve the necessary quorum, 11 people, substitute members, were added yesterday morning in a hurry.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
As expected, the articles voted unanimously.
The commentators find it funny, on the other hand, that one of the few discrepancies of the day was practically expressed at the time of prayer, so much so that several members of the committee came to think that the watch of the Constituent was wrong.
The text, which was still being voted on late yesterday, consists of 234 articles.
Article 2, the object of all views, remains ultimately identical to that of the 1971 Constitution, which stipulated that "the principles of Sharia constitute the main source of law".
Salafist parties, for whom the establishment of Islamic law is a fundamental claim, expected that "principles" could be replaced by "norms", which would have allowed for stricter application.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been modified is a guarantee of their goodwill and respect for the other components of Egyptian society.
Liberals smear it with hypocrisy and consider it to be nothing more than an advertising ploy.
According to them, the Islamization of the Constitution is done through other articles.
They refer, in particular, to article 220, which confers on Al-Azhar University an advisory role, in particular for anyone who has to confirm their compliance with Sharia law.
According to Egypt specialist Sophie Pommier, it is disturbing because "people called to speak out are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
Here we see the premises of a theocracy.”
The fears of the liberals are also heightened by the fact that the next rector of such a university would be much less moderate than the current one.
“At the moment, there is no concrete religious implication.
With this Constitution we are within the framework of the civil status.
Most of the jurists who have been working on this text are not ulemas but university students, some of them trained in the French system,” explains Alexis Blouet, who is preparing a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he acknowledges that there may be some ambiguity around article 220, since the terms used mimic the religious vocabulary.
"We refer specifically to the term iqh [Islamic jurisprudence, ndlr].
And the question that might arise in the future would be to what extent the civil judges are competent to rule above all this.”
Beyond its religious character, the text voted yesterday has received many criticisms that refer to the extended powers it confers on the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood will claim that they are few compared to those they were during the previous regime.
Another conflicting point: the powers conferred on the army.
According to the wishes of the military, the revision of the defence budget will not be submitted to Parliament, but to a national defense council.
Neither will prosecuting civilians in military courts, as requested by human rights associations.
These also showed their concerns about the text, which they consider libertarian.
The crime of blasphemy continues and, henceforth, insults are prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, especially that of the press.
In addition, no article emphasizes the protection of women, underlines Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive thing was the prohibition of torture under article 36.
The word was not in the previous constitution.
Although the Egyptian president was due to go on television last night, demonstrations are planned for this afternoon.
Supporters of the head of state protested on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists await the Holy Land, the navel of the world and a sea of brine
The Promised Land combines the majesty of biblical truths with modern comfort and pristine nature.
"AIF" identified the five most important reasons why Israel should be visited.
Reverence in the Holy Land
It is worth visiting the Jordan River where Jesus was baptized.
It is believed that anyone who enters this “baptismal cell” will receive divine grace.
And Galilee, the place of the miracles of Jesus: the conversion of water into wine at the wedding, walking on the waters, the appeasement of the storm and the nets full.
In this very place, Jesus appeared to His disciples after the resurrection.
Most of the holy places are in Jerusalem.
Believers here walk the Viacrucis or the Way of the Cross of Jesus (Latin "Painful Way").
It starts at the Fortress of Antonio, the Pretorium, where the judgment was carried out, and continues through the streets of the Old City, goes to the Holy Sepulchre on Mount Golgotha, the place of crucifixion, to the Stone of Anointing and to the place of burial of Jesus.
In this same place is also the symbolic Christian Umbilicalum of the world, which symbolizes the salvation of humanity.
And the monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem, built in the place where, according to a Christian legend, there was a tree from which the cross was made for the crucifixion of Jesus.
In Jerusalem is also the most sacred place for the Jews, the Wall of Lamentations; the remains of a temple destroyed by the Romans in AD 70.
As is tradition, people of different religions leave here notes with their desires, which will then come true.
Making a vertical journey
The ruins of the Masada Fortress were what remained of a secret refuge against the enemies, which Herod the Great ordered to be built in 25 BC for his family.
They are located in the mountain cliffs at an altitude of 450 m above sea level.
And to get there by their own means, can only those who dedicate themselves to climbing.
Others can reach this historic summit on the funicular.
And in the north of the country at an altitude of 1600-2040 m is the famous Hermón ski resort, where in the winter months there is a large influx of tourists.
From there, bus services are offered from the foot of the hill.
The total length of the ski slopes is 45 km.
According to an ancient legend, on the top of the mountain supposedly inhabited pagan gods.
Visiting unique museums
There are about 300 museums in this country.
In one trip you will not be able to visit them all.
But it is worth visiting at least five of them, the most interesting.
Among them is the Museum of Israel, located near the Knesset (Israeli Parliament).
In it are preserved the ancient Dead Sea Manuscripts or Qumran Rolls, discovered in the caves of the Judean desert, and about 500,000 archaeological and anthropological pieces.
It is worth visiting the Tel Aviv Museum of Art.
In his exhibition of paintings he has paintings by Impressionists and Expressionists such as Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall or Picasso.
In Acre you can visit the museum-bath Al Basha, which are some rooms of ancient Turkish baths with model figures of visitors and bathers of that time.
In Caesarea it is worth visiting the exclusive private museum Ralli, where you can admire the sculptures of Rodin and Dalí.
There are no tourist guides or souvenir shops.
Admission is free, and donations are categorically not accepted.
The fifth, the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, shows one of the most dramatic pages in history.
The most tragic section is the Children’s Memorial, built in memory of the 1.5 million children killed in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You enter it and you find yourself in absolute darkness.
The stars are shining.
And the names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they lost their lives.
Ukraine is also mentioned.
Healthy
The three main tourist areas of Israel are located on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
In each of them there are swimming pools, water parks, dolphins and oceanographic museums.
It is curious that in the Red Sea they bathe even in the winter months, since the water temperature does not drop by 21 degrees and the air is heated to 23 degrees.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and there they bathe all year round.
By the way, this sea, the most extraordinary in the world, is at the lowest point on the planet: 417 m below sea level.
The blue waters there are a brine that easily sustain even those who cannot swim.
The surrounding landscapes are truly beautiful.
People come here to take courses of treatment with salt water, brine and healing muds and strengthen their health in cases of dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes and to put in order their broken nerves.
Touching the Mysteries of Antiquity
They are preserved in the ancient part of Tel Aviv, the citadel of Jaffa, on the Mediterranean coast.
Through it passed the famous sea route that united Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, it was here that Noah built his ark and Perseus rescued the beautiful Andromeda with whom, in this same place, he led a long and happy life.
Tourists love to walk through the narrow streets that bear the names of the signs of the zodiac.
They say that if you touch the walls on the street of your "self" symbol, fortune will be favorable to you.
In Jaffa you can find newly married couples who come from all over Israel, and even from other countries to photograph.
And in Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can stroll through the Roman theater, "take" the fortress of the Crusaders.
In Roman times, Caesarea was the main city of Judea and the residence of Roman procurators, including Pontius Pilate.
The theatre, carefully restored, is now used for night concerts and opera shows.
Tourists remember
If you travel to Israel, don’t worry if your English leaves much to be desired: in this country about 30% of the population speaks Russian.
The money for this trip is not recommended to take it in euros, but in dollars, which can be easily changed to shekels (currently 1-3$,8 shekels).
Urban transport consists mainly of buses, but in Jerusalem there is a fast tram and in Haifa there is the only metro line in the country, which consists of six stations and connects the Lower City with the Higher City.
Actually, it's an underground funicular.
Traveling on any type of public transport costs 6 shekels and for this price you can travel by transshipment for 1.5 hours.
In Israel, according to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is celebrated on the Sabbath.
From Friday night until sunset on Saturday, markets and shops close and public transport disrupts their work.
But on Sunday morning a new working week begins.
In many cafes, restaurants and hotels only kosher food is served, excluding pork, seafood, fish without scales and dishes in which milk and meat are combined.
There is a wide selection of beef and lamb dishes, soups and desserts prepared with coconut milk, the traditional Hebrew cream called hummus, a wide variety of sauces, falafel, which are ground chickpeas, fruits and vegetables.
In the streets of Israeli cities, there are no street dogs.
Instead, there are many well-fed cats who “walk to their liking” imposingly.
At night you can see them sleeping even on the roofs of parked cars.
Snorkelers love crowded places and don’t reject treats.
Renting a car, depending on the brand, will cost from $37 (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80) per day.
In addition to insurance, it comes out for $15 a day.
And renting a bike will cost you 15 shekels a day.
Tickets to museums cost an average of 30 shekels.
Israel in numbers
In 2012, more than three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
Most of those who came to tour the country and rest were citizens of the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom and Ukraine.
The Promised Land, from January to October 2012, was visited by 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists, an amount that exceeds by 51% the same index as in 2010, before the cancellation of the visa regime on February 9, 2011.
"The Great and Powerful" Will Take You to Moscow: Immigrants Save for Language
While lawmakers and human rights defenders are discussing the consequences of the compulsory examination law, there have already been whistleblowers in the country who trade in “false” certificates.
Every year, 13 million migrant workers arrive in Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities in Russia.
They are mostly citizens of Central Asian countries: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money to help their families who have stayed at home.
Since December 1, a law comes into force, according to which each immigrant must take an exam to check his or her knowledge of the Russian language.
For now, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the service provision sector, community service institutions, domestic services and retail trade.
However, over time, as promised by the Federal Immigration Service, exams will become compulsory for all immigrants.
In addition, it will not be enough to pass the examination of the language, if not also that of Russian history and the fundamentals of the legislation.
Knowledge of the language must be confirmed even to receive and renew the work permit.
The exceptions are citizens of countries where Russian is the official language.
This law shall not apply to persons who obtained their education certificates and diplomas before the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991.
Usefulness, fatality and defense of rights
The network of examining centers will operate under the auspices of the Pushkin Russian Language Institute, the Friendship of Peoples University, Moscow State University, St. Petersburg State University and other Russian higher education institutions.
Immigrants will be able to submit to the tests in all cities, currently in Russia more than 160 such centers are open.
The initiative on introducing the exam was supported by State Duma deputies and the Federal Immigration Service.
But rights defenders, long before the law came into force, managed to often ask the press this question: And what will this actually bring?
What changes will the compulsory knowledge of the language bring, both for Russians and for immigrants themselves?
First, the representatives of the Immigration Service respond, this will allow to reduce the number of people who suffer from "labor slavery".
Many people talk today about defending the rights of labor immigrants, explains Victor Sebelev, head of the representation of the Federal Immigration Service of Russia in Tajikistan.
The defense of your rights must begin before your departure.
Only an organized selection system will solve the problem of immigrant workers in 90% of cases.
The problems are with immigrants without a profession, education, who do not know the language or pass medical checks.
Without an understanding of the language, Sebelev says, the future immigrant will be doomed to find unscrupulous people who, under the pretext of helping, throw a “paid trip” into a creepy, narrow dungeon, where he and dozens of others like him are consumed for months without food or documents, working 12 to 14 hours a day.
We receive countless complaints from our immigrants.
“In their homeland they promise them one thing, but when they arrive they are defrauded, they are deprived of their passports, they are not paid the promised wages,” confirms the head of the Labor Immigration Directorate of the Immigration Service of Tajikistan, Tolib Sharipov.
Don't get mad, boss!
However, in the meantime, many citizens of the Central Asian republics who wish to work in Russia recognize that they not only do not know the language of the country to which they intend to go, but also in their own language they write with difficulty.
Of course, this is not so much his fault but his own misfortune: few Turkmen, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to receive normal primary education.
This is because their families do not even have anything to feed the children, not to mention dressing them, shoeing them and buying them what they need for school.
Upon reaching adolescence, these guys venture to work at the first opportunity.
It’s hard, if you don’t know the language, they recognize it.
"One feels humiliated and inferior."
However, as far as the language law is concerned, rights defenders point out an important point.
Examinations will be conducted only for those immigrants whose status is legal.
If they do not have that status, there will be no examination and, consequently, no official work.
Meanwhile, most immigrant workers continue to live in Russia illegally.
"Welcome or forbidden the passage to strangers"
Many visitors claim that getting official status in our country is not so easy.
The cause lies in the bureaucratic obstacles and the difficulties of the language itself.
In addition, legalization costs money: from twelve thousand to sixteen thousand rubles.
However, a false inscription can be made quickly and for only one thousand five hundred rubles.
Russian police officers know that we usually carry false documents, we are not registered and cases of extortion appear.
"They ask us for a hundred or two hundred rubles for cigarettes or tea," Tajik citizen Umed Hushkadamov told reporters.
"Come on, don't be sloppy, buy a painting"
On the first day of the coming into force of the language law, it became apparent that not only immigrant registration documents can be fake.
Several "false" certificates of language proficiency have already been seized by officials of the Federal Immigration Service.
The forged documents had been printed on standard color printers.
Of course, they came into the hands of the new owners not as a gift: each immigrant, wanting to facilitate the task of passing the tests, paid for the document seven thousand rubles.
This is two and a half times more expensive than the official examination procedure, which will cost the immigrant worker three thousand rubles.
The main task for the near future is to protect the system against corruption so that “diplomas” cannot be bought, government officials and rights defenders converge.
So far, the authorities can promise immigrant workers that they would not have been able to successfully pass the exam the first time longer to study the basic language course.
In addition, non-Russian immigrants will be offered jobs that do not require active communication with people.
The Ministry of the Interior does not take drastic measures against the illegal arms trade
The percentage of crimes committed with registered weapons is quite low
The Ministry of the Interior proposes to apply the law with greater rigidity in relation to the owners of weapons of civil use.
This is the government’s reaction to the recent incidents: Squeezing shots during wedding celebrations in which fortunately there were no victims, and the massacre initiated by Moscow lawyer Dimitri Vinogradov, in which Squeezing seven people lost their lives.
Police want to ban the use and possession of traumatic weapons in public places and raise the minimum age for obtaining a license to carry weapons, from 18 to 21.
This idea was supported by the head of the Duma’s committee on security and anti-corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who promised that reforms in the law on gun ownership will be brought to the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is happy with the fact that the Russian authorities are trying to counteract this problem by applying the "hard-handed policy".
An open letter has appeared on the network, whose authors, representatives of various social organizations of shooters, demand that such measures of "senseless rigor" be given up.
The percentage of acts of vandalism with the use of registered weapons is minimal, commented to the BBC news service of Russia, the criminal lawyer Vasiliy Lesnikov.
According to statistics from the Ministry of the Interior, during six months of 2012, 142 crimes with the use of firearms registered in internal organs were committed, compared with a total of 1,168 crimes registered for the same period.
The authors of the open letter are confident that stricter legislation in the civil weapons sector will not be an inconvenience for the criminal to target the black market.
Now, according to his words, in Moscow you can find any weapon at a low price.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of the Interior states that the situation of the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: From Factories to Officials
The black market of weapons is supplied through several channels.
The main channels are years, says retired Colonel Victor Baranets, who for ten years worked in the Ministry of Education and the High Staff.
Screenshot of the website accepting weapons orders
The first, "armed or military vestige", that is, weapons that were stolen during military actions in the Caucasus.
“The weapons were stolen by Russian officers and by the Caucasians themselves,” Baranets says.
The next type of "black weapon",the stolen by criminals and representatives of the security forces.
Baranets explains that this includes stolen weapons from police warehouses and those stolen directly by law enforcement officials.
Illegal weapons go on sale from military arsenals.
In many military arsenals there were often explosions.
“There are proven versions that some fires were premeditated to cover up the fault,” said an ex-military officer.
According to Baranets, gun manufacturers also put their sand granite.
“They have now proliferated private weapons factories that are not competitive in the international market and distribute weapons under the rope to the black market, including that of Moscow,” the expert says.
Another source of the black market is smuggling.
A lot of guns and machine guns come from poor countries like Kyrgyzstan.
“There they have their own production, sometimes artisanal, and a mafia has been formed that has organized the flow of weapons,” explains the ex-military.
Where do the guns come from?
Experts have calculated the approximate share of each of these sources of supply of illegal weapons to the black market.
A report on this topic was prepared in 2011 by the Center for Problem Analysis and Public Management Planning.
The specialists analyzed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and Rosstat, criminological bibliography and public access data from portals whose topic revolves around weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, according to investigators, come from the armed forces and security forces.
Half of the black market’s weapons have arrived there “due to officials whose work is related to weapons,” the report said.
According to the researchers, 17% of weapons come from places where there are armed conflicts, 14% of cases are stolen during the production of weapons and 5% correspond to "illegal archaeology".
The gun dealer, who asked not to be named, says guns found by illegal excavators have not been bought by anyone for a long time because they are too old.
More often, he says, suppliers go to military warehouses when they need a game.
Through some alfer, the supplier buys a unit, for example a TT gun.
They remove it from the registry and pass it over the fence.
"This guy takes the gun to the city and sells it for 900 euros per unit with two chargers," he tells us.
“But, of course, the police are aware of all the issues, so periodically, when you have to comply with the plan to detect crimes, they make test purchases to illegal arms dealers,” he adds.
"Like in a luxury boutique"
The seller and the buyer usually meet through acquaintances.
"I visited websites and blogs until a guy who proposed to me to go to the Begovaya platform, where there would be a man who would take me to a "squirrel" where we could negotiate.
About the price of the gun, I only found out there.”
Military commentator Viktor Baranets
"To get a gun I need a friend who has contacts," says the shop attendant. "I have a friend like that, but I don't trust him very much."
There are vendors in the markets, but you also have to get there, say, "on behalf of Mr. Ivanovich, who asked to tell him that a tooth had fallen to his daughter."
I can even get a pair of steel cuffs through a trusted person.
He also supplies them only to me because he knows I'm not going to delate him.
Novices look for weapons in different ways.
Ex-military Viktor Baranets was put to the test in the role of illegal weapons buyer in the mid-1990s, when an article on the subject was about to be published.
The schemes, in his words, have not changed.
They gave him a photo album where there was no "everything".
“I felt like I was in a luxury boutique,” recalls the soldier.
To the buyer, according to the words of Baranets, they do not offer cat for hare: everything there can be tried.
I, as a potential customer, not only buy; we go with the seller to the forest, where we put a target.
"They give me the opportunity to shoot and when I make sure the gun fires well, we start negotiating," the expert describes the procedure.
Sofas shop
Web search engines lead to "Vkontakte" sites and groups, where it is offered to buy weapons "for different purposes".
No documents or personal meetings are required for this.
"It's enough to have a certain amount of money," they write in the headline of the advertisement "Buy a gun or a machine gun."
There, users place their orders and ask questions.
And they sell to minors?
"Without permission, of course", asks the user "Iván" (preserved spelling).
"I buy gun TT. Moscow", laconically formulates your question "Fedorenkov".
The Federal Security Service has created a huge network of fictitious websites and captures two-handed those who want to buy firearms.
And people go, like hungry fish to bait, and then, to extract coal in Siberia
Military and ex-military commentator Viktor Baranets
I have heard of these systems: usually, the website is registered outside the scope of Russian laws.
People make orders.
The buyer makes the payment through an ATM.
“In response, they send you a photo and instructions to know where the weapon is hidden,” said the NGO’s press secretary, Dmitri Kislov.
Viktor Baranets claims that if an order is placed online, one is left unarmed and put in jail.
The Federal Security Service has created a huge network of fictitious websites and captures two-handed those who want to buy firearms.
"And people go, like hungry fish to bait, and then, to extract coal in Siberia," he says.
Makarov for $100
In the purchase of illegal firearms, according to experts, one can spend from 100 to 900 dollars.
According to Dmitry Kislov of the NGO "The right to weapons", a Makarov pistol can be purchased for 100-300 dollars.
It will have to wait a month and a half.
It is shipped from military warehouses by middle-ranking chiefs.
According to official statistics of the ministry, compared to the period January-October 2011, the total number of these crimes in Russia decreased by 7%, which constitutes 22,900, and the number of identified cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8%.
Employees of fast food restaurants and supermarkets in the U.S. are on strike.
Up to a quarter of American teenagers find their first jobs as cashiers at "McDonald's"
In recent days, there has been a wave of protests in the United States against the low wages paid in the supermarkets of the corporation Walmart and in restaurants of popular fast food chains such as "McDonald's", "Burger King", "Taco Bell", "Wendy's" and "Kentucky Fried Chicken".
For now, no one dares to assert whether or not this wave will reach the nine points, or whether it is destined to lose strength and dawn in its early stages.
The protests are supported by trade unions and a number of left-wing NGOs.
In addition to the increase in modest wages perceived by Walmart workers and those of the fast food system, the goal of the organizers of the protests is the creation of workers’ unions in these companies.
For now, this sector of the economy has practically not been occupied by the trade union movement.
Forty-six cents a year?
Actions began last week, after Thanksgiving, the so-called "Black Friday", on that day, in the United States, the orgy of auctions that captured millions of inhabitants, and which was sometimes accompanied by clashes.
On that day, some workers at the Walmart Corporation, which employs 2.2 million people worldwide, quit their jobs and formed protest pickets alongside unions and left-wing activists in the corporation’s stores, whose products are aimed at modest and moderate-income people.
Walmart sells everything from diapers, hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The products in their stores are on average between 8% and 27% cheaper than those in larger supermarkets.
That’s why many poorly paid Walmart workers buy only at work.
The availability and assortment of products have made Walmart one of the largest corporations in America.
According to two critics, Walmart can afford to sell products at very low prices, in part because it pays its workers little.
The latter also complain about poor working conditions, such as the lack of forklifts or hand scanners.
That "Black Friday" protesters demanded wage increases and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by the corporation went from $30 to $100 monthly.
For a typical Walmart worker, who gets $9.5 an hour, this spending is excessive, they said.
Scientists at the University of California at Berkeley argue that if Walmart raises the average salary to $12 per hour, it will cost the corporation $3.2 trillion.
This is about 1.1% more than you spend on wages now.
If Walmart puts the salary increase on the shoulders of consumers, each visit to the store will only cost them 46 cents more.
In a year they will spend the ridiculous amount of $12.39 more than they spend now.
Walmart supporters are pleased that the protest took place in just nine states and that it did not cause any loss to the corporation.
Black Friday lasted in their stores from 8 p.m. on Thursday until midnight the following day and, during that time, Walmart sold around 5,000 items per second.
In total, their cash registers made nearly 100 million transactions on Black Friday.
The company’s spokesman, Dan Fogelman, said in an interview with the left-wing website Huffington Post, that they had left their job “less than five” Walmart employees and that the protest had been nothing more than “another PR trick” organized by the workers’ union.
"Free box!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where the targets were not exactly the big Walmart stores (which in this progressive city they don’t appreciate, and therefore for now there are none), but the “McDonald’s” and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's says it sells billions of servings, and then they don't even give you a sick leave and they don't pay you for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, New York City City Council member
Currently, under federal and New York law, the minimum wage is $7.25 per hour.
Fast food restaurants are increasing over time, but only slightly, and on average, ordinary workers in New York receive $8.90 per hour.
No one earns less than them in this city.
How it’s possible to survive in New York with that money, to me it’s something incomprehensible.
There was a time when nearly a quarter of American teenagers went through McDonald’s and worked there, behind the counters, part-time after school, even though they were still living with their parents.
Few were those who saw this as the main source of income or planned to stay there for a long time.
Now, I constantly stumble upon some interviews with McDonald’s workers who complain that they have to live off this salary, and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, in a forum of the Wall Street Journal there is a comment whose author points out that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know what to feed them.
Participants in the protests, which began at 6:30 a.m. on Thursday at McDonald’s on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that cashiers and fast-food chefs start paying at least $15 per hour, meaning that they double their current minimum wage.
They also demanded that workers’ unions be created in the fast food sector.
U.S. law prohibits the administration from preventing this right and punishing union activists with tricks and layoffs.
On the other hand, administration rarely makes life easier for them.
But, for objective reasons, it is easy for unions to embrace the fast food sector.
One of the main ones is the excessive rotation of staff.
Discordant
Noisy protests took place that same day in other cheap restaurants in Manhattan.
The culmination of the action took place in the middle of the rally at McDonald's near Times Square, in which several local Democrat politicians participated, in particular the city's City Council member Jumaane Williams, who said, "McDonald's says he's selling billions of servings, and then doesn't even give you a job for a hospital or pay you."
The protesters received support from other prominent New York Democrats, such as mayor Bill de Blasio, who said that “we must support fast food workers to get the fair wages and economic prosperity that every New Yorker deserves.”
As described by the New York Times, this has been the largest demonstration of its kind in American fast food history.
But only a few hundred people participated, not all of them were employees of the fast food service, which employs tens of thousands of New Yorkers.
It is not yet clear whether this will serve as a spark to provoke a massive movement.
"For now, deceiving the brain isn't so easy"
The theme of augmented reality, so popular among fans of modern technologies, has lately been commonly perceived mainly through the prism of special glasses.
Earlier this summer, at its annual conference, Google demonstrated a moving model and subsequently, in November, it was known that Microsoft had also filed an application to claim the corresponding patent.
However, from a conversation with the head of the 3D interactive technology group at Microsoft’s Cambridge lab, Izadi Sharamom, it became clear that for the company’s scientists, the glasses already belonged to a past stage.
They are attracted by the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in the air with their bare hands and creating open virtual spaces.
- Please, in general terms, what is the object of study of your research group?
- We are dedicated to the person-computer interaction, but we also try to expand the boundaries of this interaction.
For now, humanity in its great mass has been trapped in the stage of working with the pixels of the flat screen, sometimes touching it with the finger.
But we want to look 5-10 years ahead and guess the cardinal changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors represent a step forward and today no Xbox is sold without Kinect, as everyone is interested in gesture control.
- What else does the future hold?
Although Kinect has taken the interaction to the physical level, much of it still occurs on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information has improved (the system receives more data), and the output is still not very good.
We’re trying to change this, we’re working on truly three-dimensional visualization systems, based on different technologies, including design ones.
The computer world must be freed from our physical world, to make it more tangible.
For this, however, it is necessary to recognize not only the user, but also the space that surrounds him.
Then we will be able to complete the real world with virtual objects in a more comfortable way.
First, to hell with those dumb virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think about voice control?
A very popular detail, but don't you think they overestimate it?
- Of course it cannot be considered a panacea, it is still pending to resolve the issue of privacy, since you do not always want others to know about our actions and intentions.
In fact, all types of interaction with computers are good, but each in its own field.
For example, for controlling devices in public places, we had a project where we thought about gestures, but not in looser movements, but shorter ones.
In addition, the gestures were captured not by the camera of the device, but by a bracelet that recorded the movement of the bones and muscles.
For now it is very large, but in theory it can be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
But, in general, the future is for a combined type of control, for example gesture + voice.
- How's that?
- For example, how would you ask me to pass you this soda can?
You will speak and show it at the same time.
- Usually I just talk.
- Oh, that's gonna be very hard to recognize.
- That is, you want to force users to adapt to what the machine can or cannot do right now?
- Not necessarily, but it's a mutual approach.
I believe that in the near future we will have to work mainly on the design of new types of sensors that can accurately determine the reactions of the person.
These can be, for example, laser sensors, as they provide good resolution in depth, which is very important.
- If we talk about your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what complaints do you have about modern cameras?
Do you lack resolution, depth or something else?
- In principle, the current generation is what can be the beginning of our work with three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get 8 megapixels at 1000 fps.
But the question is not in the megapixels, but in the quality of the matrix and in the depth.
From this last point of view, not all current technologies are good enough for us; this gives more work to algorithm designers.
That is, we have to remember not only the resolution on the X and Y axes, but also on Z.
Also important is the speed, the number of frames per second.
The human movements are quite dynamic and the current 30 fps are really scarce, especially for gestures.
Steven Bathiche, from our lab in Redmond, made a contact sensor with adjustable processing delay of 1 to 100 ms and it should be mentioned that modern mass-produced sensors are closer to the second value (60-100).
Not everyone understands the extent to which this affects human-machine interaction.
To me it would be very useful for my work an equivalent of such a device, but that does not require contact so that the frames per second are more.
- And there's no need to increase the number of cameras?
- The Kinect now has three "cameras", one of which is in fact the infrared emitter and the second the receiver of the reflected signal.
But the third camera is actually a simple sensor of the visible diaphragm.
This is not used to determine the depth of the object.
Potentially, more cameras could solve the problem...
Or on the contrary, increase it and increase the required amount of calculations.
It would be good to create a flexible Kinect analog, play with the camera location curvature and see how this would help determine the three-dimensional position.
As far as I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, has not presented its glasses to the public.
Don’t you think that, from the point of view of everyday use of augmented reality technologies, glasses are one of the most visible platforms?
- Of course, spending all the time holding up a smartphone in your hands is not very comfortable, but I think: the best option would be a "transmutable" augmented reality when, based on a cloud platform, you could switch from glasses to smartphone,
Glasses are very personal devices, in that is their strength (private things only you can see them), but also their weakness: an augmented reality based on glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects together with other people.
- Imagine for a moment that manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only to Tony Stark of the film "Iron Man", but also to any mere mortal.
There is a problem in this idea that critics often point out: there is no tactile answer!
The hands feel nothing!
What answers does your group prepare for this challenge?
In my lectures I often say that augmented reality is the seventh burst in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the octave might well be the addition of tactile sensations.
Meanwhile, one of the most interesting tricks is the use of the second hand as support for the image.
Record the touch perfectly!
But there are also technologies that are truly oriented to bring tactileness to these "images in the air." For example, the interference of several ultrasonic rays directed to a specific point where the finger is located gives a similar sensation as one feels if someone was blowing it in the tips of the fingers, but that feeling is still very weak.
There are also wrist bracelets that influence the nerve endings of the fingers, this is also a promising direction.
- Did you try to fool the brain?
Make him think he feels what he feels he should feel the moment he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried it yet.
Here lies another challenge with which we will have to fight for a long time, how to make a person physically located in a very small space believe that it goes to an open space, almost endless. We are also working on the idea of running tapes (not like those of gyms), mobile platforms, as well as that of giant balloons.
For now, deceiving the brain is not so easy, it still has to work for many years.
That’s what makes working with virtual reality appealing to researchers, that many things are in a state of total conception.
Subjective personal taste instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continues the project "Vanguardism of St. Petersburg", dedicated to the citizens who are ahead, at the forefront of art and culture.
In this list of the best are brilliant figures of art and the St. Petersburg scene, whose achievements reach beyond the city: they often find recognition in Europe without Russia even knowing them.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the extravagant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city meets Kirill Miller, a bearded man dressed in red from top to bottom, who can be found near the Russian Museum, near the Summer Garden, or at fashion gatherings and openings.
Kirill Miller’s paintings always attract crowds, wherever they are exhibited.
Kirill Miller is one of those purely sociophilosophical storytellers of St. Petersburg, creators of new mythologies.
Kirill Miller is a brilliant representative of the St. Petersburg avant-garde of the late 80s - early 90s.
In addition, he is an urban man, whose appearance on the streets of the city awakens in the inhabitants smiles and raises everyone's mood.
Recently, he took an organelle in his hands and became the organiller of St. Petersburg, as he has matured to make such difficult paper, for his bohemian existence, his philosophy and his image.
- Kirill, why are you going around town dressed in red and not yellow or turquoise, for example?
- I chose the color red because I am a fashion designer and I dedicate myself to appearance and image.
In this world, the color red is a commitment between the artist, image creators and society.
Although in society, everything that is not a little gray arouses aggressiveness and agitation of nothing good properties.
But my provocations are aimed at starting a conversation.
The whole story of my provocative actions is an invitation to debate.
When did you realize you were supposed to be an artist?
- In an exhibition at the Nevsky Palace of Culture, where my works were exhibited.
I realized that was my way.
Then the wave of old unofficial artists had ended, and the new ones, free as I was, were still misunderstood.
I became friends with artists of the new wave, with the aftermath of those exposed in Gaza and Nevskiy, which led to "Pushkinskaya-10", and the new wave was over.
I got into the theater for the clothes, the music of all genres, but not for the lyrics.
It was important for me to find myself in the cultural center of St. Petersburg, where the best creative minds were supposed to come together.
In 1995, I occupied a territory in Pushkinskaya-10 and there, while there were no reforms, there was a musical artistic club, a bohemian club, the house of bohemian St. Petersburg.
Many were born there: Noms, Tequila Jazz, I remember the way Schnur brought the project to "The Ear of Van Gogh".
Schnur and his friends sang light songs under the phonogram, wearing tight pants, among them was the current fashion composer Igor Vdovin.
When the band began to play live, it became "Leningrad".
Trachtenberg was an animator of many programs before the times of Hali-galivskih.
We gave them to Trachtenberg and it was the beginning of his great career; the basic education and training he received from us.
Gallery "D 137", the "Club Griboyedov, are the remains of the Art Clinic.
That’s where our employees and regular customers went.
I'm a hero of the last century, when culture meant something.
In the year 2000, the survey was done in the press, the award was "The people of our city".
In the nomination "Artist of the Year" I was chosen, so ended my culmination.
In these new times it is not comfortable to work; I am a man who likes the truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
Nowadays it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are separate. One can be popular but very uncult.
- There's something recognizable about your work.
- Many of my paintings are hits, in them is clearly expressed the current and occurrence.
I'm going to do a scheduled exhibition, "The Russian Museum in Clowns."
Clowns are a timeless category.
I used to be sociable, but now being so is painful and frightening.
But in clowns everything gets muddy and tragedy is eliminated.
I love the grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, the salvation of the world through a totalitarian and compulsory change of clothes.
Now one is followed by the clothes, oriented on the outside, but not on the inside of the person.
And maybe that person shouldn’t even shake his hand, but spit in his face.
And the deception will be eliminated when you change clothes.
- We just saw you in the role of urban organizer. - A cultured city must have a hero like that.
Who better than me to be!
- Okay, but maybe commercial art can be beautiful?
- Now commercial art must be scrupulous, sweet, tactful.
We are witnessing the disintegration of cultures.
Before, people grouped in herds, the Bohemians wanted one thing, the simple ones wanted another.
Now everyone has split into micro-communities, it’s hard to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred dollar bill to please everyone.
Now you have to think about who you want to like.
Now, every cult hero has his 100 fans.
- And to listen to Stas Mikhailov arrive by the thousands!
- They're going to see the abandoned ones, that's where the sex-social sphere works.
And to a cultural event go 300 people, 10,000 will never come. As a result, less management, less money, everything fades.
I have my fans, the most important thing is not to fool them, not to lose what you have achieved.
When I was young I made such paintings that a collector had them hung on the wall next to Falk and Larionov.
I started with paintings, with which people usually end.
The concepts are often confused.
They say spiritual culture, consumer culture.
There is no culture in consumption, that is another story.
I am a man of yesterday’s culture, I grew up under the example of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, denied money just to paint paintings.
I am in favor of this culture.
- Kirill, what's missing in St. Petersburg?
- Good culture experts.
There is one concept: culture official.
But not all of them can dedicate themselves to culture.
When kings were the right ones everything was different, kings might not understand culture very well, but they knew it was necessary to keep the right experts.
There are very good consultants in Moscow now.
We have people in St. Petersburg who might well be experts, but they are closed, because they need experts at a higher level who correctly evaluate these and open the way for them.
Now subjective personal taste is thriving.
The same error, but the difference is that they honestly say that not all modern art is accepted, there are some artists who have to look for other museums.
- What's St. Petersburg for you?
- St. Petersburg is not a cultural capital. In Moscow there is much more culture, there is land.
But on our stones it is difficult for art to grow.
We need cultural ground and now we have more writers than readers, this is wrong.
In Europe there are a lot of curious people who go to exhibitions and concerts.
In our case, this class is insignificant.
We have to make art fashionable, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project will be implemented with a grant from St. Petersburg.
Giving birth in space
The Earth is in danger.
Global warming or collision with a killer asteroid.
Caravans of spaceships with humans on board set out in search of a replacement planet.
In order to preserve humanity, the main question arises: How to continue the species in conditions of ingravity or on the same replacement planet?
I think there is little to choose from.
In fact, only two are real planets that can be colonized, at least hypothetically.
“These are Venus and Mars,” says Vladimir Surdin, chief researcher at the State Astronomical Institute, Sternberg P.K. (IAES).
But if conditions on Mars are better for life, on the surface of Venus the temperature is 500 degrees.
You can only live at high altitudes or in the orbit of Venus... in space.
We began to address the problems of reproduction in space with flora.
For half a century, experiments with plants have been carried out.
Four generations of peas cultivated in orbit did not differ in anything from terrestrial varieties.
Then came the breeding of insects in orbit, small fruit flies, drosophiles.
In 1979, quail eggs were sent to space to check how the embryo develops under ungravity conditions.
As a result, we get a normal chicken.
But then the problems begin.
“The problem is that this chick has to find support, it has to stand on its own feet and start moving,” explains Vladimir Sychev, the laboratory director of the Institute of Biomedical Problems (IPBM) of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
Unable to find support, the chicks were rolling around randomly.
And after 10 hours in newborns there was a total atrophy of instincts.
The chicks did not react to light or sound.
And the misfortune was that after four days they simply died.
"And twice we got the chicks to be born, but then we left it because it was impossible to work there with them," says Vladimir Sychev about the failure of the experiment with the chicks in space.
The last time a biological “miniarc” flew into orbit was 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in the spring of 2013.
However, in the biosatellite "Bion" will only travel species of the same sex.
There was an experiment with rats, which were sent into space already with fetuses.
In the beginning, nothing supernatural was found.
"This was precisely on the biosatellites, but this was a unique experiment, and studies like this should be carried out," says Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, the space rats had offspring.
However, the problem of reproduction has not yet been addressed directly in space.
It's a tough challenge.
Animals, by losing their usual habitat, simply cannot carry out their sexual instincts.
Man, however, unlike small animals, in principle, can.
Homo sapiens has abstract reasoning and is able to create a suitable emotional background.
Similar experiments are not carried out for ethical reasons.
But women have been traveling in space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was taken by Tereshkova.
And the most precious thing that humanity has is the female organism.
Our seagull flying, and no one on Earth could say: if it is after a flight into space.
You may or may not have a baby after this flight.
“After all, no one has answered this question,” said Vakhtang Vachnadze, an aerospace veteran.
In June 1964, only after a year of space flight, the first woman cosmonaut, Valentina Tereshkova, gave birth to a daughter.
The girl's father, Andrian Nikolayev, was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second woman cosmonaut, Svetlana Savitskaya, who twice was in orbit and even worked in open space, had a son.
However, the risk persists.
We are few, the astronauts are counted to whom after long flights everything has worked out well, and a healthy generation is growing.
"And if you can say more, it is dangerous even in orbital flights," sums up the cosmonaut pilot, hero of the Soviet Union, hero of Russia, Valery Polyakov.
However, humanity must seek some new avenues in biotechnology, in radiological protection, in the creation of artificial gravity.
The water laboratory of the Cosmonaut Preparation Center is a mandatory stage in flight preparation.
In conditions of zero floatability, cosmonauts practice their working skills in space.
Water simulates ingravity.
If for an adult water is a comfortable environment, although still hostile, for a newborn child it is its native element.
The small amphibian men seem to confirm that life on earth arose from the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that the baby is approximately 9 months inside his mother in the amniotic fluid, as it will be easier for him to get used to the water afterwards.
In principle, this is logical, because from the moment of birth to the moment of the first bath only 2 weeks pass.
“This is too little to forget something,” says Marina Aksenova, a newborn swimming monitor.
In short, if ingravity is a more natural state for a newborn, for women gravity, the force of gravity, is necessary.
In pregnancy, the abdominal and pelvic muscles decrepit very quickly, the ability to expel the fetus is reduced.
Well, we omit that, relying on the action of birth stimulants.
You can, of course, give birth in a special chamber, it will push you.
"And then what?", Valeri Polyakov asks himself this original question.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without the sense of gravity, the body does not generate the skeleton or the muscle system.
To a newborn in orbit it is impossible to dress him with a special suit for training, as adults.
He will simply be deprived of what is vital to him.
“And this experiment that we are going to do together, by allowing the birth of a child in a strange environment, will result in us bringing to Earth a disabled person, a totally inadequate person,” predicts the head of the bioethics committee of the Institute of Biomedical Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Igor Pestov.
For now, the birth of children in space is a theoretical issue.
However, over time this will be a reality, when humans on their ships head to a distant planet that will be home to their children born in space.
Chief of NK<0xC3><0x9A>: The inspection of the system "<0xC5><0xA0>varc" has not dealt with the guilty politician
In the field of public procurement, the Czech Republic has good inspectors and quality legislation, although its implementation is cumbersome.
Miloslav Kala, Vice President of the Office of Supreme Control (NK<0xC3><0x9A>), said in an interview with Aktualn<0xC4><0x9B>.cz.
"The law will never be perfect," but its application must be correct. "This is, in my opinion, what we lack," so describes the current situation.
Joint checks by Czech and German inspectors also lead to similar conclusions.
As an example of an incorrect practice, he mentions Petr Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as's attitude towards the system of being autonomous only on paper, which is known as the "<0xC5><0xA0>varc" system.
The Prime Minister recently said that the ODS (Civil Democratic Party) would not bother employers with inspectors. So, is it forbidden or allowed?
“The law must be regulated in some way and if it prohibits anything, in that case, neither the president of the government can prevent the performance of the office that has the obligation to carry out such controls nor require obligations,” Kala notes.
At the meeting of the control committee in the Congress of Deputies, you spoke of the joint project between the Czech and German team, in the framework of which the legislation on public procurement in both countries was compared.
What exactly is it?
This is a parallel check that we started to carry out about two years ago.
Simply put: European legislation regulates how public procurement should be organised, this is followed by the legislation in force in each country and, subsequently, by the practice itself.
We have put everything together and, although the control has not yet been completed, we have obtained very interesting differences. Generally, the legislation of our country is "more strict and more complete", however, the concrete practice in some parameters is better in Germany.
It is therefore confirmed that it is not enough to incorporate increasingly stricter rules, but that it is necessary to focus on the implementation of the law itself.
What can this project actually bring? What do you think are the conclusions?
Precisely a common control of this kind could help us stop investing in making laws, reducing and improving limits, even if this does not have such a positive impact.
Saving economy means getting something right at a reasonable price (which doesn’t always mean that the price is the lowest) to avoid enrichment and, in the long run, criminal actions.
But not by reducing the limit of the awards means that we are going to get it.
Perhaps because the system is saturated with so much paperwork, that those who want to look for failures in the system will be able to do so more easily than if the limits remained as high as they are now.
You are talking about the problems of our country with the transfer of legislation that regulates the practice of public procurement.
How does the control system in Germany work?
Is it an office similar to our NK<0xC3><0x9A> or is it organized in another way?
As for the offices, such as the NK<0xC3><0x9A>, the Bundesrechnungshof (Federal Court of Auditors) acts there, with an organization similar to ours, with a school as well, the only thing is that in its case it is structured in a somewhat different way, but in principle both offices evolve in parallel.
The competences are also somewhat analogous, however, as long as Germany has a federal organization, the Courts of Auditors are even at this level. In this respect it differs slightly from our system.
The Federal Court of Auditors (BRH) can only control federal money, which here we call state funds.
The public funds, which are administered by the regions and municipalities, there, in Germany, are controlled by the Federal Court of Auditors.
As for local legislation, is it simpler than ours?
In general, I would not like to make a comparison without concrete data, but Germany remains a model in some respects, but it is not possible to specify exactly what is best.
Could it be better, for example, with regard to the quality of inspectors?
Of course not, but, I repeat, I don’t like to make such comparisons.
It is necessary to say that even those countries that we take as a model must face a large number of problems.
If it weren't so, it wouldn't be of any benefit to them to collaborate with our office, would it?
With regard to the legislation of our country, what did the amendment to the law on public procurement mean for your Office?
Given that the period of validity of this amendment is relatively short, it has not yet been reflected in the control actions.
Since we carry out ex post controls, a certain delay is necessary.
For now, it is observed in the process of preparing future controls: we have initiated a new tool of "detection of non-economic risks", through which we have passed almost 14,000 public tenders, which have been analyzed. The changes will be perfectly reflected here, as the limits are modified, the conditions of some types of the selection process are rectified.
Do you consider the passage of this law to be beneficial or rather to be a mess for the bureaucratic system?
I think this law is certainly a step in the right direction and I hope so.
The problem that may arise is that the regulation "hardens" and that it is impossible to comply with it.
Already under the previous regulations, controlled persons were bound to the contractor (e.g. in the case of regional operational programmes of the regional council), and any non-compliance with public procurement law meant a violation of budgetary discipline.
Does it make sense, then, to harden the law in this way?
I don't think so.
The system must exclude those who want to attack it or take advantage of it and not punish those who commit a formal ruling, which has no impact on decision-making.
Such a system will only be able to create more bureaucratic pressure.
And how do you get out of this?
We will see where this initiated path leads us.
The Prime Minister has recently stated that the SDGs would not bother employers with controls of the so-called <0xC5><0xA1>varc system, with reference to the fact of being autonomous only on paper.
Is the <0xC5><0xA0>warc system banned or allowed?
The law must be regulated in some way, and if it prohibits anything, then not even the Prime Minister of the government can prevent the Office’s performance which has the obligation to carry out such controls and demand obligations.
He can say, “We change the law and allow it,” but he can’t say that we’ll act like nothing.
In the law on public procurement, the rules are quite strict as to how it should be formally acted, and that is how it should be to protect public competition.
But, on the other hand, it is tragic that the candidate with the best offer is excluded for not meeting the formal requirements.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be correct, which is, in my opinion, what we are missing.
The roads have ice sheets, although most of them are transitable.
In several parts of the Czech Republic, roads have ice and snow plates.
Although most roads are transitable, caution should be exercised in some.
Karlovy Vary Region
This morning the roads in the Karlovy Vary region were transitable, but had ice and snow plates.
The temperature drops and will fluctuate between five and ten degrees below zero. During the day the thermometers will rise slightly.
It has stopped snowing in the region and in the low areas the snow layer is thin.
On the ridges of the Metallic Mountains, however, the snow reaches almost 30 centimeters.
In some places, visibility was still poor due to fog, according to information from the region's road operations control center.
The R6 highway and first-class road in the region are now unrestrictedly transitable.
However, extreme caution is recommended, especially on some bridges whose surface may be frozen and slippery.
All second and third category roads, including mountain roads, are also transitable.
However, in some of them there are still stretches with remains of ice and snow.
Attention needs to be increased on the road, especially in the higher areas.
Region of Pardubice and Hradec Králové
In some roads in eastern Bohemia there is a risk of frost and in higher areas and in the mountains a layer of snow may have formed on the tracks, reports on its pages the Directorate of roads and highways.
Road operators warn drivers about the danger of ice sheets forming, especially in higher areas of the Pardubice region.
Frosts can occur in the immediate vicinity of Lan<0xC5><0xA1>krouna, <0xC3><0x9A>stí nad Orlicí, Poli<0xC4><0x8D>ky, Svitav or Vysokého M<0xC3><0xBD>ta, and especially on second and third category roads.
The I/43 and I/34 roads in Svitav have been chemically treated.
There is snow especially on the roads of the mountains of Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e and Orlické hory.
There is a layer of snow in the highest areas of the roads in the municipalities of Rychnov nad Kn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE>nou and Trutnov.
In the area of eastern Bohemia, the sky will be between clear and partly cloudy today, with no precipitation.
Temperatures will usually range between three low zero and a positive degree, will blow a weak wind.
Region of Pilsen
Roads in the Pilsen region are transitable this morning, although caution must be exercised and timely adaptation will be necessary.
In the early hours of the morning there will be frosts, temperatures will fluctuate between three and nine degrees below zero.
After snowfall and subsequent temperature drops, some tracks may also be covered with ice.
In some places drivers will encounter fog, but visibility will gradually improve.
This is what emerges from the information from the region's road operations control center.
The D5 motorway is transitable almost without restrictions, although extreme caution is recommended, especially on the road between kilometer 80 and 131.
The surface of most first class roads is dry and ice-free.
In the area of the Pilsen and Tachov road bordering Germany there may be sections with ice plates.
The second and third category tracks are wet, so in this case, sections with ice plates are also cautioned.
Drivers should be more cautious, especially on less busy roads in the <0xC5><0xA0>umava area.
Olomouc Region
Drivers heading to the highest areas of the Olomouc region will encounter partially discarded snow.
After the chemical treatment, there was still snow in the port of <0xC4><0x8C>ervenohorské and on the way to Videlsk<0xC3><0xBD> k<0xC5><0x99>í<0xC5><0xBE>.
Road workers removed the snow during the night; about three centimeters of snow accumulated on the <0xC5><0xA0>umper road, according to road administrators.
In the rest of the region, most tracks are transitable without restrictions.
"In the highest areas of the <0xC5><0xA0>umper road, there are leftovers of snow.
Drivers in the port of <0xC4><0x8C>ervenohorské will be met with half-waste snow in the direction of Jeseník," an operator of the <0xC5><0xA0>umper road administration told <0xC4><0x8C>TK today.
On the ground and at night his colleagues also came to the Jesenická and, after the chemical treatment, the tracks of the higher areas are now clear and wet.
On the Olomouc road, the roads are unrestrictedly transitable, while on the <0xC5><0xA0>ternberská road, drivers should drive cautiously on forest trails, where the roads are still wet.
<0xC3><0x9A>stí nad Labem Region and Liberec Region
North Bohemia’s road operators have reported complications on different stretches early in the morning.
Apart from some places where it has snowed or frosted, according to the police database the mountain road between Telnice and Knínice in the <0xC3><0x9A>stí nad Labem region is closed.
Temperatures are kept below zero, even in the lowest areas, so ice and snow obviously remain on the sidewalk. On the other hand, in the lower areas, especially in the southeast of the Czech Central Massif, there are no problems and the roads are usually dry.
No service complications have been reported for the time being.
Road operators have warned of the presence of ice in the vicinity of <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>tí.
According to meteorologists, the conditions have been ideal during the night. During the day rain and snow is expected to melt and at night the sky will be clear and there will be ice.
Unfavourable conditions have been announced on the I/13 road on the border between the region of <0xC3><0x9A>stí nad Labem and Liberec.
The road between Telnice and Kninice had to be cut by the branches of the trees that had arched over the track with the weight of snow.
<0xC5><0xA0>imon Ornest: In our concerts we want to accumulate positive energy
It is said that in a little less than a month the end of the world is coming, what do you think about it?
It’s just one of so many other alarmist news we like to grab.
The Tap Tap music group likes to make jokes about this and we like to say that we are the only music group in the world that manages to gather enough positive energy to postpone the end of the world or to avoid it.
Also, in December you organize a really original project: three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you explain this to our readers?
This is a state charity that we have been planning for two years.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential that has the end of the Mayan calendar set for December 21 at 11:10 a.m.
On the previous day, December 20 at 21:00, we will organize 3 simultaneous concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end at about the same time as the Mayan calendar ends on the island of Kiribati, in the Pacific Ocean, 12 hours ahead of our time zone.
Who came up with this idea?
Initially it was my idea, then we went forging the project together with our designer Honza Augusta.
In addition to wanting to gather enough positive energy and avoid the end of the world, we also want to reflect, together with society, on the state in which we will leave the world to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar we have also created a unique collection of items: boots, t-shirts, bags and original anti-end of the world keychains that can be purchased at www.e-tap.cz, another way to support us.
The band The Tap Tap, along with other performers, also sang the so-called anthem against the end of the world, which is titled "End of the world, cancelled".
It is currently very popular on YouTube, can it be heard at charity concerts?
Of course it is, and it will be just the last, well, as long as everything goes well and the world doesn't end...
It will be sung by all the performers at the same time in all three concerts.
The anthems will be linked to each other simultaneously thanks to the special live broadcast on Czech Television.
Tomá<0xC5><0xA1> Hanák has written the lyrics for this song and plays the protagonist role of Jesus in the video clip, where he also sings Xindl X...
How did this collaboration come about?
We work together even with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, besides organizing many charitable events and concerts...
We make every effort to participate in this project.
It has been shown that most of them are interested and enjoy working with us.
What will the money raised in concerts against the end of the world be used for?
A equipment for the educational center without barriers Studeo, which we carry out in its sixth consecutive year with the civil association Tap in Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>k<0xC5><0xAF>v ústav.
Students of the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>k<0xC5><0xAF>v ústav school regularly receive a visit from teachers with whom they carry out fun and interesting activities.
Students do not have enough financial means to pay teachers and we make an effort to make it possible.
As part of the completion of the works in Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>k<0xC5><0xAF>v ústav, there will be an independent building to which we will move with this project.
In each concert there are several groups and performers.
What are the selection criteria?
We try to develop a program that is attractive to all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague, Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Ji<0xC5><0x99>í Such<0xC3><0xBD> will perform.
For more detailed information, please visit www.kpks.cz.
Are you planning any other similar "spectacular action" in the future?
In May we will perform for the first time at the Pra<0xC5><0xBE>ské jaro festival, so here we will surely prepare an attractive program with interesting guests.
Next year we would also like to play at the Bohemian National Hall in New York and I personally, taking advantage of being in the United States, would like to complete it with performances in Washington and Chicago.
Your plans abroad are not exactly minimalist, so far you have acted in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap is a group of people with disabilities.
What is the logistics and organization of these trips?
It’s not as difficult as it may seem at first glance.
There are five members in electric wheelchairs, the chairs must travel in the luggage compartment and also we carry a lot of weight, the boxes with the instruments...
So far, however, we’ve done well, and <0xC4><0x8C>SA and British Airways were perfectly prepared, which is something I’m always surprised about.
Even in Moscow, where we recently returned, everything went smoothly.
Thanks to the departures abroad you can compare the different attitudes of society towards the disabled and other aspects.
What have you encountered so far?
In Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities, everything works better than here; in Russia we have seen that, in the east, there is a long way to go.
Unlike Prague, Moscow is full of barriers, where it is still uncommon for a person to travel alone through the city center in an electric wheelchair.
Something as common as it is, for example, to give preference to someone in a wheelchair in an elevator, there it is not.
Fortunately, a civil partnership has been created to address the problems of people with disabilities.
In what ways should we take the example of more advanced countries?
There are many aspects that we go behind...
But it is important to mention that the improvement and improvement of the situation always depends on the people it directly affects.
In London and Madrid it is very normal for people with a serious disability to move on their own in public and can go to the service, to the museum, wherever they want.
But it is not very common for a large number of people with disabilities to actively participate in social life, in this respect, with The Tap Tap let’s go a little further!
A respectful or barrier-free society is one thing, but when the time comes when eminent athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers emerge, it will begin to change everything really.
So far, they are isolated cases of people who have great willpower.
The band The Tap Tap is currently very popular, but if we look back a few years, what led you to form the band in 1998?
I entered as an educator at Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>k<0xC5><0xAF>v ústav, where I had a lot of young people around me who wanted to dedicate themselves to something.
And since I am a musician, I play, among others, the saxophone, I founded an amateur group with a co-worker.
And over time, as our moderator Lá<0xC4><0x91>a Angelovi<0xC4><0x8D> says, we got a little out of hand (laughs).
However, the popularity did not come until these last years, or am I wrong?
It’s true that it helped us a lot by connecting with famous singers and also working actively to promote the group.
We come to the conclusion that the work that is not seen, is as if it does not exist.
Thanks to the help of the European Union, we can also afford quality teaching, equipment, etc.
Did you intend to get this far with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning I saw the potential that there was, that you can do something differently.
The show world is full of things that look like each other.
It is logical, in its own way, that everything new is welcomed with caution and takes a long time to accept.
There are few extraordinary things, but I dare say that The Tap Tap is one of them.
The impression of someone seeing us for the first time is clearly compassion, it is a natural reaction.
But compassion is totally superfluous because people with disabilities are not abandoned beings who suffer and of whom we should have compassion.
There are people who are able to live a full life and develop, provided, of course, that they have the necessary means.
I always say that if something goes well for people with disabilities, then it’s not just a breakthrough for them, but for society as a whole.
Did the fact that you are a demanding boss, as many people describe you, help?
If we want to do quality work, we have to be rigorous in many respects and demand a certain discipline.
I think it's completely normal.
Some people arrive with a romantic vision and head in the clouds and when they find out they have to come for two days to rehearse, go to the preparatory test and spend a lot of time traveling and in concerts, the initial euphoria quickly leaves them.
But that’s how it works everywhere, in every group that wants to work and get something.
The band The Tap Tap currently has 20 members.
How many of them were there at the beginning of 1998?
Only one: La<0xC3><0xAF>a Angelovich.
We are an open group, people come in and out, you can’t avoid it.
Whoever has the will and desire will always find the doors open
It will be the day before the expected end of the world, Thursday 20.12.2012 at 21 hours
It will take place in the Incheba Arena in Prague, in Fléda in Brno and in Plynojem in Ostrava and 12 groups and other musicians from the Czech Republic will participate
The three cities will connect at the end of the evening via videoconferencing to jointly sing The Tap Tap's song "End of the World, Cancelled"
The aim of the concert is to gather the necessary resources to finance multifunctional equipment of the STUDEO barrier-free educational center in Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>k<0xC5><0xAF>v ústav in Prague, whose cost amounts to 25 million Czech crowns.
Entrance to the concert costs 400 CZK and children up to 12 years have free entry at the option of early sale on Bohemiaticket
Poland and the cosmos.
At the meeting of ministers of the countries of the European Space Agency held last week, Poland was accepted as the twelfth member of ESA. It is the second member country of the ESA of the former Eastern Europe bloc, after the Czech Republic, which became a full member on 12 November 2008).
Poland initiated an intensive collaboration with ESA in 1994 and participated in the Agency's project commission in subsequent years.
However, Poland’s journey to the cosmos began much earlier.
Polish enthusiasts were already engaged in spaceflight before World War II, although their work was not always understood.
I remember, for example, A. <0xC5><0xA0>ternfeld's lecture at the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory in which, on December 6, 1933, he presented his ideas on the pioneering study "Introduction to Cosmonautics".
The ideas of the young engineer (born 1905) left the assistants indifferent and, years later, <0xC5><0xA0>ternfeld remembered that Dr. Jan Gadomski had been the only one who had shown interest in his work.
In 1934 <0xC5><0xA0>ternfeld received the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch Prize in France for his "Introduction to Cosmonautics".
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966), mentioned above, later became a great driver of astronomy and cosmonautics.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish journals and wrote a series of books dedicated to this scientific discipline.
Gadomski became a promoter of cosmonautics, was known all over the world and his contribution to science was rewarded when he named one of the craters of the hidden face of the moon.
Already in the year 1925 a dresina was built in Poland that was to be equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, it is not known who was the author of the proposal and the project stalls are not known either.
It is unclear whether the rocket was to be used for starting the dresin or for braking it.
Information about this dressing is limited to the collection in the press of the time.
In 1933, the Polish artillery began to dedicate itself to missiles.
The research was funded by the Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslawem Wolfkem and Prof. Gustavem Mokrzyckiegim.
From the preserved material, it becomes evident that the research reached the stage of practical testing.
However, with the arrival of German troops, the investigation was interrupted.
In the year 1937 appeared in the specialized press the prototype of a photoelectric fighter missile designed by the engineer Rohozi<0xC5><0x84>ski and the following year was published the study "Rakete - torpedo airborne and airborne bomb", by the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocki.
Both projects were intended for military use of missile engines.
Shortly before the war, the Provisional Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy) was in charge of all projects of missile techniques for military use and coordinated all work.
The committee was founded in 1937, but after two years of activity, it was interrupted by the start of the war.
Other studies devoted to cosmonautics appeared in the Polish press after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Society of Astronautics (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronauticze).
In the November 1954 issue of Problemy magazine, reference is made for the first time to society with four very extensive articles devoted to astronautics.
In one of them, Prof. M. Subotowiczze proposed the creation of a society that would devote itself to cosmonautics.
Projects of artificial satellites had already been launched at that time and it was obvious that cosmic research was a discipline with future prospects.
Since the beginning of 1956 the Polish Astronautical Society (PTA) aspired to be part of the International Astronautical Federation (founded in 1951) and in the autumn of that year the PTA became a full member.
The following year the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became the vice president of the International Astronautics Federation.
He held this position until his death in 1959.
From 1956, the PTA was significantly involved in the development of the RM (Meteorological Rocket) rocket, which was a success and became the first Polish rocket in which scientific research was carried out.
The first RM-1 type was completed in 1957 and first launched on October 10, 1958.
The rocket had a height of 1,800 meters, about 80 cm in length and did not reach 5 kg in weight.
Later, the RM-1A version was completed and in the summer of 1959 aerial tests of the two-stage RM-2 rockets in the B<0xC5><0x82><0xC4><0x99>dów desert began.
The rocket measured 1.4 meters and weighed about 11.5 kg.
Another type of rocket in development was to be the subject of real scientific study. The RM-34 rocket was to have a peak of 14.5 km and its mission would be to control the wind at altitude.
However, in 1962 the work was suspended.
The successor to the first RM rockets was the Meteor-1 rocket, which was built during the years 1962 and 1965.
It was designed as a two-stage rocket, with a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three types (called Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed, which differed from each other by the space available for scientific apparatus.
In the Meteor-1A rocket the available space for the volume was 0.4 liters, in the Meteor-1B 0.34 liters and in the Meteor-1C 0.62 liters.
The maximum peak in the three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, the Meteor-2 rocket was developed at the Air Institute, whose first aerial tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had an initial weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a payload of 10 kg up to 60 km in height.
Later the Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were built.
It is also necessary to mention Poland’s entry into the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the formation of the National Committee of COSPAR two years later.
As part of the Interkosmos program, Poland joined the space exploration on Soviet artificial satellites and, in 1978, Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmo after Vladimir Remek.
The suspension of the social work law is not the solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court suspended the social work law.
The resolution sparked a heated debate in society.
It will certainly be interesting to examine the existing problem from a broader point of view.
Liberal economic systems in the EU, as well as in the globalised world, are based on the principle of greater economic competition and less regulation.
Consequently, this means that the different economic forms and national economic systems are in permanent conflict with each other.
The cause lies in the principle of free trade and the free and unlimited movement of private capital, together with unbridled financial speculation.
The effect of large differences in labour costs (wages) produces economic tensions.
Under this concept, it is necessary to understand the situation in which the manufacturer, with the import of cheap goods, tries to shorten distances and for this "provokes a drop" in the price of the competitor in order to get the most of the market and thus increase its profit margin.
On a large scale, for most employers, it means moving production abroad, buying cheaper there or disappearing. The result is high unemployment in those countries where the price of labor, compared to other economies, is higher.
Because private capital has no social responsibility and is thus not responsible for the unemployment that this phenomenon generates, the social expenditure of the state necessarily increases.
All this situation fosters the total disinterest of employers to pay taxes and compensate for the economic and social damages they have caused in their desire to obtain profits.
The situation is so universally known that it is not necessary to provide specific statistical data.
The scrupulous practices of private capital create situations, in certain economies, in which the governments of these countries are forced to compete with the aim of artificially reducing the social level of their own population and thus attracting foreign capital to the country.
In other words, governments make private capital available to their own populations without regard to social decline.
This is especially evident in changes to existing laws.
The aim is to force the population to accept the dictates of private capital, especially with regard to wages.
This takes place, on the one hand, through the system of economic obligation in the case of long-term unemployment; on the other hand, through the restricted right of employees to labour rights.
The result is a growing poverty along with increasing differences between the poor and the rich.
For a number of years, there have been food delivery points in Germany for poor people who can’t keep up with their own work.
The number of people receiving this type of assistance has already reached one million.
In the context of the increase in the competitiveness of the German economy, there is a fairly common case: people employed with such a low wage that the state must pay the rest to reach the minimum necessary to survive.
A scandal of this kind was made public in connection with the situation of the auxiliary employees of the German federal parliament.
The austerity measures of virtually all the southern states of the EU lead, without a doubt, to the same situation. People, pressured by an abysmal decline of their social level, are forced to emigrate as in the nineteenth century or to live with a bad wage at the limit of society, in the hope that someday private inverse capital will arrive in the country.
Is it necessary to wonder where it comes from?
In the case of other EU countries, then poverty passes from one country to another or never comes, as Chinese, Indians, Brazilians, Turks, Moroccans, Egyptians or Africans continue to work for a small part of a European salary.
This also affects all of Latin America.
Liberal theories and the media claim to the utmost that the state should not provide capital to the economy, that directing the economy leads to its failure.
Private capital defends with nails and teeth the thesis that the state should not intervene in the economy by interfering in control.
It is then necessary to ask whether private capital does not, with its selfishness, influence the political march and, consequently, the whole state.
In this case, the answer is clearly yes.
The proof is the existence of lobbies, in practice very powerful and ubiquitous, in all states.
The result is a desperate situation that manifests itself in the area of corruption, in mutual favors, in legislation that is practically reprehensible everywhere but not punishable.
In Germany, the situation is as follows: State ministries, in the absence of financial means, entrust the drafting of legislation to private law firms, which are often linked to the industry.
These types of bills are later passed in the Bundestag, the German parliament.
Thus, all power does not emanate from the people, as proclaimed in the constitutions of Western democracies, but from the strong financial groups that represent their own interests.
It is obvious that democracies with a liberal orientation quickly find themselves in a situation such as that described by Appian in his work The Crisis of the Roman Republic in the Times of Caesar and Pompeii: "The state had been disintegrating for some time and administrations were engaged in force."
In exchange for bribes, illegitimately obtained favors and help to finance stones or swords.
The bribery and corruption were self-imposed without any impediment and people went to the polls with the vote aplauded in advance"... "there were no people with character who aspired to a position in the administration, so once, because of this disorganization, the state was eight months without consuls"... "It began to talk about it in a serious way"... "It was necessary to think that the
The conclusion, as in antiquity, is that today’s society is based on disregarded preferences of individual benefit without taking into account common interests.
Private capital is not capable, in its essence, of understanding and claiming the benefits of the whole of society.
The result is the same as that of then, an unprecedented decline of the elite, without any effort being made to reform it in depth.
The causes of the rise of fascist and communist regimes must therefore be sought in the unbridled liberalization of economic systems in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.
With respect to the current situation, it is possible to consider the disappearance of these systems for the benefit of a liberal democracy, as a definite pause, pending the next coup.
The truly devastating fact is that the current elite completely ignores the loss of hundreds of thousands of lives, social and humanitarian catastrophes we have witnessed, as well as the crimes against humanity, as we know them in ancient and most recent history.
Suspension of the public procurement law is not the solution; at least not in the long run.
Under pressure from economic competition, both internationally and within the EU, the government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to seek other ways to reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is, therefore, systemic.
The solution passes through concrete socio-political reforms, which strengthen both the participation of state capital and the influence of citizens in government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society for the benefit of the state.
Israel: The Laboratory of Chaos.
"That nothing comes from violence and nothing ever could", Sting in his song "Let's do not forget how fragile we are" (Let's not forget how fragile we are).
"If my children did not want wars, there would be none" Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, on his deathbed in 1849.
After the latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as always, various reactions have arisen.
One, on the Israeli side, argues for the right to self-defense and frames the Palestinians in the role of terrorists; the other supports the Palestinians and alleges racism on the part of the State of Israel, genocide perpetrated against Palestinian Arabs and staining Israel with a terrorist state.
After all, the citizens of Israel today, including the autonomous territories, were born within the current political situation and did not live the beginnings of violence.
My intention is to offer readers a look behind the scenes, a look to discover who is taking advantage of the tensions that have dragged on for 95 years (calculated from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) on a small area of land in the Middle East.
Some of my considerations are based on historical facts, others on conclusions that I have come to on the basis of my own way of understanding the matter, about who or what group of people is the main driver of the events of modern history.
In the history of mankind the history of the struggles for power is at the forefront.
In every age we can find a Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
But what is no longer so evident is whether it was always these characters who guided their steps autonomously or whether behind their throne there was someone who oriented their actions towards a certain goal.
We must accept that we live in an age that concentrates the wealth of the world in the hands of a few individuals and that this concentration of money and the power that this implies, has not been achieved in a single generation.
Among these astronomically rich families stands out one that could be considered the most prominent (if there is still someone behind it, I don’t know, but I don’t rule it out): the Rothschilds.
Not much is written about them.
Of course.
In the 1990s they bought the first news agency (Reuters) to stop associating their name with criminal acts of great gravity. Power and wealth, or both, covered their backs, which for them always meant a strengthening.
They have important stakes in almost all central banks in the world and in those countries where they are not represented, have been declared or are preparing a war: before the attack on Afghanistan there were 7 countries, after the attack on Iraq there were 5, after the overthrow of Gaddafi there were only four, but in the meantime Russia has subordinated the central bank to the Russian government.
Anyone who has tried to oppose this family has died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of the Rothschild central bank Bank of America, began printing money during the War of Secession, and was assassinated in 1865 in the theater.
JFK began printing money and wanted to suspend the Federal Reserve System (FED) and was assassinated in 1963; Congressman Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned in 1936 after wanting to sue the FED for triggering the Great Economic Crisis of 1929.
Their craving for world power led them during the years 1859 - 1871 to draw up a plan with three world wars, designed by Mason Albert Pike, decorated with the grade 33.
The first war was aimed at eliminating the great monarchical states throughout Europe; the second wanted to eliminate colonial supremacy, especially of Britain, and the third aimed to reduce the population of the earth between half a million and a billion people (similar number of slaves for their welfare and luxury would suffice and would not consume so many resources (in addition to the creation of a universal one), and ad pro).
The method by which the group of the richest families operates, together with the Rothschilds, follows the dynamics of crisis triggering and the subsequent offer of a solution (order ab cao - order from chaos).
These solutions are, however, wrong, and always lead to a worsening of the situation. If not, it is enough to remember that the Fed was created so as not to repeat a crisis like that of 1907.
So, after the success of the assassination of the Austro-Hungarian heir to the throne, Francis Fernando, in Sarajevo and after, as a result, the First World War was unleashed, they destroyed Tsarist Russia with the beginning of the Bolshevik revolution.
The First World War ended suddenly and unjustified from a military and economic point of view, the capitulation of Germany (the wars to end Tsarist Russia were no longer necessary) and the subsequent dismemberment of the great power of Central Europe, the Austro-Hungarian Empire.
In order to prepare the ground for the Second World War, they allowed the bankers and politicians to create, in an undercover manner, a conflicting situation following the enormous reparations of war imposed on Germany, thus creating the optimal conditions for the radicalization of the impoverished masses.
In the late 19th century, the Rothschilds pushed the foundation of the Zionist movement, a branch that aspired to the formation of a Jewish state, preferably in the region of ancient Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The aforementioned Balfour Declaration laid the foundation for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine and began the first conflicts with the local Arab population.
There were terrorist attacks on both sides.
World War II broke out: it is difficult to know whether Hitler pulled too much of the rope to which the international bankers had tied him in the beginning or whether everything he did was part of a plan. However, the suffering of European Jews in the concentration camps created the optimal conditions for the acceptance of the Jewish state in world society.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, similar to the way the war reparations imposed on Germany paved the way to World War II, with the proclamation of the state of Israel the focus was created for a third war.
If international bankers succeeded in initiating it, the Jewish nation, as in World War II, would become a front-line victim, now along with the Arab or generally Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is an immense laboratory, a machine of welding and chaos, not only within its own country, but also internationally. Let us take as an example how Israel’s sympathizers and detractors are sharply divided.
Who is guilty and who is the victim in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict? Where does injustice engender injustice in a spiral of endless violence, if at the beginning of everything was the greed of some individuals and their craving for world power?
At this point it is necessary to distinguish between the inhabitants of Israel and their leaders, because, as in our country, international bankers only present their candidates in elections.
The current president of Israel B. Netanyahu is the typical example of fascist politician, loyal to the international bankers, who does everything possible to declare war on Iran and, considering that Iran is a member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), would threaten to become a global conflict only and, if we take into account that Iran controls the world ( 20% of the world's crude oil).
In what light are now shown the words uttered by David Rockefeller in 1994: “All we need is a general crisis and people will agree to a new world order.”
The new world order in your imagination is a world of masters and slaves.
A world in which the rest of the population serves a handful of people who are part of the well-off financial aristocracy.
A world in which each new individual is implanted with a chip at birth that controls their entire being.
And it forces all, small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to have a mark on their right hand or on their forehead, not to be able to buy or sell, unless they bear the name of this monster or the numbers of its name.
It is necessary to understand: whoever has two fingers in front, add the numbers of this monster.
The number marks the person and this number is six hundred and sixty-six.”
Argo movie: If it gets raw, call Hollywood
In November 1979, a group of Islamist student protesters occupied the U.S. embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
His release was to be in exchange for the dethroned Shah Mohamed Reza Pahlevi, who after the revolution fled to the US, a country that had sponsored his regime for decades.
For the American administration, the situation offered no positive perspective: throwing the shah over the edge could not be allowed, since if it did, it would jeopardize the confidence of its allies in other countries.
But the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution had resulted in the constitution of the theocratic regime, was not within its reach.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which subsequently intensified further with the failed attempt to release the hostages by force.
The detained diplomats were released 444 days after the Algerian government’s negotiating intervention.
In the U.S., his fate caused a wave of solidarity and enthusiasm against Iran.
The failure in Iran contributed decisively to Jimmy Carter’s defeat against Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The film "Argo" by director and actor Ben Affleck themes an episode of this story, which garnered a small success for America.
Shortly before occupying the embassy, six employees escaped from the building.
After a difficult journey, they ended up in the residence of the Canadian embassy.
The CIA, in collaboration with the Canadian authorities, managed to get them out of Iran, to which a covert story helped an extravagant point: they came out with Canadian passports, as members of the film team examining the location in the country for the filming of a science fiction superproduction.
Gender combinations
The plan drawn up by “exfiltration” expert Toni Mendez required Hollywood’s collaboration.
To make the lie seem true, it was written about the film project in specialized magazines, press conferences were organized, the fictional production society even had a real office.
The details of the operation were kept secret for a long time, the film has been made from the memories of Tony Mendez.
The Affleck film is a unique combination of several genres.
On the one hand, a realistic political thriller; on the other hand, a so-called "caper movie", the story of an episode that went well, a hoax (an example might be the Ocean's Eleven series).
In the film, moods are combined. On the one hand, we find well-documented sequences of Tehran. In the credit sequence are shown emblematic photographs of the time of events, which were similarly reflected in the film; there are not many differences in this regard.
On the other hand, typical Hollywood scenes are a bit lighter, marked by irony and a slight exaggeration.
And in addition, scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions: dressed men analyzing the situation at the negotiating table, in the hallways of the office, by phone...
Ben Affleck has managed to restart his career in an excellent way.
The actor, who had been the subject of mockery, has become a respectable director and his way of acting has ceased to be the target of ironic comments.
Argo is her third feature film, after "Goodbye little, Goodbye" (2007) and the thriller "The Town. City of Thieves" (2010).
At the same time, it is Affleck’s first film in which the action does not take place in the city of Boston, where he grew up.
Also, the sensitivity of capturing the atmosphere of the place was a feature that placed the directors of old films above Hollywood standards.
And Affleck demonstrates it in Argo, where Tehran is “wheeling” in Canada.
The best scenes of the film take place on the streets, in the reconstruction of true events.The introductory sequence of the embassy take is impressive for its synoptic ability that, at the same time, conveys the thrill of the baffling and lack of foresight that arises when, somewhere, history takes a step forward.
Affleck and his collaborators get a similar effect on the fictional scenes (the imposter team at Tehran’s bazaar).
Too much action in too many places
The director had to accept the fact that a story told does not offer much in the cinematic sense of the most intriguing scenes.
Sometimes it adds something to reality: here everything doesn’t come out so elegantly (the scene of the crisis at Tehran airport, the diverting of a call to America and the unbridled search behind its tracks become madness).
Argo’s weakness is the out of control that arises from the need to show too much action in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman have a very funny role as Hollywood collaborators, although their characters deserved more space and are not, much less, the only ones in this film.
For these reasons, Affleck's film loses a bit of dramatic trait, but it is a film that can be followed with a moderate interest, value its realization and the retro style of a thriller evoking the 70s.
But if it collapses, that's gonna be hard.
As an evocation of a real story and as proof of how exaggerated the notions of omnipresence and omniscience of the secret services can be, it is enough.
Rules for inflating balloons, bananas and circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which each year presents a survey on the most absurd bank rates, has now decided to announce the competition on "the most absurd regulations or ideas of the EU workshop".
"It occurred to us after the last event, the EU plans to approve a 40 percent share of women in leadership positions in the big European companies," said Pravo Patrik Nacher, the organizer of the survey.
Among the absurdities nominated is, for example, the recent decision of the European Court of Justice to unify insurance policies between men and women.
So far, women have been taking advantage of better prices in life insurance because they represent objectively less risk.
"Other incredible ideas from the EU workshop can be proposed by people by the end of this year."
The election will take place at the end of February 2013,” Nacher said.
Among the disputed EU regulations is, for example, the compulsory addition of biocomponents to fuel which, as a result, damages the environment; another prohibition is the use of lifelong mercury thermometers only because they contain a small amount of a dangerous substance or the directive shadows the size of the hens' cages, which has contributed to this considerable price increase.
It has criticized the factual prohibition of using the term "butter butter" or the removal of the classic bulb from the shops.
A quality banana should be 14 centimeters long.
The Union apparatus makes such decisions often under the pressure of one or another commercial or industrial lobby whose demands in Brussels are normally defended by some state or group of states (the Czech Republic, even with the threat of veto, reclaims the demands of its banks).
The interests of a lobby were behind the request, for example, that higher-quality bananas should be at least 14 centimeters long in the EU and could not have "abnormal curvatures".
The European Commission defended itself by saying that with this it only seeks to harmonize the unhomogenized national rules to date, which only complicate their marketing.
The rules referring to fruits and vegetables in the EU, despite opposition from some states, have been softened on the basis that the existing directive entails a waste of foodstuffs.
The candidate to win the survey could be last year’s EU prescription that inflatable balloons being marketed are mandatory to warn that children under the age of 8 are not allowed to inflate them without the supervision of an adult.
The U.S. referred here to an American study that, when it comes to toys, balloons are the main cause of child death from asphyxiation.
A similar restriction is also in force on the use of sows by children up to 14 years of age.
Curious incidents are born even in our country
Equally absurd is the regulation on European officials: anyone who has any official function in the EU cannot use the name of Macedonia. In order not to hurt the sensitivity of Greece, we must talk about FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The Bankovnípoplatky.com server, in collaboration with the association of liberal economists Laisser Faire, nominated in the survey, among some absurd proposals mentioned above, the Union’s prescription on the volume of food supplies in the territory of a member state.
The EU has determined the maximum volumes of food supplies that can be found on the territory of the Czech Republic on the same day of our entry into the EU.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the established volume for canned mushrooms, which posed a substantial threat of fines.
The survey organizers were also interested in paying those countries that do not have access to the sea and the idea of granting a grant for the application of grants.
This kind of ideas did not arise in Brussels but in Prague.
“We are disadvantaged by the fact that we do not have a sea.
We ask the European Union for compensation," said then-Agriculture Minister Jaroslav Palas (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD) in the autumn of 2004.
He argued it with the fact that in our country a lot of cereal was produced and, as a result of the so-called intervention purchases, the state had the warehouses full and had to export.
According to Palas, given that the Czech Republic is far from seaports, the EU should pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
In the end, the European Commission was willing to help the Czech Republic and organised a public tender for the purchase of cereals from countries without access to the sea.
The grant to receive a grant was proposed to the municipalities by the Ministry for Local Development headed by Minister Pavel N<0xC4><0x9B>mec (US-DEU). Specifically, it is intended for the drafting of Brussels grant applications.
EU: Rare prescriptions are an exception
The guidelines of the Member States are often subject to criticism, the EU's regulatory efforts and more effective functioning and development across the Union deserve our recognition, according to several experts.
According to experts, the most serious problem is, for example, the collection of EU grants for projects that have nothing to do with deepening European integration, but that Member States have achieved in the negotiations on budgets.
The Czechs are also affected by the sensitive fibre, in the same way as other countries of the Union, by the struggle for the right to the designation of origin of their traditional products, even though our country has not always been victorious in these struggles.
The Czechs, after six years of disputes with Germans and Austrians, successfully defended the designation of origin of the Olomouc cheese, but had to change its name to the national rum, whose tradition in our country dates back to the 19th century, and it was renamed "tuzemák".
Only products made from sugar cane distillate can be called rum, but not those made from sugar beet.
In the official list of protected designations of origin of the EU, together with the feta and gorgonzola cheeses known worldwide, the mazapan of the German city of Lübeck or the ham of Parma, there are already for example the cookies of Karlovy Vary, the carp of Poho<0xC5><0x99>elice and of T<0xC5><0x99>ebo<0xC5><0x88> and, even, the variety of lúa de pul.
As EU protected marshes, they can be proud of Pardubice’s gingerbread and the barges of Ho<0xC5><0x99>ice v Podkrkono<0xC5><0xA1>í.
People want me to save the republic, but I'm a fan, says Okamura
Senator, how did you come up with the idea of running for president?
It's not about being a senator or president.
If all was well in our country, then I would not submit my candidacy.
But I can no longer stand to see how robbed in our country over the last twenty years, how thieves go unpunished, taxes and retirement age rise.
He had no ambitions to be a politician.
When I see something I don’t like, I try to come up with a solution to change it.
And since I’m forty years old and my candidacy is independent, the only chance I have to change things is to present myself as a senator or president.
The Senate has already arrived, but shortly afterwards it has set out on its way to the presidency.
Is he not turning his back on the people who voted for him?
I always said that my candidacy for the presidency depended on the results of the Senate elections.
I later stated that if I was elected senator, I would present my candidacy for the presidency.
But my goal is not function; function is the tool with which I can make my own ideas a reality.
That is why I need as much influence as possible and the strongest mandate as possible.
The problem is not only that we are a nation that we criticize in the bar or in front of the television, but that we trample anyone who wants to initiate change.
To this are added the media, which discredit you and confuse freedom of expression with the freedom to lie.
I am said to have bribed journalists or been an adviser to Ji<0xC5><0x99>í Paroubek.
Let's talk about your ideas.
It presents itself to the presidential struggle with financial theses and criminal responsibilities of politicians and the declaration of property above twenty million.
For this, the law must be changed.
As president, he does not have this competence and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws.
How do you want to solve it?
As a citizen, I have been part of a pressure group for the guiding profession to be recognized as self-employed, and we have succeeded.
The problem is in politics: if someone comes up with a good proposal, whether from the right or the left, it is deliberately rejected and this affects citizens.
As an independent candidate, I have more potential to get the support of all parliamentary groups.
Without party embezzlements or dogmas, I have the ability to choose something from each party that is best for our country and apply it.
Do you consider yourself a right-winger or a left-winger?
From the Czech point of view, I have the impression that people consider me more of a leftist.
It doesn’t matter to me, whether it’s a little left or a little right.
What matters to me is that we move forward.
I don’t care if someone is on the right or the left, I want to unite people.
I always openly support any good solution, regardless of whether the proposal comes from the KS<0xC4><0x8C>M or the SDGs and, in the same way, I will be against bad ideas.
It's a joke when you're told you're a populist.
But isn't he proving it with what he says?
When creating a business plan for the company, you also have certain goals and ideals.
And you're trying to get close to them.
There will be those who call it populism, but all the proposals I am talking about are already working in the world or well-known experts are talking about them.
Without the support of the parliament, however, there are only slogans left.
And with that, he cannot survive in politics in the long run.
Or do you believe that if you address people and talk to them, you will get, for example, criminal and financial responsibility?
I have no other choice.
Convince politicians, journalists and civil society and try to put them on my side to achieve it.
If elected president, there would be no problem in organizing a live television broadcast in which he would ask the leaders of parliamentary parties to legitimize criminal and financial responsibility for state politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
And eventually, they would have to communicate why they don’t want to.
If there is a strong character pointing out the disputes, you can put pressure on the political scene.
Take for example the direct election of the president, which has been an achievement of public pressure.
At the same time I claim that I am only an amateur, I am neither a genius nor an intellectual.
For my opinions and ideals I try to find allies.
I just started out in politics and I try to get as much support as possible for my program.
I’m trying to get things going myself, but in case it doesn’t go well, in six years I’ll leave it and go back to the private sector.
It sounds a bit like Okamura was going to save the Czech Republic.
I am not a savior.
I know I don’t do anything with a person, that’s why I’ve visited a number of well-known personalities, just in case they would be encouraged to submit their candidacy to the Senate.
I went to see Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura, but he refused because he had a lot of work.
For my part, I have at least supported investigative journalist Jana Lorencová, who exposed the frauds with light heating oils.
I introduced myself on the basis that people are really dissatisfied, now I’m on the scale.
Sixty percent of the population did not go to the polls and those who did voted for the establishment representatives.
In the Senate, we are two from the independent sector.
The people chose the senate, so it will be difficult to make changes.
However, I will defend my own ideas, such as the direct election of mayors or governors.
Are you considering forming your own party?
I have not considered it yet because I do not have time for it, to check the spotless past of each of the potential members of the party, nor do I have money.
I have no money for the presidential campaign, in my transparent account there are only 20,000 crowns.
You don't have any money?
Speaking of property statements, how's yours?
I estimate my private property at about 60 million.
In Prague I have a land valued at 25 million, a flat valued at ten million, another flat valued at eight million, a collection of artworks worth ten million, an Aston Martin worth about 3.5 million and a <0xC5><0xA0>koda Superb valued at one million, and in the account I have a couple of millions.
By the way, I have an Aston Martin because it was my youth dream. I always liked James Bond, who drove this car, was gallant with women and, at the same time, fought against evils and injustices.
Do you drive an Aston Martin, your property is valued at 60 million and have no money for the campaign?
You say you want to change the republic but you don't want to put too much money on your side.
It's not very convincing.
I don't have $15 million for the campaign.
Do I have to owe myself?
I've already put 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I have no sponsors shows that there is not much interest in my program.
And I have no obligation to pay the campaign with money from my pocket.
Campaign expenses essentially cover what I will receive as a Senator's salary.
But I couldn't live from it, for example, I couldn't pay my son for English school, which costs 30,000 kronor a month.
If I just wanted to make money, then I wouldn’t be a candidate.
So you will continue your business activity to be able to live?
Didn't you say before that you were going to quit this activity?
This has nothing to do with a higher salary.
As I promised, in part I have left my activities.
For example, the representative of my travel agency will become my replacement in the spring.
People would want me to be the Samaritan who saved the republic.
But I also need to live on something.
How much do you usually earn monthly as an entrepreneur?
Between 200,000 and 400,000, which I still win.
If I were president, I would quit business.

The MVRDV architecture studio demonstrates that true adventures are not only in the head - in the example of the Spijkenisse library and the newly completed "book mountain" - 2 photos
“I think the building is fun, has a futuristic look, and there’s finally something interesting to see,” says Lisette Verhaig, a passer-by passing through the street.
And Stefan Spermon, an IT technician at a large company located near the library, points out: “Furthermore, the building is beautiful.”
But I wonder why we need a library nowadays.
We all have internet, tablets and e-books.
Nobody likes to go into those old-fashioned libraries, right?
Spijkenisse, a dormitory city at the gates of Rotterdam that is hardly worth a quick visit, has the dubious honor of having stood up with a record to forget.
The population of 80,000 has the lowest literacy rate in the Netherlands.
To counteract this shameful situation, a few years ago it was decided to somehow contribute to the general culture and copy the seven fictitious bridges that appear on the euro banknotes in the form of decorated reinforced concrete miniatures.
The success of the educational offensive was limited.
And that’s how the politicians decided that there was only one way to improve the statistics: build a library!
Winy Maas, from the Dutch architecture studio MVRDV, a master in the art of bar diagrams and responsible for fun buildings while cynical, took the subject with his usual serenity and appeared at the presentation of the competition in 2003 with five books under his arm and a smile on his face.
And as the jury looked perplexed around him and shrugged his shoulders, Maas proceeded to stack the books by size forming a pyramid and concluded his brief speech with the following words: “Dear fellow citizens:
Here you have it, my proposal for the mountain of books of Spijkenisse, the so-called 'Boekenberg'."
Nine years later, the <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>30 million mountain rises in its intended place.
This is part of the revitalization project, which is completed with an underground car park, a supermarket, a post office and a couple of residential and townhouse buildings.
In early November the mountain of books was awarded the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012".
In addition, the project is also nominated for the "Dutch National Wood Award 2012".
In this way, the small town lacking history, which to date had nothing more to offer than a postmodern pedestrian area and an incredibly ugly town hall behind whose white facade one would rather intuit a dairy plant, now has a work of contemporary architecture.
But above all, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in its history.
The Long Way to the Book
The first impression is that it is a paradise of books under a cheese.
It is true that there is an elevator that transports us right to the center of this mountainous massif, but true lovers of space and reading do not use it, but prefer to merge with its topography at every step of its climb to the top.
The fully glazed interior is bright and easy to see, the anchored brick floor and elegant lighthouses unequivocally support the public condition of the library.
The urban environment is perfect.
As you raise your eyes you can see the park benches, dogs and boys and girls playing football.
And everywhere books, books and more books.
“Normally the bookshelves are arranged along the facade and in the center opens a huge dark room that is usually somewhat uncomfortable and impersonal,” says Winy Maas.
What we have done is put our legs up the classic spatial configuration and take the reading area from the inside to the outside.
The interior of the mountain is very well exploited: in the middle are the offices, the Internet library, the chess club, the environmental education center and the maintenance room.
Special mention deserve the black shelves that assume the functions of wall cladding, parapet and railing at the same time.
The sight, touch and smell are strange.
Even the most up-to-date architects and civil engineers shake their heads when they hear about this unknown material.
“We wanted to work with recycled materials,” explains Joop Trouborst, project manager in the city of Spijkenisse.
And this is how one day, on a Frisian farm, we come across the right by-product from agriculture.
For many years, in greenhouses and fields in the Netherlands, a plastic fabric of a few millimeters thick has been used as a base for holding the roots of the crops.
It is a cheap and efficient material.
This fine fabric lasts two seasons and is then discarded.
For the library this fabric was pressed, for the first time in such quantities, to obtain plates four centimeters thick.
With heat and pressure, the so-called agricultural plastic (KLP) changes color and becomes a dark, homogeneous and resistant material that smells like a new car and shoe mix.
After 105 steps you reach the top of the mountain.
At the end of this continuous route of almost 500 meters around the mountain awaits us the reward: from the cafeteria you not only have a fantastic view of the city, but you can also enjoy tasty Dutch croquettes and their ficus planted in huge pots.
These create a pleasant environment while maintaining the right atmospheric humidity for this mountain of literature.
Donations for a new soul
“Although it is hard to believe given its large glazed surfaces, this building is an exemplary project in terms of ecology,” says Trouborst.
The necessary heating and cooling is obtained from geothermal energy.
Although the mountain of books is located under a huge glass pyramid, even on the sunniest days the sun only shines for a few hours inside.
The huge wooden fences located transversely to the glass facade serve to give shade and absorb most of the sun’s rays.
This creates a comfortable indoor climate.
The rest is a matter of automatic blinds.
Stefan Spermon, the skeptical worker in the Information Technology sector, has already dared to set foot in the new library.
And Lisette Verhaig has also been there.
Also, traditional Chinese medicine professor Cynthia Bogarde has visited the library. She qualifies the "Boekenberg" as the "late soul" of Spijkenisse.
The reason is that, on the occasion of the inauguration that took place a couple of weeks ago, all the inhabitants of the city were invited to donate a book from their private collection.
In this way, it is intended to fill, for the moment, the optical gaps of a library that does not yet have its complete archive; currently it has 70,000 copies.
The concept has come to a halt.
The shelves are full.
“There is nothing worse than a half-empty library,” says architect Winy Maas.
“I think that thanks to our initiative now all the inhabitants have a certain link with this building.
Everyone knows that your book is part of the library.
Even if it's just there to decorate.
In this way, the MVRDV study has achieved full success in that queen discipline that in the specialized slang is known as "creation of an identity".
The city of Spijkenisse has written a piece of the history of literature.
Regardless of how young and uninformed he may be.
Finally a starting point to shape your identity.
Szabo: "Germans must play a more prolific role"
Germany abstained in the vote on the admission of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on U.S.-Europe relations, this puts Berlin in a rather hairy diplomatic position.
Deutsche Welle: Earlier this week, Germany indicated that it would vote against the proposal to grant the Palestinian territories the status of a United Nations observer state.
However, Berlin finally abstained.
Why is that?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis have done in Gaza.
Now, because of the special relationship that unites the country with Israel, Germany must be careful.
But at the same time, I don’t think it supports the American stance either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence without being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained when it came to establishing a no-fly zone.
This has finally been declared by NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear stance when important international issues are at stake?
Yes, it is.
This is because he is currently reorienting his foreign policy, moving away from a policy led, so to speak, by the United States and focusing on a German foreign policy.
And what makes it even more difficult is that Europeans do not have a coherent and uniform policy.
Therefore, the Germans are at a crossroads.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to doing so.
I think they are still trying to figure out what their role will be, but they have already begun the road to a “normal” foreign policy.
A foreign policy similar to countries such as France or Britain.
What exactly does a "normal" foreign policy mean from the German point of view?
It is a policy that, when it comes to national interests, is willing to defend positions different from those of the United States or its European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy finds a strong motivation in economic policy, that is, in exports and in its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
The German economic interests are to some extent different from those of other great powers and for this reason Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests influenced the position taken with regard to the conflict in the Middle East and the UN vote?
On the one hand, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf.
For this reason, she must be careful and not alienate herself from Arab public opinion, nor from the Arab elites.
This is important, of course.
But I wouldn’t give it that much importance since it’s not a totally unilateral relationship.
However, they do play a key role in German considerations.
Has Germany undermined its relationship with the US by abstaining from voting on important decisions such as the vote on Palestine?
I believe that in Europe, and even in the United States, the German stance enjoys an enormous degree of understanding.
For this reason, I do not think there has been such a drastic breakup as in the case of Libya.
Perhaps that is how Germany has managed to earn some respect.
After all, all this has only shown that it is a country that is taken seriously as an international actor and whose interests must be taken into account.
In Europe, there are differing views on the Palestinian initiative.
Instead, the U.S. has clearly shown itself in favour of a veto.
Is there a difference of opinion between the United States and many European nations?
These disparities have always existed because of U.S. domestic policy.
I think the Obama administration is secretly showing a great understanding of the European position.
But, because of the political situation here, it is clear that the government cannot publicly defend that position.
I believe that the true disparity of opinions does not really have the scope that is attributed to it.
If we look at the relationship between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, we see that Obama is not at all enthusiastic about the policy he develops.
Is it difficult for Germany to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the position of its main partners in the EU, on the other?
I think that’s exactly what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
Of course it would be a little easier for the Germans if there were a coherent and homogeneous European policy, but that is not the case.
Therefore, they do not have the possibility of being part of a higher being, but they must push things from their own position.
That is exactly what they are doing now with the euro.
I believe that in the future Germany will take a leading role in forcing Europe to take a European position.
Of course, this is not easy for Germany, either simply because of its relationship with Israel.
This has always been a hot topic.
But I think the Germans are clear that they must play the role of an independent figure.
Does Germany see itself in the role of an important international actor? Does Germany really want to take on a leading role?
Or is it still hard for you to accept that leadership?
Germany has not yet become accustomed, it is always somewhat uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, the country still finds it difficult to play a more important role.
If we look at the euro crisis, for example, we see that every time Germany is positioned as the main player, certain anti-German sentiments are unleashed.
This is not easy for the Germans.
This is an old problem and no one wants to be surrounded by enemy countries.
Seen in this way, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It must show a responsive attitude towards different neighbors and opinions and that is not easy.
The U.S. influence on European politics is diminishing more and more, but the EU does not yet fill that void, so who is left?
The Germans will have no choice but to take on a more prolific role.
Even if they don’t like it, if they find it unpleasant or if it makes them an even more unpopular people, it’s life!

"Mark Protection" in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese brands
Armani is a world-renowned brand and Polo Ralph Lauren as well.
What is Armani Polo?
Behind this name is a name officially registered in China but that has nothing to do with the original companies.
However, it enjoys protection as long as the true eponyms do not file a lawsuit.
And even then it is not clear that they will be given the reason.
“Foreigns are finding it increasingly difficult to protect their trademarks in China,” said Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer for Taylor Wessing, a law firm specializing in protection rights violations in the Far East.
Every week a new case comes to my table.
Imitators simply add a couple of letters to register their trademarks.
In this way, Gucci becomes Lu-Gucci and instead of Prada, Prada-Kny is registered.
German companies are also legally copied in the same way, as has happened to the sportswear manufacturer Puma.
Pattloch opens a filing cabinet that holds seats at the Beijing Trademark Office.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company applied to register the Zegna DF Puma brand, an artificial name that was also used by the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
That the Chinese are world champions in copying and violating intellectual property rights is well known.
In the big cities there are large warehouses of several plants dedicated exclusively to the sale of counterfeits.
However, Pattloch’s cases are of a different nature. On behalf of his clients, he is fighting against the fact that the trade mark office officially grants Chinese companies the right to take advantage of a name that is already registered elsewhere.
The Chinese call it "Bang Ming Pai" or accompanying brand.
The word has its origin in the Chinese term "Bang Dakuan",
It refers to women who have "fished" a rich man.
Chinese authorities do not feel guilty
“It’s detrimental to business, we have to fight it,” Pattloch demands.
"The brand makes waters, the monopoly position disappears and the damage that the image suffers is enormous."
The financial losses and procedural costs of the affected sectors are multi-millionaires, especially in the case of luxury emblematic products.
According to data from the market analysis company CLSA, with a volume of 15 billion euros per year, China is, in size, the third market for luxury goods and the fastest growing.
However, obtaining the cancellation of registrations of dubious legality in the registration of trademarks is complicated and also involves a lot of money.
The process can be extended to nine years and the result is uncertain.
Pattloch talks about cases in which the court dismissed a lawsuit because it had been so long since the name being the subject of the lawsuit had already become a "market reality".
“If the plaintiff is unlucky, he may even have to pay the plagiarist money because the process has damaged the plagiarist’s brand in China,” Pattloch said.
Sometimes this is the law of the jungle.
Some of the most well-known cases have to do with graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler-Benz lost a lawsuit against the construction machinery manufacturer Sany, the company that has recently been absorbed by the German concrete pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
That’s why today the Chinese can still use a very similar emblem to the Mercedes star.
Volvo’s buyer, Geely, initially used a white-and-blue logo that was largely reminiscent of BMW; the case was settled in court and Geely had to modify it.
Lacoste lost in China against imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore whose logo represented a crocodile looking in the opposite direction to the original.
The Chinese authorities do not feel guilty.
The CTMO brand office in Beijing recognizes that in 2010 they have had difficulties due to a shortage of equipment and staffing.
Last year, however, "the labor emergency situation returned to normal."
In this way, the number of unprocessed complaint processes has been reduced by 22%.
Nearly 57,000 of these cases were resolved, 75% more than the previous year.
However, 81,500 claims are still pending resolution.
Fighting this costs a lot of money
As usual in China, the numbers are surprising.
Last year, the CTMO registered more than 1.4 million trademark protection applications, almost a third more than in 2010.
It would be a new record and means China is leading the list of new entries worldwide for the tenth year in a row, according to the brand office.
It seems this is also the case with the number of valid logos, a figure that amounts to 5.5 million in total.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan would have been pocketed in terms of rights.
In other words, this means that on average each registration costs 1,280 yuan or 160 euros.
Fighting this costs a lot of money, as demonstrated by the case of the German family business Freudenberg.
For more than seven years the group has been fighting in court against a Chinese imitator.
While the Germans have succeeded in stopping the illegal manufacture of imitation car parts,
the imitator has managed to secure the Chinese rights to the Freudenberg brand.
"We ourselves have caused this situation because in Germany the surnames are not protected," says Hanno Wentzler, President and CEO of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The CTMO trademark office also dismissed the Munich appeal.
In the following two instances, Freudenberg was right, but the opposing party is still fighting today.
You have to be very careful.
The case has now reached the doors of the High Court of Justice, where a decision is still pending.
Wentzler trusts in being able to settle the matter favorably and praises the professionalism of the courts.
However, it also states that “the procedure is extremely costly, both in terms of money and time.”
It is difficult to estimate internal costs; the business file has had to review files up to a hundred years old in order to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg offered the opposite party a "six-digit euro sum" with the aim of reaching a friendly agreement, but it was unsuccessful.
“This shows how much we care,” Wentzler says.
The dangers that lie in the Far East threaten even to affect Europe.
In particular, if the imitators are insured there rights on unprotected trademarks.
Thus, a Chinese manufacturer tried to register in Germany the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather products.
The group had long since abandoned this trade area, but managed to prevent registration.
“We have to be very careful,” says Wentzler.
Both he and lawyer Pattloch recommend that German companies be extremely prudent when doing business with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trademark law, but what needs to be done is to "register also in China everything that may be susceptible to protection", as Wentzler points out.
Otherwise, the subject can prove to be much more expensive than a simple registration.
In fact, should Freudenberg lose the last assault of his particular battle, then he would have to pay the opposing party licensing rights in his own name, as explained by Wentzler.
That or in the segment in question would drive us out of the market.
World AIDS Day: Dancing, Singing, Helping
In Heidelberg the Imbongi choir rehearses and in Swaziland the AIDS orphans rejoice
The story of a link capable of surpassing much more than 8,733 kilometers away.
First it starts with the dance: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, heel shoes and moccasins look for the compass on the parquet floor, and quickly find it.
One, two, three, four.
Only then do the voices of the singers slowly begin to rise (contralto, bajo, tenor and soprano), rolling, numbing and following each other.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old director, threatens to almost get out of his boxes by trying to put order in his energetic and soft gestures.
It is Monday afternoon and in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg the Imbongi choir rehearses a new song.
The fifty singers, aged between 23 and 69, have also arrived, from the human geneticist to the master of the house.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy piece, each voice of the choir has a different text and in addition in a foreign language barely known: Zulu, a language spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and in some areas of Swaziland.
Help for self-help
According to an estimate by UNAIDS, the United Nations AIDS Programme, there are approximately 34 million people infected with HIV worldwide.
23.5 million of them live in southern Africa.
There are 245,000 AIDS orphans in Swaziland.
More than 40% of the population is already HIV-positive.
The Voices for Africa association has found in Germany sponsors for the 180 AIDS orphans of the village of Esitjeni.
Seventy of them attend high school.
For 15 or 20 euros per month you can sponsor a child.
This contribution will cover school tuition, uniform and guarantee you a hot meal a day at the Gogo Center.
Imbongi means in Zulu "story-teller" or "panegirist".
In this room no one knows how to speak this Bantu language fluently, but they know how to sing.
For ten years this choir has been rehearsing songs in this soft foreign language that sometimes manages to transport them to their place of origin: South Africa.
At 8,733 kilometers straight from Heidelberg, in the northeast of the kingdom of Swaziland, there is a village called Esitjeni that depends on the voices of this German choir.
Forty percent are infected.
Approximately 2,000 people live there, some still in simple clay and straw huts, many of them children.
More than 300 no longer have parents because they have succumbed to AIDS.
Esitjeni is a small example of what affects Swaziland: the highest rate of AIDS infection and the lowest life expectancy worldwide, according to UNICEF.
The population does not see circumcision with good eyes, a practice that has been shown to halve the risk of contagion.
More than 40% of Swaziland’s inhabitants are carriers of the immunodeficiency virus, and dying at just over thirty years of age has become commonplace.
During a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the choir discovered this secluded population, but what they saw most of all were many children on the streets who lacked not only the protection of their parents, but the main thing: food, clothing and training.
Without a school diploma, the opportunities in a poor country are more than scarce.
At first it was only the particular commitment of a few that made it possible for a child to go to school and enjoy a hot meal a day. All this for a few euros.
However, a year later the choir founded the association "Voices for Africa" which has since been professionally caring for AIDS orphans in Esitjeni.
Facts about Sexually Transmitted Infections
What are the main sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial STDs include syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea.
The most common viral STDs are AIDS, human papillomavirus, genital herpes, or hepatitis.
Snails and scabies are among parasitic-transmitted STDs.
What are the main groups of affected?
Syphilis and gonorrhea are more common in men who have sex with other men.
The Robert Koch Institute is based on the fact that at least four out of every five cases of syphilis recorded in Germany have their origin in sexual contact between men.
In heterosexual adults, the most common sexually transmitted diseases are chlamydia, trichomonas, human papillomavirus, candidiasis (fungus) and gonorrhea.
HIV transmission among the country’s heterosexual adults is relatively low; however, approximately 20% of new HIV infections are recorded in this group.
Chlamydia infections are much more common among young people than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three-quarters of all infections affect young people between the ages of 15 and 25.
In our country, the human papilloma virus is also added to the most common diseases among youth.
How has the number of infections evolved?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to mandatory declaration.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of syphilis infections has doubled from 1,697 in 2001 to 3,698 in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has been on a downward trend since 2007.
Approximately 2,700 cases were registered in 2011.
This is one-tenth less than in the previous year.
What symptoms indicate that it is a venereal disease?
Infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, discomfort when urinating, flow, abdominal pain, as well as blisters or warts.
They often do not cause pain or cause other symptoms and therefore are not detected.
How can one protect oneself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of contagion, but they do not offer one hundred percent protection.
Some pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted through dirt and physical contact infections.
For this reason, experts recommend undergoing regular medical examinations, especially if you frequently change your sexual partner.
If diagnosed early, most STDs can be cured and any late consequences can be avoided.
Through collaborations, donations and, last but not least, of the fees charged by the choir for its performances throughout Germany, they collect a lot of money.
"In total, we have already sent some 200,000 euros to Esitjeni," said Annette Lennartz, president of the association.
In the village of Zodwa Dlamini, a woman with self-confidence and leadership skills manages the money sent from Germany.
He makes sure that the orphans find a good accommodation, for example with one of the grandmothers.
The "gogos", as older women are called in Zulu, are the pillars of the people.
Some of them have up to 14 orphans in their care, offer them a roof where to live and take care that children come to school every day on time and dressed in their uniforms.
Those who have no one are under the protection of Khanyisile, a single woman who, like the two cooks who cook for more than 200 hungry children every day, receives a salary from the association.
In addition, Voices of Africa has set up a sewing school, built two chicken coops and, in collaboration with the U.S. health organization PSI, managed to get many of the villagers to undergo an HIV test.
This is not obvious, since, despite how obvious this disease is throughout the country, it is not often spoken openly about it.
A king with 14 wives
“AIDS is an absolute taboo,” says Annette Lennartz, “because it has to do with sexuality.”
Something strange in a country where the king officially has 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his opulent lifestyle and full of excesses.
Politics instead of democracy.
This officially unacceptable way of life is largely responsible for the rapid spread that the HIV virus has experienced in recent decades.
But it is also due to the countless temporary ones who travel the country from side to side and take it wherever they go.
According to Annette Lennartz, "on any corner you can get condoms for free, but these are barely used.
It’s another culture, here they only accept skin-to-skin contact.”
To foster cultural exchange, the Imbongi choir travels every two or three years through South Africa singing songs that speak of melancholy, combative spirit, hope and confidence in the black race, songs that many in the southernmost end of the African continent still remember from the era of apartheid.
A bus full of whites singing songs in a language of blacks; so much recognition not only brings with it an excellent atmosphere and a lot of joy, but has also managed to tear off a couple of tears to some angry border soldier.
The trip always takes them to Esitjeni, where the singers visit the sponsored children.
Although this small population barely appears on maps, in the valley of the Ezulweni River it is very well known.
“Go to Esitjeni, the light is shining there,” the locals say.
And after traveling the 8,733 kilometers in a straight line back to Heidelberg to the Bergheimer street rehearsal rooms filled with singers marking the step, one realizes that it is also possible to see their light shining from there.
NASA Discovers Ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe has found evidence of ice on Mercury.
Probably the ice sheet has a thickness of up to 20 meters.
NASA, the U.S. space agency, has provided evidence of the existence of ice on Mercury.
Despite being the closest planet to the sun, there is also ice water, as shown by three studies published Thursday in the journal Science.
The Messenger probe would have found evidence that a layer of ice has formed in the permanently shadowed area of the planet.
It seems that this one is at least 30 centimeters and probably even up to 20 meters thick.
The water presumably comes from comets or, most likely, from asteroids that once collided with Mercury.
No one links the discovery of ice with the possibility that there is life on the planet, says Sean Solomon, the lead researcher of the Messenger probe.
The temperature in Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, the findings could help clarify how water and other components of life have reached other areas of the solar system.
Completely inadvertently for the inhabitants of planet Earth, probes, telescopes and small robots like the Phoenix are dedicated to exploring the depths of the universe.
From time to time they send images to Earth: small windows to the immensity of space.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers from the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets that make up our solar system, in addition to the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which revolves around the sun just behind Neptune, according to the new definition of the term published by the International Astronomical Union in 2006 Ceres is no "planet".
This section of an infrared image taken by the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" in which endless generations of stars appear: the oldest stars are shown as blue dots, although the most difficult to recognize is the pink color of the "newborn" stars.
This star-forming region, unromantally named by W5 scientists, was discovered by the Spitzer telescope in the constellation Casiopea, at a distance of 6,500 light-years.
This backstage image of an extinct star was taken by NASA’s Spitzer Telescope.
The donut-shaped ring is composed of the material that the star spits out in its extinction process.
In the huge Trifid Nebula, 5,400 light-years from Earth, new stars are formed from gas and dust.
NASA’s Spitzer Telescope took this photo of the galactic star formation zone.
The Pleiades, a group of stars also known by the nickname "The Seven Sisters", are an object visible to the naked eye in the night sky.
However, with the telescope you can better appreciate the colors.
The Helix Nebula appears as a huge red eye appears in this infrared image.
It is located 700 light-years from the constellation Aquarius.
His resemblance to a terrestrial continent has earned him the nickname of North America.
The combination of a normal photograph and an infrared image results in a spectacular color.
This star could be captured in all its splendour for the first time by the Spitzer telescope’s infrared detectors.
Saturn and its rings: how they originated remains one of the great unknowns of astronomy.
It is probably the remains of one of Saturn’s moons that disappeared without a trace 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the largest and sharpest photographs taken by the Hubble Telescope: the Swirling Galaxy.
Depending on the tones, some images of spiral galaxies become real works of art.
The image published by the Southern European Observatory shows the Trifid Nebula located several thousand light-years away in the constellation Sagittarius.
The name Trifida comes from the Latin term "trifidus" (divided into three), since dark lines of dust divide the hot heart of this stellar formation zone into three lobes.
In the constellation of Ofiuco, astronomers were able to photograph the hints of a cosmic carambole: 400 million light-years from Earth, the nuclei of two merging galaxies swing toward each other to end up colliding irreparably.
This star formation was captured by the Hubble Telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
Those who do not like technical abbreviations can refer to it by the nickname of Austral Molinillo.
The Hubble Space Telescope photograph shows a section of the Iris Nebula in the constellation Cepheus.
The nebula located 1,400 light-years away is composed of dust particles between ten and a hundred times smaller than the dust particles we can find in a house.
This image was created from optical images and X-rays taken by different telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes located 430 million light-years from Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, served as a model moment for NASA's Hubble Space Telescope.
Scientists call the larger spiral galaxy UGC 1810.
In this nebula is the group of brightest young stars in our Milky Way.
This stellar formation zone constantly produces new stars.
In this cloud of stars, associated with the Rosette Nebula, also continuously new stars appear; 5,000 light-years from Earth.
In this bright galaxy with a small black hole there is still no dust, only gas.
Researchers assume that it formed shortly after the big bang, when in the universe it could be found mostly hydrogen.
Our window to the universe: the most important telescopes
It appears that the telescope was invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608, before Galileo Galilei used it a year later to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have not stopped growing and the images they offer us are getting deeper and deeper.
For 30 years, specifically from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest in the world.
His mirror, in the picture, had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, U.S.A., the Large Binocular Telescope stands.
This allows you to observe the cosmos through two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The interior of the Gran Telescopio Canarias located on the island of La Palma is huge - only the mirror has a diameter of 10.4 meters.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented to save costs.
Despite this, it reaches a diameter of about eleven meters.
The disadvantage of this more economical construction is that the telescope has a fixed elevation angle, so its mobility is limited.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas also has a fixed elevation angle.
Its peculiarity is its enormous ability to collect light.
Despite having a comparatively smaller mirror diameter, this capacity is comparable to that of the world’s largest mirror telescopes.
With the help of the Arecibo Radio Telescope (Puerto Rico), researchers can explore the universe in search of signs of extraterrestrial life.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
In the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI) can help anyone who owns a computer, providing processing capability.
View of the Southern European Observatory (ESO) located in the Chilean Andes.
Here stands the Very Large Telescope, a telescope that honors its name.
With a total of four mirrors, this telescope can also illuminate the medium infrared spectrum.
ESO will also host the E-ELT (European Extremely Large Telescope).
Its primary mirror will span 42 meters and will consist of a total of 1,000 reflective elements.
Until 2018 it is not expected to be able to take pictures.
Until 2007, the two Keck telescopes located in Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
These have two mirrors, each with a diameter of 10 meters.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which together with them explores the sky with the help of the Subaru telescope and the IRTTF.
In Mauna Kea it is planned to build a new telescope of enormous proportions with a mirror diameter of thirty meters.
This is a picture of what it would be like.
However, the most important information about the cosmos comes from the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, it sends images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler Space Telescope has been looking for extrasolar planets, mainly those that are habitable.
On February 2, 2011, NASA announced that 1,235 planet candidates had been located since the start of its mission.
The image shows the final preparations for the launch of the Kepler Space Telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will not launch into space aboard an Ariane 5 rocket until 2018.
The primary mirror of this space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the functions of this telescope will be to look for the light of the first stars and galaxies formed after the big bang.
The researchers base their findings on the fact that there is ice at the south pole of Mercury.
However, there is no conclusive evidence, as the Messenger probe revolves around the planet in an orbit much closer to the north pole.
For decades, radar measurements have pointed to the existence of ice on Mercury.
Thanks to the Messenger (2004) probe, the first to orbit around Mercury, scientists are now sure it is.
Drink butter daily and live 168 years

A search for footprints in a country where 97-year-olds are still considered young.
The tour of the mountainous region of Talysh could be described as wild and romantic.
The minibus moves with great trepidation through the winding road that passes next to wooded hills, high-flow rivers and the simple homes of local farmers.
Everything is green and juicy, one might even think it is in the Black Forest.
However, we are in the southernmost part of Azerbaijan; from here the border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
Here live the "talyshi", a people of which not much is known, except that they perfectly dominate Persian and Azerbaijani and that they are very long-lived.
Our final destination is Lerik.
This small town boasts an architecture perhaps too massive designed in the Soviet era and that does not seem to fit in at all in such a picturesque mountainous landscape.
European tourists barely get to this place, as the road from the capital of Azerbaijan, Baku, turns out to be too heavy.
It takes eight hours to travel the 323 kilometers that separate the two urban nuclei, because the road is one-way.
The amazing wealth of which the country enjoys thanks to the oil of the Caspian Sea has not yet reached this remote region.
However, Pilate Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has what it takes to become a tourist attraction.
"Baku became famous in May on the occasion of the celebration of the Eurovision Song Contest and next year we will celebrate the Festival of the oldest people in the world," says Fatulayeva.
She is the director of the Museum of Longevity, perhaps the only one that exists in the world.
Here is documented the life of eight dozens of talyshis of the place who have exceeded 100 years of age. Fatulayeva points out a black and white image.
This is my grandfather, who lived 120 years.
One of his sons died at the age of 136.
However, the undisputed star of the museum is sheep shepherd <0xC5><0x9E>irali Müslümov, who appears to have lived 168 years.
However, there is no birth certificate to certify this.
And if we take into account that the oldest documented man lived 122 years, it seems that Müslümov's age is quite suspicious.
“He was born in the region in 1805 and died in 1973,” Fatulayeva explains.
The man was married three times and had 23 children, and apparently still had time to conceive another daughter at the age of 136.
Has <0xC5><0x9E>irali Müslümov been wrong about his age in a couple of decades?
However, Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has also heard about the advanced age of this Central Asian resident.
"In some regions of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan, very elderly people also live," says Scholz, "even in Sardinia there are many older men."
Due to the lack of documentation, it is impossible to provide scientific evidence about age, especially when there are no civil records.
Everyday glasses full of melted butter
It is a fact that, surprisingly often, the inhabitants of the region around Lerik tend to reach a biblical age.
There are currently 20 people over the age of 100.
Why do so many elderly people live here in the south?
Azerbaijani tourist guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains that these are the special genes of the talyshis.
The director of the museum, Ms. Fatulayeva, believes instead that the cause lies in food.
However, from a nutritional point of view, it does not seem logical that precisely the high-calorie diet of the talyshi, who love meat, bread and especially dairy products and many of whom, in addition, drink a glass of melted butter daily, is so healthy.
In Cengemiran, a small settlement not far from the city of Lerik, lives Rubaba Mirzayeva.
At 97 years old he is relatively young for what is styled by these latitudes.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the entire Caucasus region.
Sitting on the floor, she tirelessly moves a huge butter jar.
Eight people live under one roof, including one of Mirzayeva’s sons and one daughter, both of whom became grandparents a long time ago.
They also play from one side to the other two small children.
In the kitchen they prepare tea for the guests, a tea that is served in typical glasses with an inflated shape.
Mirzayeva’s teeth are white and perfectly aligned and under the scarf hides two long braids of dark blonde hair that her son proudly discovers.
I have always washed my hair with milk, so it has never fallen off and has kept its color.
"I've never used a shampoo either," Mirzayeva says.
Pension is enough to live
He always ate only what he produced on his own farm: tomatoes, potatoes and peas.
I’ve never been to a supermarket in my entire life.
Then he tells us about his husband, who was in the army.
The worst was the post-World War II era.
However, everything returned to its course when the "dear father", Heydar Aliyew, took control of the situation.
This kind of propaganda sounds strange in the mouth of an older woman.
However, in Azerbaijan the cult of the paternal figure of the nation, who runs his country as a dictator, knows no limits.
He remained in power until 2003, when he ceded the witness to his son Ilham.
At least the elderly in Azerbaijan don’t know what poverty is.
Mirzayeva charges 230 manat (approximately the same amount in euros) in terms of monthly pension, an amount with which one can live well taking into account the situation here.
And perhaps Mirzayeva’s canny son is right: “In our culture, the eldest are highly respected.”
They live in a big family, they are loved, they receive all the necessary care and they are happy.
As if this wasn't reason enough to stay alive for many years...
The Constitution lacks the expression "Human Rights"
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Demonstrations that rival each other in Cairo demonstrate the tremendous division in which the country is immersed.
The future constitution, with sharia as its basis, is highly controversial.
The Egyptian president did not spare in patheticism.
“We must overcome the transition.
And that that happens is my responsibility, before the people and before God,” he said on public television.
His speech was addressed to the whole people, especially the Coptic Christians, the Liberals, the Enlightened Muslims and the secular.
All of them, who have been so far without remedy in a confusing opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a theocracy on the banks of the Nile by the grace of the powerful Muslim community.
As Mohammed Mursi explains, almost apologising, he has had to temporarily cancel the powers of the Constitutional Court and extend its powers "to be able to save the revolution".
However, neither the Egyptians nor the whole world knows very well what this 61-year-old engineer with a doctoral degree awarded by the University of Southern California really wants to save.
Do you intend to deprive the judiciary of its power?
In fact, the 234 articles, whose approval has been forced by a constituent assembly composed of 100 predominantly Islamist members in a 15-hour night meeting, are truly troubling.
As in previous constitutions, the draft also states that jurisprudence is based on the "principles of Islamic law".
But what does that mean about “principles”?
This was and remains open to interpretation and it seems that Islamists are going to take advantage of this vague formulation, as well as the margin of legal maneuver it carries along, to impose a stricter interpretation of the sharia.
This is at least what a new article suggests added: in all matters pertaining to sharia it is mandatory to consult Al-Ashar University, the country’s most important Islamic institution with great power throughout Sunni Islam.
It doesn’t have to be so, but this may mean that the clergy would control the legislation, something that—in fact—would result in the incapacitation of the judiciary.
Much of the draft constitution is open to interpretation.
What is also problematic is that it intends to maintain military jurisdiction.
During the Mubarak dictatorship these courts served to exert a harsh repression on the opposition.
After the fall of the dictator, up to 11,000 civilians were detained in military prisons.
As stated in the draft, the state must protect “the true essence of the Egyptian family” and “promote its morals and values.”
This is such an inaccurate wording in legal terms that, with the help of this article, state institutions could even control the contents of cinematography and literature.
To be clear, this is nothing but censorship.
Indeed, no article explicitly establishes equality between men and women.
Instead, another prohibits insulting or slandering the Prophet Muhammad and his legacies.
However, it is unclear what an offence is and how it should be sanctioned.
Equally dubious is the formulation that prohibits "offense to people"
Is a caricature of the president or a joke about a lawyer enough?
Question of interpretation, like many other things in the draft that has been submitted to Mursi for his signature and that according to his words, "very soon" will be submitted to the Egyptians for a referendum.
"The revolution is back"
For weeks, the opposition has been closing its doors to the superiority of Islamists.
Ten thousand people gathered in unusual harmony on Friday afternoon in Cairo’s Tahrir Square and swore to make the Act fail before it can come into force.
“The revolution has returned and we will end up winning,” said Hamdin Sabbahi, who ranks third in the presidential election list.
The Nobel Peace Prize laureate and former director of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed El-Baradei, said the draft constitution should be “in the garbage bin of history.”
On Twitter, he accused Morsi's followers of wanting to lead a "coup of state against democracy."
“When you convene the referendum, we will go to your palace and overthrow it,” said opposition leader Jasser Said.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers has not yet been expiated," opposition politician Chaled Ali was quoted as saying by Egyptian media.
And several judges announced that they did not wish to oversee the referendum, so it would not be considered valid.
"The Qur'an is our Constitution"
For its part, the well-organized Muslim community called for a counter-manifestation, perhaps not in Tahrir Square, but after a prayer on the other side of the Nile, in front of Cairo University.
Many women covered with a veil and supporters of the Salafists took part in it at the cry of: "the people demand the application of the divine law".
They demanded that Mursi "clean up the country", while at the same time proclaiming: "the Qur'an is our constitution."
A struggle for the sovereignty of the symbolic Tahrir Square, where it all began, would have provoked a situation similar to that of a civil war.
It is clear that Mursi’s supporters did not want to risk something like this happening.
The Muslim Brotherhood claimed that both those opposed to the draft constitution and its supporters would have expressed their views loud and clear.
Now would have been the time to let the people decide in the polls which direction the country should follow.
In this sense, it seems that the draft of the Islamists has guaranteed the majority.
"The expression 'Human Rights' does not even appear"
Hafez Abu Saeda is furious with this forced constitutional process that actually should have lasted until February and included all social forces.
This 48-year-old human rights lawyer and president of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) defended the Muslim brothers when they were held in prison or faced trial during the Mubarak dictatorship.
Not because he shared his ideology, but because for him human rights are indivisible.
For this reason he was beaten, convicted and imprisoned.
"And now the expression 'Human Rights' doesn't even appear in the new constitution," he laments in a conversation with the newspaper "Welt am Sonntag".
The extension of Mursi's powers to the three powers of the State caused this lawyer to resign.
The measures taken are flagrant violations of the rules of the democratic game and will lead Egypt to a new dictatorship.
“Instead of strengthening civil society, what the president has done is abolish it,” Saeda said.
Democracy cannot work without civil society organizations.
Saeda feels abandoned, also by the international community, which observes the ideological struggle taking place on the banks of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
This could turn against you.
A protester in Tahrir Square warns: "You are conceiving a monster that you will not be able to control."
Norwegian rakfisk: the most smelly fish in the world?
The five million inhabitants of Norway enjoy one of the highest living standards, not only in Europe but in the world.
Is it possible that the success of the country has anything to do with its greed for an extremely smelly fish?
Take a series of excessively cured cheeses.
Place them in the middle of a mountain of dirty, wet football clothes.
Leave it there for a week.
You will then be able to smell the paralyzing aroma of rakfisk, one of Norway’s delicacies.
I am in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
The landscape is spectacular and that smell, always present, floats in the air.
Rakfisk is salted trout that is allowed to ferment in water for up to a year, depending on how bad you prefer it.
As it darkens and gets colder, the Norwegians flock to a festival that is held here, in Fagernes, dedicated to this most, so to speak, captivating meal.
"You eat raw and then you drink a glass of aquavit from a drink," says Havard Halvarsen, a city firefighter who is also known as the "General of Rakfisk", who is in charge of organizing the festival.
Everywhere we see people eating this fish that is stored in small buckets and drinking from a drink important amounts of the drink.
"Some people like aquavit more than rakfisk," says Havard.
Drinking can kill the smell.
I try a few pieces.
If you can avoid passing it close to your nose, it’s not bad; it’s not very different from a portion of sushi that has traveled a few miles by bus.
Rakfisk is a product that comes from a very different era, when poverty struck Norway and in which, before refrigeration existed, fish was stored during the autumn immersed in water and salt in airtight barrels.
Later, in the middle of winter, when it is already well fermented, it is taken out and, obviously with the senses inactive due to alcohol, it is eaten.
Just a generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work, and emigrated mainly to the United States.
Currently, the population is growing rapidly; more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by the abundance of jobs, high wages and a complete system of social services.
A stream of inhabitants of Sweden, the old rival and even not much richer than Norway, comes to this country to work.
The rakfisk is considered something important, an essential part, though quite smelly, of Norway’s past.
It is one of the most expensive dishes you can buy.
But, in fact, everything is expensive. A cane of beer or a sandwich cost you 10<0xE2><0x82><0xAC> ($14) each.
Norway does not usually appear on the international news agenda and most Norwegians like it to be so.
Here people are still unwilling to pronounce the name of Anders Breivik, the far-right racist who shot and killed 77 people, including men, women and children.
Instead, they refer to the shooting as “the July 22 incident.”
The Norwegians find it very difficult to believe that in their peaceful country one of their own was able to commit such cruelty and murder.
Behind much of Norway’s current wealth lies the growth, since the early 1970s, of one of the world’s largest oil and gas industries.
“But oil isn’t the only reason we’re doing so well,” says Anna, our waitress, as she passes through rakfisk trays and who, with her long blonde hair and amazing blue eyes, represents the image of Norwegian well-being.
“We are, as you say, wise people.”
His English, like that of most people in this country, is impeccable.
"We don't like bragging, we don't like ostentation."
Norway has managed its oil wealth very cautiously; everything except a small percentage of the money coming from this industry is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
While everyone was wasting money they didn’t have during the years leading up to the global financial crisis, Norway kept the wallet tightly closed.
“While we can ski in winter and hike in summer, we are happy,” says Anna.
"And eat rakfisk," he adds with a hunchback.
I'm in the snow queuing for something to eat; I've already had enough rakfisk.
Now a pine hamburger is certainly something different and quite juicy to taste.
But at night, that smelly fish comes back.
The hotel where I stay is one of the many places where a rakfisk dinner is held where guests vote for the best fish, or perhaps the one that tests the nostrils the most.
A TV has connected live with a presenter who wears a little bird and is surrounded by rakfisk dishes.
It looks like the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What are your scores for the best fish up there in the mountains, Thor-Juergen?"
"Here's our score, Havard."
There are laughter and applause.
A man falls from the chair, perhaps beaten by the aquavit.
Or maybe it's the vapors of all that fish.
Mexico: Enrique Peña Nieto faces a tough start
As Mexico’s incoming president, Enrique Peña Nieto, prepares to take office, BBC correspondent Will Grant analyzes the challenges facing the new president and the different expectations of his population.
Traffic in Mexico City is especially bad nowadays.
In a city that, under the best circumstances, is already congested by itself, a steel fence has been installed since Monday that cuts off several of the main roads leading to the city and is causing huge chaos on the roads.
The goal, however, was not to prevent workers from reaching their workplace, but to prevent protesters from reaching parliament.
On Saturday, the new president of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, will receive the presidential band and will take over the management of the nation.
He faces a complicated task.
Mexico has been achieving good economic results during the outgoing government of Felipe Calderón, but the country is immersed in a war against drug trafficking that has already claimed some 60,000 lives in six years.
"My government has the great commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence," Peña Nieto told US President Barack Obama earlier this week at the Oval Office.
“I’m going to propose a new security strategy that will allow us to achieve that goal.”
Before coding with the President of the United States, Mr. Peña’s previous political experience was as governor of his native state, Mexico.
A very populous and fast-growing state that surrounds the capital; opinions about the new leader are divided in this territory in which he used to move.
A sincere man
In the bucolic town of Valle del Bravo, for example, he is remembered with affection.
Its residents attribute to it the merit of the growth of tourism in the place and the construction of infrastructure.
To get to the city you can drive on one of the new roads of Mr. Peña Nieto, which is a huge improvement compared to the cracked roads filled with creeks that were rehabilitated.
You can also see plaques with their name at the entrance of a modern sports hall and an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
“We trust that he will be able to make a real and lasting change,” says his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernández, a member of the party of Mr. Peña Nieto, the PRI.
“Particularly in terms of security and economy, we look forward to the interesting and real change that our country so much needs.”
After an uninterrupted 81-year term in power, the PRI was defeated by Vicente Fox in 2000.
MEP Olvera admits that, after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, within the party there are many expectations regarding Enrique Peña Nieto.
It also rejects the rating that the opposition lacks the essence of the new president.
“He is a very sincere, very committed man with an excellent vision of the country.
He’s a fantastic statesman and, above all, he’s a person who knows how to listen.”
However, on the other side of the state that is not the impression that many people have of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.
Hidden under highway sections is, in many ways, a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems of the municipality are also harsh and urban.
Earlier this year, the military was asked to intervene to help in the fight against drug gangs operating in neighborhoods and violence against women is particularly serious.
In a desert plot, located next to a garbage dump, the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been abandoned in just the last two years.
More than 1,000 women were murdered in the state of Mexico while Mr. Peña Nieto was governor, a far higher rate than that of Ciudad Juárez, unfortunately famous for its violence and a place that is synonymous with the murder of innocent women.
Critics of Mr. Peña Nieto say, at best, that he did not know how to address the problem of femicide while in office.
The most critics accuse their administration of making a blind eye.
In a concrete house, typical of the deteriorated neighborhood, Irinea Buendía has to make efforts to contain the tears while showing me photographs of her deceased daughter, Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of the facts, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
However, her family believes her partner murdered her.
“When I arrived at his house, it was as if his body had been cleaned,” recalls Mrs. Buendía.
"There were signs that she had been beaten and the rigor mortis had already appeared."
As her mother tells the story, a photograph of Mariana looks from the walls, next to a cross on which one reads a single word: Justice.
However, that is exactly what the family says has been denied.
“The state authorities have treated me as if I were an old gossip, a rioter, a complainer.
What they want is that one simply accepts what they say and shuts up.”
“But that can’t be the case when there have been so many irregularities and so much negligence,” he says.
The presidential band that President Peña Nieto will receive on Saturday will be accompanied by an enormous responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by violent crimes in Mexico over the past six years and the new president has promised to give them priority during his term.
"I hope that he is the same kind of president that he was when he was governor," says the MP of PRI Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
However, that is precisely what the families of the victims of Ciudad Neza fear most.
Bradley Manning did not denounce ill-treatment, prosecutors say
Prosecutors try to deal with allegations of Bradley Manning abuse during his imprisonment
The trial focuses on Manning's period at Quantico Military Prison in Virginia
The defense wants the case to be dismissed on the grounds that Manning’s imprisonment was severe.
The military soldier is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents.
Prosecutors tried to prove Friday that soldier Bradley Manning, accused of the largest leak of confidential information in U.S. history, missed multiple opportunities to denounce the ill-treatment he now claims he suffered while under military detention.
During the prosecution’s interrogation of Manning in a pre-trial hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, Prosecutor Commander Ashden Fein said the records of the weekly visits of unit officers Manning received during nine months of detention in Quantico, Virginia, show no complaint about the treatment he was receiving.
The interrogation, which took place during a hearing in response to the defense’s request that the case be dismissed as his imprisonment had been harsh and had already been punishable enough, came a day after Manning testified that he had thought of committing suicide while detained.
The military intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents while serving in Iraq.
Later, WikiLeaks published the material on the Internet.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Manning was the source of information.
On Friday’s sighting, Fein reviewed with Manning the forms officers filled out following Manning’s visits during his arrest at the military prison of Quantico, where he was imprisoned in maximum detention from July 2010 to April 2011.
Officers would have asked Manning questions and recorded his answers.
When Fein asked about the forms on Friday, Manning acknowledged that he had rated the treatment given to him by the locksmiths as "excellent" and the treatment received at the facility in general as "very professional".
The forms do not show any allegations of ill-treatment, even though officers asked Manning directly about the treatment he was receiving, Fein said.
Manning replied that he had expressed concern about some issues and that the officers visiting him had spoken about those issues and indicated that they would be dealt with, but that they did not record those issues in the record.
"They wrote 'no incidents' (after talking about the problems) but that doesn't necessarily mean I wouldn't have mentioned any problems," Manning said.
The judge, Army Colonel Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he had not denounced the treatment he received during the January 2011 meeting with a board in charge of examining the suicide intentions he had expressed on a form months earlier.
Manning replied that his intention during that meeting was to obtain the reduction of the "injury prevention" regime under which he was.
The military said they had placed him under that restrictive regime, which is one degree below surveillance for possible suicide, to ensure his protection and the safety of others.
“I wanted the senior staff to know that I was okay and (I wanted) to stop being under injury prevention... so I could enjoy what, from my point of view, is a better quality of life,” Manning said.
Manning testified on Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for nearly two months before being transferred to the military prison at the Marines' base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said he had considered suicide in Kuwait and that on one occasion he lost consciousness due to the heat.
He said the fact that he was not allowed to know what was happening to him or what was happening in the outside world was very distressing.
“My world was reduced to Camp Arafjon, that cage,” Manning said Thursday.
"I thought I was going to die in that cage."
Manning claimed that once he was transferred to Quantico, he spent most of the day in a small cell, at least for 21 hours and often for 23 hours, without company.
Manning said he was only allowed to have a mattress, a blanket, a few cheekbones, some clothes and his glasses.
He explained that he was trying to move all the time, as it was forbidden to sleep or even lie down during the day.
Manning claimed that he always had a light coming from outside pointing to his eyes while he was sleeping.
He said that if the locksmiths could not see his face when he turned around at night, they would wake him up to turn around again.
Manning’s attorney filed a formal complaint in January 2011 about Manning’s treatment.
Manning was transferred to Fort Leavenworth Military Prison in Kansas in April 2011.
On Friday, the judge asked Manning about an allegation he made in Thursday’s statement that, after being forced one night to sleep naked in his Quantico cell, he was forced during a morning count to stand naked in front of lockers and other prisoners.
Manning had testified that he had never been given the opportunity to cover himself with the blanket during the count.
During the judge's interrogation on Friday, Manning said he deduced from the bailiff's order that he should drop the blanket he could have covered himself with, but acknowledged that no one had ordered him to drop it.
Manning testified on Thursday that he had been forced to sleep naked the night before because of an attempt to prove to an officer that he did not pose a danger to himself.
Manning said he had told the officer that he could have used his underwear elastics or buckles to self-harm, but he had not.
Manning testified that his underwear, underwear and glasses had been removed from his cell that night.
Her lawyers hope that the judge will at least take into account the experiences she experienced during her imprisonment and drastically reduce her sentence in case she is convicted at the war council, which is scheduled to begin early next year.
The defense said it plans to have Manning plead guilty to minor crimes and defend other charges deemed too extreme.
The hearing is scheduled to resume this weekend and prosecutors are expected to argue that the conditions of detention were justified.
The Pentagon has argued that Manning was detained in accordance with the rules of enforcement to any detainees who are in maximum custody in Quantico.
The charges against Manning include cooperation with the enemy, illegally provoking the publication of information on the Internet, leaking information from the national defense, and theft of property or public records.
If convicted of all charges, he could face life imprisonment.
My Mexican-American Identity Crisis
Many were forced to leave Mexico due to lack of opportunities.
Mexicans tend to criticize those who left; says they remember Mexicans from those difficult times
Navarrette says Mexican-Americans are trapped between two worlds.
On a recent trip to Mexico City, he had barely descended the esplanade and arrived at the immigration processing zone and was already totally confused.
Some signs indicated the way to two queues: one for "Mexicans" and one for "Foreigners".
I stayed there for a few seconds without being sure where to go.
Growing up in Central California, I've been called "Mexican" all my life.
This is ethnic tachygraphy, just as my friends in Boston refer to themselves as "Irish" or my friends in New York call themselves "Italians."
Later I decided to call myself "Mexico-American."
But this was Mexico.
And, in my grandfather’s homeland, tachygraphing or screenplays were not necessary.
He was simply American.
I speak Spanish. Good enough to handle during an interview in this language.
But I don’t have the vocabulary level of a native and I can’t get rid of my American accent.
So I took my American passport and put myself in the queue of foreigners.
I thought about that moment this week when President-elect of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, visited the White House to meet with President Obama.
The agenda of the day, as always when the leaders of these two countries meet, was: immigration, drugs and trade.
Peña Nieto was also looking forward to talking about the growth of the Mexican economy, one of the reasons why at this time a Mexican is as likely to stay in Mexico as he is to venture to the United States.
It wants to partner with the United States and Canada and create a European Union-style trade bloc in North America.
In addition, Peña Nieto promised to continue fighting the drug cartels in Mexico, although he did not give details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of resentment.
Probably most Americans never remember that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to cede half of their territory at gunpoint.
But for Mexicans, who think of centuries, not minutes, the elements that remind them of it are everywhere.
So, by the time a U.S. official says anything that brings the slightest criticism to Mexico, you start hearing complaints, both in the press and among the Mexican elite, about how Americans are usurping the sovereignty of their neighbors.
And the sons of Moctezuma stand up for war.
And yet, for Mexico, the relationship that really poses a whole challenge is with the more than 35 million Mexican-Americans living in the United States.
Are we talking about resentment?
There's a lot.
In Mexico there are winners and losers, people for whom the country provides opportunities and others for whom it is not.
The only reason that there are so many people of Mexican descent living in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that, at some point in our family tree, there was a person, maybe the father or mother or one of the grandparents, who was closed the door of opportunity in Mexico and had to march north.
And most of the time that person fit into a certain profile: dark skin, a low level of study, coming from a poor people, etc.
We are their descendants and we are loyal to them.
Not in Mexico.
And, even though we may be living the American dream now, having gone to good schools and had good jobs, we can never lose sight of the fact that what we are living is that, the American dream, not the Mexican dream.
Sometimes our identity may not be clear, but our loyalty is.
It's for the United States.
In addition, we are aware that many of the Mexicans belonging to the ruling class elite do not like us.
The feeling is mutual.
They see us as a reminder of a humiliating defeat and look at us above the shoulder as if we were of a lower category that is not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough and our ties with Mexico will never be strong enough.
In his view, our existence is synonymous with failure.
If our families had not failed in Mexico, they would not have left.
And now we would not find ourselves trapped behind this silk curtain, living well in the United States but still as lonely souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and legally came to the United States when I was a girl, reminds me that there is this friction between Mexicans and Mexican-Americans because the first know more firmly who they are and the second this bothers them.
Although she is a citizen of the United States, she is considered part of both countries.
Meanwhile, many Mexican-Americans I know feel they are not part of either.
We love listening to the Mexican band The North Tigers, but also to Bruce Springsteen.
You have the best of every country, but you are not rooted in any of them.
In Mexico, they see us as Americans.
In the United States, we are considered Mexicans.
Now, to further complicate things, as I learned during my trip, some Mexican leaders and some intellectuals want to reconnect with the diaspora.
They want Mexican-Americans to work as improvised “ambassadors” of Mexico, representing their interests in the United States.
We would tell our fellow Americans how fantastic it is to visit that country and we would pressure political leaders to strengthen their ties with Mexico.
Yeah, sure.
That's not gonna happen.
There's too much resentment.
And, with wage inequality, galloping corruption and drug violence, many of us aren’t so sure it’s a fantastic country.
I'm afraid you're going to be left alone with this idea, friends.
That's fair.
If some Mexicans are still unprepared to forgive the United States for the way they treated Mexico a century and a half ago, then they have to accept the fact that some Mexican-Americans are still resentful of how their relatives were treated much less time ago.
Hmmm.
Maybe we're more "Mexicans" than I thought.
Old Battles, New Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could well be an unlikely basis for peace
Will there ever be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another bloodshed that seems to indicate that any hope is in vain.
In the midst of the useless and usual discussions about who started first, piles of buildings have been reduced to rubble; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis have been killed and, for the first time, missiles from Gaza have fallen near Tel Aviv, Israel’s metropolis, and the holy city.
But, even though Israelis and Palestinians seem to be anchored in their ancient conflict, everything around them in the Middle East is changing.
The Arab Spring has left everything shattered whether you like it or not, Palestinians and Israelis have been trapped in the regional upheaval.
Perhaps this will make your struggle even more bloody than before.
However, there are reasons to think that their lethal dead-end situation could unravel.
A war that is neither lost nor won
At first glance, optimism now seems very difficult to justify.
Even if the agreed ceasefire is maintained on November 21, this week’s clashes have reinforced the falcons on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007, will claim to have forced the Israelis to withdraw, even though Gaza has received a good beating.
And despite killing some of its leaders and putting pressure on Gaza’s 1.7 million people in one of the world’s most miserable and populous corners, Israel has failed to put an end to Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is gaining ground in the West Bank, the other part of Palestine currently ruled by its relentless rivals to Fatah, the most moderate Palestinian faction.
In addition, Hamas leaders could come to the conclusion that time plays in their favor.
Since Islamists have been gaining influence throughout the Arab world, Hamas has made rich and powerful friendships.
Turkey, a renaissance regional power that had previously been Israel’s closest Muslim ally, has embraced the cause of Hamas, as has Qatar, one of the Gulf’s richest and most dynamic states.
Hamas exultant members say the Islamist crescent is encircling Israel, from Lebanon to the north, where the Hezbollah militia party dominates, through Syria, where rebels of an increasingly Islamist tendency could overthrow Bashar Assad, to reach Jordan, where Hamas’ allies are threatening the king.
Especially on the southern flank of Israel, the growth of the Muslim Brotherhood led by President Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, by far the most populous and fundamental of Arab countries, has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the secular despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, did not have much time for Hamas.
The Muslim Brotherhood, on the other hand, is Hamas’s cousin and its leaders are more dependent on popular opinion.
In future diplomatic actions, it is possible that Hamas emerges as a protagonist to whom one cannot exclude, not even Israel and the United States.
Meanwhile, Israel’s hard wing will draw the opposite conclusion.
As far as the military issue is concerned, they have put Hamas in its place.
Israel’s Iron Dome missile system has proven its effectiveness and many of Hamas’ missiles have been destroyed.
The Israelis will sleep quieter... for a while.
As far as diplomacy is concerned, the United States is firmer than ever; many European countries have also blamed Hamas for initiating the latest wave of violence.
Above all, Israel has prospered, especially under the government of Benjamin Netanyahu, a prime minister who has largely ignored the peace process.
Although rockets fired from Gaza have killed some 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has not had too many suicide bombers, partly thanks to the barrier that corrodes the West Bank, the main chunk of a territory aspiring to become a state of Palestine, and protects Jewish settlements that continue to increase, despite international law.
Mr. Netanyahu, whose Likud party has joined an even harder-line group led by Avigdor Lieberman in the run-up to the January 22 election, is in a good position.
Why pamper those twisted Palestinians by giving them a state of their own?
If they really ruled the West Bank, wouldn’t they fire rockets just like their compatriots did in Gaza?
It is better to have them behind that wall and give them a good blow if they raise their heads.
Perhaps the hard wing will be imposed, although the Arab spring could alter your calculations.
Although Islamists who take power in Egypt and elsewhere do not have too much appreciation for Israel, their priority will be to address internal difficulties.
Israel’s defense budget is larger than that of its four Arab neighbors together.
Starting a war with the area’s superpower will hardly help new Arab governments improve their economies.
That the pragmatic Mr. Morsi has worked with Barack Obama to achieve a ceasefire is a good omen and could mark the beginning of something.
Israelis should also think long-term.
With the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic, depriving Palestinians of their right to self-determination means creating a dustbin that will one day explode in Israeli-occupied territories, just as a bus exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
The repression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state and demographics are worsening the situation as the Arab population increases.
Cruel missions against Gaza every two or three years to reject Hamas will pay an ever-increasing diplomatic toll.
Both sides need a push from people outside the conflict.
The solution remains the one preached by sensible people on both sides, most of the outside world and this newspaper: two states and Israel’s cession of territory for security reasons.
The hope, small in the short term, is that the ceasefire will give a little more impetus to outsiders who are fighting for this cause.
Egypt, which must begin to curb the entry of weapons into Gaza, along with Turkey and Qatar, is in an unprecedented situation to convince Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, with land exchanges and a shared Jerusalem.
The Arabs outside the issue should also pressure Hamas and Fatah to come together.
That would contribute more to the creation of a Palestinian state than the imminent attempt to obtain a virtual state category at the UN.
Mr. Obama also has an important role to play in bringing Israel to the negotiating table.
During his first term, he failed to present his own plan for peace.
Again in the White House, he seems equally reluctant to pay attention to him.
This attitude implies a deplorable vision for the future.

Generic Tobacco Packaging Act Enters into Force in Australia
Warnings about the risks of smoking and parts of the body with diseases appear on bottles of a green color off, which are the same for all tobacco brands
The Australian law on tobacco and generic packaging, pioneering in the world, comes into force and replaces the logos and colors of the brands with an envelope of an olive-green off, horrifying images of parts of the body with diseases and depictions of sick children and babies being children of smoking parents.
With the exception of the different images and health warnings, the only difference between the boxes, mandatory from Saturday, are the names of the brands, all of them printed on a type of small font.
This is the strictest regime in the world applied to tobacco packaging.
The Australian federal government says the goal is to deter young people from smoking by eliminating the traits that make this habit glamorous.
It relies on studies that show that if a person has not started smoking before the age of 26, there is a 99% chance that he will never do so.
"You can see that boys, even from a very young age, understand the message that the tobacco company is trying to sell through its brand," said Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek, citing studies showing, for example, how girls linked the logo of a crown to the idea of being a princess.
Although Australia has one of the lowest rates of smokers in the world and these changes will not affect the benefits of multinationals too much, other countries are considering similar measures.
The tobacco industry has put enormous pressure on the law.
Tobacco companies said the law would encourage the black tobacco market, where cigarettes would be cheaper and more affordable.
“The legislation will have serious unintended consequences,” said Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco in Australia.
It will increase the amount of tobacco that counterfeiters from China and Indonesia will bring to sell on the streets of Australia.
Others say their business has benefited from the passage of the law.
Sandra Ha, of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family-owned company, said the demand for pillowcases and silicone covers to cover up the unpleasant images of the boxes had skyrocketed almost from zero two months ago, when British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost a court hearing in Australia.
Ms. Ha said that Zico had sold up to 6,000 units to wholesale establishments and was expecting more stock.
“It’s a good business for us.”
According to experts, the possible obstacle is the popularity of social networks among the demographic sector to which the plan is directed.
Following a series of Australian laws banning television advertising and sports sponsorship and forcing most sellers to keep cigarettes out of sight, tobacco marketing has gone online.
Australia has banned Internet advertising to local businesses and websites, but cannot restrict it to foreign pages.
“If you’re marketing tobacco and you only have this small window to promote your products, online space is the most compelling place to be,” said Becky Freeman, a University of Sydney public health researcher.
Freeman noted an increase in reviews of brands from “standing citizens” posted on social media websites such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
One wonders if it’s just a private citizen who really loves Marlboro cigarettes and has taken the hassle of making a video or if any marketing company is behind it all.
The British American Tobacco of Australia indicated that the industry focuses more on what new regulations involve than on marketing.
The industry has even come to pay for Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to reject the new rules; these countries are claiming to the World Trade Organization that trade is being unfairly restricted, even though none of these countries has a significant volume of trade with Australia.
The WTO is likely to issue a resolution in mid-2013.
Plibersek said the government had held talks with other countries that are considering applying similar tobacco packaging laws.
In 2001, Canada became the first country to introduce the mandatory inclusion of images in boxes.
They are currently compulsory in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
In Great Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India, tougher laws are being considered.
In Australia, many smokers are challenging.
“Photos don’t affect me.
I just don’t listen to them.”
"You take the cigarette and keep the package," says Victor El Hage while buying a package with the image of a tumor in his mouth.
"Honestly, there's only one reason I'd quit smoking: for my daughter."
James Yu, manager of the King of the Pack pond in central Sydney, says uniform boxes make it harder for him to place them on the shelves.
"It usually took an hour to unravel a delivery; now it takes four," Yu says.
“The government should have totally banned tobacco and then, it’s, okay, it’s over and we closed the store,” he says as he raises his hands up.
In a constantly connected world, it’s not so bad to get bored a little bit.
During this year’s Thanksgiving holidays, I unexpectedly had to spend five hours at an airport because the plane we were flying on had a mechanical problem and we had to wait for another plane to arrive.
So I had a lot of time to think about boredom.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Spending half a day at an airport waiting for a flight to arrive is quite boring, even if you have the means to be entertained, such as books, magazines or iPhones, without forgetting the duty-free stores.
But there are more and more academics and experts in child development praising the goodness of boredom.
According to them, it is good that both we and our children get bored from time to time.
Boredom forces the brain to look for interesting options and may encourage creativity.
Since most of us are currently connected to this or that screen, we do not experience the benefits of boredom.
So, should we accept boredom in good spirits?
Oh, yes.
No, no, no.
But we will talk about it later.
First, like many people, he assumed that, now that we have more time for leisure, boredom would be a relatively recent phenomenon.
But as Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman History at the University of Calgary, Canada, and author of the book “Boredom: A Lively History” published in 2011 by Yale University Press, is not so.
"In fact, the history of boredom is very extensive," he says.
On the walls of Pompeii there are Latin graffiti about boredom dating from the 1st century AD.
We must also consider how we define boredom.
“The problem is that it has already been defined and discussed in many different ways,” says John D. Eastwood, professor of psychology at the University of York in Ontario, Canada.
After examining the published research and putting the idea before a discussion group of 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as the experience of “desireing, but not being able, to participate in an activity that fills you.”
It states that the difference between boredom and apathy is that the person does not do something but wants to do it.
He points out that with apathy there is no desire to do anything.
The main experience of boredom, he says, is “the alteration of the process of attention, associated with a low mood and a feeling that time passes slowly.”
Boredom can sound terribly similar to depression.
However, Professor Eastwood says that although they may be related, people who are bored tend to see the problem as a matter of the environment or the world, while people who are depressed consider the problem to be their own.
Sometimes we think we are bored, when what actually happens to us is that we have trouble concentrating.
In his study “The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention,” published in the September issue of the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues referred to an earlier experiment in which participants listened to a tape of a person reading the article from a magazine.
Some groups listened in the adjoining room to a full-volume television program that had no relation, others listened to it with low volume, so it was barely perceptible, while the third group did not listen to the audio at any time.
The group that listened to the program with the low volume showed more boredom than the other two groups; it cost them to concentrate, but they were not sure why and attributed it to boredom.
“When you try to focus on a difficult or interesting task, altering attention can lead to boredom,” said Mark J. Fenske, a professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph, Ontario, and one of the study’s authors.
“On the other hand, when you’re doing something boring, like detecting faulty parts in a manufacturing line, music that distracts you can help you not get bored.”
“In fact, we currently know that moving or making scratches, actions that are often interpreted as a sign of boredom, can actually help combat it, as they make that person physically more alert.”
“Research shows that those children who are allowed to move learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to remain still,” Fenske said.
We all know what it’s like to get bored at some point: the delay of a plane, a monotonous speaker, a particularly boring movie.
But some people tend to get bored more than others.
To help measure it, some researchers developed a “boring trend scale” in the 1980s.
The scale includes issues like “many of the things I have to do are repetitive and monotonous” and “there are so many things that I’m interested in that I don’t have time to do everything.”
Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, says that using these scales, researchers have found that boys tend to get bored more often than girls, and specifically need more external stimulation and more varied.
But, in general, teenagers are a type of group that gets bored quite easily.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted 400 teenagers and their parents between seven and eight times a day through a search.
He found that 32 percent of teens said they were bored while at school or doing homework, while 23 percent said they were bored when they weren’t at school.
On the other hand, 3% of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson said he did not know if the current boredom rates, 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
But he said what he did know was that “teenage is a period when boredom reaches its highest rates,” largely because both children and teens are not given much control over what they want to do.
So, back to my question at the beginning: is it good to get bored?
Sometimes it is not, because, taken to the extreme, it can cause us to be exposed to absurd physical risks, such as making bets or falling into substance use as a method of combating it, as evidenced by research.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers talk about the connection between boredom and creativity, according to Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying this issue for more than two decades.
“Boring is the way the brain has to tell you that you should be doing something else,” says Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at the University of New York.
But the brain does not always know what is most appropriate.
If you are bored and use that energy to play the guitar or cook, that will satisfy you.
But if you watch TV, it may satisfy you in the short term, but not in the long term.
“So, if your child is bored and you give him an iPad, he may not be bored anymore, but he will not have learned to entertain himself or to dose himself,” says Professor Fenske.
And “that ability to dose applies to other situations,” he says.
Your child not only learns to entertain himself, but learns to control himself better in other areas.
I don't think we really want to praise boredom.
But we shouldn’t be too critical of him either.
Rather, our goal should be to feel comfortable away from the constant rumours of activities and technologies.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
“In our view, we need to get bored more, but boredom is a desire too anxious and disturbing to relate to something worthwhile,” he says.
He points out that what people are really looking for is a way to disconnect and enjoy a dead time.
“In an environment where we’re constantly overstimulated,” he says, “it’s hard to find ways to focus our attention when the noise stops.”
Colorado: No Instruction Book for New Marijuana Law
Anthony Orozco, a 19-year-old student at a community college and footballer in southeastern Colorado, faces a criminal lawsuit for something that will soon be legal across the state: the possession of some marijuana stones and a pipe he used to smoke it.
Orozco says that one day in September, he and some friends were driving through Lamar, in the plains near the Kansas border, when they were stopped by police.
Police found marijuana in the car and a while later Orozco received a court summons for possession of drugs and related items (minor offenses each involving a $100 fine) informing him of the date of the trial.
“They treat us like criminals,” Orozco says.
And are they?
In the weeks following the Colorado vote to legalize the possession of small amounts of recreational marijuana, the response to hundreds of minor drug possession cases depends less on the law than on location.
Hundreds of minor marijuana possession offences are being overturned both here and in Washington state, where a similar measure was passed.
Police departments have stopped filing charges against people over the age of 21 for small-scale possession, which will be legally passed once the law comes into force in the coming weeks.
But Colorado’s most conservative district attorneys have pledged to go ahead with the cases opened for marijuana possession and are still quoting people.
At the same time, several cities, from the Denver suburbs to the western mountains, are voting to prevent recently-authorized marijuana stores from opening in their communities.
“All this is changing so quickly that I don’t know what’s going to happen next,” said Daniel J. Oates, police chief at Aurora, just east of Denver.
Those in charge of regulations in the state of Washington are also turning the issue around.
And they continue to seek advice to establish a system of production, manufacturing, distribution and sales licensing, all before the deadline, December 1, 2013.
They say that, for better or worse, Colorado is ahead of most states in regulating marijuana use, first for therapeutic purposes and now for recreational use.
“Colorado has a more regulated market, so it will be a good guide,” said Brian E. Smith, a spokesman for the Washington State Alcohol Control Commission.
But Mr. Smith admits that any place or system can only make suggestions about what might work.
“There is no real precedent that serves as a model for us,” he says.
Washington’s law, dubbed I-502, comes into force on December 6, leaving also a year during which it will swim between two waters, as the licensing system in that state will not yet exist, but the possession will be legal.
In addition, there are some delicate mechanical issues that need to be resolved during that period, such as how to maintain a balance between the state's requirement to offer "adequate access" to authorized marijuana and its ban on conducting cannabis business within a radius of less than 300 meters of schools, parks, playgrounds or children's centers.
“Nowhere will it be more difficult to locate an authorized cannabis business than in urban areas, especially in the Seattle metropolitan area,” says Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the Center for Legal Cannabis, a newly created research group.
On November 21, Oates, Aurora’s police chief, sent an email to his police officers informing them that the city’s prosecutor would stop prosecuting people over the age of 21 for mild misconduct for possession of marijuana and that the police would stop bringing charges against those crimes “with immediate effect.”
Police chief Oates said they would enforce the city’s regulations regulating the cultivation of marijuana for therapeutic purposes and that they would continue to pursue drug traffickers and dealers.
In Weld County, northern Colorado, the district attorney, Ken Buck, represents a stricter view.
After the vote, he said his office would continue to pursue cases of marijuana possession, mainly to pressure consumers and decide to receive treatment.
Currently, 119 people face charges for possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, although many of them have other charges.
“Our office has an obligation to bring legal action against those wrongdoings that at the time they occurred were a crime,” Mr. Buck said in a statement.
The answer has been complicated even in places like rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the marijuana legalization initiative.
Grand Junction Police, the county’s largest city, no longer cite adults for possession of small amounts.
Pete Hautzinger, the county district attorney, backed this decision, but also decided not to dismiss any of the pending possession cases.
"I don't think he's wasting time continuing to enforce the law until it changes," he said.
Although 55 percent of voters supported the measure, it was never considered that bringing recreational marijuana use to the government and judicial system would be easy.
The contradictory reactions that arise throughout the state reveal a marked ambivalence among the officials regarding the great ecological experiment in this state.
“It’s a cultural barrier with district attorneys,” said Sean McAllister, a Denver attorney who represents marijuana-possession defendants and is a local spokesman for the National Marijuana Law Reform Organization.
“They’ve spent so much time bringing people to court that they can’t actually still accept it to be legal,” he said.
Being the first states to consider small amounts of marijuana in the same way as if it were alcohol, Colorado and Washington are preparing to become the nationwide test cases for drug legalization.
While attorneys and state officials have a new legal sales frontier, they also look forward to receiving indications from the federal government, which still envisions considering the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
Proponents of marijuana legalization have hopes that the Justice Department will give in.
Although there have been some prominent arrests of patients and marijuana vendors for therapeutic purposes, the federal government has mostly allowed marijuana sales businesses to exist for these purposes in Colorado, Washington and 16 more states.
“While anti-drug agents are likely not to throw doors down to confiscate a small drug bag, they will likely be reluctant to allow the operation of state-regulated stores for the sale of recreational marijuana, allowed under the new law,” said Kevin A. Sabet, a former drug policy adviser to the Obama administration.
Several cities in Colorado are not waiting for federal authorities to act.
Even before election day, some local governments approved moratoriums on any new marijuana store, even though it will take about a year before any of them can open.
Last week, the western city of Montrose adopted a six-month ban and is likely to pass it next week.
“We don’t want to get into a situation where we authorize someone and then have a serious problem at the federal level,” said Bob Nicholson, a city council member.
“Our community voted against this amendment.
We are studying what the community voted in favor of what the state voted in favor of.”
There are many questions about this.
Petronella Wyatt: "I was harassed until I was kicked out of Oxford for being a Tory"
Students are not attacked for their views only now
I don’t remember any time in my life that I haven’t been dreaming of getting a place at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother had been in what I assumed was the best place in the world to learn, a Greek symposium of the contemporary era that fostered the two pillars of civilization: free thought and tolerance.
However, after two weeks of taking my place at Worcester College in the late 1980s to pursue the History career, I had already packed up, triggering the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed and started to cry.
My friends were bewildered.
The Evening Standard newspaper claimed that I had quit because I did not tolerate some college classmates having sex in the next room.
Writer A. N. Wilson announced jokingly that I had left because I was forced to drink in unscathed cups.
The truth was less fun.
I ran out of there.
Yes, I fled, because I had been subjected to systematic harassment and intimidation.
Not because of my extravagant name, or the fact that I came from a private school.
I was harassed for one reason only, that in the cradle of the supposed illustration was something intolerant and barbaric: my father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a prominent adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I supported the conservative party.
You may be wondering what that is for now.
Well, several reports indicate that a new generation of center-right students is suffering similar persecution.
The institutionalized and growing hatred of conservative party students is such in Oxford that last week a group of them claimed the same level of equal rights as homosexuals, disabled people and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Corpus Christi College’s JCR (Gruppation of Graduate Students) claim they are “often seriously detached, personally attacked and treated as ungrateful people” for their political ideas.
They want to create a position on the Equal Opportunity Committee of their college to make sure they can express their views freely.
His situation was not favored by a recent BBC2 documentary called "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right" about student politics and that featured the Tories as eccentric and neo-Nazi.
It showed graduate student Joe Cooke, former president of the Oxford University Conservative Party Association (OUCA), in a Rolls-Royce, wearing a silver suit and a stick with a silver handle.
At other universities, conservative students say they are being treated as "Turkish heads" for introducing higher tuition fees.
Luke Black, a 20-year-old and vice president of the Conservative Party Association at the University of Nottingham, said in a Sunday newspaper that "there is a growing trend of leftists in universities.
People assume we’re like the Bullingdon Club without even knowing each other.”
Samuel Roberts, a 21-year-old history student at Corpus Christi who filed the motion for greater protection, says this environment is "uncomfortable", while Stephanie Cherill, 19, who is elected president of the UOCA, says the attitude of JCR members towards people who are center-right has worsened.
“This poses a threat to the intellectual debate environment, as well as the well-being of members,” he says.
During my first weeks in Oxford I was more alone than one.
I entered college in September 1986, I was a terribly shy 18-year-old.
Hatred towards the Conservative Party was at its highest point.
Earlier this year, the university had voted to deny Margaret Thatcher, a former student, a title "honoris causa" after cuts in funding for higher education.
The atmosphere would have shocked any Stalinist.
Already during the first days of the welcome week for new university students, when the new students meet and meet the professors, I received a sample of the bitterness that awaited me.
I discovered that the professors not only looked fat in the face of the mockery of conservative university students, but they willingly participated in it.
The policy of the miners’ strike, the privatization and the government’s opposition to the sanctions against apartheid in South Africa reached the wooden rooms of the seminar.
At the first I attended French texts of the eighteenth century were to be translated into English and I was not prepared for what came next.
"Miss Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (already deceased), "please translate the first paragraph."
I didn't say one.
Pitt, a small man with a face that looked like cake mass, knew well how to expel bad bile.
"Do the Thatcherists refuse to learn French or are they just stupid?" he asked.
The other students laughed.
My eyes were burning with the tears I was trying to contain.
“I suggest you go to French classes in your spare time, as long as you’re not too busy meeting people,” Pitt grunted.
I returned to my room like a grieving soul.
That night I sat alone at dinner time at the university; then I felt a slight slap in the back.
He was a second-year English student named James who introduced himself as a member of the OUCA.
"I know who you are," he said kindly.
"I'm afraid that's how it goes.
They mess with anyone who's suspected of being Tory.
It's very complicated for me, but they know your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it's going to be even worse for you.
Many newcomers tories appear to be laborers.”
Later, in a local pub, I cowardly tried to conceal.
I insisted that I did not agree with everything Mrs. Thatcher said.
That trick turned out to be useless.
A first-year student of Philosophy, Politics and Economics who, paradoxically, had studied at Eton, said: "You are the daughter of a fascist pig.
You are contaminated.”
Other students adopted that song.
I became the dirty pervert.
"How do the Tories have sex?" one asked.
"They beat each other, don't they?"
I felt the same way that homosexuals should have felt before the liberal law of the 1960s.
Could I ever live a normal life in Oxford?
Would I be forced to stay with people who would think like me only after dusk?
Should I become a laborer and suppress my natural tendencies?
The three years that awaited me presented themselves as a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only openly Tory professor was Norman Stone, Professor of Contemporary History destined for my college.
They hated him for being not only the Conservative Party, but also Thatcher’s foreign policy adviser and one of the people who wrote his speeches to him.
I was just out there.
He hated the place because he considered it provincial and insignificant and because of its adherence to the Marxist-determinist vision of history.
In 1997 he accepted a chair at the University of Bilkent in Ankara, Turkey.
“You’re not going to be happy here,” he told me.
I began to move daily from Oxford to my parents’ home in London, finding refuge in my more open-minded family and friends.
I told my father that he hated Oxford and why.
He didn't believe me.
When he studied there in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
"But if it's the best place in the world," he said sadly.
"They would never do that, not there among my dear dream needles.
Even my communist friends have always had an impeccable attitude.”
His painful eyes began to cloud.
"Give him another chance.
I'm sure they did it just to joke.
I'd break my heart if you left it."
Tired of so many trips to London, my emotional stamina was deteriorating.
A friend of mine, who also supported the Conservative Party, had succumbed to pressure and had renounced his creed.
The following week, during a seminar in which another professor of history had hinted, speaking quite seriously, that I was an “enemy of the people,” I decided to do the same.
Red of shame on the inside, I admitted that my parents had "brainwashed" me and called them "old fools."
The truce lasted shortly.
It was my father who put the last nail in the coffin of my college career at Oxford.
At that time my father wrote two weekly columns in Murdoch’s press.
My door was locked.
I was in a clutch of fear, and after five minutes, my persecutors gave up.
When they left, I packed up and took the first train to London.
I never came back.
Maybe you call me a weak tear.
But no 18-year-old should be subjected to such a level of intimidation and hostility in an educational institution.
What is even more tragic is that it was Oxford, which has not only formed 14 Conservative party prime ministers but, today, hides behind an undeserved reputation of equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to notoriety"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino: Master of Sewing", which opened this week in London, ABC speaks with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous clients of the Italian designer
Somerset House, former residence of Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
The designer has recognized him during the inauguration of "Valentino: Master of Sewing", a retrospective apotheosis that brings together more than 130 high-stitch dresses created by his "maison" over the past 50 years.
"I love this palace," he says with his unmistakable Italian accent.
This sample is the culmination of a story whose only protagonist is "il signore" Garavani, but which could not have been written without his distinguished clients.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the rare and distant world of nobility.
In the first room of this exhibition, open until March 3, private letters and photos abound with the signature of the most grenadier of the aristocracy, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, passing through Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margarita of England.
Valentino teaches these personal memories as trophies of his social rise: from a humble fashionista from the city of Voghera, in northern Italy, to an idol of the international "jet-set".
To be in love with royalty is not bad.
“At least they don’t turn off the clutches of their pits on your magnificent carpet like some beautiful pop celebrities do,” says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 60s and 70s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular host and entertains with generosity and elegance.
"We all loved to be invited to their chalet in Gstaad," explains the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen, intimate with forgotten beauties such as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred elegance to notoriety.
And yet, she's a star.
Valentine's Day, Valentine's Day
Argentinian model Valeria Mazza also does not forget the charisma of the fashionista.
Many years ago, after a parade in Piazza di Spagna, in Rome, we went to dinner at his apartment.
We were twenty people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
In every detail of the floor, the decoration, the food, the music, everything looked and felt his spirit.
“Each of the guests made us feel important and loved,” recalls the “top model,” who began working with him during the Paris Fashion Week in 1995.
“It never goes out of fashion because its designs are works of art,” he concludes.
Alcurnia Parade
Garavani’s life is not a story of obsessions, but of well-matched loves.
He loves people with good education and better titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries of Somerset House has been transformed into a glamorous walkway of sixty meters long that proposes a change of roles: the visitor takes the place of the models and must parade along the walkway to contemplate a dream "audience" that looks like masterpieces of Valentino, like the dress that Arbaiste chose for his Jackie Kennedy
In this audience of mannequins shine names such as Sibylle of Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosary of Bulgaria or Sofia of Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the Modist, 2006
Many of those clients say that the first Valentine is like the first love, "impossible to forget."
I remember it perfectly.
It was a trousers, a shirt, a "gillette" vest and a jacket from the fall-winter 1971-1972 collection.
“It was a gift he gave me,” says Naty Abascal, one of the designer’s muses.
“I prefer him over others for his femininity, for his great love for women, because it enhances our beauty,” added the former Duchess of Feria.
I really like the colors they use, they have great light and are "donors" to the face.
The proportions are perfect.
Princess and fashion designer Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg also cannot forget the first time she wore a Valentine.
When I was a teenager living in Italy, I dreamed of getting old and the opportunity to wear one of his nightgowns...
The time finally came in the late 1990s.
I bought my first Valentine's dress to wear at a party at my cousin's castle, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red suit, with skirt flaps, "corsage" draped and neckline word of honor.
"It was a dream come true," says Rodrigo d'Arenberg's widow.
“Valentino is indifferent to fashion, his obsession is the timeless,” explains this Italian aristocrat who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess D'Arenberg keeps her dresses of the fashionista party with "the utmost care ... because a dress is not only a dress, it is also the set of memories that it carries."
The "King" of Fashion
The grand finale of Somerset House's exhibition is Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding suit at her wedding to Paul of Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "ragazze" (as the modist calls his seamstresses) to make that ivory silk suit with pearl inlays, twelve different types of lace and a tail of four and a half meters.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the highest authority of the specialized press, that dress represents a milestone in the high fashion of the late 20th century, "the return of high society clients".
Obscure for years with the "savoir-être" of the elite, now Valentino is his best example.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest rank distinction in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, decorated with the Legion of Honor, Garavani accumulated as many honors as any of the husbands of his clients.
“I’ve always been drawn to its refinement, its calm, its pulcro and perfect look,” D’Arenberg acknowledges.
The last time I saw him was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Orsay Museum.
He was at the table of Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a great friend of mine.
"He was impeccable, time does not pass for him."
If a princess says so...
The world’s toughest trade: Kawah Ijen’s human mules
For four euros, the bearers of the Indonesian volcano play life and health loading 70 kilograms of sulfur through steep stone paths
There are people for whom their work is a hell and another who literally works in hell.
This is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who earn their living by extracting sulfur from the Kawah Ijen volcano, east of the Indonesian island of Java.
To do this, you have to go down every day to the bottom of your crater, where the sulfurous gas emanating from Earth’s bowels solidifies when it comes into contact with air.
After plucking large sulfur rocks, which in total weigh about 70 kilos, he carries them in two baskets of bamboo that he loads on his shoulders through steep stone paths.
They are only 250 meters up to the top of the volcano, which rises to 2,386 meters above sea level, but the exhausted carriers take more than 40 minutes to climb at the turtle’s pace, keeping their balance and gently measuring their steps so as not to slip and fall down the precipice.
They know that any transplant could cost them their lives, as happened to a French tourist who got away with the risks of the Kawah Ijen years ago.
Kawah Ijen miners earn 5 cents for every kilogram of sulfur they extract
Once up, they make their way among the tourists who photographed them as circus monkeys and, tiredly loading the heavy baskets, walk three kilometers to the scale that a mining company has placed a little lower, at 1,850 meters high.
This is PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that has been exploiting the volcano since 1960 and, never better to say, its workers, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 cents of euro) per kilogram of sulfur.
It is then sold for 10,000 rupees (83 cents) to the petrochemical industry, as this mineral is widespread in everyday life and is used to manufacture matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even to bleach sugar.
"As usual it is to load 70 kilos, we get about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) on each trip," explains Anto, who usually carries out three porters daily.
It takes three hours in each and it ends up grinding, but they allow you to collect 138.000 rupees (11.5 euros) at the end of the day.
Although it seems a misery for such inhumane effort, it is three times what I would win in the field.
“The miners’ newspaper is very high here, where the coffee collection is paid at 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) a day and the average monthly salary is two million rupees (167 euros),” clarifies the carrier, who previously worked as a bricklayer on the tourist island of Bali.
There, his salary was 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day and the tajo was not so hard, but Anto has returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a village close to the volcano, for a reason that, in Indonesia, is as strong as sulfur: "I married a young woman from Bali, where they are Hindus, and I have translated her to Islam."
Anto has asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs constantly and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases
At the age of 27, Anto has three playing skin in the Kawah Ijen, whose sulfur has already begun to pass bills despite covering his face with a mask and special glasses.
He has asthma, has difficulty breathing, coughs constantly and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases released by the volcano.
This is the price you have to pay to get your dream done.
“I will work two more years because I want to open a store or study Spanish or French,” he promises in a more than acceptable English.
Punished for life, this friendly and intelligent young man might be a hotel guide, waiter or receptionist, but instead he does the job of a mule.
Sharing a dirty wooden cabin with other carriers, he gets up every day at two in the morning because the sulfur does not cease to flow at night, when its characteristic yellow color turns blue and shines in the middle of darkness.
Challenging the shadows, Anto descends to the crater, glowing with a small flashlight attached to his helmet, which he himself has bought with his money.
About 400 carriers load the sulfur baskets on their shoulders from the bottom of the crater
Despite its small profits, the mining company has not mechanized sulfur extraction to save costs, nor does it supply any equipment to the carriers, who work on their own and at the same time the weight.
In fact, they do not even see part of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) per camera charge that, next to the entrance of 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros), the guards of this natural park charge tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
“This job is for the beasts and not for the people,” protests Madrusin, a 42-year-old gifted carrier who has been in the Kawah Ijen for three decades since he left school.
Capable of lifting up to 110 kilograms, he says he will endure working "everything he can" because he needs the money to educate his three children, between 18 and 10 years old.
I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano has been my whole life
Although sulfur burns the throat and slaps the eyes when the wind suddenly changes and traps the miners in the thick columns that come out of the volcano, they are so hard that no one complains of suffering serious diseases... beyond, of course, their usual respiratory problems, osteoarthritis, pains in the knees and knees have been hurt.
By swinging the basket over his back, Unainik can only load 50 kilos at 53 years old.
Every day, he and his companions pluck 15 tons of sulfur into the volcano, which three trucks move to the Tamansari warehouse, 18 kilometers away on a goat road between the weeds.
"I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano has been my whole life," Unainik proclaims, opening his mouth well, where he lacks several teeth.
Of his five children, the eldest, 30 years old, also works loading sulfur.
Time passes, but perpetual misery from generation to generation is one of the toughest jobs in the world: the one made by the human mules of the Kawah Ijen.
Singapore seeks babies to save economy
Singaporeans blame career, stress and the cost of property and education for not having children.
“The population of Singapore needs to grow.”
I am a patriotic husband, you are my patriotic wife, we fulfill our civic duty and create life!
It may seem unlikely that these verses are part of a mint pill ad, but despite that — or perhaps because of that — the video went viral on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
The phrases are part of a rap that uses local references like "We're going to put a bao (bacon) in the oven" to laugh at Singapore's birth rate.
The advertising company that made the video, BBH, harbors the hope that with the ad they will manage to draw attention to the problem in a fun way.
His creative director, Douglas Hamilton, says he wanted to use the power of music to make people fulfill “his national duty.”
This is something purely internet, so we had to make it fun and funny.
This is the biggest problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world to reproduce ourselves, so we felt this was a topic we had to address.
We knew that the government had tried many things, such as throwing perfumes with pheromones or organizing speed-dating evenings.
Many of those ideas may have been creative, but they didn’t necessarily work.
So we thought, why don’t we do as creatively as possible to solve this problem, that is to compose a rap?
1.2 Children
The one who does not take it so lightly is the government of Singapore.
It spends $1,300 a year on policies to encourage citizens to have more children.
A government package for marriages and parents grants up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But all this has had little effect.
Singapore is a rich and high-tech state city in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leaders and its strict social controls.
The birth rate of Singapore, according to its national population division, is currently at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was above 2 – known as the replacement rate – was in 1976.
So why do Singaporeans have no more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of Marriage and Family Policies at the National Population Division, says it is due to “better education” and “a wider range of career opportunities.”
“That has allowed people to have a wider range of choices in terms of life goals and priorities, beyond getting married and forming a family,” he explains.
These changes in social norms have contributed to rising singleness, and delaying marriage and births, resulting in a decline in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, a EU immigration policy aiming to dramatically increase immigration to cope with population decline has created resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites where xenophobia abounds barely disguised against many new immigrants, particularly Chinese, who are criticized for keeping wages low and not integrating.
The rise in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why last year Singapore’s ruling party experienced its worst election result since independence.
Since the elections, there has been an attempt to correct the problem, with higher quotas and fees for foreign workers.
Unexpected Consequences
While the drop in the birth rate has known effects on a nation’s economic growth, tax revenues, health care costs, and immigration policies, Singapore’s example is also having some unexpected consequences.
The government is trying not to build so many small houses.
For example, it has begun to affect the real estate sector.
The urban development authority has gone on to control the number of small apartments, known as "shoe boxes", that can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have surfaces of 46 square meters and have been very successful in sales.
However, there is concern that they may promote a single lifestyle and discourage developers who want to build large, family homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, CEO of real estate company EL Developers, says his “shoe boxes” sell much faster than larger units.
They are more popular, in the sense that units run out days, even weeks, faster than larger units.
This makes it much better for our cash flow.
However, he admits that the new rules give clearer guidance to developers, who were previously hampered if they wanted to offer too many small units in a project.
Too stressed
Singapore is a state city.
While these new rules may be a step towards increasing the national birth rate, talking to Singaporeans working in the financial district of the center would seem to have little effect.
“People are very stressed, houses are expensive and so is education, so many people are postponing it,” says a young executive.
Other people may have children.
“But for me it’s important to have my own money and time,” says another 20-year-old.
Men and women mention their careers, stress and the cost of property and education as the reasons that prevent them from having children.
So, no matter how much the government tries to push its citizens to have children, when it comes to making babies, Singaporeans are the ones who have the last word.
Private offline is private on line
Privacy .
According to the Dictionary of the Royal Spanish Academy, this is the quality of private life or "the area of private life that you have the right to protect from any interference".
What is private for a child under the age of 16?
How do you apply this definition in your daily life and on social media?
Do you understand the dangers you are exposed to by venting situations on the Internet that you would certainly not share offline?
The Journal interviewed five boys between the ages of ten and 15, frequent users of the network.
In four of the cases, they associated the term with “something very mine,” on a personal level, and “in the user’s key and name,” when they applied it to social media.
“My deepest secrets wouldn’t go up to a post,” says ten-year-old Jorge, when he tries to explain the meaning of privacy on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had accounts for two years.
“They’re very secretive, my mom may know them, but not everyone,” he says.
On FB I upload beautiful images or games.
I also have fun with my acquaintances.
“I wouldn’t share a photo that isn’t mine, or of someone who’s doing the ridiculous,” he says.
The child acknowledges that it is wrong to post obscene photographs, of naked people, of crimes or to write humiliating or violent comments.
Jorge says he meets his 35 friends on FB and his nine followers on Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
The mother is included, she has the key to one of the accounts.
I opened Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
“I don’t know if they answer me, I just upload them,” he adds.
“Social media is entertaining, I can talk to distant relatives or my friends quickly,” she says.
Do not hesitate to reply that you would never accept a request from an unknown person.
I wouldn't listen to anyone recommending a stranger.
The case of 14-year-old Joseph is different.
The teenager has open accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, in the latter admits not to know 20 of the people added to his list of friends.
“I’m not afraid, because we have something in common, music for example,” he says.
According to the boy, no one has been insinuated or asked for the address of his house or his phone number.
“If I was pressured or demanded, I would just take it out of my account,” he admits.
Joseph became a follower of Ask after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The boy is no stranger to the experiences of what is now known as cyberbullying.
A friend of a friend of mine was being blackmailed on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money from him.
“I never knew who he was,” he said.
The victim, according to Joseph, did not close the account.
"Just put him privacy."
Then explain a number of steps to set up the account securely.
Unlike Jorge, this guy would upload photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yes, I would, if I fell ill or if I got it.
“Although I know that’s cyberbullying,” he says.
Key Questions
Marielos Porras, an English teacher and a bachelor in Education and Learning, believes that in order to guide children and adolescents, it must be understood that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
“The Internet emerged as a means to search for information, but with the appearance of these sites, the rules of the game changed,” he says.
Porras notes that academic Marc Prensky, a master’s degree in Pedagogy from Yale University and author of the work Digital Natives and Immigrants, coined these terms to explain the phenomenon.
The digital natives are they, the children and young people who were born with technology.
“We are the digital immigrants we have to teach them when we’re still learning,” he says.
He comments that the topic is complex, "because we are asking them to have a definite criterion on what is appropriate or not to disseminate, publish or say at an age that maturity does not give for that."
“Also be selective when what matters most to them is being popular, having thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences,” he adds.
According to the specialist, the most effective way to teach what privacy is to children and adolescents is through questions that make them reflect.
“Telling them not to do it doesn’t help,” he adds.
Then Porras lists some options: There are things you wouldn’t tell a stranger, why do you do it on the Internet?
Or, would you like them to post a photo of you like the one you posted from a friend?
Do you know what others post about you?
When you tag party photos, did you ask permission from other people to tag them?
And one more thing, do they all need to know what you’re doing every moment?
Another point is to make them see that they must act online as they do offline.
They're the same rules.
“One outside the Internet acts with respect, morality and other principles, the same should be done on social media,” he says.
Surveillance
Stuardo Guardia, a university professor, primary school teacher and educational consultant, says that it is essential that parents read social media policies consciously.
By understanding each of the incisions they have solid foundations to talk to their children about the implications of opening an account on the Internet.
“For example, age and what is allowed to be shared or published,” he says.
According to the Guardian, it is key to remind children of the lesson of "do not talk to strangers".
UN Security Council ends UN Security Council summit without making the Lima Declaration public
The VI Presidential Summit of the South American Union of Nations (UNASUR) concluded today in Peru without the publication of the Lima Declaration, previously announced and theoretically signed by the seven assistant presidents.
Efe repeatedly tried to access the document signed at the VI Ordinary Meeting of Heads of State and Government of UNASUR, but sources from the Chancellery and the Presidency indicated at the beginning that they would deliver it after the closure, but then stated that at some point it will be published on the website of the Peruvian Government.
When consulted by the text, they noted that the contents had been exposed by Peruvian President Ollanta Humala during a brief statement to the press.
Journalists’ access to Summit information was restricted at all times.
During the day, only the audio-free video of the presidential assembly with the message "private session, audio restricted" was broadcast in the press room.
The little information that circulated among the reporters was delivered by the press spokesmen of some of the Unasur governments attending the meeting, though not the Peruvian.
The only document released during the day was the list of attending presidents, which caused the discomfort of hundreds of journalists from various national and international media asking for more data.
Subsequently, the Peruvian Presidency sent an email to the media with the "final declaration" of the summit, but this is Humala's pronouncement, not the official document that closed the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the Third Summit of South America-Arab Countries (ASPA), and on that occasion, despite being insistently requested by the press, the so-called Lima Declaration that they had previously announced was not disseminated either.
The official ASPA website confirms that the document was published on Tuesday.
In both international meetings, Peruvian authorities endeavoured to ensure that transmission systems were secured for all journalists but limited information to the maximum.
The summit also concluded with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to accept a decision of the Hague Court leading to a border dispute between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and of Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met during the regional meeting and ratified that they will respect the decision of the (CIJ), which begins on Monday in The Hague to listen to the allegations of both parties, in the process that Lima presented against Santiago.
"We will uphold and execute the judgment that defines the differences that we are bringing to this international court today," Humala said, along with his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile has been, is and will continue to be a country that respects international law, the peaceful settlement of disputes, treaties and international courts," Piñera added, greeting Humala with a handshake, alongside the flags of the two countries.
The two presidents’ confirmation that they will submit to the ICJ came after Colombia denounced this week the Bogotá Pact for which it had agreed to submit to the rulings of that international court, following a decision on maritime borders with Nicaragua that it considered gravely wrong.
The summit was held with the absences of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rousseff; Venezuela, Hugo Chávez; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, suspended from Unasur since 2011 following the dismissal of its former president Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
The host president, Ollanta Humala, was in charge of opening the discussions in the morning and closing the summit, shortly after noon in Lima.
The president read the final document in which he reported that 16 agreements were adopted and action lines were set for 31 projects between South American countries for a total of $17 billion in investments.
Among the agreements adopted he mentioned that the UNASUR countries will take "important steps towards the goal of a South American citizenship for which we are expanding the residency agreements".
Actions are being driven to improve "cooperation in the fight against civic insecurity and transnational organized crime, actions to make medicines more accessible, low-cost internet access in all corners of South America, and jointly and efficiently address the risks of natural disasters."
With a Europe in crisis, “economic consolidation (of Latin America) should not have a triumphalist matrix but should serve to expand our productive matrix and foresee a better future for our peoples,” Humala added.
“We have decided to privilege a group of 31 emblematic projects that will improve the connection of South America’s spaces, especially in rural and border areas ... uniting our countries and generating new economic circuits,” the Peruvian president said in a message read.
Among those projects, he mentioned that five correspond to Peru, and are located on the transverse axes of its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and two point to a greater connection with Ecuador, although he did not give further details.
The final document also mentioned the political situation in Paraguay.
“We hope that the electoral process in that country will serve for its reintegration into the Union of South American Nations,” from which he is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain an integrated region of prosperity and peace, and good relations between neighbours, was another of the issues underlined by the summit.
In this regard, the President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before starting his participation in the regional meeting that he expected to meet with his Nicaraguan counterpart, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico to treat in a respectful way the maritime dispute after a ICJ ruling, questioned by Bogotá.
"Tomorrow (Saturday) he may have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega," Santos said.
"We are going to review all these paths, they are not exclusive, even the treaty with Nicaragua will require a conversation with Nicaragua," he said.
"With President Ortega, I hope to be able to tell you that we will handle this in the most civilized and respectful way possible," Santos added.
Santos and Ortega would meet on Saturday in Mexico where they plan to attend the takeover of the new president of that country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
Also, as part of the summit, the bloc’s defence ministers met in advance to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus on defence in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay join UNASUR, although the latter country is suspended.
Peru holds the pro-tempore presidency of the regional bloc.
"South America must learn from Europe to integrate a citizenship": Rafael Correa
Ecuador's President Rafael Correa said today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal in which "South America, in this case, must learn from Europe".
Correa, who participated in the sixth presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), held in Lima, told state TV Peru that Europeans “killed themselves in World War II” and in other conflicts, “but now they are practically a homeland.”
He defended, in this sense, the project of establishing South American citizenship that is encouraged by UNASUR member countries.
“We must achieve the free movement of citizens and workers by any South American country, as it already happens with the members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary sectors that want to bring us back to the past,” he warned.
The Ecuadorian president was also in favour of the re-establishment of the Organization of American States (OAS) under the premise of reducing the influence of the Anglo-Saxon states and taking into account those who have signed the San José pact on human rights.
Those who give chairs never commit to anything and, on the other hand, we South Americans sign everything.
“It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington under U.S. funding,” he said in reference to Ecuador’s political asylum granted to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa said he did not regret that decision because it did not betray his principles, but respected his “deep democratic and human rights values.”
He added that, at the time, “there were grounded suspicions that Assange was extradited to a third country and his process was not respected.”
He also criticized the Swedish justice for requiring it to be interrogated in its territory for an alleged sexual offence when "Swedish legislation itself allows it to be done by videoconference, which could be done from the Ecuadorian embassy in London".
Correa said there was a risk of Assange’s physical and mental health deteriorating.
"I haven't spoken to him since he's in our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he had a small lung problem, nothing serious," he said.
What there is is the danger of deteriorating your physical and mental health by being locked in a small space without being able to do outdoor exercises.
“That complicates anyone’s health,” he added.
Correa noted that the solution to Assange’s asylum granted since June at the Ecuadorian embassy in London, through the granting of a rescue pipeline that allows him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and European legal authorities and stressed that there have been talks with London in search of a solution to the WikiLeaks founder’s lockdown.
We do not negotiate with human rights, we do not use that word in this case, but there have been permanent conversations.
“The solution to this problem is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European legal authorities because Assange’s lawyer, Baltazar Garzón, is doing a series of procedures in different European instances,” he said.
And he said, “If Britain gives tomorrow the bailout, this is over.”
And if Sweden, as perfectly permitted by its legislation and as it has done in other cases, interrogates Mr Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy in London or interrogates him via Skype tomorrow, this problem will end.
Correa took the opportunity to reaffirm himself as a defender of press freedom and nuanced that what he does not tolerate is " mediocrity, bad faith and lies, which distort freedom of expression."
“The greatest enemies of press freedom are not the evil and perverse politicians but the bad journalists based on profit, blackmail and extortion,” he said.
In that regard, he welcomed that these journalists are no longer “neither the bankers nor the hegemonic and bourgeois countries that dominate Ecuador”, and said that if re-elected, “it will deepen the revolution to continue the right path and direction”.
Correa also supported the decision to keep the veto on Paraguay in Unasur at least until its next elections, arguing that the body "must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and legality-clad coup" because it actually "destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy".
The Ecuadorian president also considered "perfectly pertinent" the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to now negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime boundaries between the two countries following the ruling of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which benefited Nicaraguan maritime sovereignty.
For the time being, this ruling is not upheld.
It is a problem between a South American country and a Central American country.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the will to walk together.
They must be processed extensively in order to overcome them and move forward.
He also trusted in a good conclusion of the maritime boundary dispute that they maintain in the same court of Peru and Chile and felt that "it is right for Latin America to seek international instances if the two countries commit to accept judgment no matter how hard it is".
Referring to the eventuality that he will present himself as a candidate in the upcoming presidential election in Ecuador to seek a third consecutive term, he said he sees that possibility "with a lot of optimism and joy, although sometimes it is quite hard".
Correa assured that if he loses the February 2013 elections he will retire from public life.
Personally, I have never been interested in power, but in situations as unfair as Ecuador’s, that socio-economic poverty can only be corrected from political power.
“My political movement believed that I was the one who guaranteed that likely victory, because we have to accept that responsibility,” he said.
If I won, it would be my last term in the presidency and from there we left public life.
If we lose the same.
"It's a decision," he said.
Correa also referred to the new health treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
I just spoke with Venezuelan Vice President Nicolás Maduro and he tells me that he traveled to a treatment that was already planned, routinely, that was expected to pass the campaign to return to Cuba.
"It does not mean a relapse in the state of health of President Chávez," he said.
The Ecuadorian Head of State participated today in Lima at the VI Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), which concluded with calls for greater regional integration to sustain progress, equality and security.
AIDS deaths today are the cause of late detection
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was confirmed the test result: AIDS positive.
“It was like I dropped a bomb,” he says, recalling the moment of the announcement, that the doctor was trying to “make it softer,” with no apparent success.
The boy hid it from his family.
He decided to take care only of his illness and began to inform himself about it; with such an effort that he already celebrated his 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients in the HIV Unit of the Guadalajara Civil Hospital (HCG), to which he arrived in 1994 after several battles.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, something hard to imagine in the early 90s, when there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigma.
Then even the director of an IMSS clinic avoided saying goodbye to him “because he brought a cut.”
Having AIDS is synonymous with death.
Now it is possible to survive this syndrome and do it with quality of life.
However, ignorant of their disease, many people still arrive when the virus has already caused damage, "depleted" their immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the onset of AIDS in the world, at least of the first reported cases, "the great achievement means at this time that the survival of a patient who starts treatment in a timely manner and the survival of the general population, is exactly the same," said the head of the HIV Unit of the HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, after mentioning that this information was endorsed in a scientific year.
Infectologist and expert on HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanueva commented that since 2008, scientists had concluded that AIDS was not a fatal sentence, but the years of survival and the quality of life depend on the degree of affect to the immune system presented by patients at the beginning of the diagnosis, with better expectations for those who are not 50 years old, and those who are not using drugs up to 30 years old.
In simple words, the above means that those who are diagnosed with HIV positive at 25 years of age, under these terms, “as long as they stay in control, they will be able to live without problems until 75 years of age,” the interviewee explained.
To scale this advance, it should be remembered that the life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years on average.
While mortality has declined significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS fell from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNAIDS annual report), it is also true that since the onset of AIDS, 60 percent of patients in the national database have died.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011, and there are 187 deaths as of May this year; however, universal access to antiretroviral drugs is ensured since 2005.
- Why are there still deaths?
It seems to me that the problem is not access to treatment.
That's how I see it, that's what happened to us in our hospital.
At least in the last 12 years we have not had a shortage of medication the problem is that patients arrive very advanced because they do not know their state of infection, i.e., in late stages of the disease.
“Nine out of ten patients arrive when they already have some opportunistic infection what needs to be done to have a greater impact on global mortality, is to make earlier diagnoses and, therefore, have to offer mass screening tests, to all people who require it.”
In his proposal coincide specialists and officials of the State Council for AIDS Prevention in Jalisco (Coesida), also the patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who went to be tested at a particular laboratory, only motivated because he had done it a friend and, despite his young age, was already in the stage of AIDS and even suffered the complications of Kaposi's cancer.
Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some people think they're going to die and they don't want to know anything.
“If I’m going to die already, I’d better blow myself up three times a week,” they say no in my case.
The change was to improve, I eat well, I exercise, I take the medications.
To date, his parents only know that he suffered from cancer.
I live a normal life, like everyone else.
“I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I have an active but responsible sex life, I take care of myself and the other person,” said Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimacy with Millenio Jalisco to motivate with his testimony those who today, as part of World AIDS Day, are afraid.
Let them take the test, if they were at risk, that the sooner they know if they are HIV positive, the better and if they already have the diagnosis, that they learn that they can live like anyone, being responsible.
That, his message, summarizes the motto of the battle against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
Great are the gaps between health programs and the common citizen, said Ricardo Salazar, a Tapacio journalist who has assumed the cause around HIV.
And the biggest one is in prevention.
In places dedicated to this task "the distribution of condoms has effectively increased, before they gave us one or two, now they give us packages of one to a hundred, and that is very good but it turns out that there are those today, still, do not have access to a condom," he said.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are adolescents.
"Why do you want them?" is a common question, with sorcery and value judgments from social workers, school counselors, pharmacy employees and health personnel, to which adolescents do not want to be exposed, the communicator said.
He proposed reorienting this ineffective distribution; that the condoms should not be just behind the counters and that those hundred should be found in public toilet dispatchers of the sites frequented by young people.
It’s not about motivating promiscuity.
Nor is it a matter of paying them the shelves and the motel, as Governor Emilio González replied, when asked if there would be distribution of condoms in his Administration.
"That's not sexuality, it's best to bring condoms closer to those who already practice sexual activity," he said.
Keys In Jalisco
There are 13,435 cumulative cases (12,158 of AIDS and 1,317 of HIV).
The state ranks 4th nationally in new and cumulative cases of AIDS and 13th in HIV.
92% of the contagion corresponds to the sexual route, 6% to the blood route and 2% to the perinatal route.
It is estimated that 50,000 people may be living with HIV since by one recorded case there are 4 to 5 people who do not know.
Ratified by a U.S. court of appeals a judgment that ignores the restructuring of the Vitro Group’s debt achieved through a merchandise tender in Mexico, the scenario sets a disastrous precedent for any domestic company with branches in the neighboring country that has solvency problems.
It would be said, therefore, that the procedures in support of the survival of the signatures allowed by Mexican laws are not valid in the country of bars and stars, contrary to international conventions.
On the practical ground, the backlash to the judgment issued on June 15 by Judge Harlin Hale of the Bankruptcy Court for the Northern Texas District leaves Mexican firms defenseless against the possibility of seizure of their properties elsewhere on the Bravo.
However, the resolution opens the door to Mexico’s leading glass manufacturer to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, alleging three inconsistencies.
At the outset, while the judge of the case points out that creditors must be governed by the U.S. Bankruptcy Act, the Fifth Circuit Appeals Court, based in New Orleans, says the main proceeding is the trade contest conducted in Mexico.
The first point would imply ignoring international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of companies with a transnational profile.
In fact, the United Nations Model Law for the Uniformity of International Commercial Law was created for that purpose, with the American Law Institute as an arbitrator.
Secondly, the judgment states that without the vote, inter-companies, recognized in the critical mass of the commercial competition the debts they had with their parent Vitro subsidiaries, would not have achieved the required majority to approve the restructuring.
However, the possibility is recognized by Mexican laws.
In fact, the Vitro has not been the first case in which the scheme is accepted.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose inter-company debts were approved by the Federal Institute of Commercial Competitions.
The truth, moreover, is that by subtracting the votes of the subsidiaries, anyway the creditors of Vitro who fought against it in the United States Courts, i.e. the "buitre" funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot International and Liverpool Limited, will not have achieved a majority.
The vote would have been 45 percent against 37.
This is omitted by the Court of Appeal.
From another angle, he blames Vitro for the difficult situation he faced starting in 2008 in the wake of the serious economic crisis that faced the United States, hitting the country.
Soon, the signature of the family González Sada will file an appeal of reconsideration before the Court of Appeals itself so that the vote reaches the full of this, i.e. the five magistrates, since only three voted.
If this does not prosper, the appeal of Cerciorare will be appealed, which requires the review of the process by a higher court, in this case the Supreme Court of Justice of the United States.
The seriousness of the case is that the court ignored a document sent by the government of Mexico under the figure of amicus curiae ("friend of the Court"), detailing the procedure followed by Vitro under the Mercantile Competitions Act, noting that the latter was dethroned with attachment to the agreements signed by both countries to match the ban.
Moreover, it is noted that the country has adhered to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the rules set for cross-border insolvency cases, which guarantee equity for debtors and creditors.
Two-band carambola: they hit Vitro and hit the country.
Balance General
For several months, the complaints put on the table by Mexicana de Aviación’s unions against the company’s former owner, Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, who is accused of fraudulent administration, have already found the bottleneck.
The court headed by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau has just filed a criminal lawsuit against the National Banking and Securities Commission accused of obstruction of justice.
According to this, the supervisory authority has systematically refused to report to the Attorney General of the Republic on an operation carried out by the entrepreneur to extract from the trust F/589 of Bank IXE, on behalf of Mexicana de Aviación, 198 million pesos.
The funds would have been channelled to the purchase of shares of the Professional Hotel Administrator.
As you know, Azcárraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the hotel chain Posadas.
Searching for the Dragon Mart
Meeting over the weekend at a forum at the University of the Caribbean, a group of national and foreign environmentalists, academics, entrepreneurs and members of civil society in general approved the creation of a broad front to oppose the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun.
We are talking, as you know, about a colossal sales and distribution center facing Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean of products from the wall country, with a limestone housing area for employees of 150 companies.
Previously the Canacintra had managed to unify the governors of the southeast area to oppose the monumental thing that razed with part of protected areas and raises the mother of all secrets against the industry.
Acta is dead.
A demand from the Senate to explain under what terms and circumstances the Mexican ambassador to Japan signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, known in English as ACTA, has already passed to the file, according to the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property.
As you know, the action was taken despite the fact that the Senate itself had disqualified the possibility by considering it an attack on freedom of expression on social media.
Long-term Homex
In order to pay off long-term debts without affecting short-term debts, home developer Homex is putting on the market Stock Certificates for 500 million pesos.
The issue is the first of four identical ones that offer to pay interest every 28 days.
Competitiveness is born
Integrated by the companies NYCE, e-Quality and Kernet, leaders in information technology, has just been born a consortium with social reason Competival, whose aim will be the service market of the software clusters of Central and South America.
Investments in the area exceed $1.5 trillion.
Hector "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball has been my life"
Hector "Hetin" Reyes was more than 60 years attached to the sport of table tennis and, thanks to him, traveled the whole world.
Few people in Puerto Rico have a mental collection of the history of local basketball as wide as Hector "Hetin" Reyes has.
And it is that before a stroke confined him to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in the sport for more than 60 years, he was as a player of minor categories, player of the National Higher Basketball, empowered and leader at the BSN with the Bayamon Cowboys or president of the Basketball Federation.
“I put a lot of hats on basketball throughout my life, including several at the same time, like when I was president of the BSN, general manager of the National Team and federation president during the 1990s,” Reyes recalled during a First Hour visit to his home in Bayamon, where he resides with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
“Basketball has been my life.”
Kings do not exaggerate in making that assertion.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photos and memorabilia that denote his wide trajectory, testify to this.
Bayamon in the heart
Of all, the ones that he treasures with the greatest emotion are those that recall his passing through the Cowboys from the mid-50s as a player until 1982, when he turned 15 years serving as co-author or co-author of the franchise.
"These were my best years, the ones I enjoyed most because I had the opportunity to be a part of eight Cowboys championships since 1967, whether as a manager, co-manager or manager.
They were many years of satisfaction, including the five championships raced from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye to one in 1981, Jerome Mincy’s debut year on BSN.
Henceforth he took over "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a great administrator," Reyes said.
I remember Gene Bartow, who had directed here and was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), told me, "I have a very strong player, 6"7" tall.
Do you want it?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico has ever had.
Bartow then recommended sniper Raymond Gausse, who was native and was one of our best shooters.
I remember he said that if Mincy had given Bayamon a championship, Gausse would help bring in another.
The Cowboys Championship with Gausse enjoyed it, but already at a distance, as by 1988 it was already listed as more federative.
For that time he preferred to enjoy his executioners and those of Mincy in the National Team.
I remember when we first won the United States during the 1989 Pre-Olympics in Mexico.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, where we reached fourth place and it must have been bronze if it wasn’t for that Canadian referee who made us repeat the final playoff for the second time, Reyes said.
Is that 1990 World Cup group the best national team you've ever seen?
He is among the best, just like the one who won the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was the Pan Americans in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and gave a peel to the U.S. team, which was quite similar to the one that won us the bronze in the World Cup.
That team not only repeated Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz), but also had (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter young, the León brothers (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who had not been able to be in the 90th round due to a lack of time.
A team that might not be the best in terms of staff, but gave us a gold medal and a great joy was that of the 1995 Pre-Olympics in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players such as "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and a junior Rolando Hourruitiner replacing the players suspended by the Panamericano de Mar del Plata mess, we won gold against all odds.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
Without a doubt, that was Piculín Ortiz.
Their numbers in international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated at that level like Piculin did.
And that’s not to mention his career in the different leagues he played.
Who was the best Borician leader?
That's very difficult.
We have had a very good layer that includes Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
I love the work of Leo Arill.
What do you consider your greatest achievement in the federation?
Having been part of the most glorious era of the National Team between 1988 and 1995 and that in the early 1990s the BSN had up to 17 teams in one season.
What's left for you to do?
There were things I would have liked to implement, such as the regionalization of smaller categories.
For example, the Ponce boys only played in their area and only faced teams from other corners of the Island in the national playoffs.
Right now, children travel and play too much unnecessarily.
At least I see the fruit of compulsory certifications and course for executives, board officers and referees.
I'm glad to hear that.
What are you doing now?
All I do is listen to music, watch music videos of my time on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and occasionally go to basketball games.
And of course, enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who has always been with me.
Actor Larry Hagman dies
Larry Hagman, born on September 21, 1931, in Forth Worth, Texas, became world famous for his central role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R.", in the television series "Dallas", in which he embodied an unscrupulous, malicious and manipulative businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as predator oil tycoon J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, has died.
I was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in a new season of "Dallas," died Friday afternoon from cancer complications, according to a family statement provided to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., the producer of "Dallas."
“Larry was back in his beloved hometown of Dallas, again representing the iconic role he liked most,” the family said.
Larry’s family and closest friends were with him in Dallas for Thanksgiving holiday.
Linda Gray, who played his wife in the original series and sequel, was with Hagman when she died in a Dallas hospital, her publicist Jeffrey Lane said.
It brought joy to everyone I knew.
He was creative, generous, funny, funny, loving and talented, and I will miss him so much.
"He was an original person and lived life to the fullest," Gray said in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis in 1992 and admitted that he had drunk a lot for years.
In 1995, he was found to have a malignant tumor in his liver and underwent a transplant.
Years before "Dallas", Hagman became famous on television as a decent guy in the light comedy "I Dream of Jeannie", broadcast by NBC from 1965 to 1970.
In it he played Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life is altered when he finds an attractive genius, played by Barbara Eden, and takes her to live with him at his home.
He also starred in two short-lived comedies, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971–72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His film work included critically acclaimed roles in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was his masterful interpretation of the charmingly detestable J.R. that led Hagman to his ultimate stardom.
The CBS drama series about the Ewing clan and other characters in its orbit aired from April 1978 to May 1991.
The promotional phrase “Who shot J.R.?”, designed to generate expectation around an emotion-filled episode in which Hagman’s character is almost killed, generated international speculation and millions of risky dollars in bookmakers.
It also helped give the series a record audience at the time.
When the answer was revealed in a November 1980 chapter, an average of 41 million viewers tuned it and made "Dallas" the second most watched entertainment program in history, behind the end of "MASH" in 1983, which had 50 million viewers.
It was J.R.'s sister-in-law, Kristin (played by Mary Crosby) who shot him.
J.R. conceived her and then threatened to spot her as a prostitute unless she left town, but others also had reason to attack him.
Hagman portrayed Ewing as an insatiable corrupt with a charismatic smile: a cheating businessman and an unfaithful husband who tried to get his alcoholic wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), to be interned.
“I know what I want on J.R.’s gravestone,” Hagman said in 1988.
I should say, "Here lies the honest citizen J.R. Ewing."
This is the only deal he lost.
Victoria Principal, co-star of the original series, on Friday remembered Hagman as someone "huge, inside and outside the screen."
It is unforgettable, and irreplaceable, for millions of admirers in the world, and in the hearts of each of us, that we were lucky enough to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were broadcast a few months ago with great success for the TNT channel.
The recording of five of the episodes for the second season had already been completed and a sixth was in the process, the channel reported.
There was immediately no statement from Warner or TNT about how the series would handle Hagman’s loss.
Born in Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who starred in such classics as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still a teenager when he had it in 1931 during his marriage to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He tried his luck on the New York theater stages in the early 1950s, and then served in the Air Force from 1952 to 1956 in England.
While there he met the young Swedish designer Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for a long time in the Californian city of Malibu, where many celebrities reside.
In 2001 he titled his memoirs "Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life".
"I didn't put anything there that I thought was going to hurt someone or affect them in any way," he told Associated Press at the time.
After the liver transplant, he became an organ donor promoter and volunteered in a hospital to assist fearful patients.
“I advise them, I give them courage, I meet with them when they come for their surgeries, and then,” he said in 1996.
I try to offer some comfort, such as “don’t be afraid, it will be a little uncomfortable for a short time, but you’ll be fine.”
He was also an anti-smoking activist and participated in several campaigns.
Start a course that explores the "End of the World"
Every week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
This semester, when the professor of religion Stuart Charmé decided to teach a course on the end of the world, he knew that he had an irresistible hook: The end of the "long countdown" of the Mayan Calendar, on December 21, to which many people have clung as proof that the end of the world is coming.
But Charmé had no idea what to expect in the next couple of months: the cataclysmic hurricane Sandy, a fiscal precipice that some have called “debt-magedon” and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where end-time Christian theorists believe the Apocalypse will begin.
"I didn't realize this was going to be the most apocalyptic semester ever," Charmé told students at Rutgers-Camden University in New Jersey this week.
If one analyzes what has been happening in the world today as if we were 30 days and counting, this has been a really good period.
And remember that evil is good for those of apocalyptic mindset.
And he’s not the only professor offering courses on the “end of the world” this semester, in theory the latest in history.
At Temple, Assistant Professor Barry Vacker is teaching the course "Media, Culture and the End of the World".
Every week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
“We analyzed why these ideas proliferate over time,” he said, and the way they offer hypothetical scenarios that guide certain human behavior.
If nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could break out.
This month the students analyzed movies with apocalyptic themes and explored how they compare to real-life examples.
“I have tried to inform students about what is possible, probable, credible and impossible,” Vacker said.
At Pennsylvania State University’s main campus, Latin American history professor Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an adjunct professor of art history and anthropology, have teamed up to teach a course, titled only “The End of the World.”
“We don’t add ‘2012’ to always have the option of teaching the course again, in case the world doesn’t end,” Restall said.
Despite the “imminent ruin,” students must study, generate projects, and take final exams.
At Penn State, the final exam will be taken on the eve of the Apocalypse, leaving students no choice but to work “until the same night the world is supposed to end,” Restall said.
The courses were quite popular.
"It saturated in two hours," Restall said of his course for high-average students, which was filled with 35 students.
We received email messages for weeks and weeks before the start of the semester, from people asking if there was still room.
Students, for their part, assure that the course is one of the most interesting.
“I find it fascinating to see what people do to comfort themselves,” said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student of the career in Religion and Sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey, at Rutgers-Camden.
And it is that the apocalyptic mentality, secular or religious, is only a matter of consolation or the absence of it.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old psychology and nursing student, said he had seen all the apocalyptic movies.
“I had never heard of a class that could teach that,” he said.
I'm enjoying it.
But no student interviewed — let alone a professor — said they believed the December 21 expiration date.
“Our first project dealt with Maya prophecy and in a way we discredited it,” said Julie Zeglen, a 21-year-old senior student at Temple and West Chester.
The Mayans never predicted the end of the world; it’s just a key point in the calendar, Restall said.
But he noted that there is an apocalyptic anxiety in Western culture, dating back several centuries, in which people react to the changes around them by predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has caused a boom of these speculations.
“Otherwise, people don’t think about this,” he said.
Mostly in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at La Salle University who teaches courses in the Philippines this year, quickly answered the question of whether he knew about any course about the “end of the world” there.
“The Philippines does not participate in the end of the world,” he wrote, implying an exception from a superior authority.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restall noted that over the years there has been talk of many days of the final judgment, and said that if nothing happens on December 21st, “people will start immediately thinking about the next date” or philosophizing that December 21st is the beginning of a seven-year period after which the world will end.
Students and teachers are taking the date lightly.
Several said they plan to go to "end of the world" parties.
“Maybe I’ll call some friends and we’ll laugh together,” said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
